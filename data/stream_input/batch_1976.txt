1451695195|4.0|Very informative and the author was honest and forthcoming. there wasn't a lot of new information if you've read other life after death accounts, but it did serve to confirm what others have said. What Dr. Alexander brings to the discussion is his scientific training and understanding of the physiology of the brain.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Watched this movie with my 6 year old son. We have all the others on DVD and this one fits perfect into the set. Our only complaint is that it seemed short. Great movie for the whole family =)
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Girlfriend said it was fine. That's it. Not much comedy or singing. I could careless for it. Happy I didn't see it in theaters.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I appreciate the research that went into this story plus the &#34;peek&#34; into Oswald's life and personality! I like the way Jake has been discovering more of his own inner self and the joy he finds living and making a new life for himself in a simpler world.  Loved it!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Amazing voice, amazing cd, great Christmas songs. After two play throughs the cd we got sick of the same songs but great none the less.  Wish I could sing like him.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Harry Bosch stories entertain without all the explicit sex and gratuitous violence found in so many of today's &#34;entertainment&#34;<br />venues.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|I love all of the movies, but we opened this and found the cas was ripped apart with a huge made in Mexico sticker on it. Bad quaility but we kept it because the movies play nicely. Bad case construction though.
B000HIVIOW|4.0|I gave this to my three-year-old grandson and we watched it together just after Christmas dinner. He was mesmerized, and it was even better than I recall from years ago when we watched it with our kids. A classic that should be a regular video for the holidays.<br /><br />Paul Grace<br />Shoreline, WA
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I think this is the best Die Hard, don't get me wrong I like them all this one is just better out of the 4 movies so far. Can<br />t wait to see new one coming out this year.
0307596885|4.0|Ms. Munro continues with her beautiful portraits of her fellow Canadians struggling with life's challenges. Her images of rural Canada are compelling. I'd read several of them in The New Yorker but found second readings even better.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|At the beginning sometime when I start Fruit Ninja, I was required to log into my Amazon account in order to play the game, later I was able to play the game fine but unable to access Leaderboard or Game Circle. I kept getting the message \\"Please sign in with your Amazon account.\\" but there is no way to sign in Amazon account. I try sign in my Amazon account from Amazon app. I still get the same message showing I need to sign in Amazon account.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I bought this only because i needed a replacement for my lost Kindle cable. Seems very pricy for just a cable.
B00164KYV4|5.0|He's just Not That Into You  is still very funny to watch and I watch it went I need a laugh. I was cheeper to buy than Wal-Mart.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Put two in the Liberty gun safe.  Perfect!  Motion sensors work great.  Good quality.  Fast ship for nominal cost.<br />Will purchase additional soon for other locations in the home.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|Got what I whated and very happy with the product. Now I have all of my old cassette musice on my MP3 player.
B003Y5H59C|5.0|You don't have to be into alternative sexual lifestyles (was that PC enough?) to enjoy this movie but it would probablly help. As I recall there is no nudity to speak of, and very little traditional sexual interaction. A Dominant/submissive love story plays out beautifully with a few laughs along the way. I love this movie. I really should read some reviews and see what people with no exposure to the life think of it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Got what I whated and very happy with the product. So much better to watch them back to back and no interruptions
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Life, death, and laughs, perhaps a bit out of order, but with a great sound track to boot. I have loved this movie for years. Aside from being a good story it is a great way to get a litte perspective when needed.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|A classic that every kid loves to watch. There are a few choice words for little ones but overall the movie is great to turn on and let the kids watch.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Honest lyrics and a musical style which keeps one jumping from one foot to the next in all the right ways...these guys are a blessing and this album is worth its weight in platinum.  God bless Twenty One Pilots!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great end to a wonderful series! Very exciting- couldn't put it down.  Recommend the whole series! Excellent!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Complicated enough to hold your interest. These are usually monotonous but this is kind oh hard<br />.lots if interesting content
B000B589JI|5.0|Everything looks and works as well as advertised, It is easy to use. It is very handy to carry on a key chain.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great read. This was the first  book I read on my new Paperwhite and I couldn't put it down.
0765325950|1.0|Seriously, I am not adding another gigantic hardcover WoT book to my shelf and after this many years and the series ebbing and flowing I'm not that desperate to find out how it ends.  If/when the kindle version comes out I'll read it.  Tor really, really shot themselves in the foot on this one.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a wonderful app to use it is easy and fun :-) I totally recommend it for all ages!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Has everthing I need in it very well done easy to use, just a wipe of my finger and I have all the weather I need
B008M87GJK|3.0|I am very glad to have access to BBC news on my Kindle.  For me, the BBC news is a 'go to' source for a broader perspective on headlines.
B000002HO3|5.0|best cd money can buy.what a voice on this guy. wish he was still doing concerts.I&#34;ll be looking for more.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|would recommend this for everyone.  It is a great gift for all ages.  Very easy listening.  I see why he won American Idol
B007FEFLTO|5.0|5 Stars: Because it's well written and thoroughly researched. Every chapter keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's very difficult to put it down!  It's amazing how Ken Follett integrates each family's personal stories into the actual historical events. Highly recommended for history buffs & for those who want to learn more about our global crisis'  from many differing perspectives.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This is a hilarious book. Tina Fey has a great back-story and a special way of relaying her life in a way that is completely entertaining.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was riveted to my seat for ever single second of every single episode or every single season!!!  The best!!
B004SRNH10|5.0|Thank you Amazon. Went to other places to download this app for nextbook with no success. Now I can now download my favorite games!!!!!
B005LAII8K|5.0|Looper is a cleverly written and wildly entertaining sci-fi film that proves that there are still original ideas left in Hollywood. Rian Johnson has created a stylized and very detailed world within a thought-provoking film that is sure to stick with the audience after the credits role.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who continues to prove that he is one of the industry's most valuable new actors, is absolutely great as Joe, a \\"Looper\\" who eliminates targets sent to him from 30 years in the future. Problems arise, however, when Joe's older self, played by Bruce Willis, is sent into the past for execution, only to escape and attempt to change the future he's come from. The first half of the movie sets this climax up very well, while the second introduces us to Cid, played by newcomer Pierece Gagnon, as well as his mother Sara played by the always great Emily Blunt. I have to give a lot of credit to Gagnon, who gives a very memorable performance and piqued my interest in any future roles he lands.<br /><br />Now, be warned that since there is time travel involved, the movie does contain potential plot holes if you dwell on events and their consequences too much. However, Johnson has created such a fantastic vision of the future, as well as terrific character interaction between JGL and Willis, that the holes don't appear unless well after the initial viewing. Because I was more enthralled with where the story was going and the brilliant storytelling from Johnson, I'm more than willing to overlook any inconsistencies I noticed.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The quality of the picture is not very clear. The game is standard but the picture could be absolutely be better.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Best purchase I've made in a long time. All their stuff is now in heavy rotation. Southern Rock and country. Can't wait to see them live!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|This book isn't what everyone raved about,its rather lite weight and you have to be into S&M.I'm not into being whipped I'm afraid, but I can see that some woman who have not had much experience in sexual matters<br /> would find it exciting.I guess I 've had far too exciting experiences that this is boring and repetitive.
B000HL09SA|5.0|Watched as a family and it was a GREAT movie.  Great story of how a little dog helps a young boy emerge from being a shy introvert to a well rounded young man.<br /><br />Spoiler alert / Note to parents: The boy and the dog age over time and the director very tastefully captures the inevitable passing of the elderly dog.  Again, very tastefully done, not a graphic at all, narrator announces that one day many years later the dog passes.  My 10 year old is particularly sensitive to animals and was able to handle this plot detail very easily as the film is so tastefully done.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A real page turner-loved the way it was written.  Couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend this book.  Wish it had continued on a bit longer.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This is one of the most covered subjects in regards to a CEO and tech mogul, but Isaacson does a great job of capturing the man behind it all. I would highly recommend this to see how a guy created, lost and reinvented himself, a company and an industry in a very short amount of time!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fast paced read with grisham`s gift of  remarkable description and natural dialog make way for an anxious wait for the movie's release?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great as a chalenge. you have to get enough points to unlock new games and stuff for fun
B00AYB1GAS|5.0|We really loved this movie.  Old folks and young together really enjoyed the visual feast and the space music. Relaxing, sad, funny, and inspiring by turns.
B0086700CM|5.0|my teacher has this game on her ipad and she lets us play on it sometimes.<br />ive been waiting forever to get this game&iexcl;!!!!&iexcl;
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The movie does a good job of exploring issues brought up by advancing age. It is humorous and to the point and pokes a lot of fun at how society feels seniors should behave. I hope the quality of the acting brings in a few younger people and opens a few eyes.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A fun romp through culture shock.  For us, a reminder of places we have been . . . and a few we would like to visit (well before retirement).
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I did get some laughs from this flic but for me it was a little too predictable and really amounted to a one line joke told over and  over again. While I did find some of the situations humorous I found the gratuitous bad language boring not funny.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I've seen some reviews that complain about the flow of this book, and the book being somewhat convoluted.  All the books in this series flow from place to place and character to character.  The author sets the table with the character flow for future place settings and major events.  I love Martin's style of writing; it is easy to ready but not dumbed down and keeps your interest, leaving you wanting more.  I just want to read the next book &#34;The Winds of Winter&#34;.  I can't wait, just wish it was coming out sooner.  This is a big complex world Martin has created with lots of intrigue and character depth.  If this is not the style you like to read, move on and read something else.  This is fantasy at it's best.
B0098460O4|4.0|I loved it but I came here to write a review to blast the mixing.  The first track, \\"The Prayer\\", was butchered by the mixing team.  Why would anyone think it was OK to drown out the two people that make this album.  Why drown out Charlotte in one of the best parts of the track.  Really?<br /><br />Simon, take the thing back to the studio and have a different team of artists remix this.  Unreal that anyone would let this fly out the door.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Pretty fun to play, except it seems like the free one runs outta things to find. Like the graphics and the story line
B005EXA8XC|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 15 year old grandson, he was excited when he opened the gift. The next time I saw him, he said he had watched the DVD and it was better than he thought it would be.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|I was charged for the app but was told the app was corrupted and it did not download to my Kindle Fire 7HD
B002MRROKS|5.0|An absolutely unbelievably fantastic band at the height of its power.  The CD version misses some stuff - the \\"More Than a Feeling\\" intro to SLTS really should not have been edited out - but the effect is to allow the listener to focus on the power of the music, rather than the stage banter (compare the edited and unedited versions of Unplugged in New York and you'll see what I mean).  Whether you were an impressionable teenager in 1992 or now, it's well worth your time.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I had heard about Team of Rivals, but like many others, I picked this up recently due to the excellent Lincoln movie. And that was a great decision. A great deal of the book actually covers Lincoln and his rivals before the election, so you feel like you get to know them personally without being dumped into 1860. DKG (for simplicity) does a wonderful job of fleshing them out, though I did feel like Bates was the least interesting of the men. Chase is just a wonderful character shown with his drive for the presidency. Poor Kate Chase - be sure to read up outside the book on her fate.<br /><br />Lincoln would truly have been the best friend the Confederacy would have had if he had lived. His death is even more tragic in those lights. His ability to lead and be president is incomparable and it does help to show why so many say he is the greatest President. Washington resisted the urge to be a King and created America. Lincoln preserved America.<br /><br />However, could Lincoln be elected today? Unfortunately, I don't think so - and we should think about what that says about us.<br /><br />I only saw a few issues with the Kindle version and I doubt most would even notice.<br /><br />27,759 locations in length, but about 12,000 locations of this is in the notes. 915 pages in total.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use several weather apps and this is the one I consistently turn to -- has wind speed and direction on front page, it's easy to navigate, extended forecast, and accurate.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I've never had the pleasure of reading work by Hitchens, but that's certain to change after this.<br /><br />This is an abbreviated version of just one man's fight with the greatest health threat our age is likely to deal with.  The wit and candor that is present here is well worth the asking price of the book, despite the complaints I've read in reviews.<br /><br />If you are a fan of his work, or if you're wanting an honest view of what the good folk of \\"Tumortown\\" experience, then you can't easily find a read of greater power.<br /><br />This is a work to be felt, and felt without restraint.  Few people in his position are willing to let so many in.
B0049IHX2C|4.0|I like it miss frank and tony shalob in the third movie. the locker analogy is kind of cool looking
B00ARAO720|3.0|Fun and entertaining, but a little predictable. I would have given it 3.5 stars but couldn't. Definitely a movie to rent and not buy.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|wish will smith could have song the movie's song like he did the last two. like the time travel. too many heights
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book I couldn't put down!  Highly recommend although it does have a tough story line especially if you have kids.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|you miss alot watching on tv originally. The bonus features are really interesting too. dosn't play in my old school dvd player
B001NERPHS|5.0|Thgius was purchased for a friend. I myself love this tape.<br />O course I love aqll of Mr. Dylans cds.
0345509617|5.0|Product received fast and in good order way before its estimated date.  I would definitely recommend this vendor with 5 stars rating.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Another fine album from the master of it all..Mr Bob Dylan.<br />A bit dark at times but I love Mr. Dylan. A++++++++++++++
1449410243|4.0|This is a good fun book.  Cats are wild animals after all no matter what deceptions they practice and however nice they pretent to be!
B008BDZOZY|3.0|I got it for a friend but we did play it together. I thinki he liked it<br />more than I did.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|As usual, Grisham has you on the edge of your seat and interested to the very last page.  If for some reason, you haven't read this one, I highly recommend it.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|I have just begun working this app, but enjoy it very much because of the beautiful images. I love stained glass &amp; enjoy working with it. These patterns are inspiring.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is fun and addictive to warn you. It is great for people who like a fast moving test of your reflexes and the controls are very simple. Buy the extra lives that cost 500 coins rather than the 10000 coins. They get you much farther in the game and you can use more than one per game. Have fun!
B000002B7O|4.0|this item was a gift for someone else they were very pleased it came right away also as stated thanks
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This version of UNO is pretty good.  It has nice graphics and is easy to use.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic games.
B00008WT5C|4.0|this was a gift also the individual was very pleased with item and would from same place again well done
B004LWZWGK|5.0|although there were echoes of &#34;The World is not Enough,&#34;  loved the action,  Wow wow wow!  I enjoyed this movie.
B001ECQ4AS|5.0|came right away safely shipped and the item was just as it was posted would order again from same place
B0042H9YMC|5.0|It was purchased as a gift.  My friend said it was good quality and loved it.  She watches it over and over.
0143038419|5.0|A great book about a journey of a woman finding herself. Great for every 20 something going through a quater life crises.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I loved the book. It kept me interested, but it only took an hour to read, and cost $8. Lower the price and its worth 5 stars
0375869026|5.0|A wonderful story appropriate for any age.  I have recommended it to everyone I know.  It reminds of the importance of kindness.  Loved the precepts in the story.  Cannot say enough about how much I liked this book.
145210655X|5.0|My 8 year old son and I love this book.  He said it was his favorite Christmas present. i thoroughly enjoyed reading the book with him, even though he could have read it by himself.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I really like this app. Although I have not reached the end of the game so far I'm enjoying the suspense of reaching the next level. It is a little different from other hidden object games, that makes it more fun.
B00004U8P9|5.0|No complaints here.  Love it.  Showed it to some of my friends and the look on their face of the campy-ness is epic.  lol
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It's better than the 1st book.  I'm definitely over the sex at this point. This needs a better storyline.  I hope the 3rd book brings it all together.
1594202842|5.0|I love the book despite the critisism.  I like to read how other cultures operate with raising their children.  I don't agree with it all but agree with some things in there.
B00A757EFW|3.0|2 Things to hard and if u have something like a touch screen tablet or ipad its hard to turn packman<br />good luck if u are trying to set a world record
B002P79KAC|5.0|I bought first season a couple of years ago and never watched it until I saw a couple of episodes on t.v. so had to watch it from the beginning.  It is super funny and I had to buy the second season since I couldn't simply wait for it to come in the mail and of course it is cheaper to download it anyhow.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story keeps you moving forward chapter to chapter unable to stop reading.  I found myself holding my breath in anticipation'  can not wait for the movie to come out.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I am actually going to watch this movie again! Entertainment was my goal in seeing this show and I was thoroughly entertained!
B003E8P9G0|3.0|Very interesting and suspending and a good purchase for action type of readers and big book type of readers. That's all from me.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game, however, the graphics are not as clear as I would like. But it is still a fun game to play
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|This app is cool. Great for a video diary. I'm bored easily so it should like have way more stuff. I would like totally buy it if your into making a video diary or whatever. If you don't like this app, too bad for you. It is only 4 taking pictures and video. The only other thing is that I can't erase the videos I made so, that takes up space. If it was 99 cents or a dollar I'd luv it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved the movie &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34;.  The cast, the story, and the laughs made for great evening at home.  The humor and dialogue between the characters had me laughing out loud.  The storyline had me rooting for different people in the story.  The singing sets were entertaining, engaging, and had me singing along with the movie.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who needs a good laugh and enjoys music or singing.  It is worth the rent and plays great on a laptop or Kindle.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|It was an amazing book. I love the different twist on vampyres. I still don't like how vampyre is spelt with a y but still awesome.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Funny as hell and worth the rental fee . The bear and wahlberg are very funny as a team. Highly recommend
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is awesome! I love it! The graphics are really good too. The little story line is a great idea too, it just makes the game even more fun. :)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book gave me a real insight into what kids are doing that their self described \\"involved\\" parents have no idea of.  We think we know our kids, but do we really?  The book is well written dealing with psychological and legal issues that face one seemingly average family.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series, but the third book really left a lot to be desired. First two books really suck you in.
B0015AARJI|5.0|An extra controller, not sure how to review this but everything worked as advertised so no complaints from me. Purchased an official controller not some some knock off so if that kinda thing is important to you then this would make a great purchase
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Good CD<br />while I thought all the music sounded like it blended together--after a few listens I like dit more<br />My wife loves him<br />so, aok by me
160459201X|5.0|This is a great product. However I don't appreciate this site requirirg me to go on and on when I can sum this up in one or two words.
B007MAETA8|4.0|Jon Mayer's voice at times can sound a little bit like that of the young Paul Simon, but neither his songwriting skills nor his melodic inspiration can rise consistently to that level.  That said, however, this is an unpretentious and workmanlike album, supported by a fine group of back-up people (I recognize Chuck Leavell on keyboards from a Greg Allman album I heard recently), and well-produced sonically by Don Was.  It has a kind of melancholy, slightly self-absorbed vibe that, again recalls some aspects of the young Simon, but the songs are literate and don't outstay their welcome.  All that sounds a little bit like damning with faint praise, but some of the songs are memorable -- \\"Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey\\" and \\"A Face to Call Home\\" are very good, and even better to my ears are \\"Queen of California\\" and \\"Something like Olivia\\" -- the latter is a lilting or soft-rocking blues that I'll probably remember when most of the rest of the album fades from memory.  I should add that I know nothing about Mayer, nor am I particularly interested in finding out: I bought it for under $5.00, mainly because it was under $5.00, so I listened without preconceptions or expectations.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|as an old sci-fi aficionado i enjoyed howey's redition of a future earth.  a fast-paced easy read.  eveninstilled a little empathy in me for the &#34;bad-guy&#34;.  i'd probably go for the next installment - is underway???
B0042U94UQ|5.0|It was a gift, but the person to whom it was given loved it.  Glad we could find it for her.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Price is reasonable and worth to own.  The trilogy is a series to watch over and over again.  Two thumbs up
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Didn't think it quite lived up to the pre-release  hype. We thought the movie dragged in the middle, and lost our interest.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Sandra Bullock is awesome in this movie.  I love the scene where she confronts her &#34;adopted&#34; son Mike's former friends in the hood.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would love to have a subscription to see this AMC show. It reminds me a lot of Lost. I saw the first 2 seasons on Netflix. I saw the first 2 episodes of Season 3 via Amazon at $1.99 per episode. The quality was excellent. I don't know why anyone would pay an extra $1 to view it in HD.
030758836X|2.0|Book was quite an exciting read with good attention to detail until the the last quarter of the book, then it just doesn't make a lot of sense and then a horrible ending!  Please DO NOT READ if you want any kind of closure from the ending.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Excellent book.  I do wish this topic were more readily discussed in the media.  The human rights violations are appaling.  How so few can contol so many is mind-boggling, but unfortunately not all that uncommon. After reading his account of North Korea camps, this book does make you want to explore the topic in more detail. We hear so little about the people of the region, and the great disparities between the North and the South.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of those books that grabs you right away. You'll laugh, cry and love it. Anyone that has or has ever had a dog will really enjoy the new take on their dog's daily life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game I love playing it. I would recommend it to peoples 6 and up. I will play forever it's so fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first book that I actually loaned to someone else....that is how highly I thought of it. It was an amazing story with many turns. This is the first book I have read by this author an I hope to read many more. Well worth the price, I only wish all books this good could be this inexpensive.
B006M6NV0M|5.0|Love this movie!  A little hokey?  Yes.  A little predictable?  Yes.  Each &#34;Heros&#34; strengths were shown and emphasized, with a lot of punch (in both physical and comedy).  Just a great &#34;get away from the world&#34; movie.
6302719631|1.0|I only got through 45 minutes of this silly film and gave up!  Acting is very poor and the way they shot it with the odd choice of music makes you wonder what they were thinking?  I do not recommend this one.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Entertaining but very violent. The boys in the house like it but I could have gone without. Not a girls movie.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|...that's how much I enjoyed this book. My second time reading it (first on kindle) was just as satisfying as the first. If this is your first glimpse at any fiction by author Chuck Palahniuk, this is a fine place to start. Satire at its best.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this app is awesome because there is any kind of dragon and this is my most favorite app the app store has
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My daughter says this is a great movie. She already had one copy so she gave her new one to my son. Good condition upon arrival and timely.<br />Thanks
B007TXN4TK|3.0|It is a fun little item to play around with. Could use a few more keys but enjoyable. You'll like.
B003UYV08E|5.0|I got to view this with my Daughter, we had watched Iron Man 1 the week before. It was her Christmas gift. Very enjoyable.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|After just 20 minutes I didn't really care who lived or died. Very minimal story. The whole thing took place in a locked down building. Reminiscent of Bruce Lee's game of death without any lesson or progression. Some decent visuals but overall not a movie I would recommend.
B003TZ9EGO|3.0|My niece was happy she loves Lady Gaga. It was very much wanted and price was very reasonable and easy way to purchase.
1577314808|4.0|Would recommend this to anyone looking for that inner self strength and direction.....Looking to share my copy with friends and family, pass it forward.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|This season is great!  I love dexter!  if u do not watch the show yet u should... it is so addictive!!  I love dexter but it did take forever to ship to me!
B007L6VR6M|4.0|The story of two young teens running away from life and drawing together in a puppy love type affair. One runs away from family, the other from a scouting encampment. Top notch cast, script, and acting. Very artistic camera work with tremendous attention paid to every detail in every shot, even the stuff in the background. The film is highly yellow tinted for emotional effect. Probably not suited for viewing by pre-teens for promoting running away, dancing in public in underwear, and lots of smoking.<br />This film would have been much better without the constant smoking promotions as product placement through out the entire film. Perhaps a good idea to teach your kids how product placements in movies work so they can grow up to be aware of them. I think this was one of the best movies of 2012.
0385535147|2.0|I'm a long time Grisham fan and have read every book he ever wrote. The Racketeer is surely not his best work. It is a surprisingly weak plot and lacks attention to details that make Grisham's novels so riveting.
B006QLH7O4|4.0|So many of the 3D movies today are not shot with 3D in mind, they are adapted for 3D like the re-release of Titanic. This was shot to be viewed in 3D which makes a world of difference.<br />I use a 3D projector on a large pull down screen. Not too many movies feature things that jump out towards the viewer. Mostly, the 3D effects add depth (when viewed at home). This film does utilize things that jump out at you on your home 3D hardware.<br />In the final minutes of the movie they show short segments of all the previous editions of this series, set to music, like a 3D horror music video, a really nice feature.<br />I think this is the best in the five film series. Plus it features one of my favorite actors, Tony Todd playing the role of the coroner.<br />This is the story about a group of office coworkers from a N.W. USA papermill taking a team building excursion via a large bus (like a Greyhound bus), the bus along with other traffic is halted on a large suspension bridge due to highway construction on the bridge. The bridge collapses sending the bus and dozens of people and cars hundreds of feet to the large river far below the bridge. One worker has a vision of the impending collapse then urges others to get off the stopped bus before the disaster even starts. Few people heed his warning. Like so many disaster films the worst part is the predictability of the deaths of the characters. Those being the most annoying people tend to live the longest and die the most bloody and painful deaths. Aside from that feature this story is one of the best in this horror series. I hope they keep making more and keep up the 3D use too.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really like this game. It did take a while to get used to the views and different symbols. I love it more if the tiles were in color.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|a fantastic thing to use. I can chat with my friends and look at the shop for flash deals. Its fantastic!
0395389496|5.0|A great book. We did an activity in class. We watch the movie too. A great book. Will recommend to other teachers.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The app worked fine but wasn't set up the way I wanted it to be. I am an over the road trucker and I wanted to be able to put in cities along my route and know what I had in front of me.
B005KMX866|4.0|This album Chris Isaac covers some classic songs and does a wonderful job. But I admit I prefer his original songs. But over all this is a good album.
B00005JKZV|3.0|I recently purchased all 3 of the LOTR movies from this website. When they arrived and I unwrapped them I found that this one's case was in really bad shape. There were dozens of dents and even a rip through the plastic and paper of the cover. It reminded me of a very used and uncared for DVD. The Two Towers came sandwiched between the first and third movie (which were both in pristine, flawless condition), so I know for sure that its condition was NOT a product of poorly handled shipping. Luckily, the discs were undamaged.
B00650SSWG|5.0|Loved Justin Timerlake in t his movie. As you can imagine it has a lot of sexual content and is not for the younger audience. But funny and likeable movie.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I got the cover as a request for a Christmas gift and as far as I could see, it was a good fit and will be used a lot.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|This is a funny movie. The actors are great. It does have more fowl language then I feel is required as the movie is funny on its own. Some nudity as well so it is not for the younger audience.
0307950654|1.0|Surprisingly bad for someone with James's skill. It almost reads like an essay, telling you about characters and their histories, but without a single chaeacter who comes alive. The pace is ponderous, dogged and just flat out fatiguing; you have to really want to finish it to make it to the end.<br />A fan of Austen, and of James, I read it out of curiosity and with no expectation that it would reach the caliber of Austen's novels, but I did hope it would fit the level James has established in earlier mysteries.<br />Sadly, it doesn't. In places there is even a waspish quality as James attempts to re-create Elizabeth D'Arcy's (nee Bennett) character. It takes real brass to re-imagine one of the world's most deservedly famous artistic creations.<br />If James wants to put on the literary critic's hat and give us her take on Pride and Prejudice, that's an honorable scholastic pursuit. Doing it in this elaborately promoted novel is just tacky.<br />Save your money - get it from the library.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|I knew the story and had seen the films but never read the book. Worth while read of a classic.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very accurate information of a Real Seal team member.This book is very very fun to read, I would recommend it to almost any guy or girl who likes blood and violence. Great book over all.
0143036424|3.0|Got this book for my husband because he loves the TV series. He is also a huge fan of the CJ Box series. He does not want the rest of the series because he says it has too much fowl language and is not a fan of the writing style.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I recommend this to any amateur psychologist.  What really lies behind our behaviors?  I'm hoping to find out, at least in the case of the major characters.
B0052QXAEK|3.0|Good movie but unfortunately Vanessa Hudgens does not do a very good job in the movie. The other characters are great and believable. This is the first thing I have seen her in so I had nothing to compare it to. If you can overlook her it is a good movie.
1451695195|5.0|An excellent book, well-written, interesting, and informative. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in life after death. Service was excellent, as usual. A good experience!
B0098460O4|5.0|Love it ! I listen to this most everyday in the car and got free download with purchase so it is on my Cloud player. Beautiful opera voices with some Pop influences.
B007P7DHJ2|3.0|The song was on the CD, but I expected to find other songs too. Recording quality was sub...service was extremely slow.  What happened to the good old days?
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is an amazing book and one that makes us look at our lives and how we treat people.  It is excellent and I would recommend this to everyone!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|The game was fun with a good story but too short. It it had been longer it would have been more worth it
B008518MOW|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater. I wanted to get it to complete the series. Glad  I waited for the 3D version.
0765325950|1.0|Amazon sells millions of products. Customer reviews provide us an outlet to rate and review those products, a vote if you will above and beyond our dollar.<br /><br />I argue that everything about a product should be eligible for criticism here; from the price, packaging, and quality of the product to the fit, form, and function.<br /><br />If the product happens to be a book, it can and should be rated for more than the single faucet of \\"the story\\". If the price is bad, it should get low stars, if the packaging or physical quality is poor, then it should be rated low. If it was poorly edited then is should be subject to low stars... and yes... if it excludes certain formats intentionally, well then it deserves the low ratings it has asked for.<br /><br />It's NOT immoral to rate a product poorly for failing to meet our expectations!<br /><br />A poor review based on the formats offered IS related to the book because it IS a part of the product.  These ratings are legitimate, just as poor ratings would be for books sold with poor ink or poor bindings.<br /><br />If the book comes out in Kindle version, then I'll pick it up and finish this long quest. I'll may even come back to change my review. If my one star hurts the sales between now and then... well, that's what it deserves in my opinion.<br /><br />Edit: In response to comments, I would like to append the following.<br />*********************************************************************<br />Complaining is in fact a virtue! When I was the child that some of you believe me still to be, my mother told me time and again that you get what you get and you don't throw a fit; Such a pernicious bit of advice. If mankind followed that advice, we would quite literally still be in the dark ages. No, that isn't an exaggeration, not in the least bit.<br /><br />What!? Women want to vote! Talk about complainers... Slaves want to go free!? What the hell are they whining about... they get fed... hell some even have shoes. The Boston tea party, now those were some childish deviants that certainly didn't listen to their mothers!<br /><br />Jest aside, considering all the value that complaining (both verbal and demonstrated) has brought to our society, you would imagine the word would have more virtuous synonyms by now.<br /><br />Trying to get authors and publishers to release their books digitally certainly doesn't quite stack up to women's rights, but it's still an important issue of our day.  Printing millions of books that typically get read only once, twice or even a hand full of times is horribly wasteful.<br /><br />Where several of my fellow complainers went wrong was expressing their passion in hateful ways. Slinging vile insults at a widow or making rabid attacks on other members of this forum is cruel, unproductive and has earned us more enemies than sympathizers.  I'm sorry that some of my fellow complainers lack the clarity, maturity, or perhaps simply patience to craft their complaints with care and couth.<br /><br />It's comical (in a sad way) that when some of us fail to submissively lie down and take whatever crap that's being dished, but rather, we stand up and rock the proverbial boat with complaints and demands for change.... So many of you react to our breach of norm with.... Complaint! You criticize us, denounce us, question our maturity, integrity, and honor; so often reacting with an equal disregard for couth.<br /><br />Ok, you caught me. Marking the hardback version of the product with one star for not offering the Kindle version of the product is wrong, strictly speaking. On the other hand, breaking open casks of tea and pouring them into the harbor isn't right either, strictly speaking. But, if our childish and deviant acts of protest run the risk of encouraging authors and publishers to give us the kindle option we demand even once in the future.... Well, then I'm willing to risk it! And so should more of you!
B002ZBN13A|5.0|Great album. Every song has enough variation it doesn't get lost in the mix. Definitely recommend this to anyone who likes evenesence or flyleaf
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Five  stars!  My  favorite part was the ending when Jason was talking to everyone else and telling their story about their adventure and thinking about their next move.
B0027MJU00|4.0|It was a good read...engrossing & creepy at the same time.  I recommend it.  It's a great escape from reality.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show! This season has more of the same things that I loved about the first two season. Good characters, beautiful costumes, and family drama :-)
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I have almost mastered the whole thing and cannot wait for updates. :)  Very fun and addictive. If you like cut the rope you will love this.
B001N3OJEG|4.0|You can't go wrong with Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey! Really good actors and an interesting storyline make for an entertaining crime drama.
B00005JLEU|4.0|The story and the animation are great!  The story starts off immediately, but the movie is long!  Children love different parts but some of the references are totally Japanese and lost on American audiences.  Certain characters are mesmerizing, the movie and the animation are wonderful.  The little girl's action and behavior are realistic to human child behavior.  Fate is portrayed with a recognizable mask.  This was a very absorbing picture, though very, very long.  Over 3 hours!  I loved the spider's<br />character.  Simply wonderful!
B000HF6XV8|5.0|The Secret Garden.  Love this movie!!  Watched this with my kids when they were little.  Wanted it on dvd.  Timely delivery!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the characters and how you feel what they are going through it made me laugh, happy and sad but a great story
B002APU580|5.0|Loved the book and love the movie! Such a beautiful story and Hollywood did a pretty descent job of depicting it.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|this is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I wish I wouldn't have purchased this or, given any type of funding to the creators of this movie
B00ANT6OK8|3.0|This movie is the story of the finding and execution of Osama Bin Laden.  Aside from the constant use of the \\"F word\\", which lost its shock value years ago and makes one wonder,'Does ANYONE in the movie industry own a dictionary?' it is an interesting movie.  One wonders how Hollywood and reality compare, but the mission was most impressive  and makes one proud of our military.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|I grew up listening to Zep with my dad and uncles and have always been a huge fan.  Even though much of their old music has been remastered it is still pretty flat and unresponsive compared to newer music on a nice sound system like the one I have in my car.  Not anymore!  This new concert sounds absolutely amazing, the only bad thing I can say is I get headaches listing to it so loud!  Page does sound older but he does a good job and doesn't try to hit notes he isn't capable of anymore.  The band sounds as good or better than they do in the older concerts.  The new rendition of Kashmir gives me goose bumps, it's just amazing.  Just buy it and crank it up.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|No more Ultra violet copy please.<br />I bought like 20 Blurays and DVDs. They all offer Ultra Violet copy. I already have that DVD and I think it is a waste.<br />I love the film.<br />No doubt that you should buy this at any cost.<br />Another good actor director case.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi is a well written and thought provoking account of a young boy's survival story.  Martel creates a vivid world, enhanced by his writing tone, which completely absorbs the reader.  Through much of the story, though the events are tragic and horrific, we as readers get a feeling of hope and optimism- possibly because we know from the beginning that Pi lives to tell his story.<br /><br />This book is chock-full of literary themes and symbolism, and while it's a relatively short book with a narrow story, it absorbs the mind and heart.  Bring with you a thick skin- the story is not a delightful romp with a boy and a tiger, and does take several disturbing, even haunting, turns.  Overall though, Martel has given us a book with a fascinating story and has also raised many questions about the nature of humans, animals, and religion.
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|It is not as good as Cabin in the wood, but very nice film, I thought.<br />I never expected anything from this film.<br />The ending still makes me think about this movie again.<br />It is not shocking or scary that much, but thinking back after watching it, something haunts you.<br />It is my second best horror film made in 2012.<br />I am buying Bluray and it is 7.1 DTS HD. Very excited.<br />I have seven speakers and rarely use them all.<br />It's a bliss that I can experience 7.1 a lot from movies like 'Avengers, Hellboy 2,Panth's Labyrinth, Dark City, A nightmare before christmas and so on.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't<br /><br /> wait for this one to become a movie. This book has opened my eyes to a hole different world and helped me to understand someone that comes from his kind of lifestyle.
B005LAII8A|3.0|Maybe I saw so many time machine movies. I didn't really liked this film.<br />There's no amusement moments or even one surprise. They are predictable or just plain.<br />I like Joseph really much but Bruce willis was kind of lame. Anyone could act that charactor.<br />All in all, so so film.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Whether you read this in high school or not, read it (again). This book has many levels and will give you a good look at the great depression, both from the Joad's story and the nation's.
030758836X|2.0|I could not put this book down. I loved how it was from two peoples perspectives, every other chapter. The author paid great attention to details and most of the book was full of &#34;Ahhhhhhhhhhh's&#34; and OMG's. But then, the last 30 pages or so, I feel like the author got board and was just trying to throw together an ending. The attention to detail was gone, the feelings you had for the characters had changed. It just wasn't a good ending. NO satisfaction what so ever. NO &#34;wow, I really did not expect that&#34;..... Other than I really did not expect to be so disappointed with the book when it was done after getting off to such a good start. I have a one year old and managed to read this in under a week, it was that good... That is until I got to the ending and felt like I was just robbed of a substantial amount of precious time!
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Not one of Connelly's best, but certainly entertaining reading.  Requiring words is rather ridiculous, when a few well-chosen suffice admirably.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Ken Follett has the ability to weave an engrossing story of fiction while at the same time include historical facts relating to the times and lifestyle of the period.  The reader becomes just as involved in the history and lifestyle as in the story being woven .I found both aspects engrossing and giving me cause to ponder what it must have been like , and what differences would it make confronted with the same circumstances today .Human nature has not changed, do our rules and regulations control us any better?  I find often history on it's own can be dull and forgetful , not in the hands of you Mr Follett ,thank you ,you have done the research  now keep the stories coming please.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Be prepared to be challenged and to sense deeply into the nearness of that which Dr. Alexander chronicles. Can this be? Read it and see for yourself. 5 big stars!!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|its great and bring so much fun top game. this game is for young and adult.. top game was make fun
B0098XY5VK|5.0|This is fun and if you're older (like me) and have arthritis in your fingers, this really makes your fingers move. (smile)
0486281523|4.0|This was a stocking stuffer for one of my sons.  They have all paged through it, testing each other.  Some puzzles all could solve, some stumped one guy or another, but they enjoyed it together (and the recipient has enjoyed it by himself after everyone else got bored and left).
B003O86FMW|4.0|Wonderful reading...haven't read in years and this is a great series to pick up.  4 stars.  I can't wait to get started on mocking Jay.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I liked this movie, a sci-fi movie about time travel without a lot of science or time travel drivel.<br />They handled the time travel with just right, by not handling it at all and concentrating on developing the story line.
B008NR91DO|5.0|As probably the finest rock guitar player in the world , Gary Moore was a perfect choice to do this tribute to jimi, From the moment he steps out on stage he rips the living daylights out of every one of the songs he does. To say his playing is KILLER is just an understatement. His band is hot and plays the first half of the show then Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox play the second half, As they only played together the night before they are outstanding, This is one hell of dvd concert as Gary shows everyone why he was the consumet guitarist, and i believe jimi would have been proud of this performance. the cd is sold seperate and is just the awsome soundtrack of the dvd . If you play guitar or not you will not be dissapointed with either. I think the sound and video quality is fine on both cd and dvd. The passing of Gary Moore was a blow the music world and the same with Drummer Mitch Mitchell, quality guys and legends now of rock history as is the man they paid tribute to Jimi Hendrix..  RIP
1416955070|4.0|Rating: 4 stars<br /><br />Review:<br /> I am reviewing this after I have read all of the books in The Mortal Instruments series that have been released. I found this second read to be even more enjoyable than the first because I could really analyze each character and watch how they grew as time went on. Cassandra Clare's writing is chock full of description, imagery, and humorous dialogue. She has created a complex world with Shadowhunters, werewolves, vampires, faeries, demons, and warlocks; each with their own culture.<br /><br />Clary is sucked into the Shadowhunter world by a fortuitous meeting with teenage Shadowhunters in the Pandemonium club. Her place in their hidden world is sealed when she discovers she has Shadowhunter blood running through her veins.<br /><br />You will either love or hate this book. Some of you, like Steph, will be bored with Clare's slow-paced writing style and will stop reading after the first few chapters. Only two weeks have passed in this 485 page book. Others, like me, will become captivated with this strange world and its various characters. Clare has weaved one of the most complicated tapestries that I have ever seen. If the characters slip up even once, they will face dire consequences.<br /><br />Quick rundown of the characters:<br />Jace: *sighs* A young shadowhunter who has killed more demons than anyone else of his age. He is as handsome as an angel, witty, and secretly broken inside. His father taught him that \\"To love is to destroy.\\" His outer personality is really just an armor he uses to hide his true feelings. He won the 2011 YA Crush Tourney at the YA Sisterhood blog! Jace's sexiness will cause you to keep reading even if you think the plot is boring!<br /><br />Clary: You might be frustrated with Clary's supposed lack of usefulness. At first, I didn't like her. But as you keep reading this series, Clary becomes stronger and stronger.<br /><br />Alec Lightwood: If I said anything about him, I would be giving away a rather large spoiler. I will say that he is Jace's parabatai, his \\"brother from another mother\\" for lack of a better definition.<br /><br />Isabelle Lightwood: A confident, headstrong young woman who uses her beauty as a weapon. At one point, Jace wonders why Clary doesn't know that she beautiful and doesn't use her beauty like Isabelle. Isabelle is hostile to Clary at first because she has always been the only girl with a pack of boys. She feels a bit threatened.<br /><br />Simon: Clary's best friend who is secretly in love with her. He is a cute, awkward geek who loves playing Dungeons and Dragons and reading anime. He is a good archer and uses his skills later in the book.<br /><br />Magnus Bane: A warlock who loves sparkles. Really, no joke. He gels and sparkles his hair! He is not so much of a main character in this first book, but in the sequels he is definitely a major character.<br /><br />I knocked off a star because at some points, I was bored in his book. There are a few slow points filled with smalltalk and humor, but sometimes humor cannot make a ton of dialogue interesting. Clare generally uses a lot of humorous dialogue in her writing.<br /><br />Overall, a great book! The movie is coming out soon, but it might be nothing like the book. I don't think the guy playing Jace is hot enough...but I like the girl who plays Clary! :)<br /><br />Quotes:<br />\\"What are all these?\\" Clary asked.<br />\\"Vials of holy water, blessed knives, steel and silver blades,\\" Jace said, piling the weapons on the floor beside him, \\"electrum wire - not much use at the moment but it's always good to have spares - silver bullets, charms of protetion, crucifixes, stars of David-\\"<br />\\"Jesus,\\" said Clary<br />\\"I doubt he'd fit.\\"<br />\\"Jace!\\" Clary was appalled.<br /><br />\\"A diary with no drawings of me in it? Where are the torrid fantasies? The romance covers?\\" Jace<br /><br />\\"He made a sound like a choked laughed before he reached out and pulled her into her arms. She was awareof Luke watching them from the window, but she shut her eyes resolutely and buried her face against Jace's shoulder. He smelled of salt and blood, and only when his mouth came close to her ear did she understand what he was saying, and it was the simplest litany of all: her name, just her name.\\"<br />ooh lala ;)<br /><br />--Steph and Dani @ A Walk on Words<br />[...]blood, and only when his mouth came close to her ear did she understand what he was saying, and it was the simplest litany of all: her name, just her name.\\"  ooh lala ;)    --Steph and Dani @ A Walk on Words  [...]
158234082X|5.0|Anthony Bourdain on paper is just like Anthony Bourdain on T.V. -- witty; insightful; enlightening.  He pulls no punches, and takes you to places you could never go on your own.  If you want to learn new ways to delight your palate, either in the kitchen or out on the town, he can provide the wherewithal to do so.  Very much recommended.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|We simply had to have this at Christmas time.  Had a DVD that had been destroyed previously, so glad we had this, this year!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game starts out slow but builds up to Sudoku-like levels of difficulty.  It's especially good if you have very limited windows of time in which to play, as I do.  You can play a few frames and then bail.  Check it out.

030758836X|4.0|This book had me from page one, could not stop reading.The twists , the turns, the unrealistic plots even made reasonable. The ending - my stomach actually lurched, I felt physically dissapointed!  Seriously, sounds dramatic, true, how could such a great written book end so awfully?
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This is an awesome book and I'd recommend it to any one that likes any sort of zombie movies :)
B009PNQUXO|1.0|I just downloaded this app. The videos will not play. It says &quot; generic error&quot;. I'm just gonna delete it and use the nonlinear version.
030758836X|4.0|This was our book club pick. It drew me in right away. I'm ready for the follow on book. It kept me reading to each new turn.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is awesome!! You can't buy the book in stores for what you can get it on the kindle.
B001KWP54S|5.0|Love the songs and they fit well together. Reinforced my love of the blues. Several friends have heard and gotten their own copies.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|So far this camera seems to work great. The only thing I don't like about it is, you can't take a picture unless the shot is facing you. I would rather it face outward.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This purchase has to be the best purchase I have made for my husband who is a BIG FAN of The Game of Thrones!  I purchased the First and Second Season and will continue to purchase every Season as long as the series continues!<br />Along with my husbands purchase I now have other family memebers who I also make these same purchases for!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn does it again! Amazing story line and current in every aspect. The plot twist definitly will catch you by surprise and keep you page turning until the end. LOVED IT!!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|could not put this one down from the start. Another masterpiece with all the characters that seem so lifelike. We actually need andOrg like them in America to cut the head off the snake.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was amazing. I loved the movie but this book I couldn't put down. Well written and perfectly executed story.
1619692368|3.0|I ordered this book because I love Ellen's humor.  The book is less about humor and more about advice from Ellen.  It was okay, but I wanted to laugh and didn't.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|We played this as a family fun time.  It was challenging and fun for US all!<br /><br />Fun for the whole family.
1465001107|4.0|When I ran across this calendar on Amazon, I knew right off the bat that I wanted to purchase it to add to my Michael Jackson collection. And I honestly never thought it'd arrive in such a timely fashion either, but luckily it arrived within the estimate delivery date! However, I'm just a little bit disappointed with it, especially in a few of the pics,(the first 3 for January, February, & March,) due to being a bit too dark, & it could've been a little bit better in that department! I also was a bit disappointed in a way, over the fact that one of the pictures used for the month of NOVEMBER(my fave picture by the way, since i own a big poster of the same photograph), is also already in the 2011 MJ calendar. That seems a bit awkward to me, in my opinion, even though I myself don't have 2011, but for those fans that do have it, was it really necessary to include the exact same picture in another calendar??<br />I seriously don't think so! I really hope that next year the calendars will be better, in terms of different NEW pictures & hopefully better quality!!<br />And that's the reason why I give this calendar a 4 star. So with that being said, overall, it's a good collector's item for fans!! :)

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this Is a great app I recommend this for people who play temple run and other running obstacle games. I think this app is for all ages kids might enjoy it more but grownups might enjoy it too. It depends what their interest are. I for one love this game and a think you should get it on amazon products and Apple products.
1863514260|5.0|This book is so beautifully put together. Each page is carefully thought about and printed. Learning embroidery painting made simple!
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|T.I.'s new album is awesome. Finally someone came out with something I actually like. I felt like rap had seriously gone down hill then I heard this. It's his best since Paper trail. It's cool how he put his real life drama into his album. He just throws it all out there and leaves nothing untouched. It's all I've listened to since I bought it. Definitely not something to sleep on.
B0045EJY90|4.0|But when you know the product has 110 volts US specifications and the product is meant for a country in Europe with 220 volts power supply, the machine cannot simply be used as is. Either you look into your global inventory to find the right electrical connections to the destination country or suggest an appropriate adaptor. I spent many days looking for the right adaptor to transform 110 volts to 220 and even then I have the constant fear that the machine should not run more than three hours as displayed on the adaptor warning. For a big company like Amazon, matching these customer needs in different countries should not be such a big problem and would greatly augment customer satisfaction.
B004K00NMG|5.0|This movie is very interesting. Voice talents of meg Ryan & John cusack, also Angela lands bury. It is based on the search for princess Anastasia. Alegedley the only surviving child & family member of the Romanov dynasty. Fun for kids & adults alike..

B00999DFP0|5.0|We have loved watching Big Bang Theory, but have never watched it from the start. We've always watched reruns & in no particular order, so this has been great!!! We have enjoyed every episode, every season!! Can't wait for season 6 to come out on disc!

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|not for children...adults.. a very funny movie...cute story line........would recommend if you want to laugh! I  would watch it again
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie is very fun to watch, the storyline is interesting & the coloring is gorgeous.  In 3D, this movie really shines.  On our TV, it has the right amount of depth to it and adds a great dimension to the storyline.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|this is great to have...still learning how to  use..getting better...like watching auctions...and keeping track what is going on..would recommend ..

B009YP9L7U|2.0|a very boring book  ...had a hard time getting threw it...did not hold my interest.  but it was a free book
1580812635|5.0|Customer ordered this for his son who is legally blind and was required to &#34;read&#34; this for school.  Very sastisfied.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Paul Simon reissues are a self-contained industry.  Sony's reissues of Simon's studio recordings have revealed the warmth of original performances. Compilations by Sony and Warner, in comparison,  have been repetitive, less consistent and dependable.  But now we have this deeply moving, energizing release, and Lazarus emerges from the dead.<br /><br />When I first listened to audios of this 2011 Webster Hall concert, I was transfixed in about two minutes. After that, I could not divert my attention from the brilliance of this composer's imagination, or this performer's understated heart.  The sonics are very fine.  The content is generous: roughly 85 minutes of concert audio on two CDs, and a complete DVD of the Webster performance.<br /><br />One of my favorite albums of 2012 was RANDY NEWMAN LIVE IN LONDON (NONESUCH) a wrenching, beautiful album and DVD by a master composer and performer.  In this performance, Paul Simon clears the bar Newman did in his extraordinary performance; but where Newman relied on a grand piano and back-up chamber orchestra, Simon turns to his guitar and a street-smart back-up band.  His set list spans the peaks of the Simon and Garfunkel Years, taps the best of his work at CBS and Warner, and touches recent compositions, too.<br /><br />In his rendition of \\"The Only Living Boy in New York\\" the melancholy those of my of my generation feel about the past strikes like a Mack truck.  Simon's performance is so thoughtful and heartfelt, and his set list so well-chosen,  that listeners of all generations must pause and wonder.  We're happy that an innovator still creates, sings, and inhabits legendary spaces like Webster Hall, in which the ghosts of Simon's forbears performed and recorded their work.<br /><br />The only disappointment  here is in the packaging, which fails consumers in a few negligible ways. Too-light cardboard stock used for packaging leads to easy tears. Poor planning for easy removal of discs is annoying.  The lamination istacky and documentation too brief. What should have been an historic release has been issued in a package designed for a routine issue, and that annoys old men like me, for whom the physical piece is part of the album.<br /><br />That aside, there are 19 indelible performances here by one of our great singer/songwriters, and a fine video of the New York event, too.  Concord wanted to add value. If they'd had the courage to charge consumers another buck, they might have created a lasting archival package for those who buy brick-and-mortar albums. A physical package that lasts.<br /><br />Music matters more, though, and in this case, the compositions, performance and sonics save the day.  This is an unusually fine piece of musical history performed by an artist whose skills are too unique to be parodied or duplicated.<br /><br />Five stars.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|RECEIVED IT IN EXCELLANT SHAPE AND THE MOVIE WAS IN SUPERIOR SHAPE; LIKE AS IF i BOUGHT IT BRAND  NEW
B007MB5OCE|4.0|It took me a while to get the hang of this book, however, after a few chapters I really enjoyed it. It's a bizarre, but entertaining, read and I loved the way, it walks the reader through very important events in last centuries history. Usually these books come with a bad/sad ending, not this one, which for me is another plus.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Outstanding music. Gives me hours of listening enjoyment along the lines of Billy Joel.  Will buy<br />any of his albums when available.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|I recently got Showtime and began to watch Dexter in Season 7. I have access to all the other seasons except Season 6, so I purchased it on Amazon Instant Video. I love the convenience of watching on my iPad or computer. Season 6 was awesome!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's an ok app. it's a good time waster. the time limits can either be an incentive or very annoying. it depends on what you are looking for.
0765325950|1.0|The world is changing.  Paper books are being replaced by electronic ones.  Why wouldn't they release the kindle version of the book at the same time as the paper one?  The only reason I can think of is to try to make those of us who buy the e-book buy both the paper and electronic ones and steal money from us.  That is not acceptable.  Rather than buying this book I think I will go to my local library and check it out for free.  Congratulations, you now have lost money because you had to be greedy and wait three months for the e version.<br /><br />I encourage everyone to go to a library instead of buying this book.  It just wrong how publishing companies treat us.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game, very entertaining, good puzzles, good story line.  I hope they produce another one just as fun.  I would be sure to get it!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This is a hidden object game that is pretty intricate with various tasks to be completed, and the graphics are really attractive. One thing, however, that I found annoying. You often have to backtrack to areas you had been before, which is fine. However, you can't just go directly back to where you need to go. You have to keep clicking back and going back thru each location.  That gets very tedious.  Otherwise, it's an enjoyable game.
B001P06GX4|4.0|This is a fun game for the whole family. I don't think my brain is wired quite right to be a whiz at this game (spacial logic) but I think that it could help improve my brain function if I were to play it more often.
076115678X|5.0|No more straightening.  No more blow drying. This book is the ultimate training tool for those who just can't stand to see their untamed curly hair in a ponytail ever again.  Great easy to follow step by step instructions.  It took me almost 60 years to learn to treat my curly hair the right way.  You don't need to wait that long, I highly recommend this second edition book with cd.  If you decide to make the change look on their website to locate a hairstylist trained to cut using the deva curl method.
1451683405|1.0|Mr. Harris states that \\"Either our wills are determined by prior causes and we are not responsible for them, or they are the product of chance and we are not responsible for them,\\" and worse, \\"free will doesn't even correspond to any subjective fact about us.\\"<br /><br />Please, this subject is much more complicated than this simplistic statement which is not characteristic of such an educated man as Sam Harris.<br /><br />I'm not a great fan of free will either, but this treatment of such a complex issue, including the neuroscience and psychology and philosophical issues make this statement a comic book caricature of the true issues.<br /><br />Clearly there is a polemic going on here rather than true massaging of the subject. Very sad :(<br /><br />For a better viewpoint, see Stanford professor Kelly McGonigal's, [[ASIN:1583334386 The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do To Get More of It]]
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this and have a hard time putting it down.  I will recommend it for all ages and they will enjoy
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I enjoyed the read, but I expected it to be better, since it is Sparks.  I won't give anything away, but I didn't care for the ex-wife twist.  I suppose it comes down to personal preference, and I preferred his other books to this one.
B00007BK2N|5.0|A brilliant and hilarious take on the music scene in northern England (what would eventually evolve into rave culture). And you get to see a non-CG Andy Serkis as a demented recording engineer.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the entire trilogy in 10 days.  Although slow in some parts, it kept me turning page, wanting to know what will happen next.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love the graphics & challenge. No adds or prompts to buy other stuff. Still on first level but Ill get it eventually.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|This movie was ok but I liked the 2nd one the best of the 3. It just didn't hold my interest as well as 1 and 2.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game keeps you busy on it down time and it gets really addicting when u get farther into it
B008Y5OW20|5.0|If you are and Jeff Lynne fan you will love this album. Jeff plays all of the instruments, all vocals, and mixes what you hear. Amazing and enjoyable.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Arrived quickly and the quality of the disk was great. No glitches or scratches of any kind, great product a
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: For a decade, an elite team of intelligence and military operatives, working in secret across the globe, devoted themselves to a single goal: to find and eliminate Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />The cast led by Jessica Chastain (impressive in her Oscar-nominated performance as Maya) is brilliant. The directing by Kathryn Bigelow (who also produced the film and was Oscar-nominated for her producing efforts on the film) is brilliant. The story & screenplay by Mark Boal (who also produced and was, not only, Oscar-nominated for her producing efforts, but for his screenplay, as well) is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Alexandre Desplat is brilliant. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is brilliant. The film editing (Oscar-nominated) by William Goldenberg & Dylan Tichenor is brilliant. The casting by Mark Bennett, Richard Hicks & Gail Stevens is brilliant. The production design by Jeremy Hindle is brilliant. The art direction by Ben Collins & Rod McLean is brilliant. The set decoration by Lisa Chugg & Onkar Khot is brilliant. The costume design by George L. Little is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Neil Corbould & Richard Stutsman, coordinated by Blair Foord & J.D. Schwalm is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Chris Harvey & Mike Uguccioni, coordinated by Anita Ho is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by George Cottle & Stuart Thorp is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliant and well-made film that is intriguing and entertaining in terms of its subject matter. It is also well-crafted and well-acted. Jessica Chastain gives an interestingly impressive performance as Maya. Kathryn Bigelow & Mark Boal have done a terrific follow-up to their Oscar-winning film \\"The Hurt Locker\\". This is also one of the best films of the recently-done holiday season and of the recently-done year, as well, if not, the best film of the year. This is also the Oscar contender of 2012 (of course, nominated for Best Picture and also Sound Editing, as well, of course, recently, winning in a tie with \\"Skyfall\\" for Sound Editing) to beat, the awards consideration that it has received to date, is impressive, as well.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|I love this app. I've been playing for the past 3 hours and just reminded myself that I wanted to write a review. This app is worth the $3 I promise!!!! Well let me get hack to my game Devil's Attorney...
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love this album. Every song is a winner, and her voice is wonderful - a mix of power and vulnerability.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Very good novels short and the plot does not drag out.  There is not any junk writing thrown in just to add pages to the book.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I love a good Zombie yarn, and someone asked if I had read this after I saw a movie trailer for the new movie.... I saw just one trailer, but it seems the movie and this book may share just the same title.  I didn't care for the interview style writing, took you completely out of the moment, there was zero character development and what plot?  Maybe my expectations were too high. The only thing I did like was the slightly different take on the Zombie war, being &#34;we&#34; won and Countries then had to worry about rebuilding, but I felt that was a topic barely touched upon. I'd have liked to see the idea more thoroughly explored.
1933308087|5.0|I love the book. It is so helpful, especially for a beginning quilter.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in quilting.
1402793375|5.0|I bought this book again to reread it. I first read it while I was in college back in 1974 in Champaign, Illinois. I was immediately captured by the other side of the story about the Native Americans. Its original subtitle was \\"How the West Was Lost\\" and that is exactly the story Dee Brown has told. At the time he was a librarian at the University of Illinois.<br /><br />I did have to laugh at the book description comment written in October 2012, \\"Now in paperback, this stunningly illustrated edition...\\". Quite amusing since the edition I read in 1974 was paperback and fully illustrated as well.<br /><br />I was excited several years ago when a TV mini-series of the same title came out. Then my hopes were dashed since the series had very little to do with the actual facts and was basically a Hollywood piece of crap.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Truly an amazing and creative story!  I am SO glad I took a chance on an author I've never heard of, but who is now one of my favorites.<br /> So please, take a chance, you won't be disappointed!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I tried this because some of my younger grandchildren use it and they really like it.  I wanted to see for myself and it is good.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|It is so easy to watch movies on Amazon Roku. No problems at all! Great movie, if you like action.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is another great game and fun to play.  I can play for as long or as short a time as I have available and still have fun.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|A fun guilty pleasure! This is a perfect book to read on vacation. Would not recommended for younger girls as there is a lot of teen drinking.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game! After the kids go to school I'm like time for my game.I have other games on my kindle fire however I'd rather play this one more.... I even got my hubby stuck on this game... my husband and I take turns playing this game.... he even got our children stuck on this game too.. then I'm like hey my turn... so I play mostly when kids are sleeping and hubby is at work.  I also played temple game.. I didn't like it like this game... haa haaa I at time get frustrated I'm like I can beat this mission!! Love it!!!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This is funny but really and I say Really got tired of the foul language. You would think that writers would have a better vocabulary to use than the same ole F word.
B0000TB014|5.0|Got it for a Christmas gift. My grandson loved it! And the price was right.  This is why I rated it 5 stars
B000MCIBAW|5.0|This was the last disc my husband needed for his collection. He is very pleased with it and has been listening to it daily.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|What can you say. It's always a pleasure to read a Pendergast novel. It's like seeing an old friend every year or so. Thanks P&C
0316113077|4.0|very good material. book contains picture of projects finished and explanation of how to do it.  elisa strauss is very talent!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I got this for the wife for christmas. She loves it. The only thing, after market charger do not fit in the slot provided, you have to use the I phone chargers.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Good transfer, and I like having four versions, including one I can take on a laptop to watch on the plane.
0141194073|5.0|I bought this because I love this Penguin collection. Call me old-fashioned, but I rather have one of this beautiful covers in my library, than to have a digital copy of the book. Of course, this also happens to be my favorite Fitzgerald novel. I also bought one as a gift for a friend.
0765316994|5.0|I loved the concept when I first heard about it and the book does not disappoint. An excellent story that turns some SF tropes on their head.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. It was written beautifully and I couldn't put it down. There was just twist after twist that was just amazing. Loved it so much!
B009329Y30|3.0|It was watchable.  I was in the mood for romance and wasn't sorry about the 3.99, but am I glad I saw it? Nope.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok, I had heard a lot about the books before I read them so I was expecting them to be shocking so that wasn't a big surprise. What was a surprise was how much I loved the characters.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|If you're looking for a book that tells what a word means then it is for you.<br />But it is not for me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Was dissappointed in the first book for how it ended so it was nice that it continues on. All of the things that I disliked about Christian in the first book don't go away, but the author definately made the character more likeable and human giving him more back story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show! My wife made me watch it and now I actually like it. And here are 6 more words.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This didn't hold my grannddaughter's interest at all.She tried a few times,but it just wasn't worth the effort. Very disappointed.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I have no idea how many times I've  watched  it.  I love it.  I think Rene'e  did a wonderful  job.  I  only think of miss potter as Rene'e<br />my grandaughter  borrowed it  so I bought her, her own copy.  so good,tragic, and redemming.  so different from today's standard, and yet  the same story. we meet,  we  fall in love,  we  part , life goes on.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Who doesn't love FaceBook? There really is no better way to connect with family and friends!Only problem is,it can be addicting!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|this was  exactly  what I wanted.  The quality  is  very  good.  the price  was  very  good.  I am  thankful I bought this to give to my brother,  he  loves it and plays it several times a week.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am a college student and decided to buy the Kindle hd because I thought it could benefit me in everyway. I'm not much of a reader and I was hoping thr Kindle hd would change my mind and help me begin to like reading. Well after purchasing a few books, it has!! I didn't have much knowledge on Kindles and the Amazon staff have been great at trying to answer all my questions. I also love the fact thst I can get apps, surf the web and login to my Facebook Account. I can even check my mail. Its like a mini computer. Because I am a student I was able to find a coupon and save $50 and get the 8.9 instead of the 7 for thr same price. I also signed up and got a prime membership for frer for the first 6 months because I'm a student. I would definitely recommend this product, especially if your not a reader or if you are because if your not, you'll become one. Thank you Amazon.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great way to pass the time.....very addictive and as a free app, I have fun trying to increase my score!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing bingo blitz. Bingo is one of my favorite games. I used to go play real Bingo with my mother once I turned 18. Been loving it since.
B009IQG5LK|4.0|I have been waiting for this movie to be released on Blu-Ray forever. It looks wonderful and all the colors are just amazing.<br />Very disappointed that there are NO extras at all. No commentary, no making-of.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I purchased this for my son. He loves this game. He plays it whenever I'm not on my kindle fire.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is completely amazing though there are some grammatical errors, I completely love this book and can't wait to read the next one!!!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Rayman goes so far back I can barely remember. I had to get this game. This game is great on my kindle. Plays really good. Everyone should give it a try.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Nice smooth gameplay, awesome graphics, and a game that doesn't get boring. I'm thoroughly impressed and I can't wait for more.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I was bored, needing to kill time I began to search through the app store, seeing a high rating I figured id try it out. I never thought id play the game through clear to the end in one sitting...one long sitting that is. I became zo involved i just couldnt put it down. Definitly worth the time!
B0096HIEE2|1.0|great looking bodies but the whole movie stunk.I am not a prude but I think this movie could have been better with the two stars they had in it,
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I thought this book was going to be a scary story, but was happily drawn into a fantasy with unexpected characters and events. Very nice!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It's combines all the types of animals, people, and monsters of the era.  Plus gives the pursuit of the Stark family to a unpredictable future<br />And keeps you wonder who is good and who is evil??
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My daughter (6 years old) and I love this game.  Very creative and fun.<br />Good puzzles.  Interesting storyline.  Wish there were more levels as we've finally completed the game.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Continues to follow the family stark but leaves you asking who is the good guy?  And when all the players will come together, who will reign.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|This is a classic movie if you have never seen it, it is definitely a must watch. This Is by my favorite movie ever made!
B001GMQALY|3.0|It was hard for me to believe that I completely missed this 80s film! I thought that I had seen all of the greats of that era! I read some of the reviews and learned that many women secretly attested to loving this movie, but were not comfortable openly admitting it, for fear of being perceived as bad girls.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it contained many of the key ingredients that make for a successful and powerful seduction. John (Mickey Rourke) demonstrated the masculine attributes that inspire a powerful attraction in the opposite sex. Confidence, a guy who knows what he wants and is not afraid to go after it, a guy who doesn't really care what others out there might think, a guy who lives life as if it is his bedroom, but the most powerful of all the seduction chess pieces that he plays, is that of \\"mystery.\\" He hardly ever answers any of Basinger's direct questions. He simply smiles instead and draws her in with curiosity. Just like a putty cat that you lightly push away, Basinger kept coming right back, over and over again.<br /><br />One reviewer on here felt that John did not portray the role of a \\"nice guy\\" in this film. Yet, I felt that such assessment is definitely open to interpretation. \\"My\\" interpretation is that he \\"did\\" (initially, at least) play the role of a \\"nice\\" guy because he invested so much time and energy in creating for Basinger, a pallet of potent emotional experiences. He wanted to take complete care of her, but did so in a way that kept her guessing, kept her wondering, he never revealed what was under the mystery dance. He was always \\"spontaneous,\\" she never knew exactly what he was going to come up with next. I think people often confuse \\"nice guys\\" with \\"dorks\\" who will overide their own personality, their own creativity, what makes them unique, to give way to a woman who they feel attracted to. Yet, do women really find such a guy attractive?  Tons of research says \\"NO.\\" I am also convinced that there is a strategic and creative balancing act required, and at the beginning, Rourke played it very well. His character portrays the nice guy, in the \\"non-distorted\\" way, until he flips the scales that is, crosses the line, and no longer recognizes that the painting of emotional experience that the brush of his actions were creating in Basinger, were no longer on the \\"positive,\\" enjoyable, blissful--side of the emotional spectrum.<br /><br /> I loved this scene where John takes Basinger shopping and he has her try on some outfits. He sits back admiring her beauty and decides on one outfit that to \\"him,\\" looks the best on her. When they go up to the register, Basinger asks him: \\"John, aren't you going to ask me how 'I' like this?\\"  John smiles at her and says; \\"no,\\" as he places one after another $100 bill on the counter. I think that \\"unconsciously,\\" women find men who take charge like this, who know what they want, who are firm and secure, to be quite attractive.<br /><br />Another reviewer on here stated that we should watch the movie, \\"not for the sex but for the magic,\\" and I totally agree! I loved how the movie smoothly progressed into more intense plots that seemed to threaten the boundary between sanity and insanity, what is acceptable and that which is totally unaccetable (or abnormal). I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, but there are many scenes, and one in particular, where you are forced to wonder what you would do, how you would react in such a circumstance. Eventually, it was this scene which took place in a hotel room that seemed to end up being the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. You have to see the movie to know what happened. After that, Basinger seemed to realize what she was dealing with. It was as if the \\"context\\" of John's new game and the nature of the emotions that it provoked, caused Basinger to abruptly snap out of the seduction trance. The spell had lost its power.<br /><br />I didn't give the movie a \\"perfect\\" rating because I feel that the ending left too many loose ends untied. I felt that it was too abrupt, left too much up in the air. Its as if it left you wanting an explanation from Basinger. She was having such a blast, excitedly clasping the handrails of an emotional roller coaster, then hands way up in the air, reaching for the sky, happily yelling at the top of her lungs. You see the \\"sparks\\" that many reviewers here describe, turn into all out \\"thunder bolts,\\" and then, suddenly, all you see are rain showers cascading from Basinger's beautiful eyes. Even though you might, indeed sense what it was that flips the switch, there is no concrete footing given, nothing to give you absolute closure. I even got this sense that the creators had gone beyond their alloted time limits and were forced to edit the movie down in a way that left something important out of the ending. But, I am open to the alternative. Perhaps I am totally off and it was \\"exactly\\" how the writer intended to end this great cinematographic story. Leaving us wondering, as John had left this blonde beauty wondering so many times, \\"what's next, what's next, what's next?\\" The patterns that seduced Basinger, end up being the same cards that the writer plays to seduce us....<br /><br />Enjoy!

B001AITGWE|5.0|Wow! What a great movie! This movie brought back so many memories and activated so many psychological patterns that were already dormant (or perhaps transcended)! This movie was very well put together, and touched upon so many factors. I agree with one of the reviewers, that Douglas enacted many of the things that have probably crossed all of our minds at one point or another, things that at times, we too wanted to play out in moments of utter frustration.<br /><br />I lived in Los Angeles up until when I was 18 years old, and in the movie they show areas that I have been to many times. Its amazing how certain images in films can re-activate the feelings that once felt so familiar, this sense of home. The traffic, chaos, cultural divides inherent in big cities are captured quite accurately in this film. I can still remember feeling this angry, this frustrated, caught in traffic on a scorching summer day, just to make it to a restaurant to have dinner with my family. Fortunately, instead of lashing out like our actor's portrayal, I moved out to the San Bernardino area and then out of California entirely.<br /><br />I know that I am sharing some elements that are personal, when this review should be about the film itself. Yet, I believe that such is the power of a good movie. A good movie has the ability to awaken a youthful nostalgia, old frustrations, old experiences that were either sad or joyful, an endless emotional array of experience. Some people \\"love\\" these very aspects of the big city that I, personally, did not care for. This movie has a little bit of something for everyone. It powerfully depicts the most basic elements of the human condition, and does so in a way that pulls directly at our internal, emotional strings.<br /><br />One of the things that I liked most about this film is that Douglas's behavior was not inspired by pure malice, in other words, the experiences that \\"triggered\\" his unconventional responses were things that most of us would also find disturbing. He runs into the typical ignorant gang member who is living off of his parents because he cannot maitain a job, yet claims to own a large piece of land that people who unwittingly trespass upon, now owe him a monetary fine. The closing down of a traffic lane during rush hour by the city, to fix a road that there was absolutely nothing wrong with in the first place, etc. The film clearly depicts how we each perceive reality in our own, unique way, and how such perceptions may conflict with those of our fellow human beings.<br /><br />I totally loved this film, the only negative thing that I can say about it is that at the very end, when the cop is eating pop corn, the mirror neurons activated with me and I ended up with a powerful popcorn craving! It wasn't a big enough reason to deduct rating stars though, so this movie gets a \\"perfect\\" score from me!<br /><br />Enjoy, everyone!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it! I can't wait to see if there will be anymore! It's hot romantic and evil all at the same time!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderfully written, great humor and just refreshing to watch the story of this family unfold in such a clean yet provocative way even though it is fiction. It is a wonderful glimpse into the every day lives of British Aristocracy. Gotta love the Brits and the unabashed way that they slight one another without curse words or brutality. Quite a change from the Hollywood versions of American family dynasties. The Brits have it...Simple is good AND Less is more!!!!!!!!!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Its a really lovely story with a couple of unexpected twists. Its funny, entretaining and super romantic. Its definetly worth reading.
B00A23MVHA|2.0|I really expected to laugh.. At least Mila Kunis was in it. Beautiful actress. She it's the only reason I gave the movie a couple stars!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|If you identify with the way the main character Reacher thinks, analyzes and reacts, then you will want to read all the books in the series, as I have. As you become engaged in the circumstances of the plot, your mind will want to anticipate, or compete with Reacher to see what he will do. This book, while not the most action-packed, is filled with lots of juicy details to analyze.(That's where God lives, right?). The refined mastery of the auther in the latest of the series, keeps those pages turning with anticipation.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|i like it. it does the job. I still hate waking up for work though.  thank you my alarm clock free.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly is a great story teller, however, his bent on making almost every storyline revolve around public corruption is getting a little tired.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wish they would add cave spiders, spider jockies, caves and endermen. The nether portal, flint and steel to creative mode. Ender dragons and a portal to the end. Villagers, revenes and villagers. Also mind carts and tracks.
B008PZ69T8|2.0|disappointed.  I heard this on PBS but I guess they only played the best selections.  will be more careful on next purchase.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like the game cause I play the original virtual city also but I don't like the fact that everything is so expensive in the game, its unreal!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This one of the best tap games because you can do more than just creating habitats. You can find your own animals and finally it makes sense to have food and etc.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|What a crazy ride. Very good movie, I guess you could call it a sleeper. I would highly recommend this movie.
B00846REIS|3.0|Given my 3 star rating I must emphasize that it as not that I didn't enjoy Bared to You. I did enjoy this book and I do believe that Sylvia Day is a talented author. However... I felt that this particular novel lacked originality and creativity. Like our modern day reality shows, Desperate Housewives of Orange County & Desperate Housewives of New York, I felt like I was reading 50 Shades of Grey in New York. There were to many similarities. Examples: Eva/Ana, Gideon Cross/Christian Grey (CG same initials reversed), richest/youngest entrepreneur where girl falls into his office, instead of blondes he prefers brunettes, Dom & sub, Eva is a only child with a mother who married multiple times and a dad farther away, Gideon has married parents with one brother and one sister. The list is almost endless. If you could plagiarize another author's originality and creativity, this one nailed it on the head.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Tom Selleck at his best. You can't go wrong with the Jesse Stone series of movies. We have them all.<br />I highly recommend this series.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Three words to describe this game. Amazing Awesome And Rocking. It is so much fun and it is very addicting
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is the best! you need to get it! I like how you can race your dragons once you buy the track( please note that you need to reach a specific level to get the track). I like trying to get all the dragons,and you would have to check your game a lot because there are limeted time dragons that only come out for awhile each year.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I like Vince Flynn (Mitch Rapp) and now I have a new character to follow. . .yea!  Can't wait to buy the next one in this series.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Bought for my husband for Christmas as he is a fan.  1st album was great but next 2 were not as good.  Seems someone picked the wrong songs for  Susan.  But this album takes full advantage of her wonderful voice again.  And the songs are right for her.

0792164903|3.0|I am afraid I did not get to see this movie, it was for my brother and he enjoyed it, so I guess it is a good movie but what ever I purchase from Amazon I have been very satisfied and even with the amount of time it is shipped to my home, thank you.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I am not nor have ever been a huge fan of Stephen King. I've enjoyed a few of his novel's, \\"On Writing, \\" and \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" come to mind but after \\"Christine,\\" \\"Carrie,\\" and \\"Salem's Lot,\\" I was done with his writing. Many years later a friend suggested \\"On Writing\\" and recently another suggested I would love 11/22/63. I don't like sci-fi, have no interest in time travel but I love history and am fascinated by the Kennedy family. I read this in just under two days. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I remembered the aspects of King's writing I do enjoy, characters you believe could be your neighbor, a sense you can see, hear, and smell the scenes he as he sets them. The sense where the reader is just behind Jake's shoulder watching the story unfold.<br /><br />I'm back Mr. King, and I believe I have a lot of catching up to do to read all of your previous works in a new frame of (open) mind. Bravo.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Entertaining read! Looking forward to reading the last book. The ending took me totally by surprise.<br />Will the rebellion succeed? Will Peeta survive? Hmm!
B005G4TJUC|1.0|The plot was terrible.  The acting was terrible.  The effects were as good as the other ones.  If you want to see pure action without any story, then enjoy.  Otherwise...it was a complete waste of time.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|AWESOME but it says you can play as a zombie it won't let me 4 stars until this is fixed .Awesome tho
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Not quite Hunt for Red October but worth reading if you are a Clancy fan...timely scenarios (2013) with Chinese cyber warfare theme
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I bought this game for my teenage daughters who enjoy the show as it recalls the well written and cartooned shows of their childhood. It is a cutesy and fun game. My daughters play it simply because it is cute and silly, with simple but fun games and a creative town building component.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I had a hard time caring about any of the characters in this movie.  It was OK for a red box rental, but not worth the $3.99 I spent to stream it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I borrowed the book from a friend who really liked it. Not my kind of story. Took a long time to get interested and understand all the flipping back and forth. Every other chapter is written by husband or wife and the wife's chapters are from the past so takes awhile to understand what is happening. Sure doesn't go the way you think it will. I was probably halfway thru book before I started to really enjoy, but ended pretty well.
1401937519|4.0|This is an interesting book, especially for those of us who  have experienced a lot of it.  Recommended!  You need a nice quiet reading place with no disturbances......................

0671027344|4.0|Our protagonist, Charlie is a Fifteen year old boy who writes letter's to \\"a friend\\" whom he's never met but heard some girls talk about at some point and decided oddly to pour his heart into this. I had hoped, actually, we'd learn these letters where actually a journal, it would have made more sense, much, more, sense.<br /><br />So, Charlie is a prodigy who begins the book with horrid grammar skills. I ignore the complaints about this, people think \\"genius\\" or \\"Gifted\\" is equatable with \\"perfect at everything\\" and that's not true. I've been labeled both those things thanks to test and being able to pass pretty much any class in school or college simply by turning up and handing in the work, but I still write letters and Amazon reviews strait from the unfiltered mind to the page and therefore grammar, spelling and homonyms attack and it doesn't make me or Charlie less smart, it just means that's not our skill set.<br /><br />Moving on, my main quip with the book is Charlies unrelenting Innocence. He's not a child of the 90's, he's a child of the 50's. So often I felt this was a period book taking place in the wrong period. Really, nothing of modern life except the music mentioned actually feels modern here, this book is old-fashion and horribly out of time, it's jarring and must be overlooked to enjoy the book. Charlie, at fifteen doesn't know what Masturbation is, but gets high and drunk with ease. We might attribute some of this with his childhood abuse, but, he has a fairly normal sexual relationship in the story (well, for a fifteen year old!) And he tends to narrate with such a \\"leave it to beaver\\" tone sometimes it's hard to imagine he's more than twelve.<br /><br />Having been a senior in 90-91 this is technically a story about my generation, after all, that's when his senior friends graduate, but they don't feel or act like the teenagers I knew, again, this feels more like a 50's movie than a 90's book.<br /><br />So what do I like here?<br /><br />The story is well paced, if not a bit overly brisk. The epistolary structure of the novel does lend itself to that, and there where times I wish it had gone a bit deeper. The feelings that Charlie conveys, the darkness of some of what goes on around him and to be honest I had to keep wondering if and when he would kill himself. What the book offers is an experience of someone's life and it does well at making you care about Charlie and Sam (his not-girl-friend senior girl-friend) and his family. I did want to keep picking it up and reading (and it's a short read) and I was still thinking about it after it was over.<br /><br />It's an affecting novel, you'll travel and think and feel with Charlie, you may not understand him and he might even piss-you-off a bit, but you're there. At the end I still didn't feel like Charlie was absolutely going to make it and \\"funeral for a wallflower\\" was in order for the sequel. After all, the only thing that brings Charlie out of his shell are his Senior friends who he basically never sees after they graduate and ending the book on a high-moment and a high-note are not the same thing. I keep thinking, \\"the next day Charlie felt all alone and isolated again with only the hope that in a few months his friends might visit for a holiday.\\" That just doesn't feel to hopeful to me.y is well paced, if not a bit overly brisk.

0812993357|5.0|This was like a good conversation. So full of wit and heart and honesty, with pithy and funny asides and some heart stopping tragedies. The era she evokes in London in the early Seventies was especially resonant for me as I ran around there a lot as a student. She brings it all back with clear eyes. The photographs were wonderful, her drawings disarmingly funny. It was all I could do to not turn right around when I finished it and begin it all over again.<br />She will just have to sit down and write another one, very soon.

1619695006|5.0|I finished this book several days ago and haven't been able to stop thinking about it.  A big reason for my enjoyment is the performance by Tom Hollander.  I must admit, I was disappointed to find that it wasn't read by Jim Dale, whose reading of the Harry Potter books was beyond compare.  But he wouldn't have been right for this book.  Tom does the voices and accents superbly, and really made me feel strongly for Rowling's characters.  Several scenes brought me to sobs.<br /><br />JK Rowling is a simply brilliant writer.  The interweaving of the lives in this community makes a fascinating tale.  And Rowling's strongest suit is creating characters you can really know, and who feel completely real.  I am sorry this book is over, I wanted to keep reading it forever.

B005IZLPME|5.0|I got this DVD combo set of &#34;Captain America&#34; for three reasons: 1) I needed to get a Christmas gift for my father, 2) This was the only movie in the Marvel series that I not seen, so far, and 3) This was the only movie that my father did not have in his collection.  He insisted he had it, but when I went through all of his DVDs (if bajillion could be a number, that's how many he has) and I could not find it.  I was kind of expecting an argument from him on Christmas morning about how he already has it, but I think even he has come to realize that he didn't and appreciated now having the complete collection.  Now, we're waiting to Thor 2 to come out into theatres.

B0026NBZDU|5.0|I first read this book in 2004, at a time when I was making a transition in my life from being a research scientist to a writer. I remember so clearly reading that first page. By the time I got to the words at the end of the first paragraph, I was hooked. Here is that first paragraph:<br /><br />\\"My name, in those days, was Susan Trinder. People called me Sue. I know the year I was born in, but for many years I did not know the date, and took my birthday at Christmas. I believe I am an orphan. My mother I know is daed. But I never saw her, she was nothing to me. I was Mrs. Sucksby's child if I was anyone's; and for father I had Mr. Ibbs, who kept the locksmith's shop, at Lant Street, in the Borough, near to the Thames.\\"<br /><br />In 89 words, Sarah Waters has given us such a complete feel for the world she is creating, the Victorian era of the early 1860s, that by the time one gets to the end of that first paragraph, one knows one is in the hands of a master.<br /><br />This novel has everything, sophisticated characterization, wonderful descriptions, heartbreak, treachery and great plot twists. Yes, one can see that Ms. Water's literary ancestors are Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins and the Bronte sisters, but she brings a fresh new voice, a sly modern take, on the preoccupations of those novelists. Five stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is the first time I read the novel written by Colleen Hoover.  I like her writting style and her looks into details that bring the story alive.  I enjoyed reading the first part very much and seem a bit not understand the character of Holder.  I love Sky,  she is lovely,  honest and smart.  I am a bit diasppointed on the 2nd part which is a bit slow moving. I'd more expect the ending could elaborate a bit more on the future of Sky such as how she is in college,  in work and even in marriage.  Overall, it's a good book to read.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|At the surface level, \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is a simple story of puppy love.  But there is far, far more going on beneath the surface.  The two puppy lovers are both troubled youths, and it is only through the inattentions and inactions of all the adults around them that they are able to create, ultimately, a life-or-death crisis.  To what extent are the kids responsible for their perceived failings?  Moonrise Kingdom presents a compelling case that the kids are alright and it is the adults who are screwed up.<br /><br />The stars of Moonrise Kingdom are the two twelve year-old lovers, portrayed by child actors Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward.  Both do a more-than-credible job, and will have you rooting for them to succeed on their attempted escape.  The main adult roles fall to Bruce Willis and Edward Norton, who turn in fine performances of somewhat stereotyped characters: the sleepy town police chief, and the by-the-book scoutmaster.  The roles of Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are not significant enough to showcase the talents of those two accomplished actors.<br /><br />The movie takes place in director Wes Anderson's picture postcard-perfect alternate universe, a visually striking place in which everything (even including kids' play areas) is perfectly ordered and ready to be photographed.  Even Kara Hayward's 12 year-old runaway girl somehow maintains her neatly applied eye shadow during the course of a multi-day outdoor excursion.  Similarly, all of the characters aside from the two lovers are simplified stereotypes: the government bureaucrat, the bully, the loyal dog, even the narrator with perfect diction.  Yet Moonrise Kingdom not only works, but it delivers some deep messages in a touching, humorous way that will capture the hearts of most audience members.<br /><br />Definitely recommended, for adults and families with older children.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book is great and fun! Do not compare book to the movie. You will be disappointed if you expect the movie to be just as good.
B0098VXHBG|4.0|Elles is a serious look at a specific aspect of modern day romantic life in the age of the internet and cellphones.  Juliette Binoche stars as a writer for Elle magazine researching (she thinks) an article on young college-age women who offer their services to men in order to obtain the money they need to live as something better than a starving student.  Binoche's character starts out aloof and almost sneering, with the stereotypical attitude the general public has towards these women, but as she gets to know them better she gets drawn to them and into their world, letting down her journalist's guard.  What elevates Elles far above a mere fictionalized documentary movie is when Binoche's character realizes that she is already part of this world.  Aside from one scene in which a character gets assaulted (which is most likely a fantasy, although it is not entirely clear), there are no real victims or perpetrators in Elles.  It is just what consenting adults do to satisfy their needs and survive the stresses of modern day life.<br /><br />The centerpiece of Elles by far is Juliette Binoche's character, and she gives a star performance.  Her character is not terribly attractive, and her face often shows the stresses of the life she leads as a busy working mom, but that is as it should be.  She is most appealing when she lets her hair down by getting tipsy with one of her interview subjects, and that scene is a pure joy.  The two college students, played by Anais Demoustier and Joanna Kulig, are near opposites in personality, body type and hair color, but each actress gives an intimately revealing portrayal.  The men and boys in Elles have much more minor roles, but are well played.  The casting and acting are spot-on, and speak to the care with which Elles was obviously made.  If this film ever gets remade as an American film with American actors, I doubt it will be anywhere near as good.<br /><br />The only thing that prevents me from giving Elles five stars is that it tries to do a bit much in a short amount of time.  There are many scenes and many significant events which rush forward to an ultimately satisfying conclusion.  I feel the film could have benefited from a slightly more languorous pace, which would have allowed time to more fully explore everything that happens.<br /><br />Elles is highly recommended for adults who aren't afraid to look behind the facade.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great show! So glad i started watching this show. im officially addicted now. so glad i decided to buy the first season.
B001NCPED2|2.0|I got this album in hopes that I was getting the original but it turned out to be the censored version. Apparently, the original version is marked as [Explicit]. I think the censored version should have [Censored] on it. In any case, be careful with your buy. If you want the original make sure it has [Explicit] in the title. The censoring makes it sound like a CD skipping and disrupts the songs entirely.<br /><br />Please note that the album itself is awesome. I just needed to replace the one that I lost. White Zombie rocks!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|What a perfect second season to follow a great first season. This show keeps you wanting more. i recommend this show to everyone. such great writing!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have trouble getting to sleep sometimes. The free version is great, but it doesn't let you close the app & keep the sounds going. So i felt the need to buy the premium version, and i have not regretted it since. Every night i'm having a panic attack or just need to relax & help me sleep, i set this to an hour timer and i'm usually asleep within 30 minutes. I also use the heart beat sound for newborn photography. It's better than having to go buy a heart beat monitor!
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Was a little disappointed with the lack of emphasis on the killer's character and motives. Reading 'The Leopard' currently and it seems to be building the character of the killer. I kinda like that
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|It was for a younger audience than I was aware of. Good for someone in their twenties. Not much depth for me. I guessed the outcome and many of the revelations well before author revealed them.

B00AMBLDEE|3.0|With a predictable plot and a sappy ending this addition to the Bourne series was rather disappointing. The writers and directors just didn't give Jeremy Renner much to work with.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|If you love Adele, you will really enjoy this DVD.It's a must have for Adele fans.  I've watched it several times, by myself and with friends.
B005S9EJ46|1.0|It would not play on my VIZIO BLU-RAY even after following the instructions on the packaging. Avery disappointing thing after the anticipation of seeing this film
B004EBT5CU|5.0|If you love Adele, this is a must have.  My son told me about her long before she became a household word and I fell in love with her voice.  Great song writing
B00A9X7X6C|3.0|This movie isn't great but it sure isn't bad eather. I had no problem watching this but its nothing I would end up watching over and over, once really is enough.

B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I downloaded this about a week ago. I do not like it. it tends to freeze up on my kindle and when it does decide to work it just isn't my kind of game. uninstalled.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|Good reading, Now I'm hooked on Baldacci and will have to get more of his novels.  If they are as good as this one I won't be able to put them down.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book was an easy read. It really held my interest and kept me trying to figure out how it would end.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Very well written, with engaging anecdotes, this book is as entertaining as it is useful to those of us who are looking to set positive habits.
B009X01FJS|2.0|I had a similar cover for my 7\\" Kindle Fire, and loved it. I expected this one to be like it for my 8.9\\" new Kindle Fire HD. It isn't. The back cover has a piece that is attached to the plastic hard cover that has a seam connecting the 2 pieces. No matter what you do, if you don't keep the item flat, the Kindle will flap around. I read in bed lots of times, and my head is lower than the Kindle. and I use the handy holder on the back of the front cover. That was fine on my old 7\\" cover, but this new one is made differently, and the heavier part of the cover with the Kindle attached just flaps open. They may say that it's due to the revolveable feature, but I think, for what they charge for it, it could have been done differently, or put some hook and loop on the back to keep it from flapping open when I'm laying on my back. I'm thinking of sending it back. There are many cheaper covers that will do as well.
B00884GR0W|4.0|Honestly? I didn't expect a bunch from a clear clone of MineCr*ft, but these people have actually done a respectable job. The GUI is a little rough, and there are quite a few graphical errors and bugs, but really it just reminds me of original PC MineCr*ft. This does a better job of getting MC to mobile than the actual Pocket Edition does, and that's kinda sad for Mojang. Like I said, it can be a bit frustrating at times, you'll place blocks you don't mean to trying to press the onscreen buttons, but man, if you have a tablet or a different way to get a keyboard and mouse hooked up, it makes for a well formed game in similar fashion to Minecr*ft, and also tries to add a few things MC should've had in the first place, in some cases. Try it for yourself, it was worth a try for me. Until Mojang picks up the slack on the Pocket Edition, this is where I go for my mobile MC fix.<br /><br />-Alec Hart
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so gripping that I went to work on only 3 hours sleep - I just could not put it down!  The way the plot twisted and turned so unpredictably was fantastic gripping me to the end.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved everything about this book. A must read for those who have loved a dog. I could not put it down.
B002C949AE|5.0|This book was amazing.  I can't stop talking about it.  Waris Dirie's journey from a Somali Nomad where she lived a one with nature and had not experienced man made things to becoming a model and flying all over the world is the most incredible story.  I was both entertained and educated by this amazing book. I  highly recommend it.
B005G5PPGS|3.0|It was very interesting to read how a small market team can with good management play with the rich teams and win.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|great time management game. one that I enjoy the spirit of competition with against my daughter to see who can get the highest score with each board lol. I purchased two games so we can play side by side and if that doesn't speak about a game being good idk what does.....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks has such a way of presenting real feelings of fear and love while telling a great story.  The redemptive quality of learning to trust and be part of a caring community is uplifting while an under lying suspense is always present.
B001AT4Y84|5.0|I like the terminator trilogy.  It is fun to watch.  I really do love it.  It is one of the best movie sagas.
0805090665|5.0|My Nephews Really Loved This Book.  They Wanted Me To Read It To Them Everyday & Night.  It Was A Great Chilren's Book.  Thank You.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I found this book an odd combination of predictable plot twists and flights of fancy that barely took wing.  The subplots tended to be either trivial such as the involvement of D'Agosta and his girl friend, or obvious attempts to keep a popular character involved, such as that involving Corrie Swanson and her father.  This latter may be a &#34;pilot&#34; for a new book.  If so and the authors intend to write more Pendergast I hope they pay more attention to regaining the form that made the earlier books so strong.  Fans of Pendergast need to read this book for closure of this story-line and many may think more of it than I did.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This was an amazing book, I enjoyed it so much! I really can not wait to read the next one!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Its sooooooooooooo funny!!!!  But its adult content all the way!  The bear is more adult than Wahlberg, and uses worse language!  Great to see Flash again!  The old 80s stuff is great to remember.  Lots of fun.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It might be hard to say you love this show but it certainly holds my interest and keeps me coming back for more!  The twists and turns are never boring!!!!  Cannot wait to see what is coming next!!!
0316236535|5.0|I read this to pre-k children at work. They can't get enough of this book! It empowers young children not to be afraid. This is a book for your collection! Buy this!
0300179553|5.0|My wife is the expert. I couldn't possibly keep up but at least I can talk about the photos I see. She loves the visualization and I love asking question about the photos I see. I think they do a tremendous job keeping the informed and non-informed literate. I always will buy the books from the Met. Outstanding art.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the book it is better than the rest of the series great job I love it so much
B001F4UHGC|4.0|The car chase we all remember. Except I thought I recalled the Charger losing at least 5 hubcaps during the chase. This version appears to have some visible cuts. Now only one hubcap gets lost. Oh well.<br /><br />The story is still good. The bad guys are bad and the good guys, well, not always so good. Robert Vaughn is convincingly detestable. Look for a young Robert Duvall as a cabbie.<br /><br />The Mustang still sounds great!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Fun to play and easy for my kids to play without needing my help. A lot of boards to be a free app and addicting cause you want to win each level.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|My first e-reader read. Love reading it while I am on my elliptical exerciser. He knows how to involve the reader. I think I always get a few more minutes in thanks to his wonderful style of writing.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|&#34;Sweet Tooth&#34; is not up to par with McEwan's writing.  Atonement was special and unforgettable.  Hew needs to return to his previous prose style

B006CQLGXG|5.0|The dialect may seem a bit dated, but this short novel could easily become a classic!  I might even read it again next December.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|Was just ok.  Did not measure up to the films in this series. The actors had no real chemistry and the plot was not very good.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I laughed my tail off... great film for those with an open mind. If you've ever made a bad decision you'll appreciate the story line.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|We have been watching this movie for years and now we have it on Blue Ray DVD.  Absolutely love it!  Great for both kids and has some subtle adult humor that keeps you coming back.
B007Q0OV6Q|2.0|This set is just a bunch of Star Wars stuff thrown together. NOT as good as years past when there was some semblance of a holiday/Christmas theme.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It does take a long time to get more coins..other than that, it's good time waster! Wonder how many people other than me have shaken their kindle to try and make the coins fall?! lol
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome, love this game. This game keeps my kids,and myself occupied for hours n hours. Very addicting fun. I GIVE THIS FIVE STARS
B00280LYIC|5.0|The Lightning Their is the first of a five book series (there is also another series about the same people, with new characters introduced) and it tells about twelve-year-old Percy Jackson and his friends, Grover Underwood, a satyr, and Annabeth Chase. Annabeth Chase and Percy Jackson are both Half-bloods, or demigods. Half Greek god human. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but I will also say that if you think watching the movie (same titlitle, by the way )  then you are wrong, since the movie only basically follows the storyline of the book. I recommend reading the book, because the movie is great and everything, but it is a different experience. Or you could read the book and watch the movie. They are both great. :) Thanks for reading this opinion! I am a huge fan of PJO, but my favorite book in this series is The Sea Of Monsters. The second one. By the way, this review was by Susan Baxter. :) Again, thanks for reading!<br /> (\_(\<br />(=','=)<br />,(\\")(\\")
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This is not so much a review as a recommendation.  This book is a page-turner and much more than a romance.  The reader encounters ethical questions, a bit of mystery (I did not know how it ended before I read it.), and a message for women about seeking education under less-than-ideal circumstances.  I like quirky, unpredictable novels like those of Ann Tyler and John Irving.  While this book was not on the same level as the books of those two authors, I enjoyed it and recommend it to readers looking for something a bit unusual and thought-provoking.
B0044LHN0G|5.0|vyctorynotes.blogspot.com says:<br />The film is well worth it to view.  The acting was wonderful.  The film is based on a true story.  The book was good, too.  The soundtrack is wonderful.  I think you will like John Williams' pieces.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book had me from chapter one. James dashner has an amazingly wonderful imagination. The world he makes and the characters are masterfully done . I will definitely recommend<br />This my friends and even strangers :)
B005HSL626|4.0|this was the first game i got on my kindle fire. i have to say that i enjoyed it. it is fun to try and beat your high scores, and the different game modes are nice. after hours of playing though, it started to get a bit repetative, but that's just my opinion, and it is still a very fun game.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Couldn't put it down.. That's all I've got to say on the subject. I also like B sci fi too
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I definatly enjoyed this app for the 15 minutes I had it lol. for those of you who are having trouble with the controls, there is an option to change them to ones similar to minecraft pe and block story. the graphics were very good for this type of game. I would have liked to give more details on the items tools ect. but I was only able to try out a few before the time ran out.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Upon watching this movie I felt that it started out to be alright, not like the original with Sylvester Stallone. As the movie has progressed it seemed it was not focused on Judge Dredd, it was primarily focused on his rookie the psychic. I wont go into detail, but I would anticipate a sequel to this movie given that they introduced the psychic and now that she has been deemed a Judge her journey now begins.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Exhausting in a good way.  I made the trip with these characters in this book. It was a good read

B00884GR0W|5.0|At first I thought this game was a rip off minecraft. I didn't buy this but it came out free so I said what the heck. When I started playing I was amazed. This game I think is better than minecraft. If you love minecraft I highly suggest this game.

B00AHGH6XQ|3.0|DVD Details<br />Disc 1 : The Movie (with Language options) WARNING, does not include the lone Bruce Wayne featurette that's on the single disc edition. No, it doesn't state on the box that it does, I'd just assumed this set would have everything the single dvd has.<br /><br />Disc 2 : Batmobile Featurette (really cool) and Ending the Knight Featurette (not watched yet). Box says \\"and more\\" which I thought would be the Bruce Wayne featurette. There is no \\"and more\\". Well, at least we get two (and maybe the best) featurettes from the blu-ray, and don't have to convert from our standard definition format. Of course they could've add more for the price of this 2-Disc (which is more like a bonus disc), but It's still great to have a 2-Disc edition of this movie available for others like me who don't own (or want) blu-ray players, but still want the special features which I feel should be available in standard format anyway.<br /><br />Update: The Blockbuster rental copy of The Dark Knight Rises does NOT have the Bruce Wayne Featurette that's included on the retail version. So It's just like the one manufactured by money grubbing Warner Bros. for the 2-Disc edition except it has a gray color insteady of the black found on the 2-disc, and Trilogy sets. Note: The Dark Knight Rises included in the standard definition Trilogy set DOES have the Bruce Wayne Featurette, but none of the other films have any. The box says it includes bonus content from all three films, which is actually just a booklet and one featurette, a detail that could've helped alot of their customers who were looking for the movie or set best for them. While it clearly appears that Warner Bros. doesn't care about their customers, I'd like to think of the inclusion of the Bruce Wayne featurette on the standard edition single disc is baby step in the right direction.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Excellent book. Did not give it 5 stars as I would have enjoyed a little more character development through the different stages of the outbreak. Toward the end, it dragged a bit and this would not have been this issue had he developed the characters a bit more for the reader.
0765325950|3.0|Long about volume 5 I told everyone either Jordan or I would die before it was finished. Well, guess what? I think the story died before he did.  The 14(long) volumes could have been condensed to about 5, or even 3, and told the story better.  The &#34;grande finale&#34; chopped a lot of sub lines, forgot others, betrayed characterizations and in general, pulled it out of the azz. Can't really blame Sanderson, I don't think Jordan knew where he was going that's why he kept rambling and maybe why he didn't want it finished - embarrassment.  I hope his widow lives well off the proceeds.  I have a horrible suspicion that there will be sequels.  Let's hope the True Power consumes all involved and buries them somewhere at the other end of the Wheel so at least the present won't have to endure that. D. A. Duvall
B0086700CM|1.0|I hate this game.  once you get the game your like ok now what.  if u have temple run get subway sufers its more fun and really addicting.  with subway surfers you don't have to move your screen you don't have to turn your character all you do is collect coins and make sure the inspector doesn't catch u.  by the way I forgot to mention that subway surfers gives you a lot more coins than temple run.
B0086700CM|5.0|the controls worked fine on my kindle fire. even when you have to tilt. all my friends already had this on their ipods when I got it. fun and addicting but a little challenging. I don't know what people are talking about when they say its not fun or the controls don't work right. just a perfect app that both me my family and my friends all love.

0765325950|4.0|So to sum it all up, I loved the treatment of Rand, Mat, and Perrin. I enjoyed the many events that furthered the plot. I felt the ending to the series was a satisfying set of events. I felt very disappointed in the final treatments of several major characters. I felt cheated by the thin understanding provided of Shara and it's leader.<br /><br />Sanderson is a brilliant writer (loved the Mist trilogy). And he did a good job of finishing an epic series from the notes of a previous author.<br /><br />However, sometimes I felt as if he was writing an extended outline of the major events planned by Jordan to end the series. The plot events were usually satisfying, but the sometimes the character developments were just two dimensional.<br /><br />For example, Thom gets all of about six pages in the entire last book, as does Padin Fain. In addition Nyaneve and Moraine are just cardboard characters used to further the plot. Their roles are major, but their dialogue and character development were sorely lacking.<br /><br />There was extensive narrative dedicated to the details of all of the battles.<br /><br />Yet I can't imagine that Jordan had planned to spring the Sharan on us in the last book. I would have to believe that he had hundreds of pages of ideas about the history of the Sharan's and how their leader came into power.<br /><br />In summary, here is how I would rate the character endings (and by endings I don't mean deaths, I just mean the endings written for each character).<br /><br />Rand was well covered and Rand's ending was very satisfying. This was probably the most satisfying part of the last book to me.<br /><br />Perrin and Mat were well covered and their endings were satisfying.<br /><br />Thom was a mere outline of his former self. He only existed to perform basically one event. Beyond that he was hardly mentioned. And Thom was a major well beloved character to many of us who grew up with the WOT. He deserved more coverage.<br /><br />Moraine was a cardboard cut out. Both in this book and the previous book when she was rescued from the tower. Very, very disappointed with the life (rebirth) given to Moraine. She was a major well beloved character that we spent years getting to know. She deserved better.<br /><br />I don't know what happened to Padin Fain. Even Jordan lost track of that guy. I was, at one time, heavily invested in his intense hunt for Rand. Unfortunately, this last book only gave Fain about five or six pages. And I could almost hear Sanderson thinking \\"Shoot, I need to get Jordan's plan for Fain in here pretty quick because I'm already on page 900.)<br /><br />Egwene was well covered and her ending was very satisfying.<br /><br />Elayne was covered well enough; as were Avenhida and Min. Once again though, if Jordan had continued writing I suspect that we would have been rewarded with more insight into their on-going relationships with Rand.<br /><br />The forsaken were covered well enough and their endings were satisfying. However, to me the most interesting forsaken was Asmodean; and I always hoped he would return in some way or another (in more than a possible obscure hint).<br /><br />The Dark One revelations were a little weak. But satisfying enough in the end. I felt as if Sanderson used this as an opportunity to espouse a bit more of his own religious philosophy than perhaps Jordan would have. But, who knows?<br /><br />All in all, I am happy the series is finished! After reading these last three books I believe that Jordan probably intended to write more than three books to complete the series. I am not sure if I would have liked to buy another 10 books to find out the ending however. And Sanderson did an excellent job of cramming ten books into three!<br /><br />Note to Sanderson: Please continue the Alloy of Law series. First rate!!!!
B000NY12LO|5.0|In the light of todays news this book is very timely. Piccoult can make you care as much for the bullied shooter as for the victims. Excellent story!
B009JBZH54|5.0|You cannot find a whole lot of action movies with an actual plot nowadays. I usually rent movies on Redbox / Netflix but I love this trilogy so much I bought this collection. Should spend time to watch the special features as well! High recommended.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Discovered this Christmas movie in the '70's.  It was not known by my generation when we grew up in the '50s and '60s.  I remember how surprised I was to discover it as an adult and always wondered why Hollywood in it's infinate  wisdom kept it from our generation.  It's worth a look every year.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a wonderful book to read. The pain ,love and strength of the characters seems to flow so well throughout the book. Couldn't put it down.  A must read.
0071766588|5.0|English is not my first language, but i am so satisfied about this book. nice book. but the shortage is no speaking test.
B002M9WW30|5.0|\\"I received this item on time and in great condition. What was I doing between 1976-1990? WATCHING ROCKY!!! Movies. I loved all of them. Greatest story since \\"Roots\\". I love the Rocky series especially since I can now watch it in Blu-ray. Watched all in 3 nights-brought back some memories. Get this set if you like \\"Rocky\\".\\"
B009329ZF2|3.0|Okay, I had fun watching this film as improbable as some of the situations were.<br />It is a typical alien invasion story, but I enjoyed blowing stuff up and kicking bad guy butt.<br />Rihanna surprised me. I enjoyed her acting outside of the sex kitty thing her music career<br />seems to have her locked in. I think with some quality coaching she might have a career on screen<br />as well as music if she wanted.
B000JJRIO8|5.0|IVE ORDERED FROM HERE B4 N WAS PLEASED BUT THIS TIME I GOT MY PACKAGE N IT HAD MY NAME N OR CURRENT RESIDENT. THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP BUT OTHER THAN THAT I LOVE THIS COMPANY N WILL ORDER AGAIN. BUT PLEASE FIX THE MAILING PROBLEM. THANKS.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|I liked the first one better. This had too many of the cliche moments I have come to hate.<br />Especially the obvious fate of the fresh faced rookie. damn that pissed me off.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|I got this movie for my grandaughter for christmas, We had watched it on Netfilix & she loved it soooo much I decided to get it for her! She's 3 & watches it 3-4 times a day. So far we have not got tired of it. It is truly a cute movie.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|This movie is really carried along by the special effects. Sam Worthington is alright, but the 'gods' look ridiculous in their wigs and costumes most times.<br />I was into the hero just fine, but I thought they should have picked character actors for many of the roles of the gods. Okay, look I just couldn't believe Liam was Zeus, okay? Just no.<br />I loved Pegasus though, he was stunning. ;)
0307577589|4.0|The CD's were in good condition as promised.  I would recommend buying used if your funds are low. You will get a good product.
B0098460O4|5.0|I was so very happy for this album. Jonathan and Charlotte are beautiful voices and its a pleasure to listen anytime I desire.<br />I understand some were unhappy with the sound quality, but I was pleased to hear both voices blending together.<br />Jonathan learned to power 'down' his wonderful voice so he and Charlotte could mesh better. I appreciate it.<br />I would love to have another album. I think they are awesome.<br />I know there careers will take them on separate paths one day, but they will surely continue to entertain us.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Joe Walsh...  Analog Man....What a great CD!!!! again, A GREAT PURCHASE FROM AMAZON! Love the new \\"sober\\" Joe Walsh! I hope he comes to CT on tour with the new CD, I will go see him! I love the song  \\"One Day At A Time\\". It has HIT written all over it! Having a brother who is recovering...I play this song, a lot, when he's around...  The song \\"Family\\" is wonderful. ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT! GOD BLESS, Best of love and luck Joe...its about time!  Fantastic CD, Great to have you Back!!!!! CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU TOUR!  KIM
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Johnny Depp and the cast were fantastic.<br />I was throughly into the film until they threw in an event which gave away the ending of the film.<br />I'm sure you will see it and it rather made me want to fast forward to get it over with.<br />But, as I mentioned this is the fault of writers and production team, not the actors. They were great.
B008CLI4N4|3.0|No movie is ever as good as the book but they have done a good job with the characters.  Cool opening sequence.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I gave this film 5 stars because the two lead actors were so intuned with each other it was no leap to imagine they were one and the same person.<br />The storyline maybe simple and even cliched to some nitpickers, but the ultimate goal to close that loop rested on the characters not on technology. The need to 'see' clearly and take the appropriate actions, reflected the real life experience of making mistakes and repeating them over and over until you take correct action.<br />I thought it beautifully filmed and the clues to the necessary answer right up front if you were willing to look with unbiased eye.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a very good game. You really get your moneys worth since there are 48 levels to play. It keeps you on the edge of your seat right up till the end. I loved this game. I have played nearly all of the HO games that Amazon has to offer and this game ranks up at the top. Worth every penny!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I didn't see this in the theaters and kind of regret that now. For a Saturday afternoon popcorn film it was much better than expected and that includes acting.<br />I had an enjoyable time and really thought a sequel would be nice, as I wanted to know what happened after.<br />If you are looking for parables or social commentary go somewhere else. Like I said, for fun.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Without knowing entirely what to expect, we were pleasantly surprised to find that this movie had depth and challenging human emotion on top of the fun sci-fi hook it is billed with. In fact, the movie eschewed the details of the futuristic plot hook to focus on moral delimmas. My wife and I both loved it and would highly recommend it.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Oh I loved it.  Much, much better than the second one.<br />The acting was spot on and the effects were great. My only complaint is I wanted them to ride the cycles more. I loved those!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Can't even get started to try this game.  Keeps on saying that I have to buy coins. .  Do you have to buy coins in order to play?
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Terrible, terrible movie. What's with all the 'cute' catch phrases uttered by cat woman, the cop, and everyone else? This movie is so packed full of hollywood cliches I couldn't stand it.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Do not quite understand how to move this pac-man or play the game.  I really do not know how to move this game in order to play it.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book wasn't like I thought it would be . It kept me turning pages, couldn't put it down ,
B005HSL626|5.0|I simply love this game.  It is very simple and easy to play.  My grand daughter is crazy over this game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me guessing. Great author. Plan on reading other books by the author.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|This was an okay sequel to the original musical. Had some great musical numbers, but I HATED the ending! ALW, why did you have to do this to your devoted Phans? WHY?! \\"The Beauty Underneath\\" rocked!
0765325950|5.0|I'll do my best not to spoil anything/stick to general statements.<br /><br />I figure that some people will be disappointed, but there's no satisfying everyone with a story this large and complicated. However, I do feel that this was a strong conclusion to the series. Many of the plot threads are brought to a close or resolution, and each of the main characters has a chance to play a critical role in the action.(I do wish we could get smaller ending stories showing what happens off in the future, but I figure Sanderson is probably finished with this job for now at least. :)<br /><br />I did occasionally get a bit bogged down with the battle scenes, but, really -- what could we expect from this book? It basically just told me when I needed to take a break from reading. Though the tone gets pretty dark, moments of humor keep it from being too overwhelming.<br /><br />There are a lot of twists and surprises, and it's an impressive finish. I'm definitely not disappointed (except that niggling bit in the back of my mind that's sad any time a series this good is done). Kudos to Sanderson and Mrs. Jordan for finishing the rest and giving us an ending, period.<br /><br />*Possible minor spoiler*<br /><br />If you're someone who can't stand any of your loved characters dying, steel yourself. Not everyone gets a free pass in this book to the end.<br /><br />*End spoiler*
0061997811|5.0|This tells you a lot about the movies and the people who made them possible. I enjoyed hearing all the different actors reactions to when they got the part. The pull-out stuff was the best!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was so much fun to read!  The pages just flew by.  I was a teenager in 1959 and this book brought back so many memories.  It is not typical Steven King and just shows what a great writer he is.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I totally enjoyed all of the Bourne series. It was intriguing to say the least. The movie captures the imagination and allows one to visually escape reality, while presenting a theatrical view of a side of life which is interesting but the average person will never be involved in!! Just a real feel good movie which provokes thought!!!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This is a light, fun book to read although the technique of going back and forth in time was somewhat confusing..  Our book club all enjoyed it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I was traveling overseas and this game kept me entertained for hours on my flight.  Great graphics.  Puzzles are fun and not complex.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I am a lawyer and usually do not like books about lawyers or lawyering.  Here, I found all of the descriptions, trial tactics and techniques to be right on.  The story line was so good and the book very well written.  It was at times horrifying to read which does not detract from what a good book this is.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its a funny game to play wile waiting at the doctor offices.not hard to move through the game with out money. I give it 5 stars
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book.  When I wasn't reading it, it kept calling to me to pick it up.  Why can't all books be this compelling?
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Made me laugh, made me cry, and most of all made me miss my old friend very much. A great quick, feel good read.
B00338QENI|3.0|I am glad that I read this book and understand what happened.  There were parts that I just skimmed because I thought it got too bogged down in unnecessary details.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very good book. Kept you guessing the whole time. It has some good twist in it. I would definitely read it again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The sweetest story I've ever read. Make sure you have a box of Kleenex for this book. A must read!
B00A757EFW|4.0|Just like the original pac-man.  Love that part of it.<br /><br />The only negative thing is that the thumb control doesn't feel very responsive.  It's just not the same as the joystick on the arcade versions.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My 10- and 12-year-olds think this is really, really hard and really, really fun. They sit on the couch and try it over and over again. They've gotten to level 23 and are compelled to keep trying to get into the 100s.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Reminding yourself (and the author does a great job of this) that the author comes from a heavy duty science background makes the &#34;proof&#34; even more compelling.  My only wish was that it had one more chapter in it. I felt like it ended a bit abruptly without telling us about his assimilation back into the &#34;real&#34; world.
B003Y5D776|5.0|I got this for a friend who had her audio card take  a dive. She has the low profile type and she was looking at spending close to $100 to fix the sound. I got her this for  a song, no pun intended, and it works perfect...
B004U52VPS|5.0|Kids just love these. Great price and hours of fun for the boys. They love playing with them so much.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I've been a fan of AB since watching No Reservations on Travel Channel.  I had no idea what his background was and it's pretty fascinating.  The drugs are incidental.  The coming up through the ranks and the succession of messy jobs in kitchens all over Manhattan is what makes this such a great read.  Not the mention the professional tips for making your own cooking experience at home more fun and skilled.  Plus, I will take his advice and never order fish in a restaurant on a Monday night.
1451695187|3.0|I e'mailed the author as we had something in common but he did not reply, so not read the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book will keep you at the edge of your seat, wondering what's going to happen next. Hoping for the best for Katniss and Peeta but fearing the worst.<br /><br />It will keep you engaged until the end, leaving you wanting to run to read the final book in the trilogy.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|looks good on my Kindle fire and HTC Ego.  My 7 yr old loves it too.  Two player now has option to face each other or pass back and forth.
B000VK99Z6|3.0|Simon Pegg is one of my favorite comedic afters, and I would love to give this movie 5 stars.  However, the &#34;slasher movie&#34; aspect of Hot Fuzz was a real turn-off for me.  Otherwise, it was hilarious.
B002BWQ6H6|2.0|I had to force myself to finish this book (was a choice of my book club so I did read it all).  Don't know whether it was because he wrote too well (made me feel I was immersed in the savage world of characters living on the edge of existence) or not well enough.  There were so many points of view from which the story was told that it was a little disorienting because new chapters might shift suddenly to a different character. He's a well-regarded author, but I wouldn't choose another book by him.
B007V4530A|3.0|I'm using this text in a university-level course on TED-style presentations. While the content's pretty solid (if very straightforward), the style's a bit off-putting. Worse, though, is the prose. Donovan's a pretty terrible writer (one hopes he comes across better in person than in writing), and the book's poorly copy-edited—for example, Steve Jobs didn't ever give a commencement address at Stamford University.<br /><br />If you're looking for presentation basics in a digestible format, this is fine (and the price is right, too!). Just don't expect amazing writing.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this App I can't imagine not having this I have it on all my phone, computer, tablet, reader Love it
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|not bad for a free app. graphics aren't bad either. has a story line. keeps the game more interesting. keep up the good work G5.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love this App I can't imagine not having this I have it on all my phone, computer, tablet, reader Love it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm not what you'd call a reader, I type that after a week and a half I'm settled into the couch... kindle full of fifty shades, glass of wine, plus classical music channel playing. Needless to say I love these books on to fifty shades freed!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it left me wanting more was more books. it kept me wanting more. I Love it very much
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|Criterion once again presents a movie unjustly treated upon release in a beautiful edition.  Great image quality and a fascinating movie.  It's slow, yes, but don't expect a fast-paced traditional Western and you should appreciate it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love Kindle I can't imagine not having Kindle I have it on all my phone, computer, tablet, reader Love it
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I have had nothing with problems with them, I have itunes have loaded all their crap contacted them on 2 different dvds and they still don't work and they don't want to help.  Their product is garbage do not buy their product if at all possible!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it left me wanting more was more books. it kept me wanting more. I Love it very much
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie was great, funny and entertaining.  I saw it in 2D but it's even better in 3d!<br />I'm glad I purchased it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book seriously made me cry!  Excellent read and I highly recommend. Wonderful story of forgiveness and love!  Holder was a true hero in this book
B008OOYALE|5.0|Okay this game is awesome and its so cute and fun .....but the requirement of Wi-Fi access is pretty. High and it will not load unless u have a excellent signal other than that great game add me ~Marissaandkeyera12345678910
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Guess I'm the last person on the planet to have finally seen this movie and only because my brother was raving about how good it was. For me it was no Les Miserables'  (2012) version but a close second. I could not believe Emmy Rossum was only 18 when she made the movie or Gerard Butler played the Phantom - he sings, who knew?!<br /><br />I was invested in the characters from the very beginning and actually watched it twice.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is the first Picoult book. Really enjoyed her wimroting style! The storyline is good, definetly didn't want to put it down. Sad, but not a tear-jerker.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|My gosh this movie was so good we watched it twice! It came highly recommended and the story line was interesting to me to begin with. It was based on fact and had a really good cast of actors. I had to change my view of Shia after this movie. I also highly recommend this movie - rather violent but not for the sake of gore.
0739358049|5.0|This book is very well read which made the story even more enjoyable and easy to follow.  It arrived quickly and was well packaged, and well priced.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|I noted the critics gave the movie less than stellar reviews but my granddaughter wanted to see it and I really enjoyed it. I'd really give it 3 and a half stars. I was never bored and it stuck to the previous movies, it was nice seeing the same characters.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I will be sad if this is really the last Dark Knight movie!!  I think that it was great, made for a fun movie night!
1451688091|5.0|I wanted to read this after seeing the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34;.  It was very well written and had information I never knew.  I recommend it highly.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Enjoyed the style of writing, unpredictable yet romantic. Detective work was entertaining as well  and enjoyed linking to TV series.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|by the trailer of the movie, it looked interesting to me.<br />I watched it and more than satisfied. I an going to purchase<br />this movie. It was'nt terrifying, but very good and interesting .<br />I really enjoy the movie. Max Theriot was very good, and the rest<br />of the cast pleasing also. Well worth the time
0307592731|4.0|I think I already reviewed this. It is well written and an interesting story, but there are a lot of things unanswered, like why her backpack had to be so huge and why was it so easy for her to move on from bad stuff like heroin but yet be so stuck on her grief for her mother.
B008M34INW|4.0|Not the best Gibson movie, but different plot and entertaining.  Cute savvy kid steals the show but definitely forgettable.  Gibson is looking old here.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This is easy and fun reading. There are very few, I mean very few of Grisham's usual story telling ingredients . He is getting used to telling us do not expect any reality check just believe in me. I am not sure if it is all him or publishers that push these authors to assembly line prosecution. Or may be their expensive life style. Anyway, if you dispense with serious thinking, this is a good story when you are on thread mill.
B00957T6X6|5.0|These books are amazing, and the bundle is a great deal. He is a wonderful writer and I can't wait for the 6th book to come out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Geatest website since facebook!! Really addicting!! I cant get enough of it. Everyday I'm on Pinerest!! Its a great way to express yourself!!
0765325950|4.0|Not sure why I am bothering to leave a review here.  If you're starting the series for the first time with this book, well, you should frankly have your head examined, because there's no way in hell you have a chance of ever understanding it.  If you're a hardcore fan, you're probably already reading this book, or done with this book by this time.<br /><br />Put simply:  fantastic close to the series by Sanderson.  I've been reading this series for 15 years now....and until the last 3 or 4 books I reread the entire series before each book came out again.  He didn't tie up every loose end, but he tied up a whole heck of a lot of them, and Brandon should be proud of the work he did with the series.  The last 3 books were much, much better than 7-11, and the climax is somewhat of a cross between the end of Harry Potter and the Return of the King in terms of emotional impact, scale, and power.<br /><br />Very well done book.  The only reason I didn't leave a 5 star review is the ridiculous kindle policy by the author of forcing me to buy the hardcover or wait 3 months.  Tor books can bite me on this one.  I forgot how annoying it was to hold a 5+ pound book for hours on end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book, but an ending I did not expect. Should have known she would end up with him. May the odds be ever in your favor
B005XN31LY|3.0|I like the way the fairy tale characters are connected. Keeps you thinking. Not sure I'll watch the series but a couple were pretty good shows.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I read this trilogy in a 4 day time period.  I enjoyed the plot and writing style.  I had a hard time putting down the kindle to go to bed at night because I wanted to keep reading.  The first book was definitely my favorite.
B00979CS50|4.0|Another great album from Mr. young, Can't really compare to Weld & Arc or other masterpieces from him, but one of his best lately.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I read this trilogy in a 4 day time period.  I enjoyed the plot and writing style.  I had a hard time putting down the kindle to go to bed at night because I wanted to keep reading.  I was a little disappointed in the ending.  I felt like it just stopped and didn't wrap up completely, but it wouldn't keep me from recommending this book to others.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Some of the best music to come from Mr. Dylan lately. With such a catalog of masterpieces this almost fits in.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|I read this trilogy in a 4 day time period.  I enjoyed the plot and writing style.  I had a hard time putting down the kindle to go to bed at night because I wanted to keep reading. I would recommend this trilogy to others for a simple pleasure reading.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A great first novel, could not put it down... only 1 issues with it and that is the last 3rd seems to be rushed through but apart from that fantastic... looking forward to Tower Lord
B005BDZQKU|3.0|The packaging for this particular West Side Story collection is wonderful and quite well assembled, BUT the media contents contained on all 4 discs fall short of spectacular and rob the film of its full glory. Prior to owning this collection I've seen West Side Story many times both recently at an old Hollywood movie theater which featured the original master print and original in theater audio system. I also have a previous DVD release. Having seen how the film is supposed to be presented, here's where the bluray falls Short: 1st, the  intro fades to black before revealing the New York Skyline. It's supposed to transition to blue and then red as it fades into the view of New York. SECONDLY, although the high definition remastering is immaculate and clear, the colors used in West Side Story no longer pop! THIRDLY, anyone that's seen West Side Story at a movie theater knows that the original film print of it contains a 15 minute intermission card which has a soundtrack score of beautiful sweeping music. Eventhough previous West Side home video releases didn't contain the segment in any duration, I'm sure Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim would not be thrilled to know that their gorgeous intermission was edited down to only a few seconds! One would think that for a 50th anniversary bluray release the entire segment would be featured! At least, that's what I expected and hoped for! When I had the in theater experience everyone enjoyed the intermission segment which came as an unexpected surprise to those of us who grew up seeing the film on home video. It's music is breathtakingly gorgeous! Why doesn't the bluray have that entire segment??? ALSO, this collection is missing 50th anniversary media!!! The Special features Blu-Ray contains a documentary that was made back in 2001 for West Sides 40th anniversary release, AND it doesn't contain any interview footage of George Chakiris. It contains everyone else but him, and I know George would've appeared in the 50th anniversary documentary if one were to have been made! I had the honor of recently seeing him at a local Westside Story film showing where he was interviewed! Why is the documentary SOOO old, and why isn't George in it??? It seems MGM was cutting corners to save a few bucks, and this fan is not happy with the result! This particular set also includes a pathetic 8 track musical tribute CD which in my opinion could've been done much better simply because through the years scores upon scores of celebrities have covered this movies music!! What a disappointment! A much better tribute CD was already done back in the 1990s! MGM could've at least remastered that and included the original soundtrack plus bonus remixes to bring it new life!! So sad! I've not viewed the DVD version contained in this set. Having a DVD in a bluray set seems pointlessness to me.
B002VBV1S6|5.0|This book was just awesome, from the character development to the one liners through out just a very fun (albeit) very dark novel with the right blend of humour and brutality.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Love this set and absolutely love Spartucus! It made me subscripe to Showtime all over again just so i can keep with the show!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I always loved the series and watched the cut version on tv after the series ended on HBO.  However, by having the DVDs it is like watching the show for the first time without the cut out versions they show on tv.  This show is one of my all time favorites and I am glad I finally purchased the set so I can watch it anytime I want.  If you are a Sex & City fan I recommed ordering the full series.  I did have some problems with the DVDs.  The first time I watched some of the shows the DVD acted up (pixals were jumpy and the show would stop), however,  I watched them again and they worked fine.  I still have not watched the whole series, but so far I've had no other problems with the DVDs.  I ordered the series in December, a Christmas present to myself.
B007YNBOJM|3.0|The ears were cute and worked well with emotions like happy and sad. Unfortunately i think this is just a phase because I don't see my daughter messing with it anymore after Christmas. So definitely don't see this going as a trend especially for the price it wants. Thanks.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love this dictionary app on my kindle fire this thing goes faster than my phone dictionary . Who else like this app? I know I do.
6305212112|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and each time I see it I enjoy it more.  The acting is superb and the story is handled gently and lovingly.  A great movie to see again and again.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a decent game that occupies time but it gets old and boring after a while since all you do is tap a screen and nothing to REALLY do.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|As a long time Baldacci fan I was not disappointed.<br />This is a new character and situation but, drew me in to the chase as I cared about the characters.<br />Interesting pace that didn't let up. A real page turner.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Really didn't care for this book and the attitude toward women. I would not recommend it to any of my friends.
0979019710|5.0|This book will truly transform your life! I've been doing the miracle morning since the beginning of the year and have seen immediate results in my personal and professional life.

B0014KFV6I|5.0|One of my all time favorites albums.  Definitely takes me back to the 70s and my years in high school.
B008M721MS|4.0|It's great but wen I try to take a profile pic and I click the little button for it to work it says &quot;Skype has stop unexpectedly please try again&quot; I did and it does the same thing every time other than that it's great I totally recommend it if u don't want a pro pic.<br />-Cowz

1608871045|5.0|Quality of book was great and had lots of information, good color added to the movie or story line imagination.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is phenomenal. It is enough suspense to keep your interest and a beautiful love story. In depth character descriptions gives you a unique understanding.
0375842209|5.0|I thought the Book Thief was an excellent book and I would high recommend it.  I normally get my books from the library, but this one was worth the extra money and now I will pass it along for others to also enjoy.
B001XUW26Q|5.0|Really love the plot, many layers of complexity and the characters were really deep and interesting.  I thought the pacing of the movie was perfect. And it really gets you thinking about the stuff going on in that part of the World and our role in it. Leo really has grown into one of the elite actors of the day. I look so forward to seeing what he does down the road.
0525952926|1.0|This Ken Follet story is a big disapointment. If you like socialism, you'll love it; but for everyone else, it's trash
0393064476|5.0|Stephen Greenblatt writes clearly and communicates with ease. This is a very interesting book with great, &#34;food for thought.&#34;<br /><br />One person's look at our social evolution.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I love the book but it was really short but still good the best one in the series so it's not that bad
0066620996|5.0|This book is amazing! It is definitely one of my favorites. It gives great advice about building a great company which can also be used to become a better person
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is literally my favorite movie now. I watch it all the time with my friends. It is very funny and has a little love story to it. Take my advice and watch this movie. :)
B008M721MS|1.0|I don't think it's any good since I can't seem to get anyone at Amazon to tell me how to get it working.<br />I am able to see the person calling but they can't see me (which could be a good thing, I guess). my camera is working and I've call three times about the app & sI'll don't have any answers.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Ok I know what you are thinking, this looks likes such a stupid game.Well your<br />wrong THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER if you can't send any money or if you just want a good laugh.<br />This game is by the creators of CUT THE ROPE and that is my favorite game besides this one :)<br />When I first saw this game I was like no way am I getting it well you will make a HUGE mistake if you don't get this game.<br /><br />I hope you will like this game as much as I do
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love this album and was so happy to see it offered on cd from Amazon. Pricing and shipping were great (as always). Thanks for keeping cds around for us old-schoolers!
B008J34466|5.0|I so love cleaver lyrics and great music ! Pink has done it again. As Pink matures , so does her stories. Always barring her soul not just in words, but in the inflections in her voice. How can you not love Pink ?
0440243688|4.0|I enjoyed this book in the Jack Reacher series. It wasn't my favorite of Child's books, but it was a good read. &#34;Gone Tomorrow&#34; does not have as much action as previous novels, but the dialogue is paramount, so Reacher must use his brain more than brawn in this edition.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I cannot stand having a knife that is not very sharp.  This put a razor sharp edge on my knives.<br /><br />I don’t think it is intended to use on all your kitchen knives.  But if you backpack?  Get it.
1936608898|5.0|I am admittedly a review junkie. I research for reviews on most things my family and I purchase, and have grown to really appreciate them tremendously; but rarely do I leave one of my own :/ I am trying to change that, and felt compelled to start by leaving my review of this OUTSTANDING book. Let me preface by saying this:<br />- I am a real woman<br />- I am a wife & mother<br />- I was NOT PAID or even solicited to write this review<br />That said, I am 30 years old and have already been diagnosed with a potentially life threatening, \\"incurable\\" disease. I have 5 children, including one born with a birth defect. From the time I was a teenager I remember having digestive issues; and the stories shared by my relatives of the \\"terror\\" :-) I was as a young infant into late childhood, tells me something just wasn't right. I wholly believe my diet attributed to a lot of my \\"issues\\". When I began to realize the problems with my nutrition, and the importance of taking good care of my body INSIDE and out, I wanted to do better, but didn't know how. I started out slow by changing a few staples in our home to \\"better\\" i.e. switching from buying commercial milk, to getting it right from the farm. That, as I know now, was such a minute part of big picture thinking; but it was a start. Since, I have become versed on so many ways of eating, vegan, vegetarian, grain-free, gluten-free, sugar-free, WAP approved, and most recently paleo/primal. For everything I found to be truth, there was something else contradicting it. I even called upon a couple local naturopaths for help, only to realize just as with everything else, even naturopaths can be contradicting (and boy, lots of $$$$$). I became a slave to my own confusion, I wanted to create a perfect eating lifestyle, but I was chasing my tail, and wasting a lot of money all the while. It was frustrating.<br />Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. A copy of \\"It Starts with Food\\" was available for me to pick up at my local library. Yes, at the library. No way was I going to drop another dime on a book without knowing if it'd be any different from all the others. I was skeptical. However, I picked it up and had a hard time putting it down. The information is layed out so simply. They give you the meat if you want it, and the summary if you get are the type not needing all the details. They address contradictions, and theories that led to other recommended eating lifestyles. It wasn't just a do this, and don't do this, instead they were thorough, and seemed to have an answer already, for most questions that could arise. I appreciated that. I felt more confident as I read, realizing they really thought about what they were writing, they put a ton of time into really thinking it all through and looking at the big picture. They do have lots of \\"tough love\\" sometimes child-like tones but I figure there are adults needing that. They didn't gear the book to novice dieters, they really wrote it so that Joe-Schmo could pick it up, and LEARN. Not only learn, but be encouraged.<br />For me \\"It Starts with Food\\" pulled together everything I had learned up to the point of picking up the book. I need life simplified in this area, and it did just that for me. Is eating against the grain easy? NOT AT ALL. Is it fun, NOT MOST OF THE TIME, atleast not now. For me it's not a convenience, it gets me a lot of flack, and my kids certainly don't always \\"get it\\". After all, their teachers, coaches, friends, and even family give them candy for treats, celebrate over sugar, and tell them \\"ah a little won't hurt\\". Only, it's never \\"a little\\".  What eating against the grain is though, is NECESSARY. I don't want to do what normal people do, and have the normal outcome of society. I want to overcome my issues with food, I want to lay a good foundation for my children, and I want to HEAL. So to wrap it up, there was nothing I didn't like about the book, but there were a few things that stuck out to me that I'd like to note, that I really liked:<br />- It was reader friendly and well layed out<br />- The information was very thorough for the average reader<br />- They did not sell anything, or intend to, though they did give their own reviews of some products (very few in number though)<br />- There wasn't anything I needed to buy in order to start making the changes they recommended, no expensive juicer or kitchen item, no expensive supplements, nothing. I am already equipped with what I need, my focus just needs to be on the food.<br />- They simplified the supplement \\"game\\". That being one huge takeaway for me!<br />- The master recipes, love, love, LOVE<br />- The menu planner and meal map - fantastic!<br />They have made this way of living attainable for me, and given me a lot of encouragement along the way.<br />My goal is to complete my first Whole30 before I turn 31 (3-22). I see it as only getting better from here as I walk by faith...<br /><br />...STARTING WITH FOOD. :) (and buying my own hard copy of the book to refer back to :D) Then, after people start asking me how I have been able to accomplish the health feats I expect, I will point them first in the direction of the author and finisher of my faith, and then get them a copy of It Starts with Food!
B0049VZ222|5.0|A friend of mine suggested I watch this show so I purchased the first season and I was hooked after the first episode! I'll be purchasing the second season soon.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This movie was awesome. It started off great right from the beginning. It's one of those movies of revenge and you love seeing them get it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|calculator plus free is a good app. but in the pics it shows the square root sign but when I open the app it does not show. but other wise great app. functional pretty. I like it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was another sample I downloaded on Kindle because of the ratings.  Purchased it 5 minutes after the sample and read it straight through to finish.  I felt it dragged a little once they started discovering the secrets and it seemed a bit overwhelming with all of the bad things that started happening.  But the love they both had for each other kept me reading on.  There are parts in the book where you truly are left feeling Hopeless, but once all comes into play, you understand quickly what is going on.  There is something to say for young crazy love.  We could all use a bit of it in our lives at times.  I highly recommend reading this book, you will enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved reading &#34;Slammed, and &#34;Point of Retreat&#34; they were amazing books. When I heard that Colleen Hoover came out with a new book called &#34;Hopeless&#34;, I knew I had to read it. I loved this book even though some of the story line is disturbing, but Ms. Hoover has away of making all the pieces come together.  Holder and Sky are great characters that evoked heartfelt emotions from me. It is was beautifully written to bring out so many emotions in the reader and will be on my mind for a long time!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read a sample of this on Kindle as i was just shopping around.  I was hooked the moment I started and purchased it as soon as the sample was done. I didn't stop reading until 8 hours later when I had finished the book.  If your looking for a great story of love, turmoil and problems, this is by far the best book to choose.  I have recommended it to all my reader friends and they too were unable to put down.  The characters are easily loved for different reason, and you feel the turmoil they each go through during the story.<br /><br />Looking forward to book 2!!
B009O2XY12|2.0|Once you reach a certain level it kicks back at you it stinks! It was fun at first but then they keep you at the same level like they want you to spend more money,or stay there! it is very discouraging!
0670022411|5.0|Great book for adults if your into witches, vampires, other supernatural beings and romance! Can't wait until the third book comes out
B000BCE918|5.0|My son loves this trilogy so I thought I would buy it for him for Christmas. The price was right so I did and he absolutely loves it!
0525478817|5.0|Upon ordering this I was excited; being a Tumblr user this book has been all over Tumblr for weeks. People Obviously thought this book was good so naturally, I was curious. I expected some kind of logical self-esteem kind of book.. I never bothered to look what it was about. I wanted it to be a mystery.<br /><br />Upon arrival I opened the package up with two other books neatly tucked inside. Nothing was damaged or broken. Everything was perfect. It took me several days to pick up the book and actually read it. I didn't want to loose that mystery vibe but at the same time the cover and name and everything I had seen looked so interesting that I eventually (with a week) had to pick it up to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Upon reading I was opened to this new kind of book. Something I didn't  expect. A girl with cancer? Throughout the book I laughed, cried, and mourned the end of a perfectly written book. I felt like the story ended beautifully; but because I am a woman who loves beginnings more than endings.. I went back to read the first few chapters. I soon found myself in this brave young girl. I could relate to her on a level.. then I came to realize. Isn't that how we read books? We relate to that person some how and because of that we are drawn to reading the book about them.. well, it makes sense to me.<br /><br />This is at the top of my recommendations list. The author deserves to be applauded. He writes so beautifully that it is hard to imagine that I could ever find a book that could top that one.<br /><br />Good luck Readers.~<br /><br />Keep Reading.<br /><br />Ash~
B008GXHOFW|1.0|don't get this app. it continuously said I needed to delete stuff sso I could play it. NOW ALL MY APPS AND MUSIC IS GONE. IM SO PISSED PLEASE FIX THIS. and it still says I need to delete stuff. THERES NOTHING &quot;LEFT&quot; TO UNISTALL. WTF?!!!
B005JE1JZC|5.0|Just like the first it draws you in, this time you can't put it down as so much happens only to set up for the last book
B004SBS8LA|4.0|it is pretty cool and a great time killer but I got stuck on some of the levels. with the new update although amazon was slow to get them, its pretty awesome.
159562015X|5.0|It's very useful!! Helps me a lot to find my own talents and strengths. It also includes a registration code for the self evaluation test online.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|The clarity is great!  The hidden objects are good. Story line excellent! Will buy Magic Academy 2'  Easy to follow directions.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Funny and entertaining...definitely worth the $3.99.  Probably would have been a little disappointed in paying $10 at the theater, but for a streaming home movie, it's worth it...I am a big Family Guy fan...I think that helps in this case.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read a few reviews including one with spoilers and I have to say it's better than expected. I'm kind of glad I decided to continue reading this series even after those reviews. This sequel is just as good as the first and I plan to read the final book as well.... Don't always listen to the critics.... there are many reveals and beginnings to understanding events in the first book. It's also a terrific setup to the final book. Enjoy!!!!!!
B00001W9G0|5.0|have wanted this movie for a while barbara is awesome packaging and dvd was in great condition and if you love barbara it is a must have movie
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is such a great app!  All the pets are so cute! Just so much fun to play. You can play with, wash, brush, and feed your pets. You can even enter a daily drawing for prizes! I reccomend this app strongly.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app, seems to be pretty accurate every time I use it. I recommend it to anyone!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Easy reading and the start is somewhat funny! It w as the end that was somewhat confusing since Megan knew the terms of the partnership.
B0063IH60K|5.0|exactly what I was looking for. Have always loved the game now its easier.  Can play in the care while traveling.
B00AE2KZNQ|4.0|Lawless<br />Shia LaBeouf<br /><br />It was a good movie but I felt that there was not enough action.  I still give it four stars.
B0080GMLPI|3.0|Her first album was much better, but I do appreciate her effort to further popularize herself. The album seems a bit all over the place with no formalized structure.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great trilogy. Glad the ending was able to wrap up all the  feelings and pain but still manage to provide peace.
B00A7ZX4RO|5.0|Another fantastic album. While she manages to release a new album each year, they have not disappointed and this one has variety and substance in the lyrics. &#34;Stay&#34; and &#34;Love Without Tragedy ...&#34; are excellent.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Comprehensive coverage of the history of cancer research with many interesting side stories and fascinating insider details. Highly recommended for anyone interested in cancer and drug development.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story  of a young married couple weaves a very tangled web. Great writing. Unforeseen twists & turns throughout. Could not put this book down! Talented writer.
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|Excellent diet already lost 8 pounds! I feel great. I would recommend to anyone wanting to lose weight. I NEVER thought I could give up bread but I have and I do not miss.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never been one to write reviews, but this book deserves to be read. I felt so many emotions reading this book that I can't even begin to describe them. It's just something you have to experience for yourself.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This app is a very smart little sucker sometimes too smart but overall it's a great app I highly recommend it
1481251880|5.0|I read a ton of books but rarely rate them but I had to for this book. The story was incredible with so many twists and turns that kept me glued. I literally could not put it down! The plot, the writing style, the characters, and everything else was just outstanding. Definitely a must must must read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I did not think I would like a show about zombies, but this show is fantastic!  I love the character development and the story lines.  I can't wait for the second half of the season to start!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book kept me up. I couldn't put it down. I'm now waiting for book 6&7 to come out in a pack so that I can finish it. It's a great fast read.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|A fairly enjoyable movie, but with a predictable plot and not too interesting characters. I'd maybe give it a 3.5.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|i loved this movie- great finale to the whole series-fun to watch the characters grow up throughout-well written and directed
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Many have said \\"....you must see the movie\\".....but I think the images in my mind after following Pi through his journey would only be diminished.  Most descriptive, insightful, and delightful.
B007THA4FI|3.0|She should probably stick to wizards and fantasy. There were no characters I cared about, they were all self absorbed and not particularly likeable.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|&#34;Two Graves&#34; is another incredibly enjoyable adventure with Pendergast.  So many twists and turns - very hard to put it down!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish. I couldn't put it down until I had finished in one sitting. I laughed I cried I smiled. It was a touching story with an amazing plot. So far this is one of my favourite books. There was not one thing I didn't like about this book. Was not disappointed at all.
B007FEZQF8|3.0|I had just gotten my Kindle Fire during the midseason break of season three of The Walking Dead. I wanted to try out reading a book without pages for some time but had gotten cold feet until my momma gave this new toy for Christmas.<br /><br />Missing my show and not ready to jump into a full-blown book just yet, I gave the first edition of The Walking Dead comics a try and really enjoyed it. Very well drawn and great to see some old friends again. Very quick read makes me hesitant to get the next issue, as I'd like to try something a little longer, but no spoilers for anyone that has finished the first two seasons of the AMC show.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|As a holiday music and Michael Buble fan, I really love this CD.  It's my holiday favorite.  Great holiday standards, singing, and orchestrations.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show that has something for everyone!  Intrigue, love, suspense!  So glad I decided to watch,  Masterpiece Theatre out<br />did itself!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this period drama.  I pre-ordered last year so I got it before the last few PBS episodes aired.  Great extra features.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game.its awesome and on a totally unrelated note,they should really get Star Wars The Old Republic on Kindle Fire!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This is a must for Jane Austin fans.  I liked this adaptions the best out of all the other film adaptations.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A beautifully written and engaging story! It really thought it was just another YA love novell aboute a boy who gets the girl in the end and blah blah blah. But instead it was really really good! I can recommend it to everyone, young and old, girl and boy. Just read it. And you will know what I mean.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I bought this because I tried one episode and the purchased the 1 season.  I watched it all and now I am looking for season 2......Help&#34;&#34;  please and thank you.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|very fun and super innovative.  requires lots of just exploring and trying different things to solve each level.  there are often multiple exits in a level which requires replaying levels but that's fine as the levels have more of an open field feel to it.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game! It' bright, colorfull and the graphics are awesome. The only problem I have is that I have not gotten the promised crystals from the free crystal tasks. Could someone check that. I completed 2 and no free crystals.  :(  The game is great for all ages!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I loved this book. I'm a Stephen King fan and he did not disappoint me. It's not like the majority of his books but still fantastic.
0765350386|5.0|It seems to me that anymore you can know what type of worlds and systems to expect in this genre (vaguely Tolkien, roughly based on Irish sidhe, etc). This series is great because it breaks out of the norm. Others have gone into more exhaustive reviews so I won't repeat what they have said. But I will say if you are looking for a new author to try Brandon Sanderson is the first I would recommend.
B0083WLKBA|5.0|It is a great program and the price was a good value.  My husband is very happy to have this set.
1594481717|5.0|Love this Book opens you up to a whole new thought process
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Downloaded it on my kindle at 10:30 p.m, was finished reading it by 11:30 a.m. the next day. It was an easy read, and I wanted to find out how it ended so badly I didn't do anything until I was finished with the book.
B009ANP48G|5.0|My daughter and I love the dance movies. Other STep Up movies are much better but this one was good too.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch as a family. It is a heartwarming movie that brought laughs to both parents and kids. We will be watching it again soon.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|The movie is good and alot better then expected. Good action adventure movie and who doesn't love Matthew McConaughey! Buy it!
B004UID2LC|2.0|it was ok because I got to youtube faster but I read the reviews and my kindle already crashed and that WILL NOT happen again!!!!!!!!!!
B0000E1WKE|1.0|Had Clive Davis been involved in this album it would have been a very different experience.<br /><br />Being a fan from her debut album I was expecting an album of more traditional arrangements of classic christmas songs.
B000KE5JHU|4.0|This is like a nice afternoon with your girlfriends having a few drinks at a bar, listening to old, but good, stories. I'm a middle aged woman who enjoys good literature, and this is as good as the book.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|We played this game every night for a week after we bought it. It's a great game with absolutely beautiful artwork. Easy to learn and quick to play, it has tons of replay value. I definitely recommend it.
B004I744AS|4.0|This is one of the most concise and easy to use dictionaries I have ever seen as an app for tablets or phones ... Definitely worth the download .
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|The dystopian future YA novel is something I enjoy reading. This series was meh at best. I couldn't get behind Katniss and her lack of any real emotion towards either Peeta or Gale. Ever. She never shows any emotion towards either of these boys that supposedly love her. She doesn't even really want to free Panem from the cruel President Snow until she really has to. I was super excited to read this series after all the hype and I was left lukewarm towards it in general. Kinda like Katniss. And I hated how she ended up with who she did in the end. One guy just went away so she stayed with the other. Talk about settling. She was a weak heroine and far too wishy washy. The only time she ever showed any kind of emotion was when it came to her sister Prim or her own survival, which she even stops caring about in the end. Check it out from the library and see for yourself, but I'm not the hugest fan. I didn't hate them, I've read much worse, but they definitely weren't my favorite.
B0045HCJFS|5.0|great action film with kurt russell and halle berry. lots of action and suspense. good story line. don't miss it<br />!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|After years with boys, we felt out of our element and heavily agonized over the first baby doll for our daughter. We read all the lists of the most popular baby dolls, narrowed our own list, and headed to the store. We could not get over how creepy most of the babies looked! Back to the drawing board. We are so happy we ran across this doll in a forum discussion and then researched it on Amazon.  It came down to a 50/50 between this and a classic Madame Alexander for a first baby doll, but the Corolle just seemed so much cuter. We could not be happier with our choice! Our daughter received this for Christmas when she was 15 months. She has other dolls - knitted blabla dolls, an Emily dressing doll, and a soft posable ballerina, but none are really played with.  She immediately took to the Corolle Mon Premiere Calin doll when she opened it for Christmas.  It was amazing that it seemed to turn on a light for her as to pretend play with dolls. She immediately carted the doll everywhere and made everyone give the baby hugs & kisses. And by the end of the day she was playing with her other dolls too! Like \\"ah, hah, that's what these were - baby dolls!\\" Calin is still her favorite. She is sweet, and except when shoved in your face for kisses at 5 AM, the slight vanilla smell is not overpowering. She has already had to be washed once and she still looks and smells great! We highly recommend this doll and will likely purchase it for other little girls in the future.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|The rules are different than regular uno and I'm still getting used to it.  They make you call uno when you have two cards left which doesn't make sense. It's also not as responsive to touch as it should be, I find myself having to touch or swipe the card I want to play multiple times. Graphics are nice, but the game could use some work.

B0085TKAW6|4.0|A great read that ties in actual event in history with fictional characters that takes you across continents and around the world.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's can't seem to put this game down its so addicting I got my brother hooked on it too trying to see who has a better town<br />Recommend to everyone
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Love love love this case. Holds my fire perfectly for hands free reading & protects it while in my purse. Fire does not slip out or move when in hands free. Only thing I need now is a remote to change the page when I'm reading.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I read this book in 5 hours. It was amazing, truly a page turner. However I wish it had ended differently.
B00821P888|3.0|The story arc is good.  the mystery is good.  the premise is interesting and looks like it will get more convoluted.  unfortunately, the writers are not bright enough to come up with sequences to illuminate the plot without making their characters do stupid things.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />i dont know if they got new writers, i got dummer, or what, but the 3rd season of this was much more enjoyable and worthwhile.  there are still some stupid characters but they have established that they are stupid and they dont go in and out of that character anymore, and the smart people generally stay smart.<br /><br />i am adding this edit because someone got all huffy at me about a review i made on a movie.  i wrote the review months ago, but this person just had a conniption fit at me about it.  so i went back and read my other reviews to see if he was right and all my reviews are angry and mis-placed.  they are not.  some are angry, most not, and none are misplaced.<br /><br />this one, however, did need an update.<br /><br />skru yu stu :)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Absolutely love it.. I am able to create my own mixture of sounds<br />It also has a setting for a deeper sleep<br />It also has a timer and preset sounds in case u need a lil help puting the sounds together
B009GESJH2|5.0|As Kid Rock gets older, his music matures quite nicely - the sound is good rock music, a little southern/country rock mixed in, and sound very much like Aerosmith from the early 80s.<br /><br />Excellent work.... I am eagerly awaiting his next release.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|Bruno Mars has an amazing versatile voice and the songs on this album just don't do it justice. I'm disappointed.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I was extremely skeptical when I purchased this.  I just wanted something to throw in a Bug Out Bag and/or replace an old sharpener I got from the NRA that had a handle on it.<br /><br />I figured its small size would limit it usefulness, boy was I wrong.  Its small size is its best attribute.<br /><br />I don’t run the blade through it like my old NRA sharpener, I run it over the blade, keeping the blade stationary.  Its small size and thumb indent gives a lot of control. This is safer and makes sharpening large knives easy.<br /><br />It’s fine honing stone actually works, and has consistently given me a very sharp edge on everything I’ve tried it on.<br /><br />I actually got a second one since I use it too much to keep digging it out of my Bug Out Bag all the time.
B00866H7SS|2.0|I read this after reading 50 Shades of Gray.  It was an easy read, but I really didn't like the way it was presented as a whole.  I think if I had read it before 50 Shades, I would have enjoyed it more.  It seemed less classy than 50 Shades.  I am reading the second book now, Reflected in You and I am having a hard time finishing it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|what a great read, going to read everything i can find by the author. couldnt put the book down and hope the story continues!
B0054JELS4|3.0|I really liked the season one disks until I got to the last disk. The last episode on disk 3 had some skipping in it. I removed the disk and examined it for dirt and obvious damage. The disk was totally clean.  So I think that disk has a bad transfer. I'll be watching them in sequence to look for more.  The few drop outs in disk 3 season 1 is not too bad but if more skip I'll be returning them.<br /><br />Update: unfortunately I've gotten up to season 7 in the set and I've found more bad transfers. Basically the defect is in the polycarbonate material and for some reason tends to be azimuthal and not radial. If you flip it over and have the same issue, the plastic looks uneven and distorted and the data layer is a slightly different color.<br />This is the worst kind of damage to the disk since it's hard for the player to get past it. Radial errors only occur a short moment per rotation and the player can hide them. I waited too long to return mine, the amazon return page says it's too late for me.
0470449748|5.0|This has the information you are looking for if you're prepping for the GMAT, questions and answers are a bonus.
193413712X|1.0|I'm used to reading lots of dry history books and I do enjoy the occasional well-written novel, but this book was just plain boring.  Little to no plot and uninspiring characters.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A very enjoyable game when recovering from a back surgery!! Or while waiting for the wife to do some shopping!!
1451695195|1.0|This book contains almost no information about what the author saw, felt, or heard during the time he was out of his body.  It feels like this is the part 1 and another book will come out with more details - I felt like I was being sucked in to purchase a sequel, which would be smart marketing indeed for this author.  This book perfectly contains all the intro materials which would lead up to a second book that would actually contain some descriptions of what the author saw (or felt, or heard) while out of his body.  It's an easy read, good story, well-written, but lacking in the sort of information we purchased the book for in the first place.  Disappointed.
B003Y059EK|5.0|I could never be pleased with the normal stories as a child and always preferred the more eccentric ones like Return to Oz.  LOVE this movie and recommend to all children exposed to the original Wizard of Oz as well.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|This book was so good I could hardly stop reading it.  Read until 3:00 am one night it was so good
B0018D4SHY|4.0|It was awesome!  It was a good album!  I would recommend it to a friend and all oof my family members.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book! Loved every minute of it! I can not wait for the movie or to read the third book!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is really really fun and super cute! I love playing it and it's so addicting! It's one of my favorites!
B007HU7NBK|5.0|Most of us assume the life of a successful musician is all glitz and glam. Mr. Taylor opens our eyes to the stress, demands, sacrifices and scars that go along with being a pop idol. Such a heartfelt and honest read.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|jetpack joyride is a game i played frequently before if bought it. this game is challenging and fun,most of it is while you are saving up for something, it is amazing to finnally have enough to buy it, like jetpacks, cloths, and gadgets
B008MEM24S|5.0|play this game and you will not be an an an an an an an an an an... idiot. awesome
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|One of the best books ever!!!<br />I should recommend it to any one who loves a funny book with comic pictures
0811876373|5.0|I received this book as a gift for Christmas and the first thing I did was just flip through to look at all the pictures. The pictures alone are enough to make you want to jump up and start making cake pops! I got so much inspiration just from flipping through the book. Then I went back to the front to see the basic recipe and start looking at some of the ideas page by page. The recipe is easy to follow. The tips on how to work with the cake pops and keep the chocolate covering on are invaluable. The variations provided for each design are wonderful. It's just a fun book even if you have NO intention of ever making cake pops. But I did and I love how the ones I've made so far have turned out. They are a hit as is this book!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I got into the novels after watching the series. The novels are pretty different, but still great. Recommend it for zombie fans.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I think this game fun. I could play it all day yet I think there could be more to it
B004FOA84A|4.0|Can actually solve the puzzles on this game without a strategy guide. Good graphics. Challenging puzzles that relate to the store line for the final solution.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This special three-disc edition comes with Leslie Iwerk's amazing documentary &#34;The Pixar Story&#34; which tells a lot of Pixar's history and which is just a most inspiring, enthusiastic and amazing piece of work.
B00913DPW2|3.0|Good graphics and puzzles. Overall stroy line rather 'forced'. Probably impossible to solve without the strategy guide - some of the puzzles are not logically related to the story or each other
B009JBZH54|5.0|Hi. My name is Matt. I recently bought this online and i thought it was really really great. Having all these great movies together is awesome
B008458O3S|4.0|enough different styles of the game and it is logic as well as just mapping the path of the tracks.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Man sieht sehr schnell, wie lange der Akku noch hält. Sehr gut ist auch die Unterscheidung der Restlaufzeit in Musik und Video.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|challenging enough for me and easy enough for my six-year-old grandson.  I like the time trials.  enough variety to keep playing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book sooo much I can't stop reading when I start. I  can't wait to start the third one!!!!
0142410314|5.0|I chose this book as a standard children's classic to supplement my young friends home library of books for reading.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This light is great for our dark area by our basement steps. It is very sharp, senses any little movement from at least 20feet or more away. Great product!
0446572993|5.0|Story was great, like some of Baldacci's older mysteries.  I wish he would write more mysteries like the Camel Club and make them in a series.  I use to look forward to purchasing them.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|People should not be afraid of their amazon, amazon's should be afraid of their people. Well okay you can be a little afraid of Amazons i'm mean they are mythical warrior women. Whats not to fear!? Oh sorry i'm getting of topic great movie buy it, or watch it, what do i care what you do. You know what actually on second though don't watch it, i prefer being the only one that loves this movie. So stay off my turf, find your own inspirational film!
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Love this album can listen from beginning to end. Listen to it daily. You won't be disappointed I promise so go ahead and download it
B0039TAHMA|4.0|Amazon do something please to have subtiles in movies. Over all the movie was good .. Streaming was good and the quality of movie was nice. Some places i realky wanted subtiles so it would nice to watch those scene with subtitles
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Nothing special, but how fancy of a weather checking app does a person need.  One thing I do like over the website is that I can make a list of cities and pull from that list instead of having to type in a zipcode every time.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a quick and easy read.  It has some suspense but is predictable.  That being said, I would read this author again.
0345803507|5.0|This of course is the final book of the Trilogy.  If you loved the first two you will love this one.  Happy reading!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Great game!  I Haven't had this much fun with a game since Angry Birds!  From the art, music and game play, Well done all around!
B009H442DG|5.0|I chose this album because I enjoy all the songs and artists who are featured on it. It arrived just before Christmas and I listened to it many times. I am very happy with my choice and would recommend it to those who enjoy classic songs done in an easy-listening manner.
075666733X|5.0|It is very good ! It is very well suited for the purpose I need it. I recommend it .
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun, exciting &amp; Very Addictive. On the downside it gives too many coins too quickly and then it seems to take ForEVER to regenerate new coins!! Super fun way to relax and have some fun when you have some extra time to play!
B0000WPADK|5.0|I just received this model and having put a Con Cor(Desktop) model (no longer in production)of this together I note that it is the same model by both manufacturers. As Revell/Monogram were once unified I reason this is why the Monogram model is the same also. They are all well made and can be snap fit although I suggest you glue them in place or over the years small parts are going to separate.
B0067LXQAW|5.0|I was a bit skeptic to hear a new Cranberries album, but i'm very pleased to say they hold up to their expectation musically with this one. A great Cranberries cd!

B000JQUMPI|3.0|I guess I should have realize I didn't like the movie so I don't know what made me think I would like the book.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|I adore this book. It's a classic for a reason and is worth being read over and over. Look for the subtle humor!
B000JML7EC|3.0|Another classic book that is a good ready and takes me back to child hood when I first read it
B0001HAISG|5.0|This version is quite true to the original story!  Full of a GREAT cast!  It is so beautifully acted and the sets are amazing.  My whole family loves this version.  We have about 5 different Peter Pan movies, but this is our favorite, followed by Hook!  A great addition for the Peter Pan lover and a great movie for anyone.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|We've collected John Schmidt music for years... up to now as part of &#34;The Piano Guys&#34;.  I'm excited they got a contract with Sony for this recording.  The music is wonderful.  Our whole family loves it.
B009LRE040|2.0|i got this digital download to try out the service, it of course uses DRM but the real problem is the overall quality of play back, the colors are muted and all wrong as if it had a very low contrast ratio. I would recommend getting a hard copy, dvd or bluray instead of digital
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Interesting twist, just when you think you know where the story is going,DeMille throws in New characters and situations. Great follow up to the lion.
073935275X|5.0|We listen to audio books in the car and at our cabin in the evenings.  It's a great story and so nice to have all the books.  Worth every penny.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is actually the first I ever read, it's a great story about love, and determination to start a new life, I like the movies by Sparks and I am sure I'll enjoy this movie as well
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Recommend this CD.  It has a great collection of Dire Straits songs.  This is a great CD to have in your collection.
B000OT6UZQ|5.0|I could not find this ANYWHERE on blu ray for the CHEAP price, its worth it,<br />  I still watch my Dvds & dvds Look much better on a blu ray player,  More clear picture, Plus i love BLUE !! haaa<br />  This Is a STEAMY Soap Opera Movie,  With my favorite stars !!<br /><br />SARAH MICHELLE GELLER,  ( USED  TO PLAY BUFFY THE VAMPIRE )<br />RYAN PHILLIPPE (  REESE WITHERSPPONS X HUSBAND  )<br />& OF CORSE REESE WITHERSPOON<br />  ALL THREE make a great movie  here,

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Considering all of the hype this book has received, I purchased it with some high expectations.  Sadly, it's actually pretty lame.  It reads like the diary of a whiney, inexperienced, self-absorbed teenager.  And the &#34;good parts&#34; weren't really that good.
630512762X|5.0|I love Nicolas Cage and John Travolta movies and they really out did themselves on this movie. It's a great movie to watch.

030759565X|5.0|Good is good.  All is good. Good is not bad, at least not in my book.  Thanks so much everyone!
0765356147|2.0|I was very well satisfied with the first book in the series.  I wanted to see a little more of Vin's character but all in all, it was well-written and ended well.  The second book in the series was all negative.  I thought, well, this is like The Empire Strikes Back--everything is going to be dark and miserable so that it can all be triumphant in book 3.  So, now, in Book 3, I read the expected misery and devastation.  However, it kept getting worse and worse and going on and on with no end in sight.  Finally, on page 714, both the heroes dead, there is finally some positive events (even if it is a pyrrhic victory).  You get to enjoy the positive events for exactly 10 pages, then it's over.  Not what I would call satisfying.  I'm keeping the first book on my bookshelf for I shall read it again and I'll lend it to friends.  But Book 2 and Book 3 are going to Goodwill.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I honestly thought this book was amazing. I felt like I was Charlie's friend and thAt he was writing the letter to me. I can feel his pain and see that he was an amazing heart. I love this book so much.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|These have something for everyone: adventure, fantasy, sci fi, and romance.  Even if you've never watched a Dr. Who show in your life before (as I didn't) you'll become a fan.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I read this book when I was in my teens I loved it than and loved it more now. Excellant story of the Politics involved in a Rabbit warren. I loved the Chracters and the story is fasinating.
1451695195|1.0|I was very interested in reading this book but as so many others have said (but in fewer words) Whats it all about? And as a Christian myself, is he saying there is no Christ? I did not learn anything new from this book. And he left lots of questions. I have learned from this book that just because a books says \\"Proof Of Heaven\\" doesn't mean the author knows what he is talking about or if he does he is keeping it a secret.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|I have no cable and use my computer for my TV. I use this all the time to take my TV with me all around the house on my tablet. I with they didn't charge a yearly fee to access computers of your network. If it was a one time fee I'd pay it, but not an annual our monthly fee.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellent read,action from start to finsh,although a bit dissapointed in finish,was expecting more.Just had to finish it. A must have
B004DM0UII|2.0|only downside I see is the access it has.<br />way too much.<br />why does it need all this permission to everything?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey...I can't wait for the next episode to come out!  Beautiful costumes and exciting twists and turns in every episode.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I enjoy playing and unlike some players, I have not purchased coins.  I just played patiently in the beginning.  Now I have hundreds of coins and the puzzles are complete but I don't think there's a way to &quot;win&quot; the game.
B004U52VPS|5.0|it was the first christmas present out of the box and on the table to play with.  the boys are 5 and really liked it..

B0058YPGSY|5.0|I bought this and other seasons of Sons of Anarchy a Christmas gift for my daughter and she LOVES them all!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I read this screenplay and thought that there was no way a movie could be this good but I was wrong.  It held my interest till the very end!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Got hooked on the HBO series and now hooked on the books. Didn't get done with the first book before downloading the second.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|Was very excited to try this game but didn't get the chance. Had problem downloading it then said I didn't have enough space and I deleted 3 other apps and it still didn't work so I gave up.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book,wish it was longer.<br />I hope Charlie is doing well and I hope he stayed friends with Sam and Patrick throughout his life.<br />I almost wish the epilogue was a letter that took place 5 years later.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm in love with this book - a most definite read! This is an amazing story! The characters are memorable and will most likely read this book over and over again!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read! Well written, no bombastic VS. I highly recommend. WAY better than most first hand accounts and the author checked his ego at the door.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|This is a good cover for my Kindle. A snug fit, making the screen safe from scratches. Yet with all that, I feel there is something missing but I don't know what.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Good book and very interesting story line. At first you wonder where this is going and then it all comes together! It also teaches a great lesson.
B008476HBM|5.0|I've read this book many times, I love Jane Austen. So now I am thrilled to have this beautiful love story on my kindle fire, which I have once again read.  This story always makes me smile.

B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I was not dissappointed by any of my purchases, would use all of them again in the future should I need to buy anything
B00979CS50|4.0|Very nice CD to put on in the background and enjoy.  The songs are long versions and are perfect for back ground music when enjoying social evenings with friends.
B007W7P5L8|4.0|I like the Case cover, bought it because it had the position for a stand.  Color true to the picture.  Took awhile to get to me, but I can be patience.  Marware items are usually great product.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Love the Mitch Rapp series. This was another great job by Vince. Very compelling and spot on with the current state of affairs. Can't wait for the next one!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Brought this for my daughter who loves the movie.  Arrived on time and in great condition. Would recommend having this movie for your collection.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This is a very cool book it's kinda of like the movie but even better and there is some parts are and other parts that aren't there
B008XBASVY|5.0|I love you, Chris Colfer. This book was laugh out loud (and have the whole family awkwardly stare at you) hilarious.
B001OGRIWW|5.0|As the music industry has slowly homogenized into a money-only obsessed machine over the past few decades, more challenging and adventurous music seems to have fallen by the wayside. It very likely exists out there somewhere, but it seems harder than ever to find. Popular music of the naughts and tens seems more about hot bodies and hot products than about anything with real social repercussions beyond more consumerism and celebrity worship. But at one time, believe it or not, the music industry genuinely presented alternate landscapes and perspectives to its listeners. Talking Heads arguably represents one such pinnacle of this seemingly lost era. Though they later became, for a short time, pop darlings and chart toppers, they began as a truly experimental and, for their time, shocking critique of the musical and social status quo. Though they don't appear to have any true musical descendants today, at least no obvious ones, their vast influence nonetheless remains beyond question. Their situation and background may dictate their perennial uniqueness: bookish art students who entered the world of rock. No way would this combination produce standard rock music. And it didn't.<br /><br />The Talking Heads' first album had cover art as stripped down as the music etched into the record inside the sleeve. A minimalist red cover titled appropriately left just about everything to the imagination and communicated and presumed very little about the group or the songs. A more appropriate cover is difficult to imagine. Those who approach this cover with hindsight, which includes everyone at this point, of course know that there's more going on than mere minimalism here. Like nearly all subsequent Talking Heads' albums, this one has the potential to open up new worlds, expand points of view and even question one's social and political reality.<br /><br />Unlike subsequent Talking Heads' albums, the music here takes more of a back seat to the lyrics. Later albums would more and more showcase new musical forms as the words gradually became more abstract and sometimes approached dada. Here stripped down rock arrangements, though still full of unexpected musical surprises, let the lyrics blare out and command the foreground. Lead singer David Byrne's often barked and wheezed vocals add a twisted layer of intensity and mood not heard before. And the words definitely stick out. A love song mentions stockbrokers. Another one suggests seeing an analyst. Another one gushes lovingly about a convenient workplace that provides easy living. And, of course, \\"it's not... yesterday... anymore.\\" Some merely paint a picture, usually a strange one, of social relations. Others, in a move not seen in rock music those days, fervently embrace happiness, contentment and emotional highs. But the delivery and context of these words suggest something more sinister or critical. Is the narrator of \\"Don't Worry About the Government\\" really in bliss about his building? Or in denial? Is the \\"Happy Day\\" actually an oblivious one? Perhaps it's genuine, but once again the context of the album makes one wonder about the subtext of bleating out cheery platitudes. And this approach may raise questions in listeners' minds, such as \\"am I really happy?\\" or \\"would I sing about the conveniences of my workplace?\\" At the very least such songs may make one pause.<br /><br />\\"Tentative Decisions\\" seems narrated by a logical lunatic pressing someone to reach a conclusion when one may not even exist. \\"The Book I Read,\\" with its beautiful crescendoing chorus and \\"Hey Jude\\" mimic bridge, seems to bridge the epistemological and the sensual. Can saccadian motion over text written by someone one knows result in a near erotic experience? The idea that one's eyes also caressed the words caressed by another definitely provides possibilities for interesting new human connections. The almost inhuman squawks of \\"No Compassion\\" make for an even more unnerving experience as the almost sociopathic,yet sincerely delivered, lyrics communicate that some people have no time for the problems of others. the line, \\"They say compassion is a virtue, but I don't have the time,\\" efficiently sums up an unspoken modern sensibility. It all gets drowned in a wonderfully messy and dissonant guitar solo that sounds as if it were played with a blender.<br /><br />And though this album produced no hits (not that it was trying to), \\"Psycho Killer\\" nonetheless remained a Talking Heads' standard and very likely drove many to explore the band further. Its simple opening bass line evokes the entire history of pop and rock with a few simple notes. And though the lyrics may not sound very disturbing to today's ears, the song has lost none of its power.<br /><br />The entire album has also lost none of its power. It stands up perfectly fine to Talking Heads' other albums, though arguably it sounds a little rougher and raw, for better or worse. Only one song, \\"Who Is It?\\" even comes close to throwaway status. Everything else is solid songcraft on nearly every level. A listen to the entire album evokes an infectious twisted optimism that also arouses suspicion. Nothing else like it had appeared on the music scene. Its startling originality sounds fresh decades later. But that goes for pretty much the entire Talking Heads' catalog. Follow-up albums would take the band in even more innovative and surprising directions and they would never sound the same again. Such a stunning level of artistry, without plumbing the depths of pretentiousness, seems unattainable in today's mainstream music environment. Hopefully those inspired by \\"Talking Heads:77\\" will change that.yet sincerely delivered, lyrics communicate that some people have no time for the problems of others. the line, \\"They say compassion is a virtue, but I don't have the time,\\" efficiently sums up an unspoken modern sensibility.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Got this for my husband for Christmas. Came with good special features and booklet information. Pleased with how well this product was put together. Very easy to understand.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Works great. As my wife and I have e-mail accounts with different servers<br />this free app works very well for her. As we are older and near retirement<br />it is refreshing to work with a device that uses apps as opposed to software.<br />We have no problem downloading apps for use on our Kindle and no longer have to wait<br />for one of our sons to do it for us.
B005LAII8K|4.0|This film was OK, but the story and acting left me a little cold. Given the Time Travel premise, IMHO, much more could have been made of this story.<br />The film is displayed Widescreen, and does not fill a 16x9 ratio TV, leaving black bars across the top and bottom.<br />The production values were good, but some of the futuristic weapons, cars and buildings could have been better.<br />Bruce Willis' acting was fine. The little boy, Cid had acting positively off the scale. Emily Blunt was OK.<br />I'm sure Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a fine actor, but I failed to care anything about his character in this film.<br />The synthesized film music is nothing remarkable, it's very mediocre.<br />The ending leaves you wondering what future effects all the changes to the timeline will cause. That sort of leaves you hanging.<br />I am a big fan of Fringe, a TV program of a similar genre that is cleverly written with excellent character development.<br />I had difficulty connecting with the characters in Looper. The little boy, Cid, was the only character that I really ended up caring anything about.<br />I anxiously awaited the release and arrival of this Blu-ray DVD, but I am a bit disappointed.
B009LDCZ7I|1.0|First, the good news. Season One was epic. Buy the DVD and immerse yourself in some great acting and terrific writing that keeps you on the edge of your seat entertained.<br /><br />Season Two is just terrible. WTF happened to the writing on this series? It turned into a bad network television series right out of the 80's. Bad acting, stupid story lines and an implausible love story that hijacked the most intelligent, realistic drama series of 2011. If you liked Angie Dickenson in the 1970's series Policewoman, you'll like Season Two. This was a major, major disappointment.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|First book of his I've read and I love Jack Reacher and the writing doesnt let me put the book down.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|nice little app bit fiddly to start with but really handy. use it to browse photos on my Mac all the time
B004R2DS9C|4.0|I ordered two of these zip bins in different sizes for my sons hoping to contain their legos & keep them off the floor. The boys have had a good time with them, even playing with the mats as well as using the boxes for storage. They work fine, and they are the nicest bins I've found, but I wish they were sturdier. I just wonder how long they'll hold up to being carried around, played on, & stacked full of legos.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|Excellent movie from the very beginning to the end when the credits rolled! I loved the action scenes, the romance and the story line delivered very well!
B002DNDMTI|5.0|Looks better than it did in the theatre and thats no exageration. sound too ! - emaculate! Best looking blu ray transfer I have ever seen,
B00009UTQD|4.0|I have the Tamrac Bag 9x and bought this to be able to attach it to the bag. although after attaching it I felt that the filters wouldn't be that secure outside the bag during travel, I don't think they lock firmly, fitted all my filters in it comfortably.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book was what I expected and more.  I was interested in how she managed to maintain her sanity during this time and how she educated her girls.  Both of these things were answered in the book.  I was happy that part of the book was devoted to the therapy she received after her ordeal and how she is now coping in a world she didn't grow up in.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|I have used this sweeper,  I am not happy since there are no wheels on the bottom of this product.  It is not as smooth as the other Swivel Sweeper that I have purchased. The sweeper does not glide across the carpet as smoothly as my other sweeper.  I would not recommend this for that reason.<br /><br />Thank you
B0053TMP24|5.0|Gracias a la tecnologia se puede leer un libro sin necesidad de cargar con tanto peso. Mi hijo esta muy contento y espera acabarlo para seguir leyendo la serie.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|my younger guys like it as much is I do!!love the simplicity of te game.my grandchildren talked me into the purchase and we all play it!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great show.  I have always been a fan of the Sherlock Holmes short stories.  This show gives Sherlock Holmes a modern twist.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|like it.sounds could be neater. some sounds don't sound great.glad to find it.easy set upand instructions were simple to use!
B0013A1T8I|5.0|I ordered &#34;The Golden Compass&#34;  because my grandson,10,  is reading the Philip Pullman trilogy. I hear that they love the movie. I did too, when it first came out, a fantasy- adventure of good and evil in which pre -adolescent children are making a difference in the course of  human events.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I like it.to bad not equipped to take picture's while you look at screen?device would've been a 5star in my book!! but I still like it,plus the younger ones are able to use shelf portrait!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent production!<br />Writing is top notch and the cast works very well together!<br />Unlike American productions, they will most likely be allowed to finish the story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was recommended by a friend whiose reading tastes are similar to mine.  The story was unusual.  There were so many twists and turns, I found myself siding with the husband, and the wife alternately.  I have to say the ending left me hanging,.  Does this mean there will be a sequel?
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Hard to connect with the characters in the beginning but the middle was really good,the story had a good flow.Not a great ending felt like it ended very abruptly as if the author had to hurry up and end the story
B0081J9OWC|5.0|they are a great feel good type of band to listen to when you need a pick up. I hope I get to see them live
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|This was my first Gary Cooper movie.  I loved his persona and strength.  My favorite line is when Patricia Neal says &#34;People may get the wrong impression.&#34;  And Cooper says, &#34;I don't think they'll get the wrong impression.&#34;
B00785P2QC|5.0|I just got this game and it will keep me going fore hours .I like like it and recommend it to any one to play it.
B00A6F9YFQ|5.0|Another absolutely brilliant output by the Pet Shop Boys. I'm not as crazy about the single version of Memory of the Future itself. I like the album version much better. However the B-Sides are brilliant. Listening brought me to an absolute stand still with it's power. The strength and vulnerability in Neil's voice is haunting and heart breaking. Just a miraculous single. One Night and Inside also just rounding out what has been I think PSBs most emotionally deep and introspective period.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Ian still kicking it out.....been following Ian from the first Mott record and I can honestly say that this record not only doesn't disappoint, but it's a surprising treat to my now ancient ears.....from beginning to end this record keeps you wanting more, I'm always a little sad when it ends (sometimes I just replay it).  This is certainly a 'must have' for anyone who likes IanHunter.....even without Mick, this one's a solid kicker.....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not a better show around for period drama and character driven stories.All done with class and style! Can't wait to see more!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|when I try to download it wont let me it says it has an error please help me I really want the game
B009GED3HS|5.0|Another amazing season of an amazing show. There is no stopping How I Met Your Mother! Watch this show! Great content, lots of laughs, surprises, and fun!
0547884591|4.0|It is hard for me to review this item, it was a gift. The person seemed to like it and was excited to get it read and start using it. He has wanted to polish some chefs skills with out having to take more classes, right now.  This book seemed to provide a good basic instruction for a busy person.  I saw the ahthor on Dr OZ. This prompted my purchase. What I saw when the book arrived seemed to be satisfactory.
B000FC10WU|5.0|No one can surpass Mrs. Christie in storytelling.  She has been a favorite for along time and will continue to be for along time more.  You never really get tired of reading her stories over and over.  Wonderful plot and excellent villians.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used swype, and it's alright. I never really grew used to using it. Somehow on a whim I got this free from amazon and it's been fantastic. It's fast, it learns what I'm doing. It's great.<br /><br />It's simple and quick. That's all you need. Simple and quick.
B008BP097A|4.0|Great mood music. I love her voice and message. Would love to see her live! Such an ethereal creature. Effective use of the love language .
B005LAII80|4.0|Dredd is a great example of what truly creative people can do on a limited budget. It is also a good example of remakes that actually work. Great acting, great effects, great action. This particular version of Dredd is steeped a bit more in reality, thus you wont see the crazy futuristic qualities of the Stallone version. ( The Stallone versions one redeeming quality was its set designs, which were dead on perfect for Mega city one.) The new Dredd, does include some futuristic backdrops, but it doesnt linger on them for long, instead giving us an intimate, simple story, jam packed with great action, that takes place inside one mega building. No flying spaceships, no war robots......just Dredd and his rookie partner, on a call that goes bad. 2 Against hundreds. Dredd is very violent. The filmakers do not candy coat the violence in this world.......thank goodness. Dredd isn't a pg 13 kiddie show.<br />  One of my favorites of the year. I'm not giving it 5 stars for nitpicking issues. The score could have been better, and the main villian needed a bit more back story. But again, just nitpicks and in the end, just my personal opinion. Oh, and the 3D is excellent in this, partly due to the slow motion sequences, allowing the 3D to really shine.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Looking around for a calculator and this looked like the best fit however I wanted the pink skin that was offers on the free one but thinking the paid on would have it no such luck you only get the pink skin when you upgrade the free version<br />I really feel both souls be the some since its a paid app
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Ages 11 to 19, all 4 kids love this movie, so do the parents, there is so much to laugh at, good stuff to talk about if we feel so inclined. Awesome effects, nice special features, John Malkovich, price is right, shipped promptly, you won't be disappointed!
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Looking around for a calculator and this looked like the best fit however I wanted the pink skin that was offers on the free one but thinking the paid on would have it no such luck you only get the pink skin when you upgrade the free version<br />So now I have the paid version with inbound skin I wanted and  the free version still says free on it but I paid for it and got my pink skin and no adds so I guess it was worth it in the end
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Whole family enjoyed this movie. (Kids 11-19) Gave us plenty to think and talk about. Movie had a believable story line, compelling drama, engaging action, great humor, and a solid message that makes it worth watching and sharing with others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing!! I couldn't put it down. Such an interesting read and I was on my toes the whole book. Just amazing
B005OCFGTO|3.0|I was really excited to get this box set because I haven't seen all of the movies. I think I got to the sixth movie before that pesky life thing got in the way. Plus it was a really good price for all eight movies, so I figured I'd spurge for the set. When you open yours though, make sure all the discs are there! I ended up with two copies of the Deathly Hallows Part I instead of getting a copy of The Order of the Phoenix. I don't know what I'm going to do with three Deathly Hallows... Guess I'll just have to become the Master of Death.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was the kind of book where u can't stop reading. It was so good. August was such a wonder the whole book which gave the book suspense.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is the first book that puts everything into perspective.  It is written in a clear and consise manner that even a novice can understand.  I recommend that it is a must read for everyone.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I heard about this from a friend at work my wife and I are always looking for a great series to watch.She and I try to find something that has been out a few years so we can buy the seasons and not have to wait a week to see what happens. Amazon prime is awesome two day free shipping on most items so no long wait for the next season to get here.
B00846REIS|5.0|Cant wait until the third book. I read both book in two days couldn't put it down. this book grabbed me from the first page.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Absolutely loved it!  I am a Constant Reader, especially anything by Stephen King.  I did not want it to end.  I think this is one of his best!
B00197POXG|5.0|I was a fan of this show and didn't want to pay the huge price for each season as it came out. When I saw this at it's great price, I bought it immediately!. Not only does it come with every single episode from the each season, but it also has all the movies that came out with it. (Even the one where it's obvious poor Joe Lando is wearing hair extensions or a wig LOL).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was hooked in from the beginning. Never have I enjoyed reading about a love so great and so tainted.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|The Red Pyramid by Rick Riorden tells the story of Carter and Sadie as they go on an adventure they do not expect. Besides meeting their Uncle Amos, Carter and Sadie learn that they are Egyptian magicians and that they are to save the world. Will they ? Gotta read The Throne of Fire.<br /><br />Rick Riorden did a wonderful job of portraying the lives of Carter and Sadie. As a Percy Jackson fan I began to read other books by the same author to see if they were as good or even better than the Percy Jackson books. It turns out that both books are great and magnificently written. Five stars.
B0091REZMW|1.0|It's ok it loads slow u have to read so much it's boring<br />Bout to delete it right now don't get it
B00006FDCD|5.0|This movie stays true enough to the book that readers will appreciate the film version. Great casting, a compelling story, and genuinely creepy scenes make this vintage King. My only compalint is the really horrible special effects at the end, which mars an otherwise excellent adaptation.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this app even though you have to buy baling every once in a while its still really awesome and fun
B001FB4W16|5.0|This had me hooked from the moment Sookie saved her Vampire, but this is one seriously twisted show! I would not recommend watching it with your children of any age. ;-)
B004HD61KE|5.0|As always James Rollins keeps you entertained and leaving you wanting more. Would definitely recommend to all. A mix of mystery, science and adventure.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|this is a great app but i am 8 years old so it seems hard to me but if the writer is reading this i think  you made it funnnnnn so speciel thanks
B007NG93CK|5.0|Kathy Reichs goes into such intriciate detail and as all off her books this was a book I couldn't put down
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Catwoman steals the show.  Understand that firstly.  Without her this movie would have been pretty boring.  This tale is more cerebral.  Batman is coming to terms with his place, with himself, with his city.  It is an entertaining movie, but it is far from epic.  There should have been many more battles between Batman and the bad guys.  The Sandman is in this film, but he does nothing.  I felt like this was more of a drama than a superhero tale.  The acting is great.  The worst actor is actually Christian Bale, unfortunately, with his stupid sore throat Batman.  Give him a lozenge.  I want to see Batman kicking butt.  This film had too little of that.  As I said, Batman was a dud in this film.  Bane and Catwoman and Levitt's cop character were more promising and interesting personalities.  It is worth a watch, but do not expect anything supremely entertaining.  It has some thrills, but nothing like the previous two movies.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was very good and I ‘think everyone should have it I love it food for traveling excellent  very good
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This movie is a smart take on the Avengers.  Even the lame Nick Fury that Sam Jackson plays is made tolerable in this film.  The Hulk is magnificent.  The actors are all at the peak of their talents.  The effects are excellent, but the enemy soldiers are all CG and look a bit too fake.  Also, Hawkeye is not utilized.  He fires a few arrows.  We don't know much about him.  Then the movie ends.  Same thing with Black Widow really.  But the dialogue is engaging.  The plot is entertaining.  The heroes are shining reflections of their comic book selves.  Well done.<br /><br />The enemies are a bit lame, unremarkable, and forgettable.  Loki is barely a villain.  A smarter plot would have pit the Avengers against a group of super villains.  Or at least professional fighters dressed as aliens, so the choreography does not look so fake at times.  It really draws you out of the suspension of disbelief when the aliens look like Sunday morning cartoon characters.  Thankfully, this only happens briefly.<br /><br />This is a solid starting place for the Avengers.  If they write in some interesting villains, get rid of the CGI, and actually INVOLVE Hawkeye and Black Widow, the next movie will be superb.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Watch the video available at Amazon.  When you close your Kindle, it automatically shuts off.  It is great as a stand.  Large choice of colors.  Radio Shack sells this but with Amazon you have a better choice of colors.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|You like time travel?  You like action?  You like alternate realities made possible by time travel?  You like futuristic hitmen?  Well, rent this puppy and enjoy yourself.  This movie is full of action, drama, sci-fi, and interesting ideas.  The acting is top notch.  The plot twists a few times.  There are thrills and shocking moments as well as a few sad choices.  This is an original movie that is truly entertaining.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love the Twilight Saga in print or on the screen.  While the movie, as usual, does not follow the book, I still enjoy it.
1439153663|5.0|This book hooks you early and like a bad accident you can't stop looking (reading)! The book contains just about every possible stereotype imaginable - abseentee but kindly master, drug addicted Lady of the House, cruel and hateful overseer, pedophile tutor, perverted fiance etc.  the list goes on and on and on.  Page after page of tragedy and action packed dialogue keeps you hooked till the over the top end remininscent of Atlanta burning in Gone with the Wind.<br />So why do I rate it 5 stars you may be asking?  Simply due to its readability and entertainment value - I cared what happened to (most) of the characters and the author was able to transport me back to the times of grand old plantations of the deep south.  The voyeuristic quality of the story telling kept me wanting to know what would happen next and in this the author succeeds.  Gone with the Wind it's not but an entertaining and fast read it exceeds at!  Take it on your next vacation or make it a book club read and you will have lots to talk about!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My granddaughter of 6 loves this game.  She actually found it and can access this on her own.  So in 'down time' she has a toy
B00AAX68HG|5.0|thought it might be fun for my four year old....tested it out to make sure it would be ok for her to play...prob not the easiest game for her...but its def fun for me!! love it and hooked.  just ads can be annoying when you're in the zone. but just a quick click of an x and I'm back in the game. so much fun!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love the Twilight Saga in print or on the screen.  While the movie, as usual, does not follow the book, I still enjoy it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first this felt like a high school version of 50 shades. Not as graphic but the intensity of the characters were pretty similar. I definitely didn't see the twist coming where everything from the first half of the book made more sense. I couldn't put it down after that!
0765325950|5.0|After all these years, I can finally not wonder what happens at The Last Battle. Rand has been and always will be my favorite and a great influence on my life. Sanderson did a great job. I would do ANYTHING though, if Sanderson would give us an Epilogue, similar to what New Spring was, in a year or so. Or if Harriet allows, a few spin off series' that answered unanswered questions. I could stay entertained in the world of The Wheel of Time forever.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|these are a great product they work purfect platstation should have desined the controlers with this kind of trigger i highly recomend them
B00164GDA0|5.0|Great movie, just watch it and you will see why.  This movie is for anyone, but if you had close friends growing up, maybe came from &#34;the other side of the tracks&#34;, or weren't exactly rich you will appreciate this movie.  If you weren't one of those perfect kids in school or had a great home life then you will really understand the relationship of the kids in this movie. Awesome flick!
B008133MDK|5.0|Excellent. Very well done .., it was a joy to watch and easy to download for future viewing ..I watch the episodes in the plane.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|One of my favorite websites, you actually learn American news much quicker than our American sites!  Highly recommend this site!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I like John Grisham very much, but I thought this book was a little too farfetched.  The making of a movie part was not believable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you play the games a lot to get new games and is repetitive. the games are fun for a while.
B009DH379C|4.0|Nice concert, excellent set, Queen performing at their best level. The sound is really good DTS HD but it could be better. Video is re-mastered from 35mm and looks pretty decent but obviously not at the level of a blu-ray filmed in HD. A must have for any classic Rock or Queen fan.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First let me say how excited I was to read this one. Seen some great reviews on this one, but come on now you can't go wrong with Colleen Hoover. She has not let me down at all. I could not go to sleep without finishing this book and everything is hunky-dory. Second let me say all this chocolate talk making brownies, cookies had me grabbing some zebra cakes and looking for my Christmas stocking eating half my stash of snickers.<br /><br />\\"I live you\\"<br /><br />This book is brilliant. If you think that you know what will happen think again. As soon as I thought I figured what was happening them bam another twist and turn. I don't want to give anything away so I will just leave it as that. But I will say again it was perfect. Go pick this book up

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a must read. I am so excited to read the next book in this trilogy. It's hard to out the book down. Characters are easy to get wrapped up in!
B003UPPO2G|1.0|My problem is mainly with the packaging. When we opened the case, the dvd had popped out of its holder and was extremely scratched.
B00846REIS|4.0|The first chapter was a little slow, but once you get into it...you can't put it down! I definitely recommend this trilogy!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book from start to finish! Great read, great characters, great love story. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a great read. It really captures the good and bad parts of high school. Chbosky did a great job. I recommend this book to everyone.
B000SEI230|5.0|This book is a wonderful love story. Makes me cry every time. I love this book.  As book about  true love.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I like this game and like it's creativity but I really wish you could decorate the house and EARN gems.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like The Third wheel because it's base on something that could happen. The book is also in a middle school environment
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|I'm not normally a Steven King reader but this was recommended by a friend and I have recommended it to others as well. I enjoyed it a lot.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Again , I'm just getting acquainted with my Kindlefire HD and the solitaire is relaxing after end of day chores.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is awesome for telling how long you can use your device for WiFi, reading, music, video, etc.  Also the option to display it on your notification bar. Great app! Highly recommended!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|A testimony to great writing. This has everything between two covers. Love, hate, sincerity, disgrace, utter sadness, pain, insanity cruelty, madness, and a type of heartache that is indescribable. A great love turned into a wrenching torment. Best book I have read in years.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|First of all, I want to say that this is an amazing novel by an extremely talented author. Most people want a fairytale ending; think it is the best ending. But, in this book's case, it doesn't need one. It's blunt truth gives the story a realistic feel and, although discouraging at times, keeps the reader engaged. I also enjoyed how Suzanne Collins created her sentences so they mimicked Katniss's mind and it's speed. They were short and to the point, but so well written that they sometimes kept secrets cleverly hidden behind them. Collins's technique gives you the proof that, even though we are looking through her eyes, Katniss is still able to keep secrets.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind towards new styles of writing and a love for a truely amazing novel.
0307887448|4.0|Maybe just a three star on technical merits, but I'll give it four stars for being a funner read than most in its demographic.<br /><br />The good:<br />* Once the story gets going it's a real page-turner, with riddles to solve, battles to fight, and evil corporations to outwit. Seldom a dull moment.<br />* The world-building is pretty thorough and fascinating, especially the virtual part of it<br />* The references to 80's pop culture can be fun even for a semi-geek like me (I grew up in that era)<br /><br />The not-so-bueno<br />* The story is front-loaded with a lot of exposition, so it takes a while to get rolling. Though usually interesting, at times it reads more like a Wired magazine article than a novel<br />* Sometimes the old-timey pop culture is laid on too thick. Yes, I get that there is a billion dollar reason that the characters are so into it. But for all the amazing technological developments in this future world, it seems as if pop culture must have stopped sometime in the nineties.<br />* Serviceable but uninspired characters. The villain is a standard soul-less corporate nasty with faceless henchmen. You have your Japanese sidekicks who are into bowing and honor and revenge, the smart and scrappy orphan main character, the love interest who is pretty much the female version of him, etc.<br /><br />The faults are easy to forgive. In sum, I'd say that, geek or not, you'll find much to enjoy in this story.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is a great movie! To get two copies for this low price is wonderful! I certainly give it two thumbs up!
B001MSMULG|5.0|Daniel Silva is, in my mind, the best author of mystery/detective fiction. His books are complicated, the people seem quite real.
B001KPYNR0|5.0|This album is for anyone who loves Christmas and Enya.  It contains a nice mix of original songs and known songs done in her typical style.  I bought this album because I really like &#34;Trains and Winter Rains&#34; and her rendition of &#34;O Come O Come Emmanuel.&#34;
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I'm a big fan of match three games. I really like the quest portion. The graphics are excellent. There's a challenge without it being frustratingly impossible.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This story followed the typical PG rated romance, where there's so much chemistry and heated attraction that the pages literally burn as you read them, but where there are ALWAYS some obstacles in the way before the two knuckleheads realize they're in love.  That being said, I read this in less than a day.  Extremely quick read, not bad to pass the time with several glasses of wine.
B0098VYKSA|1.0|Bad acting mixed with twisted storyline. Not worth the 5 bucks at all. We're glad that we didn't watch it in theater.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is probably the single worse book I have ever attempted to read.  It is just plain ignorant and stupid.  Period.
B003HLM2QO|3.0|I've never been a fan of Ozzy Osbourne. I've always found him dreadfully over-celebrated. Yes, the first four Black Sabbath albums are landmark metal LPs but I think this was so in spite of Ozzy's mediocre vocal limitations. Had Ronnie James Dio been the singer from the start those albums would likely be even better. Nevertheless, Ozzy's place in rock history was cemented.<br /><br />Surprisingly, he became even more famous as a solo artist. There's little doubt his dubious acts of animal cruelty and dimestore Satanic image (rather than musical talent) made him the megastar, fascinating teenagers and arrested adolescents for years. It didn't matter that it didn't take long for the so-called \\"madman\\" to become a parody of himself. Nowadays he's a man with zero credibility among metal diehards who consider him the poster child for biggest sellout, washed up rockstar boob on the planet thanks to that insipid reality show.<br /><br />Though he has a rich catalog of solo \\"hits\\" I've only liked one of his albums from start to finish and that was his solo debut \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\". Since then he's been consistently inconsistent.<br /><br />All that being said I admit I was pleasantly surprised by this tuneful, harder sounding version of his shtick. I've heard some bemoan alleged \\"groove metal\\" flourishes and the record being overproduced but it's actually one of the best sounding albums I've heard from him. Sure, it's definitely a commercially-minded collection and produced two terrific singles and videos. The crunchy, lumbering \\"Let Me Hear You Scream\\" is a catchy fist pumper, while \\"Life Won't Wait\\" is a melodic midtempo, alternative rock ballad with a tastefully restrained vocal. The video was hands down the best he's even been in. He even shows a bit of self-conscious humor at the end. Those who find fault with such \\"fluff\\" obviously have never understood that Ozzy Osbourne has always been \\"funny\\", albeit usually unintentionally.<br /><br />Of course Ozzy does mean business on these songs. \\"Diggin' Me Down\\" is yet another attack on religion, specifically Christianity. The problem is Ozzy doesn't seem to understand Christianity very well. When he asks \\"So come on Jesus/Don't keep us waiting here for you/How long? Cause my faith is breaking/The pure and divine are diggin' me, diggin' me down\\" he appears unaware that Christians do have an answer to that question. Still, I really want to believe Ozzy is at least somewhat sincere here. After all, the \\"problem of evil\\" has been one of the most difficult theological issues facing the Judeo-Christian mind for centuries. How can a loving God exist while the world is full of evil? Though there's good explanations it is a fair question. \\"The son of man or an obsolete facade/How will I know you're the Son of God?\\". He's tackled these subjects before but his focus is more mature, balanced and even thought-provoking, rather than simple disdainful mockery (\\"Miracle Man\\" for example).<br /><br />\\"Crucify\\" directs it's angst towards politicians. \\"Time\\" has Ozzy lamenting the dilemma of mankind: \\" Our destiny connected,Invited, unexpected,Life isn't fair, but still it goes on (goes on)/We all live and we all die,Say hello then say goodbye,The sun will set until the next dawn (next dawn)\\" . Has Ozzy been reading Ecclesiastes?<br /><br />Back to the sound of the record. Guitarist Gus G doesn't sound all that different from his predecessor Zack Wylde. That's not a bad thing. The production mixes traces of industrial, doom, alternative rock, muddy grunge so it never sounds as sterile and polished like earlier efforts (\\"The Ultimate Sin\\", \\"No More Tears\\") and I for one enjoy the new (to Ozzy that is) sound he's been building since his previous set, \\"Black Rain\\". The only drawback is the album does seem to turn stale the more you listen to it. Time will tell if this one holds up.
B000J2BRQU|5.0|As I was telling VD on facebook the other day, the official rankings of Fast/Furious movies are as follows:<br /><br />1) The Fast and The Furious<br />2) Tokyo Drift<br />3) Fast & Furious<br />4) Fast Five<br />...<br />...<br />...<br />Last) 2 fast 2 furious<br /><br />Tokyo Drift even out performs two of the Diesel movies, which is truly a remarkable accomplishment.  There are really only 2 reasons for this.  1) Han, the greatest character in Furious history.  2) Bow Wow, incredibly underrated performance, I'd compare it to DeNiro in Godfather 2.<br /><br />Top 5 Han Quotes in no order because Han is not a competitive man:<br />1) Fifty percent of something is better than a hundred percent of nothing.<br />2) I have money, it's trust and character I need around me. You know, who you choose to be around you lets you know who you are. One car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of? That's a price I can live with.<br />3) Life's simple, you make choices and you don't look back.<br />4) Police cars here are only factory tuned.If you can do better than 180K they can't catch you, so they don't even try.<br />5) You didn't just play with fire, you soaked the matches in gasoline<br /><br />Finally, just to be comprehensive in this review, Lucas Black, while a better actor than the criminally inept Paul Walker, doesn't add too much to the movie, but the hot half-australian (?) female lead certainly does.  That's about it for me.  This is a top movie and should be treated as such.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love being able to just pop this cd in and enjoying the songs! Great quality! The emotion really comes through well!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Downloaded game thinking that the graphics would be good as some reviewers  stated. Wasn't impressed at all with graphics.  Yawn. Uninstalled game.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|Hemingway draws you into the thinking and feelings of a group of partisan fighters operating behind the fascist lines and explores their reasons for what they do. He also reveals the rural Spanish people, their suspicions, lives and culture at that time. A great read.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I could not put this book down. I am the typical western parent that she so frequently speaks of. I found myself questioning my parenting style every time I turned the page. We are all tiger mothers in our own regard. Very thought provoking and well written. Inspired by her words.
1878424114|5.0|I loved this book, it can be read many times in your life and always brings new ideas and ways to find new meaning to our every day existance.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I*'m only 20% through the book, but have totally enjoyed the author's desire to bring his readers up to date on the adventures of others we have met.  The world doesn't stand still for the characters.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|this game reset my progress twice, at first it was in the beginning and I got it back. but now I had about 2000000 coins and it reset it, never to get it back. I cant stand to play it anymore its too sad to see all my progress and charecters gone. please kiloo, don't do this to another player :'(
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I would like those two nights of my life back when I attempted to get through more than half of this book. The writing is awful, repetitive and surprisingly dull, given the subject matter. I held out longer than I usually would have, expecting that, because of the popularity of this book and all of the media attention its garnered, it HAD to get better or something interesting HAD to happen at some point. But: freaking no and double crap no.<br /><br />The plot: the main character (name: Anastasia Steele. No, really, that's her name.) has sex with this guy, then finds her hair tie, then has more sex, then stocks the shelves at work, then has more sex, then eats pizza with her roommate, then has more sex, then shaves her legs... all the while fl/blushing, biting her lip over and over, and looking through her eyelashes a lot...and sucking at the English language and northwest U.S. geography. The sex scenes are described in the voice of a 10th grader who has no experience with sex, with the sexually naive Miss Steele having an orgasm on every other page, sometimes just because her beau has said her name. I don't know how the book ends and do not care at all.<br /><br />Although its not my typical genre, there is MUCH better erotica out there, with, you know, like, plots and interesting dialogue and stuff.<br /><br />I do not understand how this book made it into the mainstream.
B003UD7JEO|5.0|Nikita is no exception to this. Maggie Q is excellence in this high action and suspense role of being a rogue agent from &#34;Division&#34;. She really pulls it off, and there is a great supporting cast.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|double yay! I have had zero problems with this app. way to go Idaho :) I give you five thumbs up. Wanna play words with friends?
B00866H7SS|5.0|Awesome book can't wait for the release of the third book in the series. Love the storyline and the characters
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game...its very addicting and fun to play :-) The only thing wrong is the fact that it doesn't save your progress after your done playing :-/
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first and the  book has so much more details. It was great.  Could not put it down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Awesome. I love to play it In my free time. Very good but closes a lot. Love the games but they are a little expensive
B004UOE7VA|5.0|If you've bought the original Tron soundtrack, love Daft Punk, and love the guest DJ's that did the remixes on this album, there's no way you can go wrong with picking up this album.  More of the traditional varied electronic sound that comes from the guest DJ's than the score of the original, obviously, but still keeps the feel of the Tron universe.  I loved it.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I am so glad I ordered this. I love the functionality of it: snaps  in easily, the magnet turns it off and on when opened closed and I can read in any position I want. The.beat part is how it flips over so you can set your kindle at ANY angle, not just 1 angle. Also  the elastic closure gives me.Love  of mind, the leather is beautiful and such a great price-
0316228532|4.0|definitely not what i was expecting. it is a little boring hard to get into it. as a harry potter fan was expecting more
B009H442DG|2.0|This photo promised a lot, but John and Olivia don't perform much, and for me, the other songs are mediocre!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|It's worth the price alone to me to see and hear Robin Gibb sing I Started a Joke.<br />I borrowed from library and pretty quickly saw I had to own one. They will never sing together again, better get this in my library. It's pretty hard not to love them when they sing How Deep Is Your Love !!<br /><br />Their documentary Bee Gees: In Our Own Time is a terrific intimate portrait of them, one long interview of their candid thoughts and story of their rise told by them. You can stream that on Netflix. It's also outstanding.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put it down.<br />Wonderful, definitely as good as the first, some unexpected twists. Can't wait to get to the next
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Keep them coming guys! One of my favorite albums they have. The music is good and heavier than snakes and arrows. The lyrics speak to me a lot. Carnies and wish them well i think are my favorites. Buy this! do your ears a favor.
B00005JPAO|5.0|HELEN MIRREN WAS THE PERFECT PERSON FOR THIS PART. IT BROUGHT TO LIFE HOW THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND IS JUST AS HUMAN AS ANYONE ELSE WITH SUCH A POWERFUL JOB GIVEN TO HER AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE

B007QUUJMG|4.0|Enjoyed this book, especially the lead character, Charlie. Felt the ending was left a bit up in the air but nevertheless a good read which I enjoyed.
B007PS0DTI|3.0|Underworld Awakening is a good movie, well in line with the other Underworld movies. Interesting developments and more character development. I look forward to seeing where they take the story next.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app does what it should, easy to use, looks great!<br />Adds are not invasive, all you could expect from a free app.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Originally, I thought &quot;This game looks terrible&quot; and over looked it. Then it became free. So I gave it a try. Really good
B005K17RU0|1.0|I put this on and took it off in the same day, not really a big fan of it.  I have weather on my pc so it wasn't a necessary thing and I just didn't see any reason for it.<br />Sorry.
1439157383|5.0|The movie had just came out and I wanted to read the book first. This is a very good book and so is the movie. I would recommend it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|the one that came with my new fire didn't work, so I needed to replace it, the nice guy at customer service discounted the cost for me but I did srtill have to pay the shipping.  Not as nice as it could have been:(
B008MM9630|5.0|Fairy Farm is an awesome and fun game. Sometimes the challenges can be challenging ,but fun. You'll like this game if you like farming, animals, and challenges. So, if you like all of those things then you'll like Fairy Farm.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very good<br /> Graphics.  Great lay out.  Lots of adventure.  Good story.  Nice and detailed.  Lots of features.  Enjoyed this journey!
B0026P3G12|5.0|So glad the world found Susan Boyle -- she has such a beautiful voice, and the song selections in this record are outstanding!
B0063GORYU|2.0|I'm used to the game on the computer.  I don't like this one, maybe because I'm comoparing it to the one I use on laptop.  I'll not use this one. .
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Bought for my niece, because we couldn't find it in store.  Accidentally got sent the spanish version, but sent it back and got the correct one within 4 days.
1611134226|5.0|Great, unexpected turns in the plot.  These two authors remain among my favorites. I purchased the book on cd and would also laud the reader,Rene Auberjonois.  His voice is absolutely spot on for Pendergast.  If you are familiar with the series, &#34;Two Graves&#34; will not dissapoint.
B0091REZMW|4.0|For being free it is worth playing! I like continual play games not ones I have to keep paying in order to continue. Like I said it is just ok!
B008CLI3TE|5.0|If you like medieval stuff, this is defenatly for you! It is very real in certain scenes, but i love it, have seen the second season and just wainting for the third!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Incredible book...absolutely loved it.  Its one of those books that you need mental space and time for because you get so hooked in that you really dont care about being late for appointments or cooking dinner.  I lived on tea and biscuits until I finished it!!  I was really surprised that the main characters are so young, but they are convincingly realistic ad you truly feel part of their world.  The story plot has amazing twists and turns, but it all comes together in the end and you are left feeling completely satisfied - I hate those stories that leave you hanging so you have to wait to buy the next book.  Colleen Hoover's writing is so good, that I will buy her books without needing the incentive to find out what happens next.  There are parts that are so beautiful that they almost leave you breathless...I just loved the build up for the kiss thats not a kiss, it was so poignant.  I frowned, worried, laughed, cried and sighed .... I think I will be reading this book a lot.  Buy it...you wont regret it!
B003YCI1O8|4.0|This is quite a humorous movie - not to be taken seriously, of course. It made an excellent addition to my movie collection.<br />However, I would say that I don't really understand or much like the &#34;BD Live&#34; component (for &#34;bonus content&#34; it says on the back of the case): it kept telling me that it was trying to and failing to connect to the internet before it would play the movie and it bothered me. Not a big deal, but a nuisance.
034553154X|5.0|Everything I could ask for and more.  If you like the books, you'll love this calender.  I'm really happy with this purchase
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I was looking for an app that has a calendar, check list & some note taking (I didn't want anything too confusing). This app has exactly that. It's so easy to use and perfect for what I need. I can \\"color code\\" different appointments etc. School activities for me are red, doc appts are green and birthdays are orange. Glancing at the entire month I've got a good idea of whats what. Love it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fabulous book. Very easy reading. Couldn't put it down once I started. The story was riveting - once I started the first book (The Hunger Games ) , I just had to get the second book.  Went straight to the third book when I finished the second book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good game to play while watching tv. cards play themselves which is very convenient. overall would actually pay a small fee for app.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|If you're a Family Guy fan this movie would probably be a 4 or 5 star rating for you. Stop reading, go watch this film.<br /><br />Ok, now that they're gone, I'll speak to everyone else. There were some genuinely laugh out loud parts, but overall if you're not a fan of Seth MacFarlane and his other work then you'll probably be disappointed by this. The editing was a little awkward at times, the story doesn't build a ton of momentum, and the Flash Gordon bit is a little overplayed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Super suspense and I could not stop reading. A lot of great details that keeps you thinking until you reach the end.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Awesome Price. Fast Shipping. No complaints. I love this band. I'm glad that I ordered this. Can't wait to get more Halestorm in my collection.
B0086700CM|3.0|The game is good but the shop is bad. I had 10000 coins but then I accidentally purchased something and lost 5000
B003Q6D27S|5.0|Better than I imagined it would be. Gotta love the price and fast shipping. I would suggest you watch. You won't be disappointed.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is totally awesome.It was a perfect balance of scary and suspensefulness<br /> .It felt like I was in the game.Overall, it was amazing in graphics.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This app is great for creating pleasant background noise and even allows you to layer the sounds so you can create your own mixes. If they ever consider being able to save your own favorites I'd probably upgrade to the paid version of this app.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Not a terribly complicated thing to figure out, but we'll written, fast paced and a great read!  Starting the next book in the series now!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Worth every penny. Loads of fun. Addictive, smooth game play, tantalizing combo of easy to learn but tough to master, highly replayable.

B0010SKUYM|4.0|I like this book becuase the story is told a different way yet it is very engaging.  It leaves me to wonder what will actually happen in real time to the main character.
B00062RBOA|5.0|An extremely sensitive and totally thrilling recording that maintains the highest Brahmsian standards throughout.  How wonderful to experience and become thoroughly enrapt in wave after wave of that sublime Brahms \\"organ\\" sonority as produced by this excellent orchestra under the most accomplished baton of maestro Carlos Kleiber!
1609613937|1.0|There are a lot of things I like about McDougal's prescription:<br /><br />* it is a whole-foods based nutrition plan with minimal supplements. Whole foods are indeed much healthier than processed foods and supplements. Dr Terry Wahls only healed her MS when she added whole-foods to her supplements (google her Ted Talk video, inspiring)<br />* it eliminates vegetable/seed oils and trans-fats (e.g. no corn, peanut, soy, safflower, sunflower, cottonseed, canola oils). These oils are one of the major causes of chronic disease, and eliminating them is extremely beneficial<br />* it will help most people lose weight and improve their health on a short-term basis. In the long run, though, it creates numerous deficiencies and will lead to poor health. A much better approach is to make sure that you don't have any deficiencies or excesses. The most thorough and scientific approach I've seen is the Jaminet's [[ASIN:B007USA6MM Perfect Health Diet]] -- their approach will help you lose weight while you correct any existing malnutrition, and will result in excellent long-term health.<br />* McDougal eliminates soy, wheat, and dairy for people with auto-immune issues. Since auto-immune issues are triggered by leaky gut and these foods all contribute to poor gut integrity, eliminating them helps many people. For the rest, it almost always resolves issues to eliminate all grains, especially corn, to eliminate all legumes and nightshades, and to eliminate any other foods that trigger allergies (e.g. an IgG inflammatory response).<br /><br />So, what happens on a long-term basis with McDougall's plan?<br /><br />I was a vegan for over a year, eating a diet very much like McDougals: no added fats, no supplements. The main difference is that I was getting most of my calories from ripe fruit, and wasn't eating grains/legumes/root vegetables. So much higher fructose than on McDougall's plan, otherwise very similar. It was fantastic for about 4 months: my blood sugar was perfect, I woke up every morning with it at 83. My weight dropped about 10 pounds, to what I had weighed in college. I felt fantastic, and I loved eating all the fruit and greens.<br /><br />Then things stopped working: my blood sugar was erratic, I was hungry all the time, I started having irritable bowel syndrome, I had extremely low blood pressure, my libido evaporated, I started getting cavities. I finally stopped the vegan diet and moved to more of a paleo diet, still grain-free/legume-free, but eating meat and cooked root vegetables (along the lines of [[ASIN:B007USA6MM Perfect Health Diet]]). It took about a year to recover, but now I feel great all the time, my blood markers are excellent, my teeth are great with no tartar/plaque, and I wake up every day with my blood sugar perfect at 83. The best predictors for longevity are low triglycerides, high HDL, and low fasting insulin, and that is exactly where I am today.<br /><br />If you do go on McDougall's plan, what are the nutrients you should supplement or consider supplementing?<br /><br />* DHA. This is a long-chain omega-3 fat. Your brain and body absolutely need 1 gram/day for optimal health. You can get this from whole foods if you eat fatty wild-caught fish or eat fermented-fish-liver oil. On a vegan diet, you can get it from algae-based DHA supplements.<br />* Vitamin D. Your body uses sunlight to convert cholesterol to Vitamin D. When you have extremely low cholesterol as is typical on McDougall's diet, your body cannot create as much Vitamin D, and vegans tend to be quite deficient. McDougall on his web site says that levels of 20 are probably ok, but actual studies show that 40 is optimal for bone health in Caucasians, and 30 for African-Americans, so I suspect that his claim is because people on his diet have lower Vitamin D than most.<br />* Vitamin A. Your body will convert beta-carotene to Vitamin A, but conversion rates vary and most people need additional Vitamin A (retinol) from their diet. Animal-based foods such as fermented fish-liver oil are an excellent source. My own tooth health is excellent taking 10,000 IU of retinol per day from fermented fish-liver oil, but only 3,000 IU per day didn't have the same effect. This is despite eating a ton of high-beta carotene veggies such as squash and kale.<br />* Vitamin K2. There are two kinds of vitamin K: K1 (from plants) and K2 (from animals). K2 is much more effective for bone health, for putting calcium in the right places, and for removing it from calcified arteries or tissues. Your body converts some K1 to K2, and your gut bacteria can produce K2 if you have the right varieties. If you have adequate Vitamin A and D (probably 10,000 IU/day of A, 4,000 IU/day of D), then your body will upregulate its conversion of K1 to K2, but on a vegan diet you need to supplement to have adequate A/D. Studies show that populations eating higher K2 have longer lives and better health, so it seems prudent to supplement this. See the excellent book [[ASIN:1118065727 Vitamin K2 and the Calcium Paradox: How a Little-Known Vitamin Could Save Your Life]] for more details.<br />* Zinc. A plant-food based diet is marginal for zinc. Good sources, such as pumpkin seeds, are high omega-6 polyunsaturated fat so have a downside.<br />* Selenium. This mineral is essential for thyroid health and for your immune system. You can get this from chicken yolks, and mushrooms also concentrate selenium. Brazil nuts from Brazil are high, but usually have mycotoxin contamination. Plants will have selenium to the extent that the soil they grow in has selenium, but most soils are selenium-deficient.<br />* Iodine. This is also essential for thyroid health and for your immune system. This you can get from seaweed, [[ASIN:B00024D1ZA Nature's Way Kelp Capsules, 180-Count]] is a good source. Start with one per day and ramp up to 6 per day. This particular seaweed also helps reduce tartar and plaque. Plants have iodine depending on how close they are to the ocean, so most are low.<br />* Taurine, carnitine, creatine, glutamine, carnosine, and glycine. You can get some of these from egg yolks and whole-fat dairy, but likely still want to supplement. On a strictly vegan diet these should be supplemented.<br />* B12 is of course an issue on vegan diets, and McDougall does recommend supplementing it<br />* There are numerous other potential deficiencies discussed in more detail in the Jaminet's [[ASIN:B007USA6MM Perfect Health Diet]] book.<br /><br />A major long-term deficiency on McDougall's diet is long-chain saturated fat. Your body needs fat for cell membranes, for its immune system, and to switch to fat-burning mode instead of sugar (glucose) burning mode. In particular, long-chain saturated fat is required to stabiize your blood sugar. (This explains why my blood sugar was so good for the first months on a McDougall-type diet, as my body used up my store of saturated fat. Once it was gone, things went downhill.)<br /><br />Your body can manufacture long-chain saturated fat for its critical needs, but it can't manufacture enough to switch into fat-burning mode. On an extremely low-fat diet, you are always burning glucose. This means that you cannot fast, because your blood sugar just keeps dropping. All of your cells are extremely insulin-sensitive all the time, and they will all suck up glucose until there isn't enough for your brain to function.<br /><br />So, if you stay on McDougall's diet long-term, at some point you will want to start supplementing with long-chain saturated fat for optimal health. You can use dark chocolate and cocoa butter for this if you want to stay vegan. Butter is also a good source, as it is about 45% long-chain saturated fat.<br /><br />McDougall says on his web site that a healthy fasting blood glucose is 50 to 100. I can't find any evidence for this, because your body tries to stabilize your blood glucose at 83. When your blood glucose is higher, your pancreas puts out insulin to tell yourcells to take up the excess. At levels below 83, your pancreas puts out glucagon to tell your liver to release stored glucose to keep your blood sugar stable. So the ideal is 83. Our bodies are well-tuned to optimal levels, and extremes, either above/below, cause health issues.<br /><br />The only population studies I know of for a culture eating extremely low long-chain saturated fats is for the Kitavans. They live in the Polynesian islands, and their traditional diet was only 5% animal, from fish. The rest was plant sources from sweet potatoes, coconut, etc. It was actually a higher-fat diet than McDougall's because coconuts are high-fat, but coconut fat is all short and medium chain fats, almost no long-chain. Their fasting blood glucose averaged 67, which is what you'd expect if they couldn't stabilize their blood sugar and it dropped all night while they were sleeping. They apparently did not live extremely long lives, usually dying in their 70's, even though they did not get heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, etc. I suspect that their bodies simply wore out from constantly burning glucose -- our metabolism is optimized to include fat as a fuel source., so most are low.<br />* Taurine, carnitine, creatine, glutamine, carnosine, and glycine.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another excellent book by Rick Riordan full of excitement and danger can't wait for the next. Wish it was already out
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Excellent characters, and the actors pulled the need for mending a relationship off - with their usual professionalism. I was surprised at the pairing of Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, but it worked beautifully.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I like how the writing flowed and kept me reading page after page!<br />It's a very good weekend book to get lost in.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|This is a nice little $20 set, with 4 minifigs: c-3po, r2-d2, and two sandtroopers (which have very nice detail). The escape pod has better detail than the old one, and the speeder bike is top-notch. I like the sand on the sandtroopers, it is nice to have another version of the white stormtrooper armor, it can get pretty boring just having white armor on every soldier in your imperial army. Overall this is a great set and I would recommend this to any lego/star wars fan.
B0061S073A|5.0|Now I can let my kids play games and not worry about what they click on or what they might purchase by accident. Works perfectly!!  No problems at all!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|This movie, like most Bond flicks, is visually stunning and action packed. But it goes so much further into Bond's attributes and history! In some respects. I see this movie as archetypal, reflecting a Bond at the mid life and going through. Individuation, with things symbolically emerging as he emerges from \\"death\\" and what it means for him.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Interesting, confusing, but glad that I read it. Makes you think deeper,  it's about a man who found his faith,
B007QPFGJW|5.0|This is the 2nd Jo Nesbo mystery novel that I've read.<br />They make you think as to character names, back & forth events & backgrounds.<br />It was a pleasure to read.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Tons of different puzzles. I like figuring them out and watching the picture appear.so far I am only working on the easy ones.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I actually liked this book better than Gone Girl.  It's the only one of the author's three books in which the main character is remotely sympathetic.  But how can this author be critically acclaimed?  What does that mean?  Who are these critics? This is not quality fiction. It's horror and cheap thrills for people who have grown up with too much television and video games. The best thing I can say about Flynn's books is that they're quick reads that kept me entertained on the exercise bike.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Wonder.  There were many underlying issues that were addressed in a well-written, heart-warming style.  This book brought tears to my eyes.
0525478817|3.0|I don't know how many stars it deserves, really.<br /><br />First, this is the only John Green novel I have ever read, and as a YA author, I will admit that he seems to have chops.  Because I liked his style and because I teach high school, I will explore more of his work.  The dialogue is a lot like Dawson's Creek, with teenagers who think they're incredibly profound and self-aware, making literary references and speaking in SAT words.<br /><br />However (and this may be me bringing my own baggage to this book), it fell into the cancer porn category for me.  The cancer wasn't hidden only to be sprung upon you later (unlike, say, the film Stepmom), but it still becomes very \\"cancer-as-entertainment.\\"<br /><br />Maybe I shouldn't have read this one, because it struck a pretty touchy chord with me that way.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Deleted it right away wanted to much infromation about me from facebook. didn't want to give that type of infomation out.

(with jackd2) Tried on Arch Linux x64 and works flawlessly. Worth mentioning that ALSA DOES NOT HAVE VOLUME CONTROL but you can just use the physical hardware controls.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What an incredibly well written book.  The twists and turns kept me in suspense and wanting more. One chapter I would be on Nicks' side then the next I'm pulling for Amy.  Gone Girl takes you on a ride of different emotions and I loved every minute of it.  It's a must read!!!!!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|its ok but you only have 16 minutes to play and if you want to save and play again you have to pay otherwise is cool and free
B00338QENI|5.0|Author was very thorough and intriguing. Very informative!<br />Hela cells have opened my eyes to the importance and capitalizing ways  of science.

B00457WZEI|5.0|I chose this rating because of the excitement, sadness & over all the storyline.  I absolutely adored this book and I would recommend it to people of all ages; if you lobe adventure through a Horses eyes of course.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|So much better then the movie. Please read on and get the other books which come after this one so you can enjoy the whole story. I sure once you start you won't be able to stop at just one.
B009K0OPQQ|3.0|**SPOILER ALERT! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!**<br /><br />I really enjoyed season 1 of \\"Once Upon a Time.\\" By no means is it a perfect show, but it's entertaining and it has a really interesting plot. I was very excited to season 2 to come.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's been something of a letdown to be honest. Don't get me wrong, I still think it's an entertaining show and I'm hoping it will get better. But compared to season 1, season 2 of \\"Once Upon a Time\\" has had some weak episodes.<br /><br />I feel like the plot is starting to get stretched out a little too thin. I'm sure the writers of the show have some twists up their sleeve, but as of right now, the story is all ready starting to feel thin. How it will last for another two or three seasons, I'm not sure.<br /><br />There have been a few interesting plot twists in season 2, and make no mistake. Introducing Captain Hook and bringing Cora and King George to bigger roles have all been interesting twists. We also see some more of other characters, like Belle, and we finally find out who Henry's father is.<br /><br />But I feel like the introduction of these charcacters is causing a few problems. There's almost too many storylines to follow and the plot's tripping on its own feet. For the first half of season 2 (any episode before the winter finale in December), we follow three different worlds. We go back to pre-curse Fairy-Tale Land, to get backstory on certain characters, we also have scenes in the real world, and we get scenes in present-day Fairy-Tale Land, post-curse. It gets a bit disorienting to follow. There were some episodes where I just sat there and thought, \\"What is going on?\\"<br /><br />Several characters have sort of disappeared off the radar. King George, for example, made an appearance in Storybrooke, causes some crap to happen, and then...and then...oh, he disappeared. He hasn't been on the show since the episode \\"Child of the Moon\\" (I believe that's what it was called.) What happened to him? We don't know. Who cares anyway? It's not like he's a major villain or anything. *sarcasm* And what about August? He turned to wood at the end of season 1. We see him in the second episode, petrified in bed, then Gepetto goes looking for him and...he's gone. What happened to him? We don't know. Apparently, he just got up and walked away. (And where would he go when he looked like a giant puppet?) Dr. Whale disappeared as soon as we found out who he is, although he's slated to make a reappearance in a few weeks.<br /><br />New characters have also been introduced this season. We find out that the fairy-tale world still exists and that there was a part of the fairy-tale world the curse didn't effect. Princess Aurora and Mulan both lived in this section of fairy-tale world and come into play in the season opener. Unfortunately, neither are well-developed. If I'm being completely honest, I find Princess Aurora quite annoying. She doesn't do much which, in a show with kick-butt princess and a grandma who carries a crossbow, doesn't go over well. She pales in comparison to Snow White, Red Riding Hood, heck, even Granny. Mulan could be interesting, but she comes off as kind of a psycho b-word a lot of the time. She's tough, but a lot of the time, she tries to be too controlling and,l ike Aurora, she doesn't get much character development either, making it hard to care about her. In this season, we're also introduced to Captain Hook, who I have mixed feelings for. On one hand, he has his interesting moments, but I feel like he's just there to fill the \\"hot-brooding-bad-boy\\" void.<br /><br />We also get new backstory on some characters. **MAJOR, MAJOR SPOILERS IN THE NEXT FEW SENTENCES**<br /><br />We find out just what, exactly, happened to Rumpelstiltskin's wife, Milah. Hook fell in love with her, Milah ran off, Rumpelstiltskin confronted her and....and....ripped her heart out. Okay, then. I had a bit of a difficult time buying that, to he honest. Although Milah didn't really love Rumpelstiltskin, he really seemed to love her, or at least like her enough. Then she runs off and Rumpel kills her. Okay, then. It's not totally unfathomable, but it felt a bit random. If anything, it felt like a push to make Rumplestiltskin \\"more bad\\", 'cause, y'know, he wasn't evil enough all ready.<br /><br />We also get some backstory on Regina and the specifics on her start to learning magic and turning really, really evil. (Dr. Frankenstein, aka Dr. Whale, attempts to bring Daniel back to life. He fails, on purpose, so Regina turns bitter and lets Rumpelstiltskin teach her magic. The end.) I didn't really have any gripes with the backstory we got with her.<br /><br />I do, however, have a bit of a gripe with her sudden change-of-heart. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that it's impossible for Regina to be just so evil nothing could ever change her. But it all happened very fast. All of the sudden, she's like, \\"I'll change for you, Henry! I'll be a better mother!\\" And within that episode, she's suddenly trying to be benevolent and virtuous. Like I said, it's not impossible for her to be good, but holy crap it happened fast.<br /><br />Despite my many gripes with the show this season, I do think it's still an enjoyable TV show and a lot better than some stuff on TV. This season is definitely weaker than season 1, but I'm hoping the writers will pull through and OuaT will improve.ve Rumpelstiltskin, he really seemed to love her, or at least like her enough.

B000E1YVZU|2.0|It is hard to recreate a live show and the director did not try to do that.  I have seen Rent several times when it was still on tour and this movie does not come close to doing the story any justice.  The movie took out a few numbers and changed the context of some of the story.  It seems to drag on at times, which is disappointing.  It is nice to see several members from the original cast, but event hey can't make this a great buy.  I think the &#34;Live&#34; version is a much better purchase.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Loved the first book and kept on reading to see what happens in the end. Carn't wait to see the movie when it is made to see wether the movie can live up to the book.

B004SEUJK0|2.0|I love the book and am not quite sure why the movie even bears the same title.  The story and some of the characters have been changed completely.  If you haven't read the book, the movie might be more enjoyable, but it's difficult to know.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|is the great game a play is so fun to do it that play and thats is so nice great good
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour is an action packed, adrenaline rushing FPS game that deserves a successor. The graphics are undoubtedly the best I've seen on the Amazon market, the gameplay has been perfected, the sounds are realistic, and the storyline is a thrilling experience. I bought this game for the multiplayer, and what I got was not what I expected, it was 1,000 Times better than that. The multiplayer is fast paced and the servers always have players.<br />The story ranges from Spain to Seattle to South Africa and even takes place in Antarctica!<br />This game is worth your money, trust me and the hundreds of other reviewers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Much more challenging than I thought it would be when I started the game.  I won't give up until I find the solution.  You can play for a short time or for as long as you want.
B001P06GX4|4.0|Great game for all ages. I gave this game to my granddaughter for Christmas. We all enjoyed playing. Kids learn shapes and strategy.
B00979CS50|5.0|I saw Neil on this tour and received the free cd which wasn't very good. Once I found out that they were putting a new album out I preordered it. If you like the Everybody Knows This is Nowhere period of Neil and the Horse this cd is for you- extended long jams and Neil's voice seems as good as ever. Highly recommend if you are a Neil fan- great CD!!
0765325950|1.0|Pathetic.<br /><br />That's the only word I have to say about the author's widow.  You dislike the e-book format?  So I guess you like cutting down trees huh?  I guess you don't give 2 cents about our troops overseas who may want to read it on their kindle or iPhone.  I have sympathy that you lost your husband before his time - he was a good writer.  But this type of decision is just petty and spiteful and grounded in the fact you dislike e-books.  Get a life.<br /><br />-Annoyed Fan

B003U6BE8I|1.0|This movie is the same story as the book in name only! the directors and writors created a different story plot removed Ares,  Cerberus, the waterbed scene the diner the animal carrier scenes the bus scene the fates and Kronos out completely took out Hades hood of darknessand just about everything else was changed. they made a different plot with limited characters and for the most part poor acting through it together with an overly large budget and paid enough for the writes to call it Percy Jackson. Lastly is percy jackson a 6th grader no he's a high schooler with a crush I give this movie two thumbs done.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I Love this game and how it is just like the tv series, brony for  life<br />That is the way to play
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|Some of these reviewers are infuriating! I didn't particularly love the accent of the narrator, that's because I'm an American and would naturally prefer it spoken in a tone most resembling California-speak. On that score, I'd feel the same if it were a thick Southern or Brooklyn accent. However, it's a small price to pay for such a fine educational experience. Also, one of the reviewers complained about the lack of \\"expert\\" historians and was also upset that the director said things as fact that were just his opinion, such as where a given director got his inspiration for a certain shot. Given the subject is film and not chemistry I have no trouble accepting the director's presumptions. I would find it excruciatingly tedious if half of the film was devoted to more careful phraseology, expressing in precise terms what was his opinion and what was verified fact. My perception is that the filmmakers have studied what came before them and they liberally borrowed.  I may have been more critical had this been one of ten thousand films on the subject, but I've seen nothing of this caliber so far. If there are better attempts, please let me know.
0307341550|3.0|I am still a little confused with this book.  I honestly don't know if I liked it or not!!  One thing I do know is that I could not put the stupid thing down!!  Read it in about a day and a half.<br /><br />She wrote about something that I truly do not no anything about.  Firstly the self harm stuff is completely foreign to me and then there is that horrible, horrible disease when mothers hurt their children.  There is a name for it but I can't spell it although I know it begins with M.<br /><br />This book is very readable and certainly a powerful psychological thriller. I was thinking about it days after finishing it!
0345803485|1.0|I wasn't impressed with this book.  I read about a book a week and I had to force myself to finish it. I certainly did not bother with the other two.  I lent it to my neighbor and she returned it in two days.  She didn't finish it.
B005SMGRH0|5.0|Cool tunes with great lyrics and musical score. Especially enjoy &#34;Clint Eastwood&#34;. Good this rockin' good time with a good, cold brew.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Fun movie, always enjoy Anna  Kendrick, loved Anna Camp and Brittany Snow, Rebel was a hoot as always. Having said that the story is somewhat weak and most of the truly funny lines are in the trailers. Still a must see.

B004LSO6YI|5.0|This movie is well worth your time to go and watch, it was extremely well written and the acting is superb, should consider watching if you like a lesbian love story with internal conflict throughout!
B005LAII80|5.0|Just watched it and absolutely loved it. Im glad they came up with a new plot for this movie. It's sad that it didnt do well in the theaters, due to the original Judge Dredd film being so terrible, but this one really redeems the name and stands as a great piece of cinema. Its definitely going in my favorites.If you like the cyberpunk genre, this movie will fit in for you.
