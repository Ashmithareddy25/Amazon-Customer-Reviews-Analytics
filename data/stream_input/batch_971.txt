B00005MNHS|3.0|Though a classic rock album, the sound quality of this cd is rather poor.  Should get a better edition instead.
B000I2J24A|5.0|I love this book; and I don't care if you've never baked in your life, or if you never bake a single thing from this book, if you've ever been comforted by baking, or cooking,  you'll love this book. It's not an ordinary cookbook. It's not for grabbing when you need to throw together some last minute cupcakes for your kids' school bake sale. It's for when you have time alone, and you curl up in your favorite chair, with a steaming cup of tea, or a glass of good red wine, and you savor it...like you would a very moist, very chocolate, homemade piece of warm chocolate cake with melting, creamy vanilla ice cream on the side. Highly recommended!
B000002OZY|5.0|A classic rock opera that should be listened by anyone who is interested in the development of rock and roll.  Period.
0670021652|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it seemed like it took the author a very time to reach a pretty obvious conclusion. On the other hand, I rather liked the writing style. The author seems like a pleasant enough person, and some of her observations are interesting. I'm not sorry I read it, but I probably won't bother to read any more books by this author.
0393061310|4.0|I read the book in a Chinese translation a long time ago. As all the footnotes and bibliography were not included in the Chinese edition, I ordered a hardcover of the original book and found there is a new chapter on Japan added at the end.  It is a very inspiring book to anyone who is concerned with the fate of mankind.  Readers interested in the author's view should also read his other books, namely \\"Third Chimpanzee\\", \\"Why is sex fun?\\" and \\"Collapse\\".
0316069906|4.0|A book my son encouraged me to read.. It tells of issues I intuitively knew existed but have spent years trying to ignore. I will no longer go on blindly and it has changed my life which is a shame considering how happy I was before !!!!.. I encourage reading this book but then send it to someone who will care as much as you will.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a great young adult title. It's a quick and enjoyable read. The story is a good one, but the twists and turns are easily decipherable. I read the book to my nine year old and she had things figured out before we got to the point on the page. I prefer something a little more challenging but my daughter was thrilled she was right about what happened next. There were a couple of places that the humor was outside her reach, but my husband and I got a chuckle from it. The book is a good learning tool for Greek mythology set in modern times. I recommend buying the book, taking an afternoon, and reading it cover to cover.
1584282584|5.0|After reading this book, my flash photography has changed radically. This is the best book on flash photography that I've read. Neil is an experienced photographer who knows how to cover plainly and accurately their knowledge and experience of photography. Your [...] page is full of tips and detailed explanations of how he achieved his great performance, which shows us openly and unselfishly, answered the questions many photographers you do every day.  Neil is a genius of communication and therefore every day more followers through webb page, because we're all happy and grateful for his great contribution to the knowledge of photography. So I agree that as it refers to photography, \\"Neil is the man.\\"
0312383436|5.0|I bought the first Shopaholic book when it came out in the UK as The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic and thought it was hilarious.  I've been following Sophie/Madeline ever since, and feel like her topics are growing up at just about the same pace I am.  I can see why some people who are expecting more of the Shopaholic fun to be disappointed by this, but that's why she writes with two names - these Madeline Wickham books are always more thoughtful and slightly darker.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved it.  I loved the twists and turns, I loved the characters, and I loved all the different perspectives she writes from.  It's still a fun book, don't get me wrong.  It's not all serious.  Just deals with more real issues than the Shopaholic books.  The story and characters have more depth.<br /><br />Still, I read it on a flight and it was a wonderful way to pass four hours.  I really hope Madeline Wickham sticks around for a long time!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This is the first season of the \\"Legend of the Seeker\\". Although they took some major departures from the story line present in the books, I still think that it is one of the greatest fantasy TV Series that has ever been filmed. This season starts on the midland side of the border and chronicles Richard's fight against Darken Raul. There is non stop \\"sword of truth\\" action against Mor'd sith, Darken Raul's D'Haren Soldiers, and evil wizards. If you've ever dreamed of being a level 9 fighter with a +10 sword of power - you won't be disappointed in this series.
B00319ECHE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to hear that Dino Cazares and Burton C. Bell were working together as Fear Factory again last year. This album - despite the petulant whining of some nameless reviews - is a fine return to form for the group. This is NOT a record you can grasp completely upon just one sitting. After three listens I am still hearing things I had missed before. True, as mentioned before the stock Fear Factory guitar assault, keyboard atmospherics and inhuman drumming fill this work from end to end. However it seems the years apart have given Burton and Dino a fresh dynamic, and they're picking up where their better works of [[ASIN:B0008F113W Demanufacture]] and [[ASIN:B000009CEM Obsolete]] left off. They also throw in the brute aggression of [[ASIN:B0002ZYDYM Soul of a New Machine]] to kick the pants off the Demanufacture and Obsolete reminiscings on this record.<br /><br />What's killer is that they're trying new twists on the old formula, and you can tell it's good thing because it's pissing some people right off! Those who whine about there being a solitary actual lead on this album forget that Dino played a minimalist lead on the song \\"Messiah\\" on Obsolete's bonus track edition. I suppose Dino should just stick to root-note rhythms and pretend he doesn't know how to play anything else according to some. In lyrical content Fear Factory ties all their previous work into the ultimate analogy: the state as the machine. In subtle nods to the 9/11 Truth Movement and to futurists predicting a decentralized progression of society, it's nice to see the sci-fi rubber meeting the real world road.<br /><br />The addition of the 1991 demo shows the continuity of the band. After all these years, oh yes it's true, Burton and Dino are still Fear Factory. It's educational to hear the original arrangements of those 4 bonus songs, especially if you own Soul of a New Machine and the bonus edition of Obsolete. In their final forms half of them were sped up and rearranged on their respective records, but you can make out the intent just the same. Don't believe the hype: you have to hear [[ASIN:B00319ECC4 Mechanize]] for yourself. A good record takes you on a journey, energizes your boring daily routine and inspires you to kick some healthy arse. In my honest opinion this record hits it right out of the park. Don't take my word for it - preview the songs here on Amazon and you be the judge.e records, but you can make out the intent just the same.

0307593525|5.0|I gave this product to a friend as a Christmas gift and she was very pleased!! she's cooking as often as possible using the recipes in the book...I think it is a great product to have around the house especially for those who love to cook!
1932100660|5.0|I have read of lot of written material about health and nutrition over the last 30 years, but The China Study has the most indepth food and disease analysis of anything I have ever read.  It uncovered some really eye opening realities about the Western-based diet and the associated diseases it causes.  If this book doesn't motivate you to better your eating habits and lifestyle, then nothing will.  In fact, just recently the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and the World Cancer Research Fund concluded that 30 to 40 percent of cancers are directly linked to dietary choices in their report titled \\"Food, Nutrition and the Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective\\".  This key report recommended that individuals should choose a predominately plant-based diet.  Personally, based on my reading, I think those percentages are too low.  This is the same information that The China Study revealed years and years ago.  I highly recommend this book because it will change your life!
1933771690|4.0|I've not read the book, but I will, sounds very interesting and actually echoes some of my own beliefs.     But just to give some perspective about the basic proposition that life and consciousness gave birth to the Universe, it's not an original concept but one that is infused with the great discoveries in quantum physics and for that reason, it's worthy of a read.     The credit to the basic proposition that life and consciousness are the source of all creation goes to Teilhard who proposed (I am taking poetic license in summarizing) that there are three spheres: noosphere (consciousness), geosphere (universe) and biosphere (flora and fauna), and that the noosphere is primary and inbued in the geosphere and biosphere.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|I am a huge fan of science fiction movies. And honestly, I enjoy 85% of the ones I watch, but this one was just aweful.  Special effects were great, acting was ok, but the story was bad in my opinion.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This is the type of movie (like the prior 2) that the entire family enjoys -- clean, entertaining fun.  It's laugh-out-loud funny and the characters are heart-warming.  I think the third movie is the funniest yet -- especially with the little squirrel and his acorn that almost always 'steals the show'.  And you have to really feel for poor Manny, who is becoming a new daddy -- poor sap just doesn't know what to do with himself, so he goes overboard (in a hilarious way) trying to prepare for his first baby.  Lots of fun!!
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I purchased this item as a Christmas gift, my first purchase ever on the internet. What I received was a bogus copy of substandard quality. There were numerous typo errors on the box, gramatical, spelling, and punctuation. The discs came in a flimsy case, in paper sleeves and with multiple discs in some. I didn't even try to play them. I contacted the seller, who with an apology, has promised a full refund including the shipping \\"and a little extra\\". I had to buy the set in the store at the last minute for Christmas, costing me an additional $70.00.  I sent the set back(it was received by the seller on 02/03/10).  I am still waiting for my refund.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I LOVED the show but the ending really sucked!  I hope the writers and creators make up for the disasterous ending with a nice surprise in the next movie, which I can't wait to see!!  This movie, together with all the prior Harry Potter movies are fun, entertaining, and well worthy of being watched over and over again.  I know I will.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|At first sight the price seems ridiculously high for remastered pop records that are nearly 50 years old.  But they are worth it. After all, here is far and away the best rendering of the most important body of popular music of the last century. The sound improvement over the previous CD issues is unbelievable on good hi-fi equipment. These CDs will give hours of pleasure to old Beatles fans, and show the younger generation what all that fuss was about.

B000NQRE0K|5.0|This transfer is fantastic. It has some grain, but it's supposed to have grain. Grain is what gives film it pleasant look. The colors are bold and vibrant. The black levels are deep and inky giving the picture a nice three-dimensional look. A great film that looks great on Blu-Ray.    But avoid purchasing this product from Amazon! I ordered and it didn't come with the slipcover that all Sapphire Series Blu-Rays are supposed to come with. I told Amazon customer service and they were quick to respond. But my replacement still didn't come with the slipcover. I don't feel like telling them again. After two tries, they should've sent the complete product. I'm keeping this copy, but I will not be buying anymore Sapphire Series from Amazon if they're not gonna include the full product.
0307716988|5.0|After reading this book, I like Michael Jackson more than ever, and have more respect for him.
B00275EGWY|4.0|Jeremy Renner is a fine actor who deserves more exposure (his ABC cop show was canceled way too quickly!) and he eats up the scenery as the bomb disposal tech with nerves of steel.  But his character is a bit too cool, almost inhuman in his calm approach to terrifying danger, and this portrayal constitutes the main flaw that makes this merely a good movie instead of a great one.  Nevertheless the film does an excellent job of capturing the ambiance of a nervous occupation army surrounded by a sea of uniformly hostile Iraqis, commendably reinforcing the magnitude of America's colossal strategic error.  The plot has few surprises but then so does life, most of the time.
0446614459|1.0|I have a fairly high tolerance for pain when reading commercial fiction. But this book is so bad I couldn't go on and put it aside early on. Consider every element that makes a thriller good --- compelling characters, interesting plot, at least competent writing --- and this novel fails the test miserably.    Don't buy the book. Don't borrow it. And most advisedly don't read it!
B001PPGAIK|2.0|What a beautiful mess Baz Luhrman has created with this silly, self-important, insipid clunker.  I've gotta give it two stars because it looks so good and because Kidman and Jackman do their best with the cliches they are required to recite from the vapid script.  This film is inordinantly long and you will find that after two hours you are very much ready for it to end.  Unfortunately it has almost another hour to go.  It lurches drunkenly between bad comedy and tearjerker melodrama in the space of 5 minutes leaving the viewer wondering just what sort of film he is watching.  Actually this is two films, with the first 90 minutes being devoted to a very dull but attractively photographed cattle drive and then switching gears to become an examination of racism in 1940's Australia.  And did I mention that the first half hour of the film is a comedy?  You may not remember the comedy so much after the Japanese Air Force attacks Australia and bombs a childrens home though. You may also wonder at all the magical mystical powers on display from the indiginous folks in the film. There is also a weird little kid who plays harmonica, has an obsession with the WIZARD OF OZ and (from the sound of his voice and pronuciation) will apparently grow up to be JarJar Binks.  There is simply too much going on in AUSTRALIA for one film to handle and too many different shifts in tone.  The story is simply a series of cliches and stereotypes and \\"movie\\" situations.  In short, the film is awful from start to finish. Beautiful photography and costumes, along with Hugh Jackmans insanely buff bare chest are not enough to make AUSTRALIA entertaining.  It is all just too stupid.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|I knew nothing about this movie before seeing it, other than the fact that critics raved over it.  Sure enough, one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.<br /><br />Mind you, I don't care for tightrope walkers one bit.  I find them suspicious and effeminate.  But this guy's story is just unforgettable -- and inspiring.<br /><br />Notice that the thing that makes it so excellent is the fact that the stunt was unapproved and illegal.  If the NYC Port Authority had approved the stunt, I imagine this would have been quite boring.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|If you liked Blair Witch, you will like this one.  If you didn't, then skip  Paranormal.  I loved the former and this gave me goosebumps galore.  And even as the movie went on and you can guess where and how it will end, the ride along the way is great.  You may want to slug Micah with his camera and his refusing to let Kate call the demon expert in until too late but men are like that.  Too sure they can fix things themselves.  But as with all great horror movies, you have to let the movie take over and you sit back and enjoy the ride.  What is best about it, is low or non-existent special effects.  The less you see, the scarier you become.  The great thrillers had no gore or blood or special effects, such as The Uninvited, the [orginal] The Haunting, The Innocents.  Brilliant and scary all of them; all black and white and no CGIs.      Highly recommended for those who want to be scared witless.
B00003ZKS1|4.0|I would have been thrilled if you would have sent me the rite CD!  both the 1st and second album have basicaly the same title.THE MICHAEL SCHENKER GROUP. but the second album that i have orderd 3 time (and i keep getting the 1st)  just has the MSG LOGO ON THE COVER! NO PICTURE OF MICHAEL IN A CHAIR OR HOLDING A GUITAR! JUST MSG OVER A FLYING V. SO I GUESS IM A LITTLE UPSET AT THIS POINT.  IVE TALKED TO CUSTOMER SERVICE,AND I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY SENT ME THE WRONG ALBUM AGAIN IF I WERE TO RE-ORDER. SO IM NOT HAPPY,TO SAY THE LEAST!!!
0340834048|5.0|I purchased this book for my 18 year old daughter as a Valentine's Day gift.  I bought the first book of 'Bunny Suicides' last year for her Valentine's Day gift.  It's not for everyone but for those of us who look at the world a bit off center it's a blast. I intend to keep adding to her collection since she's willing to let me read them too.
B00003XAVA|4.0|I've always loved this recording. It shows in many ways how stiffled these two guys were in CSN&Y. The Intro to the song Wind On the Water, which I believe is, To the Last Whale & Wind on the Water it self are both hauntingly beautiful. Also Crosby's 'Carry Me' is just a great song both musically and lyrically.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|A charming story for Christmas. A real mood piece with views of Finnish village of long ago. It reminded me of the homes and landscape of my Finnish immigrant ancestors in the wilderness north country of Minnesota. The pioneers of my youth lived much as the characters in the film when they arrived in the USA to establish homesteads. I would like to get a copy with original Finnish dialog, this one is dubbed in English.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|I don't know South African history or the rules of rugby.  I do know that I thoroughly enjoyed Invictus.  This is a feel good movie of the first degree.  There is no villain.  Everyone gets along.  No crime in the streets.  No racial antagonism above a whisper.  Although I've never been to South Africa, my guess is that the sweetness of the movie is unrealistic. I don't care.  This movie portrays the world at it's best.  It lifts the heart.  I had a wonderful time.  Maybe Mandela wasn't such a great guy.  But the Mandela in this movie is the Mandela I want to believe in.  I want people to watch this film, be inspired and pass the inspiration along.  I hope I can.
0030565812|4.0|An insightful look into the behind-the-scenes struggle for democracy in South Africa ; and a fascinating glimpse into the life of the tenacious and wise Nelson Mandela without whom the struggle could easily have ended in ongoing conflict and violence.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I have been using the 405CX for a couple of weeks now and connecting it to my new iMac 27 running Snow Leopard.  I'll break this down into 2 sections:    The Watch  I got rid of the plastic strap and use the velcro one instead.  I love this strap, very comfy, good for different wrist sizes.  The GPS locates very quickly and judging by the google map uploads it tracks extremely accurately, even down to 5 meters in some cases.  It found my ANT+ heart rate monitor straight away and works very well.  The customization for the scrolling multi pages is great.  It's also a nice feature that it beeps AND lights up when you finish/intermediate distance.  The pace monitor means you know how fast you're running each kilometer/mile.  My wife has the more advanced triathlon watch but for me, the 405cx works perfectly for running and cycling.      The Software  I've read loads of OLD reviews about how flaky the upload software was particularly with a Mac.  I can report that as of now, Feb 2010, I have not had any of these issues.  The ANT+ stick is permanently in my imac and picks up the watch every time.  The upload AND download to/from the ANT agent is perfect.  The training center software is OK but nothing special.  I don't bother with it anymore.  I skip straight to the online Garmin Connect website which is awesome.  The Google maps and google earth feature is fantastic.  And I love the splits and playback function.  The latest drivers fix all the connectivity problems with the mac.    Overall, a great device considering it looks like a normal watch and therefore does not make the owner look like a dork.  The fact that it contains a GPS with playback course setting is also amazing.  It's a very good product.    And for all the reviews before 2010, I would ignore anything about reliability as it's all been fixed now.

0143039601|5.0|If you are of a certain age and experience, you already know about Dharma Bums.    If you are of another certain age and experience, this book goes against everything taught by Saint Ronald Reagan, and so you should avoid it.    If you are young, give this book a try. Better yet, instead of buying it, go to the local library to read it. Unless the people I described in my second paragraph have taken over and there are only Approved Books in the library...if there are libraries at all. Libraries cost money, and that means (shudder) taxes.    For everyone else: this is Kerouak's best work.
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|I was never a competitive swimmer, but now regularly swim freestyle laps in a pool for exercise. I don't rotary breathe, so the repetitive turning to one side only was causing me hip problems. This snorkle completely eliminates the need to rotate head or hips, allowing me to focus on exercising arms, torso and legs. I feel like I'm now getting a much better workout. The manufacturers states you may need to use nose plugs, but I don't and that's not been a problem at all. There's no purge valve so any water in the tube needs to be blown out, hard, which adds to the workout. I'd recommend this version to anyone who swimming laps for exercise, and likes to alternative focus on exercising arms and legs during the workout.

B000SFD21Q|5.0|Ratey's book is excellent.  It was recommended to me by a friend last summer, I bought it on Kindle, and read it quickly.  I was impressed with Ratey's background (more than a decade doing research on the subject of the book), and the wealth of studies and data he cited and summarized.  His straightforward writing style helped him to make his case with me too.<br /><br />I have exercised regularly all my life (now in my 60's) with the reason that it makes me feel better, look better, stay healthier, and able to more easily do a lot of activities and sports that I enjoy.  I have usually exercised 3 to 4 days per week since college.  This book made me reflect more thoroughly on how my exercise has helped me to think better, and more clearly, and be more effective at my work and my social life.  I realized that on those particularly mornings when I have done an aerobic workout I have actually felt more focused, more relaxed, and thought more clearly.  I realized that the same result had occurred over and over again for me, and it did not occur on the days when I did not get that morning workout, and I also realized that that was just what Ratey was talking about in this book, and that was what the studies' data showed.<br /><br />As a result of reading the book I made it a practice of getting an aerobic workout (20 minutes) every morning.  It has now been 5-1/2 months and I don't think I have missed a day.  It works and it continues to work.  I lead a very busy life.  I have a stressful business, and travel a lot.  No matter where I am and no matter how little sleep I am getting, each day I continue to get by on 30 minutes less sleep so I can squeeze in that morning workout.  I cannot imagine ever not doing it.  It simply works.  Every day I can feel the difference in the clarity of my thinking in everything I do.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Ratey.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I have LOVED \\"My Fair Lady\\" since I first saw it when I was a little girl, but for some reason never owned it. I'm thankful I have it now so I can watch it over and over and sing along! It's a unique story, and I love that the movie is full of drama, drama, drama. On that note, though, I find the ending a bit of a let down. Nice story, but I need the drama to match the rest of the film! Still, it's a thrilling story with great filmography and amazing acting. The copy I purchased is of excellent quality.
B00319ECC4|5.0|You sometimes just can't argue with chemistry and music.  Like Plant and Page, Lennon and McCartney and countless other team efforts, sometimes what was needed was a creative tension or cohesion that brought out the best in both partners.  And like these famous partnerships, the solo efforts, while in some cases weren't bad efforts at all, they just didn't equal the heights the combinations did.  While it would be a stretch to compare Dino Cazares and Burton C. Bell with Lennon and McCartney, in the world of metal, their collaboration far outshines solo efforts.  Cazares' first Divine Heresy CD has some punch, but the follow-up, \\"Bringer Of Plagues\\", for all its ferocity just doesn't have the tunes and although this reviewer gave it a good review in hopes it would grow on me, I'm sorry to say it hasn't.  In fact, it's pummeling without purpose and sadly bereft of hooks.<br />  So Dino hooks back up with Burton C. Bell, and suddenly the spark has been rekindled, very much so.  It's been a wait for classic FF fans worth waiting for.  \\"Mechanize\\" also brings along Gene Hoglan, possibly the greatest heavy drummer out there, with the possible exception of Dave Lombardo, and that's good company.  Hoglan fires away with machine gun precision and can also cool it when necessary, which lots of thrash drummers seem to have lost the ability or interest in doing.  But the real stars of course are the riffs and great synth programming of Rhys Fulber.  This slab has musically squeezed in between \\"Demanufacture\\" and \\"Obsolete\\", which one may have thought impossible.  While the claims on the CD promising new ground breaking territory aren't exactly accurate, \\"Mechanize\\" still proves that FF are the quintessential metal industrial band.<br />  A few tracks stand out, including \\"Christploitation\\", that has a few lead licks in it, not a common thing for Fear Factory, and the ghostly \\"Designing The Enemy\\", which is the musical highlight.  \\"Final Exit\\" fades away with Fulber's patented synth work, reminiscent of some of the more musical moments on the \\"Demanufacture/Remanufacture\\" series.  And after all, you shouldn't own \\"Demanufacture\\" without its remix partner.<br />  It's high time Fear Factory give Rhys Fulber his due and feature him as a full blown member.

And after all, you shouldn't own \\"Demanufacture\\" without its remix partner.          It's high time Fear Factory give Rhys Fulber his due and feature him as a full blown member.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|This movie is absolutely wonderful.  It is funny from the beginning to the end, yet \\"delightfully serious\\" at the same time (note the paradox).  It is very unfortunate that this movie did not get the acclaim that it should have.  More people should see it. It opens our minds and our hearts to the fact that capitalism is at the bottom of all this.  Right in front of our eyes \\"capitalism\\" says that profit is more important than human need.  How could this be?  Is it more important for someone to make a profit or to give a needed operation to a sick child?  Moore's attention to fundamental Judaic-Christian-Islamic values ultimately, that emphasize duties to one another and to \\"do things to the least of these\\" is noteworthy and refreshing.  It is as if such fundamental spiritual wisdom has become lost.  How unfortunate!  It is a very moving film, especially toward the end when he has President Roosevelt give his famous Four Freedoms speech.  In the mid 20th century, the US was such a moral leader.  What happened?  The movie could have been enhanced if Mr. Moore then spoke about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which to a large degree is a legacy of Roosevelt's Four Freedoms.  The Universal Declaration, which includes rights to worship, rights to work, health care, adequate shelter, and security in old age, is now increasingly referred to as customary international law, which all nations must abide.  In any event, this movie will definitely give us something to think about.
0345495004|4.0|FLW was quite a scamp and ladies man.  His appeal for this lady had to be stronger than protrayed in this book.  It was amazing what she went through to be with him.  In a way little has changed since the early 1900's as far as why men and women will wreck their lives for another person and the way \\"others\\" feel about it all.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Fast becoming my favorite show.  I thought the first few episodes were good, but the more I watched, the more I loved it.  I couldn't stop watching.  Thought provoking & entertaining.  You'll laugh & cry & think about it after it's done.  Very well done with outstanding acting.  A must, must watch.
0061537969|5.0|Written from a dog's perspective. So we get to see what another species thinks of us. Its well written and contains some wise observations on humans.
0385504225|4.0|While not on the level of The Da Vinci Code.  Non the less Dan Brown's novel The Lost Symbol is a fast moving, very well documented mystery story that will hold your interest until the end.  I highly recommend this book.  L.P.
0738711500|5.0|The deck is very nice (actually the cards are very beautiful) - pictures are not cluttered - very easy to read and feel. Book is very straight forward and informative, very easy to understand for a beginner. Only \\"complaint\\" is that author does not use/address card reversals. This is a personal choice for each person - but myself, I believe reversals are very meaningful, and to ignore them can change the true message that is trying to be conveyed? (my own personal choice/opinion).
0385333846|2.0|Slaughterhouse-Five the wrenchingly sad tale of  Billy Pilgrim, tells the story of a man whose  experience in WWII haunts him for the rest of his life.  When the book was published, most middle-aged American men were veterans of WWII.  Billy's nightmarish flashbacks, his contempt for women and his desire to live a middle-class life must have seemed familiar to many of them. Slaughterhouse-Five was a valuable attempt to shine a cartoonish light on the horrible memories that veterans carried in their hearts.  It was a counterpoint to the myth of WWII, popular at the time, that WWII was a \\"good\\" war, and that the horrors of real war had not existed.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse-Five is not about the bombing of Dresden. nor about the German people who were killed or survived the bombing. It is about the way the war can destroy a life, even after it is over.  Billy Pilgrim, witnesses very little in Dresdin, but sees many horrible things during the war.  During the bombing Billy was being held prisoner in a meat locker.  When this book was published, the most shocking thing about the story was the coverup of the Dresden bombing by the American government.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse-Five depicts  war as  awful and senseless.  But beyond that, you can't read Slaughterhouse-Five and not feel the loathing that the author had for women.  Female characters are viewed by the narrator the way a twelve-year-old boy might treat them--at his worst.  Its a kind of objectification that has gone out of style in American literature.<br /><br />For me the one dimentional, comic book style characters were more depressing than humorous.  Billy goes though life in a dream that has little to do with the complexity of the human experience.<br /><br /> There are much better books that describe the horrors of war.
B0013TTF9E|5.0|I have begun collecting European Boardgames, and this one is one of my favourites. The game has a mixture of luck and strategy, depending on what dog you are given to play out you may have more or less moves. You also are able to piddle on lamp-posts, dig in garbage cans, beg for food at restaurants, deliver newspapers all in the hope of collecting bones to take to your home territory.<br /><br />The board is beautiful and detailed, a few people have said it is slightly cluttered. It is highly addictive, gameplay takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. I suggest that if you want a longer game, tweak the rules from having to collect 2 bones, to say collecting 4 bones or more.....<br /><br />Other games that I have include: Elfenland, Ozoolemio, Ticket to ride, Around the World in 80 days and of course the usuals such as Monopoly, Scrabble and so on... Dogville would be in my top 3, with Elfenland and Ticket to ride.<br /><br />I will endevour to create a video review shortly! :)
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is awesome for nearly everyone. Everybody in my family has read this book and loved it. This book is wonderfull. Look out Harry Potter and Twilight because here comes Percy Jackson.
0143038583|5.0|If this book doesn't change the way you think about what you're eating, nothing will. At a time when most of us have become completely removed from the source of our dinner, Michael Pollan takes us there. He schleps from factory farms to processing plants, giving us a close look (a little too close, sometimes) at what goes into making our food.    Along the way, he discusses in detail how dramatically we've retooled nature to our own ends at every step of the food production process, and the consequences--to the environment, to the animals, and to our own health.    His philosophical gleanings on our relationship with food have given me plenty of ... well, food for thought!
B002E2M5IC|5.0|The Coen brothers have written and directed another great darkly humorous movie with \\"A Serious Man\\". It's a movie that will do more than make you laugh though - it'll make you think. Think about how all those daily problems can add up. Think about how bad things happen to good people. Think about how things can almost always be worse. Think about what life might really be about.    With Adam Arkin and Richard Kind being perhaps the most recognizable names, the largely unknown cast still shines. While the Coens can work with anyone they want, this shows that for them it's all about the movie-making and picking the right cast regardless of star-power. Michael Stuhlbarg in particular is excellent as Larry Gopnik, the main character who begins to ask himself what life is all about. Larry suddenly finds his life falling apart around him, from big things to the very small. His wife decides she wants a divorce; however, this doesn't seem to bother their two kids - their son just wants the antenna fixed so he can watch \\"F-Troop\\". Larry has to help his older brother - who's already living with the family and unable or unwilling to find an apartment - out of trouble with the police. A student in Larry's physics class tries to bribe him for a passing grade while the school board is considering him for tenure. It all gets to be too much for him, so he tries to consult three different rabbis, getting three very different responses.     While the movie has a strong Jewish element to it, you don't need to be Jewish to appreciate it (I'm not). If you're afraid you'll get lost in the handful of Yiddish expressions used, they even have an extra on the disc a few minutes long which provides definitions. People from any background can identify with the feeling of being overwhelmed though. Everyone at one time or another asks themselves if there's really any meaning behind life and all the suffering that goes on. Often the answers we're given by people we think will know more seem hollow and unhelpful. Many of the situations in the movie may seem outrageous, but that doesn't affect how relatable Larry's plight is. His character is very ordinary which makes him easy to sympathize with.    If you're a fan of dark comedy or philosophical comedy or of the Coen brothers (perhaps there's more than a little overlap there), I highly recommend this movie. In some ways it may be rather simple, yet it remains very original. I think it is among their best work.
0374531269|4.0|Beah had me at the first page of this book, which is incredibly poignant. A Long Way Gone should be required reading for anyone who lives in a country, such as ours, in which war tends to be romanticized and Hollywoodized. Beah offers a rare glimpse into the life and mind of a child soldier. He gives an up-close view of the wartime horrors and suffering in Sierra Leone, as well as his own motives for taking up arms and the inevitable process of desensitization. He's an introspective and gifted writer, particularly for someone whose first language isn't English. (I kept searching for the \\"as told to.\\") Heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. My only criticism is his somewhat abrupt change of heart toward the end of the book. He might have delved into that psychological transition a bit more, but in any case, a wonderful book.
B00139XSBA|2.0|Great book, completely flubbed by Amazon. Is it so hard to run a spell check on a Kindle manuscript before publishing it? This book is filled with ridiculous OCR screwups: letters cl being turned into a nonsensical d, for instance. And there are a lot of them. Amazon needs to fix this book and send us all an updated version that doesn't hurt our eyes or our brains.
1400077915|3.0|This collection of short stories is inconsistent, but there are a few gems to be discovered. The title story was my favorite, an original, nuanced tale populated with complex characters that kicked off a lively discussion in my book club. I also liked Tricks, a story about a chance meeting between a man and a woman, and what happens when they agree to meet again one year later.    Unfortunately, some of the other stories weren't quite as well crafted. At least three were well-paced until the very end, when they abruptly resolved.
B00006JMQG|4.0|One of the first silent films I ever saw (and still a personal favorite) this film proved to me that silents can have as much visual presence and atmosphere as more recent films.  I've been a big fan of German expressionism ever since.  The odd angular sets and liberal use of shadows create a world that correspondingly odd characters live in: a killer Somnambulist, a madman of the fairgrounds, not to mention the inhabitants of an insane asylum.  The plot is by no means straightforward.  The players have such skewed psyches, a fact which only becomes more obvious during the progression of the film.  It's also important to note that the horror element has not been lost with age.  The ever creepy somnambulist (played to chilling effect by Conrad Veidt) admittedly unnerved me upon initial viewing.      My only criticism is the rather confusing ending which results from a jarring change of tone.  In the interest of keeping this review spoiler free, I will not divulge any more.
0312427999|4.0|In this chilling history of deregulated capitalism gone wild, Naomi Klein shows how Milton Friedman and his followers have taken advantage of chaos--caused by coups d'etat, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters--to transform tragedies into lucrative profit ventures.    The strategy? When the population is in a state of shock and trauma, quickly push through your desired economic policies: privitization, deregulation, and cuts in government services. If some brutality is required along the way, so be it.    While this topic has been covered by others, Klein offers a detailed chronicle of \\"shock treatment\\" doled out by Friedman and his friends from the Chicago School of Economics (with help from the World Bank and the IMF) over the last several decades, beginning in the wake of Pinochet's bloody coup in Chile, then moving on to other South American countries, followed by countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In case after case, she offers a peek at the players behind the scenes and the heartbreaking human costs.    Klein gives nods to Keynesianism here and there (wish that would have been explored more), but her own orthodoxy does bleed through in parts, thus the deducted star. It's only a few pages before the end of the book that she briefly acknowledges, for instance, that pure socialism has also often been implemented and maintained using brual methods.    Still, it's a compelling book and a must-read for anyone who wants to understand more about the innerworkings of this ongoing phase of history.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|If your looking for something that falls out of emo steroe type than this is it. It has a great sound all of the songs have an upbeat sound and brendon urie has a great voice it's just such a great mix.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I started this workout lets say a month ago.I have a 6month old baby boy and dont have the time to go to the gym. but i want to get my body back in shape after the baby.  I started this workout in level 1 and I thought this woman is crazy, how will I ever make it to level 2 and level 3.  Well, after a week i could already notice a change. After a few days I took it up to level 2 and OMG I thought I die when I did this the first time.LOL My whole body was hurting every day for at least 4 or 5 days.After another week of level 2 I switched to level 3. Now I have abbs that i never knew they existed eventhough I used to be very active in sports and dancing. I must also mention though that I am very commited once I start something so I did this daily with the hard moves that Natalie is doing,I was pushing myself a lot.. its hard but my body feels phantastic.NOw i can carry my son around like its nothing. I will continue doing this and switch between level 2 and 3.  I gave it 4 stars because of the intro that you cannot turn off, very annoying. THe second reason is because i wish she would have had 5 different workouts instead of only 3, but overall you def. get your moneys worth IF you really push yourself and stick with it, trust me its worth it and it will get easier.  This is my experience so hope this helped!

0451228731|3.0|Daemon has an irresistible premise: upon the death of computer mastermind, Matthew Sobol, a computer virus type is released that wreaks havoc on the technology based world. Spread out (unknowingly) over thousands of computers, Sobol's Daemon is constantly checking online news websites for key words and phrases which, when triggered, unleash a new plague of technological insanity including stealing stocks and major business' money, recruiting members to his cause, and releasing alternative media. With Sobol already dead, it becomes increasingly impossible to stop the mayhem as everything is already in motion and nobody is directly controlling the direction of the Daemon.    The first half of the book is a wonderful techno thriller. During this early stage of the book, Suarez gives sufficient pertinent information about the inner working of the Daemon searching news sites and the logical progression of what terror is unleashed. The reader has full knowledge of each step of the Daemon's \\"thought process\\" and, although some suspension of belief is necessary, everything makes sense. Unfortunately, once the Daemon becomes so big and powerful; and a chunk of time elapses without any information provided to the reader, the book becomes much more of suspension of all belief. Whereas the first part of the book the reader feels like he/she is in control and knows everything that is going on, the last half of the book there is so much going on behind the scenes with only minor (and insignificant) views of Sobol's \\"army\\" doing things they don't even know why they are doing them. Each person in Sobol's \\"army\\" has no clue what he or she is doing, only a brief piece of the puzzle (i.e. take this mechanized part to location X). While this story telling mechanism works to push the story, it loses emphasis with the reader as to the power of the Daemon brainchild Sobol. At the beginning of the book I thought Sobol was a pure mastermind supervillian genius. By the end of the book, I really did not care much for the dead architect as the story shifted dramatically from a techno thriller to a simple action adventure story of nearly impossible proportions.    The characters in Daemon are unique and suffer many trials and tribulations. The best characters were the ones who thought they were in control and making headway towards stopping Sobol's Daemon only later to find out they were only a pawn in the master plan. The emotional responses in these characters were written well, and the characters had my full empathy.    Daemon, for the most part, is a tightly written techno thriller. I may be a bit too critical because I recognize how difficult it can be to accurately and completely write about the exponentially expanding influence of the Daemon; I only wish the entire book was a solid as the beginning. If you are looking for a solid techno thriller from beginning to end you might look elsewhere; however, if you like techno thrillers and action adventure you have come to the right place.    You might also check out [[ASIN:0975271148 PeaceMaker]], by Dan Ronco, for a similar techno thriller on the doomsday scenario with technology leading to societal downfall.    Good reading,    J.Stoner
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. This is a very realistic novel. Told from the perspective of the alzheimer's parient. I didn't want this book to end. I felt like I knew the characters. I felt part of the story. I've never been close to anyone with alzheimer's although I've known people with the horrible disease. This book gave me insight.  A Must Read!!

I am going to from the start that I read book one last, didn't finish book to all, but with book still on my bookshelf gathering dust I thought that it was time to read and get out my way. It was an ok read, but I thought there wasn't really much drama in the book and the characters were not the interesting. This doesn't give much hope for book four, which I have to still read. Overall while some people seem to loved this book and series I was not one of them
B000N6TYLW|4.0|The final season of the Gilmore girls saw the continuing cycle of relationships conclude and re-initiate. We learn more about the ongoing influence of the broken relationships between mothers and daughters as the drama continues to underscore the choices influenced by the brokenness. The family of characters in Stars Hollow that we grew to love continue to struggle.<br /><br />In the end we are privileged yet annoyed that Lorelai has not grown beyond her fears, that Rory too is flawed and trapped by her experiences, and that though much time has passed the ability to choose what is best remains elusive.
0399213015|5.0|Personally I don't get what the big deal is, but kids love this book. My daughter got this book from a family friend for her 1st birthday. It instantly became her favorite book. We would have to read it over and over again. Over the two years between her birthday and her younger brother becoming interested in books, this book was shot (the binding finally came apart). We got another one to replace it because my son also wants this book read to him every time you turn around. We have since purchased this book many times over for different friends and family gift occasions, and their kids all love it too!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This was a great way to end a fabulous run of a fabulous show. This show of incredible word wizards with actors and actresses who successfully brought it all to life, deserved an epic 7th season. Though I've read the critical reviews and even agree with some of them, at least in some measure, I still applaud the writers and actors, etc., for giving us, the fans, a significant way to say good bye. If all the artistry and freshness of earlier seasons was lacking, it could perhaps be said that it was replaced with wisdom and maturity. And I was certainly entertained! Worked for me.

B000683VI4|5.0|It would be very easy to simply dismiss this movie as another tear-jerker chick flick.  But soon you get caught up in its pace and the story line.  Before you know it, you find yourself immersed with the characters.  And even though you can probably predict the ending, you still want to go along for the ride, it is that enjoyable!  An excellent family movie anytime!
B000002JOH|1.0|In all my years of listening to metal, I never got why Pantera was so revered. What puzzles me even more is that the same people who hold this band on such a high pedastal are so quick to bash nu metal bands like Slipknot and Mudvayne when, in reality, they are pretty much the same thing.    Repetitive down-tuned chord progressions passed off as heavy riffing? Check.    An annoying vocalist trying to sound like a tough guy, but ending up sounding like a fourth grade school bully? Check.    Meat-headed \\"you don't understand me\\"/\\"I'm tougher than you\\" lyrics? Check.    Formulaic song structure? Double check.    Face it, people. This band was never anything more than a high-school headbanger MTV band, and a dead guitarist won't change that. All their talk of killing trends and being the defenders of heavy metal was nothing more than a smoke and mirrors act to cover up the truth that they were just as manufactured, if not more, than any \\"alternative\\" band of the time.

B000059H98|5.0|This is a film based upon a cartoon.  Have fun with it.    I bought it and watch it at least once per year.    Side note: After this film, Naomi Watts' career took off.  Lori Petty has been in and out of rehab and her career tanked (no pun).    Watch them both have fun with this film.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|My wife and I both love this movie.  I gave this soundtrack to my wife for Christmas(among other things).  This is the gift that I think she uses the most.  I highly recommend that you add this sound track to your collection if you are a fan of this movie.
B000FGGE68|5.0|Milla's entire career is now based upon action films.  And she has the choreography down!    The acting is just okay, and the script is just okay, but Milla brings a believable punch to her scenes that makes the film worth buying.    Very entertaining.
0198326769|5.0|I read this book in one day.  One work day even, because I couldn't put it down.  The way the story is written from a child's perspective is just incredible.  It is simple enough to be taken at face value, but also poignant enough for the more advanced reader.  I am so glad that I took this journey with Bruno, and I hope you do too.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|I didn't like the casting of this film, I didn't like the amateur acting, and the script had too many holes in it.    So why have I watched it four times?    Yeah, it's one of those films your brain gets locked into.
0553381407|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and I was pleasantly surprised at how down to earth and practical it was to read. Susan Forward deftly navigates the definitions of abuse both physical and magical and brings the concepts to life with characters that are very real and that are based on her own practice. Even if they weren't real, their stories are our stories in some way shape or form. Susan Forward humanizes the un-human aspects of the subject matter. It is often said that there is no book on parenting. They lied, this book is it or as close to one as we'll likely see. As an adult, it makes you rethink episodes in your childhood long since supressed or forgotten and face up to the fact, if you can be honest with yourself, that certain things in your childhood just weren't right. As a parent, it'll make you think about how you are parenting your child(ren) so as not to repeat the mistakes your parents made. Susan's book WILL help you put words to what you felt as a child, since suppressed and subconsciously manifest in your adulthood but are not even aware because you've buried those feelings deep down. A term that will stay with me is \\"adult children\\" not in the sense of your own kids that are now grown but more in the sense of that little person inside each of us that no matter how old we get.     If your childhood and parents were perfect, this is not the book for you. If you are super macho and don't need no stinkin' book to tell you how to live your life - buy the book. If you got it all figured out and \\"dealt with this already\\" without a psychologist because you were endowed by the universe with supra-emotional intelligence and are a savant at figuring this kinda stuff, don't buy the book. Now for the 99% of us that had parents that said they loved us and then proceeded to show us in their own \\"special\\" and bass-ackwards way, buy the book and begin to heal.    Don't be afraid of this book. It is well worth it and should be required reading before adolescents date and adults gets married.

I love \\"Another Time, Be That Easy, Babyfather, Skin, Bring Me Home, The Safest Place, Soldier of Love (my least favorite), Morning Bird, Long Hard Road and The Moon & The Sky.\\"  YES that is ALL 10 songs!!!! Listen with fresh ears. This is Sade 2010 and I love it! The instruments sound soooo damn good!!!! Take a listen................  My only complaint is............the CD should have had more than 10 songs. Sade: This isn't the old days..........WE want CDs with lots of tracks and lots of good songs!

B001AQMBJQ|3.0|I enjoyed the show but the blu-ray discs were faulty.  Every-so-often the dialog became muffled so that you couldn't understand what was being said.  The only correction that worked was to turn it off and start over again and use the fast forward to get back to where you left off.  Of course you had to sometimes guess where to stop the fast forwarding.

0553582038|1.0|With this fourth book, Martin does to his series what Lucas did to Star Wars. While the first two books in the series were enjoyable even in their density, and while the third book though weak was at least engaging, the most recent book is so bloated and seeming off plot, that I simply couldn't finish it. I've warned others about getting into this series that seemingly has no end. What a fantastic disappointment!

0143038583|3.0|Michael Pollan's widely-read and critically-lauded volume is, I trust, the last word on enduring a good scold over a long-considered subject. Pollan -- or, more likely, his publisher -- probably didn't want to call this work something like \\"how to eat ethically\\" (with perhaps a now *de rigueur* sentence-long subtitle like \\"why eating corn-based foods is killing you, your soul, the planet, and possibly most of the known universe as we know it\\"). Far better to soft-focus it as a \\"dilemma\\", with the lovely subtitle about \\"a natural history of ... meals\\" and some gastronomically pleasing cover photography than resort to all that shrillness. Plenty of room for that inside.    Our first clue comes when Pollan actually defines his title: (spoiler alert!) the \\"dilemma\\" is simply \\"what should I have for dinner?\\" It's that \\"should\\" that gives away the game: we're immediately plunged into the ethical realm of things you *should* and *should not* be consuming. Most of the book inevitably concentrates on the latter and if the thought of someone (even a writer as erudite and witty as Pollan) ripping your food choices sounds appealing, then by all means tuck right in.    Just know that this isn't about resolving a dilemma or providing a \\"natural history\\" of four meals (whatever that means); it means a full-blast dietary critique of good and nasty foods (or entire foodstuffs) filtered through the author's value system, through which any moral evaluation must necessarily pass. That the author is a sustainability-loving, environmental loca-vore (eng) of the free-market-loathing, capitalist-despising school tells you about all you need to know about his values. His ethical eating vision veritably bleeds through this prism often enough that the rest is just 400+ pages of very good and occasionally brilliant descriptive filler. Keeping it to \\"industrial corn is killing everything, eating animals and plants raised on grass is the best -- indeed, the *only* -- way to go, Whole Foods is afraud, and killing and gathering your own food really makes you think\\" would make for a very short book.    But of course those four points require some fleshing out and here Pollan really shines. The author not only plunges headlong into just about every gastronomical detail imaginable -- from world commodity markets to chicken digestive tracts -- but to his credit he takes a true reporter's angle of *living* what he writes: not content with merely interviewing farmers and hunters, he *becomes* one (well, for a week at a time) to see how animals are really raised, slaughtered and dressed. Even if I took issue with many of Pollan's values, I found this writing stylistically brilliant and often riveting. He clearly has superb journalistic instincts (coupled with an amusing dash of self-deprecation) and loves his subject to boot.    So all this would be perfectly delightful if the aforementioned moral harangues didn't lurk beneath almost every paragraph. I make no judgments here about Pollan's values; I'll only note that when he obviously intends for this discourse on food to indict his perceived evils *on their own* he falls painfully short. Capitalism may be a despicable way to run an economy, but not because \\"we can only eat so much\\" (compared, presumably, to our unlimited capacity for dishwashers and Cadillacs) or due to corn farmers actually *growing more* when their prices fall. (That the latter is, of course, due to long-standing government subsidies Pollan grudgingly acknowledges -- but then curiously defines the whole mess as \\"capitalism\\" anyway.) He gamely attempts to label the entire food business \\"special\\" and exempt from a market economy but his rather obvious biases get in the way.    On balance I found \\"Dilemma\\" beautifully readable, often provocative but ultimately rather frustrating. Pollan's journalistic skills and research into the food business are superlative; I have whole shelves of gastronomy books that aren't even in his league. But I found hissoft-peddled moralizing ultimately unsupported and often weirdly inappropriate. Read his book for the sumptuous detail and skip the bitter side dishes.
B00025HI62|4.0|Back in 1979, we long-time Trekkers eagerly awaited the rebirth of our long-lamented, long-departed favorite sci-fi TV show, STAR TREK in a new, improved format: widescreen, Dolby stereo sound, and with the original cast reunited. What anticipation! It was such a thrill finally walking into that theater for what promised to be the motion picture event of a lifetime!<br /><br />Yet, where is there to go from such lofty expectations but into sub-warp drive? That's life after all, but who was thinking along those lines just then?<br /><br />Make no mistake: this very first Star Trek movie is S-L-O-W paced and the plot twist of a man mating with a computer almost embarrassing. And if that original 132 minute sojourn back to the Final Frontier wasn't a trying enough trek, our endurance is further tested here by an 11-minute longer TV version. That's more seconds to linger over cold, wilted popcorn and flat soda watered down by melted ice. More minutes to cringe, dreading an ill-advised cyber love scene. More lifetimes to contemplate the state of the world and the condition of one's navel lint. More, more, more, but not necessarily better, better, better. (Think: [[ASIN:B00005OWEH APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX]] here.<br /><br />On this go-round, V'ger still gets it on with Commander Decker (Collins). Uhura still looks chunkily middle-aged. CPO Janice Rand (formerly Ens.), who disappeared mid-way through Season #1 (whispers: Grace Lee got fired!), is just as mysteriously back and just as mysteriously irrelevant. Mark Lenard (Spock's daddy on TV) turns coat and is now a Klingon captain (nor shall we forget Lenard's 1966 Romulan commander gig). Misters Scott, Chekhov, Sulu and Nurse Chapel are still grousing on the script-line periphery while our golden trio, the ever-irascible Dr. Mc Coy, the always pedantic Mr. Spock and a nicely-preserved and spiffily-divotted Admiral (sweet promotion, but don't count on it forever!) James Tiberius Kirk rule the bridge, the ship, the movie and our hearts!<br /><br />Yes, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is worth seeing again, even in a stretched-out edition and absolutely, at these prices its the best deal this side of the Neutral Zone.

0385504225|2.0|I was really excited to Dan Browns latest book, however my excitement turned to frustration and boredom...<br /><br />If I wanted to read a scientific journal I would go out an buy science books... There is so much scientific dribble dedicated in this book that I feel many average Science readers will have no idea what they hell is going on ... So that was one major flaw in it. It was like I had to take study notes and research what the hell he was writing about many times throughout the book.<br /><br />Another frustrating thing about the book is that in his previous works I felt I was learning history and it was entertaining, this time around very little is spent on educating the reader about the topics at hand .... Personally I think the topic of Masons is a boring one and Brown made a big mistake of picking this as his focus point in his tale.<br /><br />Personally a lot of times I felt there was similarities between this and the motion picture National Treasure, and to say the least National Treasure was way more entertaining than this, plus with a more enjoyable and satisfying conclusion...<br /><br />Better try next time Mr Brown..

0143039431|5.0|This book isn't for everyone.  People I know who haven't liked it say that it was too slow, or \\"What's the deal with the turtle?\\" and didn't get past the first couple chapters.  Some say it's just too sad.<br /><br />For me, this book meant everything.  \\"To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth.\\"  When I read this first line, I remember feeling like it was a line that I would always remember.  I had the sense that I wasn't reading a story that some guy named Steinbeck came up with.  I felt like the true feelings and experiences of a very real group of people were simply being funneled to me via Steinbeck's pen.<br /><br />The story felt very relevant to early 21st century America in that Fear seemed to be at the root of all evil.  The Grapes of Wrath showed how Fear could be used to control and exploit people on a huge scale.  It also depicted the human experience as profoundly intertwined with the earth.  The characters' lives were turned upside down by nature, first by drought and later by flood.  The very last scene showed how all of us are on this earth, in this life, together, like it or not and I found comfort in that.<br /><br />I had goosebumps and a pounding heart.  All this for a book where the main characters speak in dialect about the \\"Fambly\\".  Somehow John Steinbeck managed to fit what, to me, is essentially the meaning of life into a short novel about sharecroppers in the 30s.<br /><br />An amazing book.  Please read it (all of it).

0743244257|3.0|\\"Cosmopolis\\" depicts, from dawn to dawn, a single day in the life of one of Wall Street's self-anointed Masters of the Universe. Currency trader Eric Packer, forewarned with vague (\\"status urgent\\") rumors of assassins and threatened more ominously by his own crisis of faith, steps into his white limousine and decides that he wants to get a haircut on the other side of town. Within the miles of street life between the East and Hudson rivers, Eric is waylaid by several women (including his new wife, whom he barely knows), by pastry-throwing and rat-hurling attention seekers, by the lures of a quiet bookstore and a deafening techno-rave, by a choreographed riot bordering on street theater (or vice versa), by a funeral procession and a presidential visit, and by traffic--lots and lots of traffic.<br /><br />On the one hand, I found myself completely sucked into the idea of Eric's journey: the mocking absurdity of his 24-hour trek from one side of midtown Manhattan to the other, simply to get a haircut and to find the meaning of life; the comic ludicrousness of his adventures; the unexpected and random brutality of the final chapters. There are scenes that stop just short of dazzling in their acidic humor, like Eric's proctology exam conducted inside the limousine while he faces his financial adviser, sweaty from her morning jog. And things become weirdly poignant (almost) when Eric whimsically joins his wife amidst dozens of nude extras lying on the street for the filming of a movie.<br /><br />On the other hand, the novel seems to beg the reader for relevance; it's as if DeLillo went into a coma during the Sixties and, lately emerged, can't begin to comprehend the excess and the nonsense of modern America. Like the novel's billionaire protagonist waging his fortune against the rise of the yen, DeLillo bets that his readers will know virtually nothing about financial markets or how they work or who works them. As a result, the post-nihilistic, New Age dialogue is peppered with meaningless word clouds salvaged from a day's viewing of CNBC. \\"Don't trust standard models. Think outside the limits. The yen is making a statement. Read it. Then leap,\\" says the Master to an analyst with \\"advanced degrees in mathematics and economics\\"--who for some reason doesn't slap Eric for insulting his intelligence (and ours). Stuff like this has neither the plausibility of market-talk nor the incisiveness of parody.<br /><br />Eric Packer's self-constructed existence as a Master of the Universe is largely beside the point, anyway; the satire is so broad (capitalists and their hubris, youth and their short attention spans, technology and its impersonal ubiquity, the urban jungle and its hazards) that DeLillo might just as well have made his antihero an overpaid baseball player, a corrupt politician, or a music mogul--any of whom are far more likely to be caught dead in a white limousine in the first place. At the end of \\"Cosmopolis,\\" we are, I suppose, expected to fathom the emptiness of Eric's life (\\"The things that made him who he was could hardly be identified much less converted to data\\"), but DeLillo has created not a man but a cipher that not even he, its creator, seems to understand.less word clouds salvaged from a day's viewing of CNBC. \\"Don't trust standard models.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|WALL-E depicts the earth and human after 700 years in a creative perspective, when the earth becomes a huge trash bin and human beings lose their basic biological ability on a spaceship. The story follows a robot named WALL-E, who is designed to clean up a waste-covered Earth far in the future. He eventually falls in love with another robot named EVE, and follows her into outer space on an adventure that changes the destiny of both his kind and humanity. WALL-E distorts people's stereotype of animated films, which are known as childish and peripheral without profound thought. Although WALL-E has some humorous and pleasant plots to entertain the audience, it is an influential and inspiring film because it provokes deep thinking by challenging the benefit of technology, impresses the audience by true love between WALL-E and Eve, and sends a hope by finding a balance between people and machines           WALL-E works like a tale story to make people be conscious of some negative influence of advanced technology when enjoying the interesting love story between two robots. One question would catch people's mind after they watch the film, what is the true benefit of technology? In the film, people sit on automatic chairs and are extremely obese. Since people don't have enough physical exercises, pear-like human even lose their ability to walk and work normally.  In the film, human is no longer a dominant factor to forward the plot, but an ironic component used by the director to invoke the audience's thought.            The film also encourages the audiences to imagine a world filled with trash, and we, human beings, have no place to live. When the camera zooms into the details of the earth, people soon find out that the high buildings on earth are actually countless piles of trash. The sharp contrast leads people to rethink the value of modernization, which can turn our beautiful and vigorous earth into a huge trash bin. Although it is an animated film, WALL-E ignites people's consciousness of protecting our earth from pollution.       Different from other animated films made specifically for young kids, WALL-E shows a romantic love story between two robots. Although love is an everlasting theism in many films, how to express true and pure love through a 90- minute film can never be an easy topic for directors. But the robotic love in the film teaches the audience how to treasure their own love in daily life. The love between WALL-E and Eve breaks the traditional mode of Hollywood love story, which consists of romantic oath and affectionate hug between two lovers. In WALL-E, their words are limited, their emotions are hard to express, and even their sexual distinction is not clarified. But as the story forward, the audiences are deeply moved by their romantic love. When WALL-E falls in love with Eve, what he wants to give Eve is happiness and safety. In order to save Eve from danger, WALL-E leaves his home, gets to a distant planet and stays with Eve without hesitation. His brevity to seek true love moves every people.       The robotic love story becomes especially precious for its purity, because more and more people consider money and wealth as part of romance and marriage. WALL-E is a good teacher of true love, because he knows what pure love is and how to be romantic. Though WALL-E does some funny and awkward actions to win Eve's heart, their impressive story redefines modern people's understanding of love, which actually means sacrifice for each other without asking for return.      WALL-E also gives us a positive and hopeful future. With a warm ending of bright future, WALL-E shows its main theism that our life can be better when people can live harmoniously with different animals and work compatibly with machines. The ending sequence sends a signal of hope that we can find a balance between advanced technology and people without downside. The film uses picturesque and poetic images to show the earth after rebuilding. Onthe new-born earth, there are no more high buildings, no more factories and no more pollution. Birds are chipping, people are singing, and the two main characters are living together. What the earth has are green plants, vibrant animals and energetic people, who are working compatibly with machines. Although the future world in the film is utopian, it successfully sets up an ideal idea to have a biological balance between human and nature, so that people can live peacefully with all the creatures in the world.  WALL-E has received nearly unanimous acclaim by film critics since its release. WALL-E won the 2008 Golden Globe Award for best animated film and ranks first in Time's \\"best movies of the decade\\". The huge success of WALL-E proves that animated films can also show profound thought. The film incorporates several major concerns in the real world, including modernization, love and harmonium, into one 90-minute animated film. Since WALL-E can put the audiences into deep thinking about their life and values, it is more than a simple film made for young kids. WALL-E actually explores the future of humanity in a pleasant atmosphere.
B0030BOCKK|1.0|This album actually makes me kind of sad. Is HIM always going to sound this way now? Yes, I am a fan of the \\"old HIM\\" and this definitely does not sound like them at all. I actually checked wikipedia to see if the band changed lead singers. I hate to say it, but the songs sort of sounded like something the Jonas Brothers would sing. THE JONAS BROTHERS. The only great song on the whole album is \\"In Venere Veritas\\". Now THAT'S HIM. In short, if you are a fan of \\"Razorblade Romance\\" and all the other albums I can almost guarantee that you will not like this CD. Maybe the rest of you have a more open mind than me about HIM going all pop and stuff, but I think there's enough pop bands in the world. We don't need any more. I hope that this is just a stage that HIM is going through...
0385532458|4.0|Before I get started, I should probably confess to being a literary snob. That means I'm more familiar with the work of Elizabeth Strout than I am Stephen King, Annie Proulx than Dean Koontz; and I actually know how to spell Jeffrey Eugenetes. The stereotypical image of people like me are shy, bookish children who have gone on to earn degrees in English Literature from small, exclusive (and expensive) Northeastern liberal arts colleges and advanced degrees from one (or more) of the Ivy League universities. By my age, people of my ilk are usually professors emeritus who regularly sally forth arcane phrases like \\"stream of consciousness\\" and \\"literary fiction\\" at faculty cocktail parties with the same aplomb as Scaramouche thrusts his rapier. I, on the other hand, hail from a lower middle-class family from the South. I am the first of my people to ever set foot across the threshold of any institution of higher learning, either way. My degrees are not in English Literature or in any subject even remotely related, and my schools are large (and inexpensive) state universities which bang out diplomas about like Wal-Mart peddles cheap, plastic widgets.    It took me years of diligent, start-and-stop effort to finally make it through my first William Faulkner novel; but once I did, I became addicted. These days, I need regular hits of Faulkner in much the same way as a drug addict needs a fix. People of my ilk seldom read the work of popular, genre authors who have their stories made into equally popular movies and make millions, you know, those folks who write about romance, and science fiction, and crime, and young lawyers who save the world. People like me are much too busy perusing the dusty shelves of second-hand bookstores--seeking out those obscure, unknown geniuses of undiscovered yet great literary merit--to waste our time with predictable, formula writers.    About twenty years ago, when \\"The Firm\\" showed up in bookstores I bought a copy. It was a quick, light read with not much of a lasting impression. A few months later, I noticed another John Grisham book had made its way to the bookstore shelves. I bought a copy of \\"A Time to Kill,\\" took it home, and devoured it. It was difficult for me to believe the same author had written both stories. I bought more Grisham novels with hope I would find the same story telling talent and ability I'd discovered in \\"A Time to Kill.\\" After a couple more of his predictable, young-lawyer-takes-on-the-world-and-wins novels, I gave up on Mr. Grisham.    The other day, while I was searchinging the shelves of my favorite second-hand bookstore, I came across a copy of Mr. Grisham's latest effort \\"Ford County: Stories.\\" I cracked open the cover and read the flap summary. Interesting, I thought; so I thumbed through the pages, stopping intermittently to browse. When I got home and sat down with my new purchase, I never dreamed I would complete it in one sitting. I simply couldn't stop reading.    The characters and the situations in Mr. Grisham's fictional Ford County are very real. I know, because I grew up with most of them, just up the road in Shelby County, Tennessee. I know those people in that book.    The prose, like the stories' characters, is simple. Nothing complicated or convoluted here. As I read those stories, I felt I was back home with Bubba and Raymond listening to and telling of the goings-on around town, laughing, and drinking beer. It is the same feeling I had when I read of the fictional folks in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, except Mr. Grisham's prose is much easier on the mind.    With \\"Ford County: Stories,\\" Mr. Grisham has undeniably entered the world of literary fiction and done it well. I hope he chooses to stay for a while and gives us literary snobs more of his wonderful stories to enjoy.
B0012E2HRC|5.0|A good movie is one in which you are lost in what you are seeing an hearing. You are swept up in emotion. Scared, amused, angered or as is the case with The Bridges of Madison County, soothed into a love story that is like a glass of fine wine.    Clint Eastwood is laid back and sensual. Meryl Streep, always the consummate actress, plays her part as the suffering in silence Midwestern Italian housewife to the hilt.     The raw emotion and underlying passion is like watch art being created. One of my favorite movies to watch when I am feeling jaded and need to be reminded that adult and mature love at first sight can exist....if only on film.

No.  The acting is incredibly dull and moronic - this couple has the most boring conversations and lives of anyone I've ever known.  You watch the counter tick down fast, then it slows because \\"something's about to happen!\\"  And, what the?  Everytime something does happen, you'd think they'd turn on a light, or even turn on a light when heading downstairs - no, all that darkness, I guess, is suppose to add drama.  Well, it doesn't.

B002LLN2GA|1.0|I read a review for a free version of this for the kindle that suggested you spend a buck or two to get a decent copy.  Apparently the free version has more than its share of issues.  I figured this was still reasonably priced at $0.99, so gave it a shot.  It's more or less readable, but the frequency of errors is just inexcusable... even if it is less than a dollar.  There are random breaks in mid-paragraph and mid-sentence (random meaning there is no apparent reason for it; they actually show up pretty consistently), missing words at the start of chapters or paragraphs, and several typos (typos that don't exist in the print version I also bought).<br /><br />The story itself is an easy 5 stars.  There have to be better versions out there, though.
0071636080|5.0|In the past few years, I've found myself in situations where I have to (oh my) stand up and (uh-oh) say something to a group of strangers. I'm confident about a lot of things, but when it comes to presentations and talking to a crowd, my skill could be fit on a dime. On the thin edge. (How nervous was I? I once stood up to talk and fainted dead away. Really passed out, flat on the floor. Now THAT was a bad moment.) So, once I decided that it was time to get better at this, it made sense to learn presentation skills from someone whose \\"get the point across\\" ability has inspired fandom and business success; I picked up Carmine Gallo's book at the library.<br /><br />For, no matter what you think of Apple or Steve Jobs, he is probably one of the best presenters of our generation. I've attended a few of his Macworld keynotes; I personally know what it feels like to be wrapped around his little finger. In fact, I'd argue that if you DON'T like Jobs or Apple, you should make a point of reading this book. If Apple has succeeded only through this guy's ability to convince people to buy the (in your view) wrong/over-priced products, then it behooves you to learn how he does it... because just think what you could do if you had the RIGHT product/message to communicate along with these presentation skills.<br /><br />I looked forward to this book for the advice it might impart for how to improve my \\"make better slides\\" and \\"stand up in front of people\\" skills, but I got something more: a wonderful, put-it-to-use treatise about good leadership, and passion, and what it takes to make people want to listen to you. Because, obviously, if they aren't listening, they aren't following you or the strategy you propose.<br /><br />Absolutely, the book delivers on its promise: There is PLENTY of information to help you learn how to improve your presentations, from identifying \\"the one question that matters most\\" to using slides as the supporting background to your pitch rather than as the \\"read off the slide\\" body of the message. The major Aha! moment for many presenters, I think, is that Steve Jobs never uses bullets. Ever. The book made me realize just how often people try to shove the kitchen sink onto a slide rather than underscore \\"the point I'll be making as I speak aloud;\\" instead, Gallo points out, Jobs communicates three things, and doesn't try to identify every product feature. (This also applies to beginners' efforts at writing articles or other essays, though that's not a point Gallo stresses.)<br /><br />Nearly every presenter's task is examined. Gallo has an entire chapter explaining how to dress up your numbers by using analogies and by putting them into context, for instance. He shows how to control how others perceive your announcement or message by creating Twitter-like headlines. The book is chock-full of examples (not all from Jobs' presentations, so you can see how other accomplished presenters succeed with the same methods) and each chapter summarizes the key messages to take away. Gallo analyzes Jobs' presentations (largely Macworld keynotes; he invites you to follow along on YouTube), showing both Steve's words and Steve's slides. The book is immensely readable. Even better, I figured out what my presentation weakness is, and now I know how to overcome it.<br /><br />It'd be worth reading this book just for that... but to my happy surprise, Gallo doesn't look only at Jobs-on-stage for his advice on \\"how to be insanely great in front of any audience.\\" For example, he spends quite a bit of time discussing how Jobs has -- and imparts -- a messianic sense of purpose. Jobs' presentations don't aim to tell you about a product with new features; he communicates to the audience that by buying into his message, they are changing the world. People want to make a difference in the world, Gallo points out, and Jobs helps people believe they're doing that. \\"Ask yourself, 'What am I really selling?'\\" Gallo writes. \\"Here's a hint: It's notthe widget, but what the widget can do to improve the lives of your customers. What you're selling is the dream of a better life. Once you identify your true passion, share it with gusto.\\"<br /><br />This is a really great book. It goes well beyond \\"how to give a presentation.\\" I think it ought to be required reading for anyone whose job includes getting other people to agree to your strategy and ideas. And doesn't that mean anyone in business?to improve the lives of your customers. What you're selling is the dream of a better life.

B002RI9YE6|5.0|Remains of the Day is such a sad book; Mr Stevens seems defined only by his job as a butler and his dedication to duty and dignity.  He suffers humiliations from his employer and employers acquaintances and yet feels a sense of pride and professional triumphs.  His relationships are formal and repressed and again his professionalism takes priority over any personal interactions.  He either does not realise or does not want to realise the feelings of those around him.  He doesn't seem aware of how his loyalties damage his personal relationships.  He is the perfect example of the British 'stiff upper lip'.<br /><br />Ishiguro paints a wonderful picture of a stoic butler coming to terms with the struggles of British class in post-war England and his inability to conduct any close relationships.  It's the third Ishiguro book that I've read and all three have been very different; all wonderfully written.  Highly recommended.

B001PRSPA4|5.0|I just heard China live last night at a jazz club in Paris, where I was blown away by not only her expert handling of Dinah Washington's songs but also her smoldering stage presence. On my way out I picked up her CD and have been listening to it for most of today - which means I haven't been able to sit still. Her admiration for The Queen of the Blues really comes through in all the songs, which combined with China's powerful-yet-lovely voice makes for a very nice collection.
0786868724|5.0|It is true that this book's title is have a little faith, with no capital letters, and seems to focus on faith. However, it would be more truthful to say that its theme is \\"coping,\\" a word that I did not find in the book, and \\"love\\" and \\"hope,\\" two words found in the volume's last sentence. The last word, and probably the books principal theme, is \\"hope.\\"<br />One might wonder why Albom, the best-selling author of Tuesdays with Morrie and other best-sellers, chose to display the title in non-caps. One might also ask why he speaks of \\"a little faith\\"; don't people think that they need more than a little faith? Shouldn't they have complete faith?<br />However, since, as we stated, the book is really not a dissertation on faith, or religion, or on what to believe, but on \\"coping\\" despite the difficulties that life throws at people, \\"love\\" for everyone no matter his or her faith, and \\"hope\\" that all will work out at the end, and since \\"faith\\" plays a small part, the questions disappear.<br />The story is really not about a small town rabbi and protestant minister, the two protagonists in the tale; it is really about Mitch Albom's reaction to these two men, what he felt about the difficulties both men endured and how he came to respect both of them. Albom is Jewish, but he is not \\"religious\\" or \\"observant.\\" He is married to a Christian Arab. So the book is not about religion.<br />  Readers will find themselves relating to the two clergymen and agreeing with Albom who presents their stories in a down to earth manner, showing how they behave with humor and sometimes irreverence.<br />The closest that one comes to the idea of \\"faith\\" is that the two clergymen have a strong belief that God exists, and this belief helps sustain them despite their difficulties. However, both of them have no real answers to questions such as why there is evil in the world and how can a person prove that God exists. Nor do they really expect God to become involved in their lives and aid them.<br />The rabbi defines \\"faith\\" as \\"doing. You are how you act, not how you believe.\\" He also says that \\"faith\\" is persistence. This is the life he led - helping others and never stopping to do so - and this is the life that the protestant minister led. And this is the life that readers will respect.r />The rabbi defines \\"faith\\" as \\"doing. You are how you act, not how you believe.\\" He also says that \\"faith\\" is persistence.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|I bought this CD early in the winter season (early November) because of the artist and because the musical numbers intrigued me. A few weeks before while shopping at a second-hand music store I had picked up Ten Summoner's Tales, which reminded me how much I liked Sting and the different types of sounds he experimented with. On first listening, I wasn't sure about the album, though I liked certain songs. Now here it is February, and I am still listening to the album. I love it. It prompted me to buy the Dowland album (even when the reviews of that album were mixed). Part of what's happened to Sting's voice is age and use, and I love the sound of it on this album. My favorites on the album are the Purcell pieces, followed by the Elizabethan pieces and the folk pieces. I don't feel it to be a bleak album; to me, the album is comforting in that it isn't all so merry and in that it does have that winter landscape feel about it. I admit it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it is a nice break from the traditional Christmas album and it is an album that you can play all through the winter.

0156421178|3.0|An editor from Slate magazine stated that \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" was one of his top three non-fiction books.  That's a strong claim, and also what motivated me to download this to the Kindle.    Orwell paints a vivid picture of the Spanish civil war prior to WWII.  It is well written and a compelling read.  Orwell travels from Britain to Spain and joins the Independent Labor Party and POUM [...] anti-fascist army in the fight against dictator Francisco Franco.  His detailed descriptions of fighting on the front with ill-prepared comrades and antiquated weapons provide a palpable sense for trench warfare.    At a few points in the book, Orwell departs the narrative and provides deep political analysis of the interactions between the PSUC, PCE, POUM and the various societal components of Spain at the time (bourgeois, farmers, workers, the Basques, etc).  For the detail-oriented buff of Spanish history, these would no doubt be valuable nuggets, but I admit that I found these sections pretty dry and that I longed for the return of the story line.  Suffice it to say that the political and social landscape in Spain around 1936 was extremely complex on one hand, and yet simplistic with regard to the world view of the rise of fascism elsewhere.    Homage to Catalonia gave me perspective that I'd not had prior, and first-hand perspective regarding the views of Orwell himself.  Recommended, but I'd fall shy of calling it one of the top non-fiction books.    -j
B000026OW3|5.0|Some people would say that Rubinstein's style of playing is quite standard but nothing more. Of course, it all depends on personal preference. Personally, I think his version is the best interpretation of Chopin when approaching the works from the perspective of his life, moreover, it is very touching. Choice is yours, but I really recommend this item. It is good chance to have very high quality performance CDs with quite cheap price. If you have at least interested in and can afford it, seriously, do not hesitate! just go for it.
0446569895|4.0|I've never been a diehard Ozzie or BS fan, but I always appreciated Ozzy's humor and even some of the music.  This engrossing autobiography gives us Ozzy's view of his life & times, from early childhood to the present.  If you like tales of growing up lower middle class in 1950's and 1960's Britain, then this book offers an hilarious and sometimes disturbing view of English life of that time.  I often wonder what would have happened to characters like Ozzy if Rock n' Roll had not coming along; probably what began to happen to him: menial degrading jobs, jail, alcoholic abuses, and general eating of fried foods.  Ozzie's account of the formation of Black Sabbath and the recording of their first five albums is the most interesting part of the book for me, and I just wish Ozzy had gone into a little more detail about the creative and recording processes.  If there is one salient of British rock star autobiographies, it is the general slagging off of those aspects of their lives in favor of lurid tales of drug abuse and sexual exploits.  After Ozzy leaves Black Sabbath, the book looses some energy, and his takes of medical problems make the last 100 pages drag some.  Still, this is among the funniest books I've read, and I spent most of the time I read it laughing.<br /><br />If you're a fan of PETA, skip this book.  Ozzy abuses pigs, cows, goats, mules, horses, dogs, cats, birds and bats, often to hilarious and horrible effect.  What do what from a man who regularly flung animal parts into his audience?  Oh, Ozzy.<br /><br />One of the better of the rock star biographies.

B000E41MS6|5.0|I know this might start a flame war, but I honestly have to say I feel Doctor Who. Like the most recent Star Trek movie does a good job of trying to push what Scifi can do, much like one might say for the series Firefly or any number of other Media. But in all honestly I love this guy, great stories great subjects. Deep thought provoking plot, as well as any number of other corks that draw you into a very well developed character. Also the fact they have managed to find a way to replace the doctor with new actors and some how allow them to make the part there own well developing a character many people love all over again. Is one of  the most wonderful parts of the series, I would also like to add that, David Tennant the 10/11th Doctor depending on what geek or Scifi fan who knows the series you ask will be greatly missed. I would also like to say that the change up between the doctor in the first series and the ones that followed it was every hard for many to except David Tennant at first but as the story went on we now will miss him. Also Doctor Who does a good job at showing the good in humanity as a whole through out the series, if any alien from any Science fiction  were to get a reward for being most human. I think the Doctor would surely win it, I would also like to add that the show as a whole is very moving. So moving even that it could sometimes even make a grown man cry.

B001OQCV6A|3.0|When I heard that Robert Downey Jr. was going to star in a Sherlock Holmes film, I eagerly awaited its opening. I couldn't get into the cineplex when it first arrived in my town and by the time I got around to seeing it, it was playing in another venue that caters to low class adventure films.  Well it only cost me $3.50 to get in...and that's about the best thing I can say about it.    At first I had happy fantasies about Downey and Jude Law teaming up, a la Newman and Redford, for some wonderful buddy films.  Downey and Law are among the more talented and good looking actors working today, just as Newman and Redford were in their day.      Well it that were ever to happen, they would certainly need a better director and a better script.  The idea is fascinating--a remake of Holmes and Watson, emphasizing a different side of the hero than the traditional one.  However the script is stupid to the point of idiotic.  There is no dramatic tension---just one hair-raising crisis after another---accompanied by hideously loud music.  Since we know that Holmes and his buddy are going to prevail, there is no point in getting tense as we witness them getting almost blown up or squished or whatever---I ceased caring after a while.    Downey, who is a terrific actor, is terribly wasted here.  Perhaps he was embarrased because he mumbled so many of his lines that I was wishing for subtitles.  'Interesting that he is nomintated for an Oscar for the performance--I think he's wonderful, but this role is so one-dimensional, that, again I ceased to care.    Jude Law, as the conservative side-kick, actually comes across as the more interesting character, since he has at least some variety of emotions.  Downey/Holmes is so arrogant/cool that, again, I lost interest.  In this supposedly frantically exciting film, I found myself yawning repeatedly and I really wanted to leave.  I did stay, to get my $3.50 worth and to see if the ending would have redeem the film in any way.  It didn't.
B00007KLJJ|2.0|Nice costumes, pretty scenery and a brief, although well choreographed, desert battle scene are inadequate compensation for poor acting, silly dialogue and a painfully slow start that plague an interminable film with a conspicuously thin plot.<br /><br />Purists will also object to the fact that this current effort obscures the important reason, made plain in the Mason novel and the wonderful 1939 Korda version, for Faversham's apparent act of cowardice.  It is not fear, itself, which motivates him to resign his commission but rather the fear of being afraid, of being unable to meet the lofty expectations of a family with strong military traditions.<br /><br />Heath Ledgers' snivelling portrayal, silly hair and floundering accent contribute to the comic aspects of this profoundly unsatisfying work.
4789009637|5.0|I'm taking Japanese at college and this was the text book that was required.  I'm very happy with it.  The book explains grammar very well and the pace moves just fast enough so that my skills in the language are progressing but I don't feel lost.  It does not go too much into kanji (there are some pages in the back that correspond to the lessons), but if you are just learning Japanese and have no prior experience with an Asian language- that is a very helpful feature.  There is an activity workbook that goes along with the text book and it has grammar and writing exercises and kanji practice pages in the back.  You don't actually need the workbook to use the text book, but I definitely recommend it for the extra practice it gives with the lessons.<br /><br />The beginning of the book focuses a lot on speaking in the polite form (like if you were to speak Japanese to a teacher, stranger, acquaintance...) by using phrases such as '''\\"masu\\" and ''''\\"masen\\" at the end of verbs and '\\"desu\\" and ''''''' \\"jaarimasen\\" meaning \\"it is\\" or \\"it is not\\", as well as the past tenses of the polite forms. The second half of the book focuses on the cordial or familiar (what you use to speak with close friends, family...).  This book also teaches the te-form ending (you cannot use \\"masu\\" '''or '''\\"masen\\" with a verb in the middle of the sentence, so you use the te-form).  It also teaches\\"teimasu\\"'''' ending (both the te-form and the masu form together to indicate that the action is happening at the instant or that a change of action has occurred).  For example: \\"ima ko-hi wo nondeimasu'''''''''''''\\" means \\"I am drinking coffee right now\\".  So the book focuses on all of the three ways of writing in Japanese- hiragana (used for Japanese words that do not have a kanji and for the particles), katakana (used for foreign words to give them a Japanese sound such as coffee - ko-hi) and some kanji characters.<br /><br />I'm sorry if I have made any mistakes with my Japanese sentences (I'm still a beginner with learning the language), but I wanted to try to explain this as best I could because if you already understand most of what I'm writing about - then you probably need the Genki 2 book.  If this is all new material to you, then this book is a great way to learn the basics and grammar of Japanese. I also apologize because the amazon site will not let me write the japanese characters.<br /><br />So, I would definitely recommend the Genki textbook to anyone trying to learn Japanese (don't waste your money like I did trying to learn on Rosetta Stone and computer programs!).  My 14 year old sister bought the same book to learn Japanese also, so it's a textbook that can work for a lot of different age groups (I wouldn't go any lower than High School though- but it depends on the motivation of the student).

The first wave of Bond films were succeeded because they gave us a character whom we could like and, more importantly, envy.  Connerys' Bond did everything with a wink, whether it was snapping a neck, critiquing a disappointing brandy, or nailing the blonde hottie whom he'd seduced away from the main bad guy.  THAT'S why the men in the audience wanted to BE him and the gals........well, YOU know!     Now, I ask you, who in his right mind would care to switch places with Craigs' angry, brooding son of a bitch?  What woman would feel safe with him, considering his hair trigger temper?  None with any sense, would be my guess.  The films brief homage to Goldfinger was very telling, I thought.  In 1964, the dead girl on the bed was painted a shimmering gold.

B00005V9IL|2.0|If we were to translate the dynamics of Cameron's film, The Abyss, into human relationships, what might it resemble? Imagine two children who are fighting. They've even found some dangerous weapons and are threatening each other. Seeing this, their parents decide upon a plan. After all, they don't like seeing their children fighting. So, they go into their room, grab the handguns they keep as a means of protection, and rush the kids. They cock the triggers, screaming, \\"We're gonna kill you!\\" After holding the guns to the kids foreheads for several seconds they lower the guns. The message is clear. \\"Best be on good behavior, because if you're not, we can kill you.\\"<br /><br />Some message, huh? That is The Abyss in a nutshell. The film is actually quite good until its denouement. The suspense, the tension between the paranoid Navy S.E.A.L. and Ed Harris, one an authoritarian goon and the other a quite good leader with an ability to relate with other humans, are all quite well done. But the conclusion ruins it all, in addition to the fluorescent Gray-alien/fairy/angel water-beings. It's quite fascinating, and disappointing, to see a film-maker trying to imagine what a \\"higher\\" or \\"more developed\\" being's response would be to the follies of humanity, and falling flat on his face in the process. Cameron simply imagines a response as authoritarian as any we see in our world. The action is supposedly prompted by concern, and love, and yet all the aliens can muster is a supreme show of force. \\"Change your ways, because if you don't, you know I have the power to wipe you out at any moment.\\" Nothing like traumatizing people into \\"correct\\" behavior. It really shows that Cameron has no clue about the depths of human nature, or the \\"higher\\" response in such a situation. And it's a \\"schizoidal declaration\\" if there ever was one! (google it)

B0027AYAT8|4.0|\\"Some Thoughts on Hitler\\"<br /><br />Hitler as Multiracialist Propaganda<br /><br />The argument advanced by some racial nationalists that any defense of Adolf Hitler, in light of the hostility and even revulsion that his name now evokes, risks alienating mainstream Whites is plausible on its surface and should receive a respectful hearing. But it is still on balance mistaken.<br /><br />Although most nationalists in the United States and even in Germany do not consider themselves national socialists, multiracialists and anti-White Jewish advocacy groups call each and every one of us a \\"Nazi.\\" It is an undeniable fact that in our contemporary political climate *any* white nationalism, as recent events in the Balkans amply demonstrate, will be labeled Hitlerian and will summon, in breathless media presentations, \\"the specter of the Holocaust\\" and anguished fears that \\"it\\" might just happen again, if the goyim get too restless. That, after all, is the central lesson taught by the countless Holocaust Museums sprouting up, like noxious toadstools, throughout most of the West: that White racial consciousness is literally lethal and must therefore be actively combated, a lesson which we have now enshrined, in deference to Jewry, at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, a national memorial to our White wickedness.<br /><br />We are thus obliged, like it or not, to live under Hitler's shadow. Our enemies have ensured that any expression of White racial consciousness, however innocuous, will be officially pronounced hatefully Hitlerian and \\"Nazi,\\" whether we admire Hitler or despise him. It is therefore incumbent on us, as a simple matter of self-defense, to arrive at a balanced view of Hitler and the movement he founded.<br /><br />Anyone who doubts all this should recall the abuse that Pat Buchanan received at the hands of the controlled media and the organized Jewish community during his campaigns for the Republican nomination. Buchanan is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a national socialist, nor even a conscious racialist. He is, instead, a traditional Christian conservative, with all the virtues and liabilities that entails. But he was persistently labeled a \\"Nazi\\" nevertheless. [After] his 1992 speech at the Republican National Convention, Jewish columnist Molly Ivins opined, \\"probably sounded better in the original German.\\" Her meaning was clear: She was identifying Buchanan as a \\"Nazi,\\" delegitimizing his nationalism and social conservatism with the most potent weapon in the Left's rhetorical arsenal.<br /><br />So as racial nationalists we can either manufacture false \\"anti-racist\\" credentials by claiming to hate Hitler just as much as Abe Foxman does, a subterfuge that I very much doubt will convince anyone, least of all Abe, or we can tell the truth.<br /><br />The truth is that the maniacal Hitler of popular demonology is a World War II propaganda fiction, and the principal purpose of the fiction's incessant repetition more than fifty years after the war is to stigmatize any nationalist movement, NS or otherwise. Hitler now represents not a specific historical figure and the political party he led, but nationalism of any variety, from timid anti-immigration conservatives to angry White-power skinheads. The System's anti-Hitler orthodoxy, invoked almost daily, is in effect tacit propaganda for multiracialism and a potent device to keep all nationalists perpetually hiding in closets, too afraid of labels like \\"racist\\" and \\"Nazi\\" to openly say what we sincerely believe. We have, therefore, a real interest in demythologizing Hitler, and we have no hope of escaping our association with what he now represents. We can't run away from Hitler, however much some of us want to.<br /><br />Let's Notice the Obvious<br /><br />The crucial facts about World War II are uncomplicated and readily available in mainstream sources. NS Germany had limited war aims: the recovery of territory taken from Germany at Versailles, the acquisitionof living space for the German people in the East, and the destruction of the Marxist Soviet Union, history's most brutal regime. Insofar as the United States had any stake at all in the outcome of the war, it would have been to help Germany and her Axis allies, including thousands of Russian patriots, accomplish the latter. Absent the campaign conducted by the Western democracies to save Stalinism by defeating Hitler, the Soviet Union would have collapsed.<br /><br />Since America had no national interests in the conflict in Europe, our government deliberately lied about German war aims in order to manufacture the perception that we did, claiming that Hitler had global territorial ambitions, a plan for \\"world domination.\\" Over fifty years later most Americans still accept the lies.<br /><br />The predictable result of the Allied victory and the German defeat was Stalin's occupation of half of Europe. A war that ostensibly began to restore Polish sovereignty ended with Poland, along with the rest of Eastern Europe, being handed over to the Communists. And in quite concrete terms no American would have died in Vietnam if Hitler had destroyed Soviet Communism, arguably the central objective of his political career; American soldiers fought in Europe so that their sons could die in Southeast Asia.<br /><br />None of this should be the least controversial. It is a symptom of the effect of persistent propaganda that so many of us fail to notice the obvious.<br /><br />It is only a slight exaggeration to say that multiracialism itself, along with our servile deference to Jewry, is founded on the mythical image of Hitler as evil incarnate, Satan's secular counterpart in modern history. Remove the false, childishly simplistic Hitler myth, and a significant ideological justification for multiracialism would collapse. The simple question, \\"Were Hitler and NS Germany really as evil as everyone says?,\\" therefore has huge repercussions, and an entire machinery of propaganda--ranging from Hollywood films and \\"Holocaust education\\" in the public schools to off-hand comments in the controlled media (\\"better in the original German\\")--has been designed to discourage anyone from even contemplating the obvious but heretical answer.<br /><br />National Socialism<br /><br />Hitler defined his own national socialism as a uniquely German movement:<br />The National Socialist doctrine, as I have always proclaimed, is not for export. It was conceived for the German people. (Hitler-Bormann Documents, Feb. 21, 1945)<br />In other words, German National Socialism arose at a specific time in a specific place under the pressure of a unique set of historical circumstances, none of which could ever be precisely replicated elsewhere. In particular, the autocratic F&uuml;hrer state, central to NS Germany, would never be acceptable to Americans; our republican political culture and belief in individual rights are, thankfully, far too strong. Hitler was a dictator and his government authoritarian; Americans prefer their political and civil liberties.<br /><br />Which doesn't mean that NS Germany was a police state. It had in fact fewer policemen per capita, and far fewer secret police, than either modern Germany or the United States, despite the misleading image most of us have of legions of sinister Gestapo agents kicking down doors in the middle of the night.<br /><br />The basic principles of national socialism are, nevertheless, universal: that God (or Nature) has assigned each of us to a racial group and has endowed each group with distinct qualities; that a nation is not simply a geographical concept, a set of lines arbitrarily drawn on a map irrespective of the people living within them, but instead derives (or should derive) its political institutions and national objectives from the character of the people themselves; that a nation organized to preserve a race and develop its distinctive character is therefore \\"natural\\"; that the strength and social cohesion of a nation derives from its sense of a common identity, of which race is the most important determinant; that in addition to our individual rights we have larger social obligations, not only to the present generation of our nation but to its past and future generations as well; that the primary purpose of a nation is not economic, but the preservation and advancement of its people, economics being subordinate to the volkisch (racial/national) objectives that should be a nation's core reason for existing.<br /><br />\\"The [Nation-] State in itself,\\" Hitler wrote, \\"has nothing whatsoever to do with any definite economic concept or a definite economic development.

0143038419|4.0|I spent my summer camping trip relaxing with Eat, Pray, Love....     Yes, it is self absorbed and self indulgent...but that's the way people going through major life changes are.  And no, we can not all simply walk away from our homes, our families, work or marriages to embark on a spiritual journey - but that is what makes this story worth telling.   Eat, Pray, Love challenged my  personal constructions of spirituality and demonstrates a broader, more global approach to \\"God\\", love and living.   The story of Liz' year of healing is a refreshing reminder that only we can take charge of our lives - our mental, emotional, spiritual and physical health, and create a story for ourselves that reflects our heartfelt dreams.    I completed this book with a renewed sense of personal peace and contentment with my circumstances.   Eat, Pray, Love took me on a journey I could not make in person.

B0000524CY|4.0|That film was a turning point in horror films, in a way. For sure it did not concern some kind of mythical being or character. It was centered on a real person, living next door or up the street. That's the really new element, and even so, there had been some antecedents. The second new element here is the strongly Catholic context, and it is not clear at all that the Catholic Church is not used as a justification, a stamp of truth posted on the film, in other words an alibi. I find that slightly embarrassing today for the Catholic Church and all Catholics in the world. Many Catholics consider that demons, and daemons, and so on along that line, are nothing but a pagan heritage in the Christian approach of the world. The last point is not new at all. It is the close association of these demons to something found in some archaeological site in North Iraq, in other words in Moslem territory. This can be seen today as an anti-Moslem bias and it is absolutely unacceptable. On that point, like on the previous one, the film has aged tremendously. Apart from that the film was well made and still is well made. The suspense and the progression of the plot are quite clear. We understand more or less that the demon takes possession of the younger exorcist and that this priest prefers killing himself to being possessed. There are though several points that remain unanswered and difficult to accept. Why did that demon take possession of a priest? Wasn't it more comfortable to be in a young girl? And how can the priest justify his suicide in any way? If God enables a demon to take possession of one of his priests, that priest has to wait for God to liberate him, and committing suicide is not that kind of a liberation. That's why I will classify this film among the films that played an important role when they came out and even accumulated some fame because of it, but that have today aged tremendously and lost most of their appeal. The list of those is long.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID

B001UV4XUQ|5.0|We watched this movie a week ago and I've been thinking about it all week.  It isn't your typical love story first of all in that it's not in chronological order.  It kind of starts at then end and skips around in the 500 day romance of Tom and Summer.  At first this was a little annoying because it seemed hard to follow, but in the end the whole thing ties together and is cohesive.  I really liked the characters and the actors who played them did an amazing job.  In fact, that's what really made the movie for me, the excellent acting.  Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levit) was the one who was hopelessly in love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and she was always held back and distant, sometimes to the point where I wanted to grab her and shake her!  I think everyone can relate to being in love like Tom, with the big puppy dog eyes and all, at least once in their lives.<br /><br />The director did a fantastic job with the different scenes such as one where Tom, hopelessly in love, breaks out into a well choreographed dance complete with back-up dancers and a cartoon bluebird.  In other scenes you see a split screen showing expectations and reality of an unfolding scene.  There were a couple of cute karaoke scenes and a scene in an Ikea store that I thought was really well done.  The writing was great and it was very different from your typical romantic comedy.  Two thumbs up for this one!
0735619670|3.0|I am utterly convinced that \\"general advice book\\" about how to become a better programmer are invariably useful only to their authors and publishers, but this book is a partial exception to the rule, being more down to earth, and code-centered than the typical book in this genre. I see it as a good bedtime read for a fresh CS graduate who is very sharp on the tecnical side and on  \\"programming as a lerning the theory\\" but needs a primer on the more pragmatic aspects of \\"programming as a work\\". For anyone who has been in the profession for more than a few years it can be nothing more than a written version of the typical relaxing coffe break chat you have with a coworker about issues that you both know very well but still like to talk about. Its size could definitely be cut by at least 30% without loss of information or clarity, minimizing boredom and wasted time on the reader's part. It would also contribute to make this text a book that people actually read instead of just liking to show it on one's own desk or library. But then how to justify the excessive price tag? :)

B000Q66Q06|5.0|I bought this because I wanted to see and hear Strauss' Till Eulenspiegel and Don Juan by the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by a young (1992) Claudio Abbado.  It was every bit as good as I expected, but then came the delightful surprises.<br /><br />First, there was Strauss' Burleske for Piano and Orchestra with Martha Argerich at the piano.  What a virtuoso!  How can she hit so many right notes, so rapidly in a blur of fingers dancing over the keyboard!  I relished the \\"conversations\\" that Argerich and her piano had with other instruments--especially the playful exchanges with the timpani.  Rarely does one see such an emotionally-involved pianist.  To watch her thinking and experiencing the music--even when she's not playing--was an experience not to be forgotten.  I can't wait to share it with friends.<br /><br />Then, just to put the icing on the cake, out came Kathleen Battle, Frederica von Stade, and Renee Fleming to sing that incredible trio and finale from Der Rosenkavalier--and they did this very well.<br /><br />This was a concert to enjoy and share with friends:  a great orchestra, great conductor, great pianist, and great singing.  Enjoy it with someone who loves music!

0783226063|3.0|Let me start by saying this is an okay movie if you can get past a few things. They do far too much voice over/internal monologue, they don't explain the story particularly well, and there are several somewhat gross moments where the Harkonens are involved. That's not a rousing endorsement, and it isn't meant to be. Even if you can accept those elements, the movie has a few problems. Even director David Lynch claims that he never had the chance to make a satisfactory final cut of the film.<br /><br />The voice over/internal monologue was used because so much of the novel happens in the minds of the characters, which is hard to film. But the way it's used here is a bit too much at times. Several pieces of internal monologue could just as easily have been turned into dialogue or simply cut out completely by compensating with more emotive characters. It just feels somewhat lazy to rely on the voice over to tell the story.<br /><br />The Harkonens are quite disgusting at times, and the baron has some kind of putrid skin condition on his face, but that makes it easy to see them as the evil people they are. Whether that is necessary or lazy story telling can be up to your personal judgment, but know that it isn't something for little kids.<br /><br />But the biggest difficulty is the fact that it is very hard to tell a story this layered and detailed in just two hours and seventeen minutes. If you know the story already, you can follow it well enough (at least the parts that they haven't changed), but for people new to DUNE, it's easy to get lost. When it was originally released to theaters, some locations handed out \\"cheat sheets\\" to help the audience understand some of the terminology or politics of this new universe that Frank Herbert crated.<br /><br />And don't even begin to wonder where the Weirding Devices came from. That's something they made in this movie with no real source from the book.
006621131X|3.0|Believe me when I say that I wanted to love, not like this book.  And parts of it I do.  You can't help but cry at the way she ends the book, talking about Robert Mapplethorpe's final battle with AIDS, and how they barely had enough to eat living in Brooklyn in the late 1960's and their subsequent move to Chelsea in the early 1970's.  There are some pages so filled with this person and that person, and how she was with this guy and Robert was with that guy who introduced them to this other guy who helped them out with another guy.  I am not exaggerating.  And they never get to meet Andy Warhol or Jim Morrison, but Patti meets everyone else, including brief encounters with Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. It's all believable but much of the book seems preposterous anyway. This book is a valiant tribute to a revolutionary artist, but other biographers and journalists will have to more effectively chronicle the life of Mapplethorpe (as well as Patti herself).

B002QW7ALM|3.0|Pandorum is very interesting from the sci-fi perspective: We have the ultimate spaceship, carrying what's left of mankind, planet Earth's biological supplies and knowledge to another Earth-like planet. The main premise is excellent, and the first quarter of the movie is pure sci-fi. The short prologue of the film is very cool and impressive.    Then, we have the 'scare' element, that when first showed makes little sense, but it is explained in part about the resolution of the story; if only this 'horror creature' were explained with a little more science instead of trying to deliver frequently the scare and fight element, this movie would have much been better. Nevertheless I must admit that when explained briefly, where the creatures could come from, it does makes a lot of sense, I really liked it. Also, there are two plot twists that serve the story. Another highlight, albeit very brief, is the ending; those who have read Arthur C. Clarke's \\"The Songs from Distant Earth\\" might remember the novel.    Resuming, the pros of this film are small pleasures for Sci-Fi fans, but the big picture remains, the flaws are also important: trying to give equal importance of main plot elements to the horror-creature-chase-fight stuff was a serious mistake. What should have been a very good and memorable Sci-fi flick (like District 9 or even Predator) is degraded to the level of lesser items (Aliens Vs. Predator, Ultraviolet, Resident Evil) and accepting the influence of great films like Alien and best elements of Event Horizon, is not enough to save Pandorum. So what we have is a movie in where story-wise the Science Fiction departament is good but superficial in delivering and the Horror Department fails miserably (nevertheless, a child-creature was indeed weirdly freaky, but Science can take over that). Acting is OK from the two leads and of course you get the hot chick, the asian-Mortal-Kombat-fighter and the cannibal freak, these last two completely disposable and useless characters (I liked the chic!). Production design is good, and space FX (not a lot, wish there would be more) are very good.    I'd never call this movie 'stupid' or 'terrible' like some suggest, being a sci-fi fan means one have to be open minded, not accepting any trash of course, but at least to acknowledge the sci-fi value in films of the genre: when the space probe lands for the first time in another earthly planet it is well done, but again, very brief; the short history lesson of a previous space mission is eerie. Best of all, Pandorum could be used as a cautionary tale (not like Avatar, where the 'message' is in your face) like what would happen if we must leave Earth definitely, the dangers of it and in WHAT would we become; if we destroy Earth and leave to another star system, is'nt much better to take care of our planet, the only one we have to live in?    Until now we did not have a movie with such a heavy theme about the very survival of the last of the humankind depending on space travel (some would say Sunshine, I say 'meeh!'), but if you ask me I'd prefer a movie adaptation of The Songs from Distant Earth, instead, I get Pandorum, life is'nt perfect.    Surely Pandorum will be my guilty pleasure in my movie collection, recommend to rent before buying if you are a Sci-Fi fan; if not, you might want to stay away.

Reading this book, it is clear that it shares a line of commentary -- and even anecdotes -- similar to that of Omnivore's Delimma and Food, Inc. Regardless of its duplicity, it is a very engaging book. I sat down and read it all on a Sunday, which is really not something I typically do.    This book focused much more on the slaughter and physical treatment of livestock and poultry rather than on their feeding and the health impact of such feeding on humans. There was virtually zero discussion on the negative impact of Swift, Tyson, et al has on independent farmers.    The book was chock full of anecdotes. Safran-Foer really took the time to experience how meat gets from farm to table. Who knew that baby chicks were sent from breeders to farmers via the US Mail? Can you imagine?

B002VKE1K2|5.0|My girlfriend and I watched Paranormal Activity last night and wow--the film is still with me this morning! The movie starts out very slow, and admittedly I was thinking \\"When is something going to happen?\\" But when it did, I couldn't wait for the next thing to happen. The attic scene with the picture, the scream from downstairs, moving blankets, powder footprints, etc. all were examples of things were genuinely frightening. We had just watched Halloween II (Zombie version) before this (what a piece of crap that was), and despite all the gore in that, it wasn't scary. PA WAS!!! The last 2 minutes had my heart pounding--don't really think that's happened while watching a horror flick in years. I dare say that was one of the scariest things I've ever seen in a horror movie.  I know, I know--things that go bump in the night---ooooh, scary!! I'll tell you what--if I heard screams in my house, footprints on the floor, broken pictures, and doors that closed by themselves, the local priest would be at my house pronto!!  I highly recommend this for Blair Witch fans. That was a classic fright movie and so is this.

You won't like these short stories nearly as much as what you are looking for.<br /><br />I was attracted to this book after hearing Mr. Grisham talk about how these were stories that he had worked on for a long time that refused to turn themselves into full-fledged novels. I was immediately curious about how a gifted story teller like Mr. Grisham could possibly paint himself into a large number of boxes.<br /><br />Keeping that perspective in mind, I found that these stories were more rewarding than his interview suggested to me. In many cases the reason they cannot be novels is because he has built up a single scene or episode in a character's life to such an extent that anything else you might add to it would pale too much by comparison.<br /><br />I also didn't expect to find some terrific stories and was pleasantly surprised to find one. Michael's Room is one of the most compelling short stories I remember reading. I also disagree with Mr. Grisham about this not being able to become a novel. Add the background to this story as the rest of the novel, end with this story, and you've got quite a compelling and rewarding novel.<br /><br />For pure irony and humor, Blood Drive rings very true about the ways we are all easily distracted into doing things that we shouldn't. You could drop this story into the middle of a novel about a pill-popping drunk on his way down (Roger Tucker) and end the novel either with him in the gutter or experiencing redemption.<br /><br />I thought that some of these stories shouldn't be novels because they don't work very well . . . unfortunately, because they don't offer enough contrast to a bleak look at human nature. I put Fetching Raymond and Fish Files in that category.<br /><br />Quiet Haven provides us with a lovable scoundrel, the type of character that Mr. Grisham can write well about. This story wouldn't stretch into a novel because the story depends on a set-up that's not strong enough to carry a whole book.<br /><br />Casino was too predictable to me, but was mildly entertaining.<br /><br />Funny Boy is full of pathos, but much of the story depends on people being very ignorant about AIDS. Knowing what we know now about that terrible disease, it's hard to get back into the mindset of when we were all first learning about it.coundrel, the type of character that Mr. Grisham can write well about.

B000TGCR38|5.0|This movie is in Dutch, with a little bit of English from time to time and even less Hebrew.  As far as foreign films go, this one is at the top of my favorites list.      One night while up late, not able to sleep, I found the movie on an independent film channel.  But I had not found it in time to catch it from the beginning.  I continued to watch, even though I was a little confused.  At the end, I knew I had to see the whole thing.      Now I've watched the movie in it's entirety and love it even more.  I could watch this over and over and never get tired of it.    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!    ~Betsy

B002N1AERI|4.0|Escuchar el cuarto álbum de estudio de la banda holandesa Epica, Design Your Universe, muestra la madurez que va adquiriendo con los años. Los 13 temas compuestos mayormente por la dupla Jansen - Simone forman parte de un seguimiento cósmico iniciado con Consign to Oblivion y seguido por The Divine Conspiracy, donde la melodiosa voz de Simone Simons hace dupla con la fuerte escena sinfónica y los coros que dan un sentido cósmico - religioso a las canciones.  Teniendo como preludio Samadhi, con coro en latín, dan paso a un potente riff con dobleteo de batería y la clásica voz de ultratumba que combina con Simone en Resign To Surrender, marcando el inicio del disco.   Con Unleashed deslumbra la pujante voz de Simone que la eleva como en sus mejores momentos, y la batería que estalla hasta el final. Los sonidos de violín nos trasladan y acompañan a lo largo del viaje.  Para no dar descanso a los oídos, Martyr Of The Free World inicia con mucha fuerza y violencia, acompañados por una guitarra decadente que nos hace escuchar diversas voces de supuestos mártires que luchan por la libertad. El coro gregoriano es llamativo puesto que, a pesar de sonar escasos segundos, acompañan a la perfección esta canción.  El inicio de Our Destiny es suave, que no llega a representar una balada a la que nos tienen acostumbrados, mas la dócil voz de Simone se ve atacada por los gruñidos y voces de ultratumba que gritan don`t let go en señal de auxilio. Culmina la canción con unas breves notas de piano que nos hacen descender temporalmente mientras inicia Kingdom of Heaven, que nos sobresalta con una batería y constantes cambios de ritmo. Esta es, quizá, la pieza clave del álbum no solo por las muestras de dominio vocal, coral, y de instrumentos que muestran distintos estados de ánimo, sobretodo cuando la voz de ultratumba nos indica que no es nuestro tiempo y que debemos regresar, continuando con un rugido endemoniado y la posterior súplica de un hombre arrepentido para que nos deje continuar. Simone y compañía culminan esta larga canción con tonos en decadencia. Repetimos: esta es, quizá, una de las mejores canciones que ha realizado Epica hasta el momento.  Un breve respiro es el que nos tomamos con The Price of Freedom, a pesar de las conversaciones sobre libertad que nos van guiando a Burn to a Cinder, que es una canción con tonada a la cual nos tienen ya acostumbrados, muy melódico sin mayor esfuerzo por parte de la voz como del acompañamiento instrumental. El final de la misma nos hace descender de ritmo con una suave voz de estilo épico, cándido y terrenal.  La balada se encuentra en Tides of Time, otra de las ya clásicas composiciones de Epica, para quienes deseamos disfrutar de Simone y compañía. El solo de piano y sintetizador para luego dar paso a la guitarra y batería hacen de ésta una composición que llena el espacio de poesía del álbum.  El estilo bella y la bestia la encontramos en Deconstruct, pues mientras Simone conversa con suave voz, la ultratumba resurge para dialogar con el pesimismo decadente. Aquí es que volvemos a percibir los cambios de ritmo pero mucho más rápidos, sin descanso, con un coro en esta ocasión mayormente femenino.   Escuchamos trash metal en Semblance Of Liberty, con potente guitarra y voz trash durante los primeros momentos. Ello, acompañado por una batería que no descansa hasta que Simone hace ingreso para aminorar el ritmo. Sin embargo, cuando el trash voice hace su entrada, los instrumentos vuelven a surgir. Así como existen las baladas, Epica también nos muestra su lado fuerte en esta canción.  Para White Waters, Tony Kakko (vocalista de Sonata Arctica) acompaña con su voz para esta segunda balada del álbum. Es un ritmo que no se le ha escuchado anteriormente a Tony Kakko con su actual agrupación, con mucha melodía y ritmo donde la fuerza instrumental es dejada de lado.  Culmina el álbum con Design Your Universe, con una introducción al mejor estilo soundtrack, para luego dar paso a la batería y potencia de las cuerdas, que son tranquilizadas por Simone. Esta canción es el retorno a lo mejor de Epica, combinando cambio de ritmos, el coro mesiánico femenino que luego es atropellado por los ruidos guturales de Mark Jansen. Tuvimos que esperar a escuchar todo el álbum para poder apreciar una de las futuras clásicas de la agrupación holandesa, sobretodo porque Simone hace gala de su voz mezzosoprano y los cortes abruptos de los cantos corales. Un gran final para un álbum que es como un diamante que se ha estado puliendo con el tiempo, la experiencia, y la gracia de los intérpretes.

That's the overall theme of this book and Mr. Nesbo provides some pretty interesting fictional food for self-examination. As you read this book, put yourself in the place of each character and ask yourself what you would do.<br /><br />Harry Hole is that most useful of all detectives, one who is human . . . oh so human, so that we step back from admiring the detective to be astonished by the echoes of vivid reality portrayed for us. As a reader, it can be terribly easy to underestimate this book. True writing craft doesn't show its care, and Mr. Nesbo is astonishingly good at making a brilliant story seem like just so much ordinary potatoes until the cymbals clap together and jolt you into jaw-dropping amazement at what you've just read.<br /><br />This is the first Harry Hole book I've read, and I can hardly wait to read the next one. The Redbreast ends in such a way that the possibilities for future plots are enhanced . . . rather than restricted by the events in this remarkable story.

I bought this book for my son and he loves it too. I have read my set since the mid '80s. Give volume I & II a shot.
B001NB4UNS|4.0|Let me preface my review with stating that when this album came out, I was discovering music both backwards and forwards simultaneously, ie, I was discovering classic rock and current rock at the same time.  That said, I was comparing this album just as much to the burgeoning genius of Radiohead as I was to U2's earlier work, which I also became a big fan of around the same time.  I think this album is a very good album not Great status like \\"Joshua Tree\\", \\"War\\", and \\"Achtung, Baby\\", but just below that, on par with Zooropa, I think.  And also a direct result of Zooropa, I will never belittle a band for experimenting with sound and not settling for remaking their last big hit album.  As long as the melodies and the lyrics are good, I will never belittle experimentation.  If you do, you're halting the progress of the band.  What if someone had told the Beatles they had to make \\"With the Beatles\\" again instead of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"?  I'm not comparing them as bands or album to album, just conventional vs. experimental, but just the ridiculousness of trying to force a band to play like they used to play.  It's idiotic.  If you want a band to sound the same all the time, buy some Nickleback and shop at Wal-Mart.  This album is unfairly criticized and has one of the greatest U2 singles, in my opinion, with \\"Please\\".  I love that song.  I also really love \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\", \\"Staring At the Sun\\", \\"Last Night On Earth\\", and even \\"Discotheque\\".  There is some kind of backlash against this album that I do not understand.  And all of you haters came right back for the next album \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\".  Fickle, fickle, fickle.  Just proves that you are not fans of the music, you are fans of whoever is \\"cool\\" at the moment (if that even exists, I don't think it does-ask Robert Johnson, Leadbelly, or Woody Guthrie, who paved the way for everything we call rock now, if they were ever \\"cool\\").  Let a band experiment, otherwise you are the dumbass in the crowd who still yells \\"Free Bird!\\" without knowing that you are an idiot and everyone else in the crowd hates you after you do it (not to mention that you actually belittle Lynyrd Skynyrd when you do it because you don't understand that band at all, god, I hate you Free-Bird-yellers).  This is yet another U2 album that was before its time.  It will be better appreciated in the coming years, I'm gonna hold onto my release-day copy, it's gonna be worth something later, when this album is given it's just dues.

B0000A1HQP|5.0|One of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and at age 50 I have seen them all. But to make a truly funny film you need to have moments of poignancy and this film has it all.    One of my 5 favorite films of the decade.
B002ZHKZD8|5.0|I was a little hesitant before I made my purchase, but I needn't have been. This Blu-ray/DVD Combo disc works perfectly fine on my SONY BDP-S550. Picture quality is great, as is the audio. I wont go into the details of the disc contents, since others already have done so, but this Combo release from Universal comes highly recommended from me. Complete the trilogy with this essential purchase.
B002SJIO5E|2.0|I had not seen the movie but thought it would be a good sci-fi flick for me. Well should have rented it first.  Most of the movie was in the format of a documentary. Similar to the opening sequence for the old TV show \\"Alien Nation\\".  I am not a fan of that perspective in a movie.  Special effects/CGI were pretty good but that was about it.  The movie did leave itself open for a sequel which I would not see unless it was produced as a normal movie.
0060555661|2.0|I've just taken over the management of my investment portfolio from the brainless bank that let it lose 40% of its value in 2007 - 2009.<br /><br />For years I had heard of Graham as the \\"nec plus ultra\\" of all writers on investments, so this book was high on my reading list as I set to my new task.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the financial markets of 1972 (when Graham wrote this book) are far different from today's, despite the chapters written by Jason Zweig (interleaved with Graham's) which try to update and explain Graham's ideas in terms of the market environment of 2003.  Read in 2010, Zweig's updates also seem quite dated.<br /><br />To achieve a prudent level of diversification today, most individual investors will use at least mutual funds, if not ETF's.  The analysis of individual stocks is too time consuming.  First one is up against professionals who do it for a living. Secondly, the complexity of today's markets  for goods and services requires huge amounts of study before even looking at a company's financials.  Thirdly, one should probably expect to analyse at least 20 companies before choosing one to invest in.<br /><br />If one wants to undertake individual stock picking, why not read this book before turning to Graham's \\"Security Analysis\\".<br /><br />If not, the purchase of a cheap second hand copy of the book can be justified, but primarily on the grounds of being able to skim it to see if one agrees with the words above.

B000OVLBGC|4.0|Dear Mr. von Donnersmarck,    I have just finished watching \\"The Lives of Others\\" while listening to your director's commentary.  I must thank you not only for the beautiful, rich experience that your film imparts but also for the generosity with which you share your own feelings and thoughts.  The first time I watched the film, I was taken by the thriller aspects -- the depth of futility with which the East German people had to live was (as you show) literally life-threatening in its oppressive persistence.  When the mere act of imagining becomes labeled \\"subversive\\" by the government, what life can a person truly have?     But what I wanted to write here was to you, Mr. von Donnersmarck, to thank you for your kindness.  You are such a generous, intelligent and kind soul.  Your film moved me, but your commentary had me in tears.  The sheer magnitude of the things you dealt with in the construction of this artwork is mind-boggling and your ability to attend to such detail is nothing short of genius.  The warmth that you share with your audience in how you adore the actors and crew, your willingness to be open and honest, your sense of humor, the warmth and the love you feel and communicate -- all these things give me such deep respect for you, and let me know that you have earned, in advance, every accolade you receive, now and in the future.    What a breadth of knowledge you have!  To go from recommending Brecht as a good reason to learn German to putting a \\"Visitors Welcome\\" sign on Stasi headquarters!  To speak of the Leitmotif and how you used it in the music, but also show us the Pieta.  You show us a lonely man, yet you filled the world around him with love.    You talk of persistence, yet you admit your mistakes (when you talk about the color palette and say that there is no red, as if on queue, the councilman's brakelights go on.  I thought you'd laugh at that...).      You are a man like whom I would most earnestly want to be.  I envy those who have the honor of calling you friend.    Chris

B00275EGX8|4.0|My little brother is in Air Force EOD and has had his fair share of experience in Iraq/Afghanistan. He has seen the movie as well and was impressed with the level of realism. Granted there is obviously some poetic license here and there but overall the equipment used and basic outline of the procedures and their intent, he says, were dead on. Not to mention it is a real eye-openner for those that have no clue what American service men and women go through over there! I highly recommend seeing this movie for a number of reasons. The previously mentioned realism as well as the overall plot/story is gripping and reasonably well paced throughout. Enjoy!
B0030BOCKK|3.0|I have been a huge HIM fan for years, so much i have the heartagram tattood on me to show my devotion. i have everything from the begginning demos until now. so like many people who love the old HIM sound like myself, i can see why no one is really digging this album.<br /><br />im surprised no one has mentioned the song \\"in the arms of rain\\" that is deffinatly the best track off the album in my opinion, lots of synth and pretty sounds as simple as i can put it. that song has been on repeat. and the last track on the cd i think is great too, very melodic. \\"like st valentine\\" is a catchy track that is also one of my favorites off the album. i dont think the album is terrible, yes it does get a little boring after a while cause most the songs sound the same. but i do prefur this over dark light, theres only 2 songs that i enjoyed off dark light. but im sure screamworks will grow on me overtime. but of course, nothing can compare to the early him, its crazy to hear how different their sound is from greatest love songs till now. but all bands go through a phase of changing their sounds, and usually when people are not happy with it, they come back with an amazing album next time.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I  Love  This  Film.      I would HIGHLY recommend people take advantage of the Amazon price deal and pick up the Star Trek 3 disc set along with the film The Fall.  They are both terrific and you will want to watch them over and over.

0307269981|5.0|The only disappointing thing about read The Girl Who Played with Fire is the realization that the author of this excellent book passed away in 2004. This is the second book in Stieg Larsson's trilogy featuring journalist Mikael Blomqvist and computer hacker Lisbeth Salander.  The first book was the amazing [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]].  This book is every bit as good as the first.  Salander becomes the prime suspect in three murders and ultimately needs the help of Blomqvist, a person that she never wanted to see again.  Salander is a great character that is so complex that she even surprises herself with her feelings told Blomqvist.  The authorities are hell bent to catch Salander and prove that she killed two individuals that were working on the sex trade.  The plot thickens as some members of the Swedish police are suspected of being customers.  Revenge, drama, mystery and suspense all feature in this excellent 5 star novel.  Highly recommended!

1591843162|5.0|I should preface this review by saying that I am a Seth Godin fan and have been since Permission Marketing. But, frankly, his last two books have taken his ideas and his writing to a new, exponentially higher level. Up until the moment I started Linchpin I was sure that Tribes was his best work - ever. My son brought it home after attending a Godin seminar in New York a few months ago. Just as he returned home with a signed copy of Tribes a note on Godin's blog suggested making a donation to the Acumen Foundation for a pre-purchase copy of his latest, Linchpin.    I made the donation, ordered the book and it arrived just as I was putting Tribes down. Frankly, I recommend that you read them together: Tribes first, then Linchpin. One is the logical extension of the other and both are exceptional.    If you would like an invaluable insight into the way marketing will be accomplished now and in the future this is your road map!    I just received a second copy of Linchpin, which I have given to my son - the perfect gift (buy the book and you'll understand!) and am about to order copies of both for everyone in our company. These are two of the best business books I've ever read... At least, until Seth writes another one!
0765348276|5.0|Picked this book on based almost entirely on the number of good reviews on Amazon.  That and I'm a sucker for just about all Science Fiction.  Wasn't really sure what to expect, but after finishing realized it ranked up there on some of my favorite books (with the likes of Dune, Enders Game and Hyperion).  That isn't too say it's just as good as those mentioned, but it was certainly close, which is saying something.  Not to mention the fact that I've read it twice now, which has only happened a couple times before in my book reading history.  Passed my copy onto a friend who rarely picks up a novel and he ended up loving it.  While it isn't as deep and politically interesting as say Starship Troopers, I'd still recommend it just as quickly.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|From the first moment the music began my soul was cradled in a misty, peaceful, loving glow; flowing into, and with, Sade's voice, and the muscians skillful playing.  Each note touching me in ways so unexpected, but so glorious.  The years have matured Sade, and her vocals, and the music is spot-on.  What a delight.  Don't waste any time; order now!!

B0001KZM3O|2.0|I can understand that if you're all about Waters, you have good reason to love the album. It has very high production value and he's lead vocals in all but one song (Not Now John - which is my favorite by far).    I can see the appeal, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to get into it for the following reasons:    -The first 75% of the album sounds like the more somber/preachy tracks from The Wall, but not as easy to relate to. I think they had their place in The Wall, but so many of them back to back was painful for me. Waters 'emotion' felt forced and his tone became monotonous. That little whisper he does at the end of several lines was driving me slightly nuts by the 4th track or so.    -It didn't feel like a Pink Floyd album. It felt like a Waters album. It may be unfair of me to think this way, but I couldn't help but feel his ego through my headphones.    -The album is incredibly direct in its criticism of War - much more so than even The Wall. I'm not saying that's good or bad for a first listen, but it's not something I'd be able to listen to more than once every couple of months.    Overall, I think my review is biased based on my slightly bent opinion of Waters, but I stand by the fact that this album is too heavy/emo/monotonous (except for the last two tracks, which were good!) for my tastes
B001U7FWM8|4.0|As much as any artist I can think of, Grizzly Bear is a band that lives off moments. There are songs on this album that are brilliant all the way through, such as the piano driven and utterly infectious \\"Two Weeks\\". But a number of songs, especially around the middle of the track list, could easily be justified as at least a little bit boring. Nothing wrong with them musically, they just aren't particularly interesting for the most part. They're nearly all saved though by at least a couple passages, even if they only last a few seconds, that remind you how good this band can be at its best. In a perfect world, a band wouldn't have to remind you how good it is, it would just be apparent the whole time you're listening. And I'm sort of exaggerating the degree to which these \\"boring\\" tracks are uninteresting. They're all entirely pleasant to the ear, it's just that they don't stand up to \\"Southern Point\\" or \\"While You Wait for the Others\\". The album both begins and ends pretty brilliantly, and it's enough along with those moments throughout that middle to say I do like this album quite a bit. I think their previous release Yellow House was probably more consistently good throughout, those the highs of Veckatimest are every bit as lofty. Grizzly Bear would be hard pressed to work their way in as one of my favorite bands, but their early career so far is pretty darn promising.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I loved this movie and it arrived in great shape and seems like a new one, even though it was used.  Would order from them again.  Thanks.

B0012GMUZY|5.0|Two names that come up in any decent history of the blues are Robert Johnson and John Hurt.  Robert Johnson is the better known having supplied Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, the Animals, Led Zeppilin and every other 60s group of note with their principle blues rifts and signature songs.  John Hurt seems to be less well known and entirely different.  There's a distinct folk element in Hurt's work over which the blues are laid that isn't present in Johnson's.  Hurt's music nearly always sounds happy, like he's singing it with a smile on his face.  But it reminds me of a lot of Mexican peasant music, which also sounds happy and gay, but actually is about a man who wants to kill his wife with his hunting knife for sleeping with his brother.  She's usually depicted as hiding under the kitchen table screaming.  John Hurt has a few tunes like that; Nobody's Dirty Business for example. It's nobody's dirty business if he wants to belt into his girlfriend or kill his wife, nobody's business but his own.  There are a few of those, but at the same time there's his version of Frankie, as in Frankie and Johnny, but in Hurt's version, it's not Johnny, it's Albert.  And if you only need one reason to buy this album, or any other complilation of Hurt's music, it would have to be the immortal Stack O'Lee, that bad man, cruel Stack O'Lee.  Stack O'Lee has been a figure in American Black men's folk history since somewhere in the 19th century and the versions of it are legion; almost as many as there are versions of Frankie and Johnny.  In fact the only song on this album that I reckon they could've well done without is Blessed Be the Name, which basically goes Blessed be the Name, blessed be the Name, blessed be Name, to a churchy hymn tune for 2 1/2 minutes that feels like ten.  Very, very boring.  So yes, I'd say buy this album if you care about blues, blues history and knowing what it all sounded like back at the beginning.  It's a good listen.

0385532458|1.0|I have been a fan of John Grisham for some time and have collected and read most of his books but I was extremely disappointed by his latest effort: Ford County: Stories.  It was not only his poorest effort but one of the worst books I have ever read!

B002XTBE6K|4.0|Emma has been particularly well served on film and this version is much longer than either Paltrow's or Beckinsale's which is a plus. Here we have an Emma who is rich and handsome but not quite as clever as she should be, a victim of the modernized dialog many reviewers have commented on. Why not leave well enough alone - there's a reason we're still reading these books 200 years later!<br /><br />The supporting players are very good as are the production values. All in all not up to the recent Sense and Sensibility but despite the above caveats well worth having.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|I put this on my favorites list shortly after viewing the TV special.  Too bad the supplier or Amazon canceled the availability of this Deluxe Edition, because it's worth the money.  I ended up purchasing it from a private seller for slightly more than Amazon was asking.  If you love the Beatles and you enjoy watching a musician who truely enjoys his work, and like Paul McCartney, buy this!!  You will not be disappointed!

B002ZG98J6|5.0|First, let me say right up front that I have not read any of the Percy Jackson books.  My 12 ½ year old has read them all and loved them, but I did not read any of them before seeing PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF tonight.  And while I see many, many similarities to the Harry Potter series, I really enjoyed THE LIGHTNING THIEF.  Although it feels a bit familiar, it is still a fun and exciting adventure.  And a very delightful family film.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is a misfit, always in trouble and having difficulty in school.  He has a lot of trouble reading; the letters dance around the page.  The one place he feels at home is in the water.  Turns out, there is a good reason for that.  It seems that Percy is the son of the god Poseidon and a human mother.  And there are others like him, \\"half-blood\\" kids (demi-gods) who all attend a special camp to learn to use their powers and to protect themselves.  But now, the Earth is in danger.  Someone has stolen Zeus's lightning bolt.  If it is not returned by the solstice, then the gods will go to war.  And humanity will suffer the consequences.  Did Percy steal Zeus's bolt?  If not, then who did?  Can Percy and his companions Annabeth and Grover find the lightning bolt and return it to Olympus before the deadline?<br /><br />As you can see from the above synopsis, there are huge parallels between Percy Jackson and Harry Potter - secret powers, a trio of friends, a special school, a dangerous quest, and the world in peril.  Add to that director Chris Columbus, who also happened to direct the first two Potter films, and you get a movie with a very similar look and feel.  But in this case, the copy holds up well to the original.  THE LIGHTNING THIEF is a an enjoyable romp through Greek mythology with really great special effects, an engaging story, good acting, and an amusing touch of humor.  All-in-all, it made for a terrific evening out with my family.  And you can bet that I will be reading these books very soon.
B0035X1BSO|4.0|I purchased the Kindle version of this book on 8 Feb 2010 and unlike the other reviewer, I got the right book.    I'm not particularly knowledgeable in the world of finance, certainly not at this level, so I can't comment on the technical accuracy of the book.  But, I found it to be written in a style I could easily read and understand - terms that have been thrown around since the whole 'GFC' thing started all of a sudden make some sense to me.  The author appears to come clean on his own mistakes, but makes it clear where he thinks the failure at Lehman happened.    I think my only doubts about this book come from the fact that almost every event is discussed as though the author was present, even when he can't have been. It leaves a bit of a question mark about just how accurate some of the fine detail might be.  But, regardless of that, it's a good read and from an interesting perspective.
0307346617|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I downloaded the sample and decided to give it a read.  It started off fairly interesting, but then at times it slipped into a very tedious state.  Over and over describing similar things (especially about the Zheads).  A few of the stories were very interesting to me, while others were just dreadful to get through.  While reading some of the slower parts of the book I started to feel like I was a zombie.  Nonetheless, the book is a eazy read, and is interestingly put together.  I understand the movie rights have been purchased for this book, so if it makes it to the big screen it will be interesting to see how they convey the story.
0446402389|1.0|As I read the opening pages of this novel, I was impressed by the author's chutzpah. What an ambitious undertaking! Write a murder mystery set in Stalinist USSR during the repressive, paranoid years after WWII, where nothing was what it seemed, truth was State-defined, and you couldn't trust anybody, not even your own family.     First of all, he had to recreate that time and place believably: a society so different from our own, where open information was unknown and contact with the outside world was unheard of. The safest way to stay alive was to know nothing about anything or anybody. In this age of instant information, it's mind-boggling to consider a world where literally the only \\"news\\" was state-sanctioned propoganda.    And so many of the elements necessary in a murder mystery were impossible, unreliable or downright dangerous: the ability to move around freely, to ask questions, to expect cooperation from others, to believe what people tell you. To believe your own eyes. Smith solves this problem by making his protagonist a policeman, but this quickly becomes a liability as much as an asset. Nobody is safe.     (Even before page one, I was already thinking about the other Smith who writes about a Soviet policeman investigating mysterious murders: Martin Cruz Smith. I'm a huge fan of Arkady Renko, and so again, I thought to myself, chutzpah.)     So how did he do? He started off well enough. I was sucked in. I had to raise my eyebrows here and there - some situations were a bit unlikely, but overall I was willing to overlook them as the story proceeded.     But sadly, somewhere mid-stream, believability was utterly lost, and after that, it went from bad to worse, to the point where I was scanning paragraphs hop-scotching to get to the end. I'd completely lost faith in him. As far as I was concerned, the whole thing would be solved by an alien spacecraft buried in the Urals emerging to bring a new world order. It was all just... crap.     The next paragraphcontains massive spoilers ahead, so skip it unless you want to know.      Credulity was strained from the get-go. The below-the-ice river rescue? I grew up where people die like that regularly. You don't survive. He's standing there with the phone cord around the dude's throat and happens to be right next to the drawer where the book happens to be, and the book happens to have a tidy list of all the people who're being set up. The whole bizarre story on the transport train, convincing the people to back him up, pulling out nails with bare fingers, the wife's means of obtaining a tool for prying out a nail, the two of them sliding along under the train, oh I can't even go on. The noble peasant village banding together to rescue the heroic duo. Right. And nobody with half a brain would have stayed in Moscow to sneak into his parents' apartment in the middle of the night.    And we haven't even gotten to the crux of the story yet. I can go for a big, plot-hinging dramatic gesture when the groundwork's been adequately laid. God knows, the horrors of that life must have warped many peoples' minds to the point of insanity. But the whole fabric of the story had become unravelled for me by that point and I   frankly didn't care who was who.     Which was a shame. Demidov was an intriguing hero and for a long time I was interested in him. How would you survive in that world, if you weren't morally vacant? You'd have to tell yourself you were acting for the greater good. Ends justify the means, etc. Tantalizing to imagine a man who has constructed a framework of rationalizations that kept him afloat for years, but under the surface, the foundation was rotting, and we're there when it collapses and he finally sees the truth, sees himself for who he really is: a thug. I loved some of the opening scenes, the way he knew he could trust no one, how everybody is on guard every moment of every day wondering who is trying to sell them out. I loved the twists in his relationship withhis wife. That was believable and wrenching. Nothing was what it seemed, including what was most real to him. I was impressed by Smith's use of Stalin's death as timely device to throwing the whole system into confusion, like a fruit basket upset.     And yes, this kind of closed society would be an ideal place for a murderer to thrive. What a disappointment it didn't hold together, because believability is a fundamental requirement in any murder mystery, and for me, this book failed completely. I wish Smith had had a decent editor who would have sent him back to the drawing board to work out the book's fatal flaws.
0316044695|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect when I got this book.  I read the sample on my kindle and decided it was worth buying.  The first half of the book talks about his training (SEAL) and life as a child.  The second half of the book and most interesting was of his ordeal in Afghanistan where he lost several team members while on a mission.  Althought I was not that interested in the first half of the book (already knowledgeable in what SEALs go through in regards to training) it still moved along at a quick pace.  Very easy read, and the second half of the book will not dissapoint.    If you have an interest in military, and or are former military, then this book should be in your library.    Semper Fi.

For those of you who don't know what remastered is its just enhanced, the old quality is no more now it sounds like there really in front of you singing. I highly recommend this product and the price was amazing too. If you don't believe me try it out your self.
B001DDBCUU|2.0|I loooooove sex and the city the show; i thought it was funny and still is one of my fave shows. and of course like any other fan i was excited to know a movie was in the works. the final product however...not as great as i expected.<br /><br />First off, i don't think Carrie and big should be married. I think the show spent its entire series showing how, at the end of the day, these two people were just not the marrying kind. And after being together for 10 years all of a sudden, on a random day of the week, Big (of either one, he is the most shocking to suggest it) just throws out the idea of getting married--and then is the one that calls it off! I think a better storyline for them would have been to stay happily coupled and adopt. I also would have liked to have seen more about their relationship day to day. The whole movie for them was basically the planning of their wedding, them breaking up and then in the last 20 minutes getting back together...I don't even know if they had that great of a relationship to begin with seeing as how the series ended with them back together. I would have liked to see how their relationship improved, if at all, from the roller coaster it was on the series in more than just a few scenes of them looking at a house and reading in bed.<br /><br />Miranda and Steve's problems were predictable if you know anything about Miranda. Not saying that Steve was justified but Miranda getting consumed with work and neglecting her husband didn't feel that far from conceivable.<br /><br />Samantha didn't even seem like herself anymore! This was a woman that prided herself on her fabulosity and glamour but in the movie, she lets herself go by gaining weight? As I recall, she wanted a boob job on the show! And true Samantha would have NEVER let that hot neighbor tease her like that ESPECIALLY while her and Smith were having problems. And speaking of Smith, he seemed like such a sincere, down to earth guy on the show but I guess the fame he acquired changed him, showering Samantha with expensive gifts instead of support and acting like a complete jerk after blowing off valentines day! (and walking in with a box of chocolates? c'mon, if you're this big star with all this money and obviously can afford to buy her expensive jewelry on any other occasion, it did not seem realistic that of all days, valentines day, all he would have thought of was some candy!) And speaking of valentines day--Samantha going through those lengths for any man? Not believable. And then waiting up for him like a disgruntled housewife? The Samantha I knew would have got all dolled up and went out looking for a new guy at a hot, new club once Smith screwed up.<br /><br />And Charlotte....I don't have anything to say for her character cause the script didn't give her much. It seemed kind of forced that she would be pregnant all of a sudden after the drawn out storyline during the series of her struggles with conceiving. And am I the only one that doesn't think that the toddler lily looks like a believable older version of that picture Charlotte had from the series finale?<br /><br />And I keep reading comments about how people are confused by Anthony and Stanford becoming friends which I agree with but I was also more confused by the disappearance of Standford's boyfriend Marcus. If i'm not mistaken, didn't they end the series with them still together? But in the movie, all of a sudden he's gone and now Stanford has grown closer with someone he hated on the show. I admired the fact that SATC included a gay storyline in the series with Stanford and his relationships along with the heterosexual ones with the girls and was interested to see how they would continue that with the movie, hoping that Stanford and Marcus would still be together proving that gay relationships can be just as long-lasting and fulfilling as straight ones (especially given the continued struggle the gay community has with proving the validity of their bonds and tryingto legalize gay marriage). But they gave Stanford, or any gay character for that matter, nothing and I was disappointed in that.<br /><br />Also, yes we all know that fashion was a character on the show but it was a between the lines placement, i felt. It seemed like just a normal part of their lives, naturally occurring but in the movie it was definitely forced. The part about Carrie's involvement in that Vogue article seemed like the movie's way of giving her an excuse to dance around in labels for a photo shoot--we get it, she loves clothes--and did she really need to tell us all the designers who made them? Did they give some type of incentive for having a mention in the movie, because that's how it felt to me. And how perfect that she gets to keep one of the dresses for her own wedding--again, a moment that I felt was fake and was forced.<br /><br />Jennifer Hudson's character was fresh as everyone agrees but I don't know if I was comfortable with her acting. I mean, for the role, its not like she needed to bring an Oscar performance but there were definitely moments where her emotions seemed fake and her talking sounded like she was reading directly from the script or reading from cue cards. But it was nice to see another African American face since, lets face it, there weren't hardly any on the show which was odd to me because NY within itself is very diverse.<br /><br />All in all...I was happy with what they put out only because I think I just really miss the show and the movie was like an extra episode for fans who were tired of watching the reruns on TV. But I must say, as a fan, they could have done much, much better. Hopefully they realize this with the sequel....gave Stanford, or any gay character for that matter, nothing and I was disappointed in that.

B000002G87|5.0|It was not guitar heroics that made Layla And Other Love Songs a classic.<br /><br />The title track, Eric Clapton duling it out with Duane Allman, is a trademark for axe playing. But the rest of the tracks eccho subtle, restrained Calfornia country, concieved by the Byrds and raisded by the Flying Burrito Brothers.<br /><br />Though country ressonates through Layla, the album does not quite live in the [[ASIN:B0021SNRMM The Guilded Palace of Sin]]although it sure hangs out there a lot. This is rock,  but rock so deep in a rural impulse--etched by Clapton's singing, the bass of Carl Radle and Jim Gorden's drums--it is some of the most organic roots music available: it just happens to be electrified, as in, electric red clay on your shoes.<br /><br />By surrendering his Cream acrobatics, Clapton made some of the most genuine down home music of this era, or any era.
1932100385|5.0|I will not go into great detail about this book as there are already 600+ reviews that have been done. After having studied 30+ health and diet books over the past 5 years and read 1000's of articles on the internet, I would have to say this is really the only book you need to read. The book goes into great detail about the power structures that are in place to confuse the public and especially their children about the affects of The American Diet on your health. I am convinced and can now be put into the list of vegan people on this planet. I hope you will join us.

B000EHQTZO|5.0|The movie itself is so famous that no additional praise is needed.  I found no fault with the single-disc DVD.  The box claims Commentary is available during play, but I rarely enjoy this during a movie, and did not test it here.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|This set has it all - 2 versions of the film, documentary with archival footage and lots of other extras.    The film captures a tumultuous moment in American history and Ron Howard gives an uncompromising glimpse into the culture of the day.    Recommended for a good story and historical significance.
B00003CXD5|5.0|I don't know what more you could ask of a DVD package than what you get here.  The quality throughout was excellent.  The Movie itself is a masterpiece of cinema, with a riveting and insightful plot, entirely satisfying casting, and stellar performances by excellent actors.  Character, its development, change, and consequences gets stark examination,and the ultimate analysis of Man is humbling.  There are Lessons here.  The second disc of Special Features is chock-full of marvelous information.  The Featurette on John Ford struck me as being 'more than I really wanted to know' and ran long, but I doubt it left much out, for those who love biography.  It was instructive, but I loved the movie long before I knew a lot of the bio's info.  If you go for Special Features, you'll love these.  Maybe this is a Man Movie, since there's little in the way of romantic interest, but it's far from a mere Shoot-em-up or Chase movie; it's a Thought-provoker.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Loved the show the first time around. Bought the season to watch again.<br />Bought it for family members too. Well written, interesting subject matter. Funny even if you do not catch the science jokes. The cast creates the perfect nerd harmony!<br />They also give a clear view of the way others look at you if you happen to be well informed, highly educated, and not afraid to show it. Excellent casting, current themes make this a no brainer! Buy it for the laughs, and maybe even learn a little more about the universe!

0061968579|3.0|I bought this graphic novel because I wanted a fast read before seeing the picture.  3/4 into the book, I got totally confused.  One of the problems is the drawing of the characters.  Most of them are undistinguishable.  You can't tell one U.S. Marshall from the other (there are two) because there are no distinguishing characteristics.  They are built the same, they dress the same.  I'm not an artist, but surely the artist should have made their facial characters less similar.  It's all drawn in dark background, and I get that there's a storm, but even the hospital is dark.  As for the writing, I got lost.  I couldn't tell the dream sequences from the real-life sequences.  The real author, Dennis Lehane, should have taken better control of this publication.
B002RSDW80|4.0|My wife is a good cook and enjoyed all the aspects of cooking in the movie.  Acting was excellent.  The period Buick Roadmaster car should have been   high-lighted somewhere in the special sections.

B000031EGV|4.0|It has a good moral lesson. It is better to just be yourself. Wanting to leave your life behind, is a bad thing to wish. Follow this movie about a board game gone bad, and you would want to get rid of it too
B001QOGYFY|2.0|For many of you who don't know, the film WHITEOUT is based on an excellent graphic novel by the very talented Greg Rucka (who can do great things with strong female leads, as he also shows in his series \\"Queen and Country\\") and artist Steve Lieber. The book is more suspenseful and character-oriented than going from plot-point to plot-point. Yes, there is a view of Carrie Stetko (played by the beautiful and talented Kate Beckinsale, who unfortunately doesn't have much to do here) and her traumatic past, but there are far too many contrivances that exist in the film that were obviously added to make this a faster-paced B-movie thriller. The book actually has a sequel, called MELT, and if you've read both, you can see how they took elements of the sequel and supplanted them into this film. Firstly, the book takes place at a time (and I don't know if things have changed, treaty-wise, in Antarctica) where guns are not legal to carry, law enforcement or not. But how can you make a good American thriller without a gun? Apparently the studio and high-octane action director Dominic Sena (GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, SWORDFISH) didn't think so. They also thought that by giving this film a handsome male protagonist in Gabriel Macht's character was a good idea too, other than using the original female character from the book.<br /><br />There are some moments in this film that are so traditional Hollywood makeover moments that it just makes me angry. Big planes crashing; big gun fights onboard big crashing planes; a potential romantic-interest hunky leading man other than a smart and capable woman; and the obligiatory \\"I'm going to get naked and have a steamy shower on screen for NO APPARENT REASON, but I'm completely covered by clever camera angles and a steamy shower, so, sorry but no nudity\\" scene. Wake up, Hollywood... either have the nudity, or don't have the scene. It's just so cliched and so incredibly unnecessary in a film like this.<br /><br />Now some of the moments they did keep from the book, like the outside sequence in which Carrie is being pursued by the killer and she has no gloves... well, that scene works very well. The frostbite scene with Beckinsale and Tom Skerritt also works very well dramatically. Those few scenes save this film from being a total failure. But then there are scenes in which the three leads are trapped in a very deep ice hole... now, you'd think that would be EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING for these people, but they don't seem very scared at all. There's no drama pushing this scene forward into a tension-filled moment. Or maybe it's just part of their training as their respective professions to just accept that Antarctica will kill you. Oh, well.<br /><br />Another sad thing is that I like a lot of the people in the film. Beckinsale is fortunately/unfortunately being pigeon-holed into the strong female action lead, thanks to the success of the UNDERWORLD films, and I love her. She's sexy and strong and everything that Hollywood wants in a female lead... for action films. But she is capable of so much more and I hope she ends up taking on some more challenging projects. And the story of the book is, for the most part, up there on screen. It just lacks all of the necessary gravitas to elevate this film from a C-grade action-thriller to a A-Grade dramatic thriller.<br /><br />Perhaps if they had concentrated more on the story and less on trying to make it sellable to the action-thriller market, it would have been a more successful film, both story-wise and money-wise. Hollywood must stop underestimating viewers some day because they've proven don't have to. They can make smart action films and smart thrillers because the better something is, the more people will see it. But perhaps what makes those great films so great is because they come from genres that are unaccustomed to greatness.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|First some necessary information for prospective buyers.  The AKG 702 headphones need proper run in time before they can reach optimum performance.  And I don't mean a few hours.  More like 100 hours.  Yes I know this is asking a lot considering how much they cost and how anxious new owners must be but I speak the truth!  Out of the box the 702's sound rough around the edges.  Don't worry though, when you have properly given all the \\"parts\\" time to congeal and become one so to speak the rewards are many.  The AKG 701/702 are considered by many professionals, to be one of the best headphones in the world.  Well, I haven't heard all the cans on that list so I can only speak of my experiences with the pair of 702's that I've had for a month now. I put them in a room and played them though a Headroom Total Airhead portable headphone amplifier for around 8 to 10 hours a day for nearly four weeks, just putting them on and listening for a few minutes at the end of each day.  A spare dvd/cd player was used and it ran on \\"repeat all\\" for the break in period. This process was a total drag I must say but the experts tell me it's necessary and I believe them now because with some serious listening sessions, with music I know and love, the 702's have brought me to tears more than once.  The high frequencies now are full and powerful, with no trace of \\"sizzle\\".  Mid range and mid bass are present and all accounted for.  Bass frequencies are reproduced with substantial authority.  These cans are very balanced.  They don't sacrifice one portion of the sound field at the expense of another.  If however you are listening to a poorly recorded source, your going to hear it, poorly.  The AKG's do not lie!  One thing more, the sound stage is huge with these cans.  Very much like listening to very good audio gear with expensive speakers. Your orchestra/band are not crowded inside your head but in full view front of you. Truly remarkable. I've read that the Sennheiser HD800's do this muchbetter but they are 'considerably' more expensive. I would recommend that these headphones be driven with a good headphone amp to attain maximum performance.  Sorry but a cheapo portable or an afterthought headphone jack on your receiver just wont do. If however your gear sports dedicated headphone circuitry you might be able to forgo a headphone amp, maybe.  All in all I really love these cans and recommend them highly.

B002K0WBYG|5.0|THE PROPOSAL<br /><br />STARRING: Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds, Craig. T. Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, Betty White, Dennis O'Hare, Malin Akerman and Oscar Nunez<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Pete Chiarelli<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Anne Fletcher<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Romantic Comedy<br />Release Date: 19 June 2009<br /><br />The Proposal was easily one of the best romantic comedies of the year and only gets better with a second viewing.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock stars as an absolute tyrant of a boss, named Margaret Tate. I didn't even have to use [...] to verify this was her name, because I vividly remember her co-star Ryan Reynolds quoting it, so humorously in the film.<br /><br />Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton and there is only one thing in the world keeping him from achieving his dream of being an editor: Margaret Tate. While she will never admit it, she knows he is the best personal assistant she could ever hope to find. Thus, she neglects to ever award him with even so much as the slightest bit of praise.<br /><br />That's all about to change however, when Margaret is threatened to be deported back to Canada; disqualifying her eligibility to work for an American company.<br /><br />The screenwriter brilliantly has Andrew step into the room during this unfortunate meeting, to relay a message to Margaret with the word `proposal' attached. A light bulb goes off and Margaret drags Andrew into the meeting, informing her employers she and Andrew are to be married, that very weekend.<br /><br />Andrew's reaction to hearing this is hilarious as he realizes she will crush him if he does not go along. The scene only gets funnier from there, when they ask Andrew where the wedding will be held and Margaret is shocked to realize they are going to - Alaska, of all places.<br /><br />Finally, Andrew is in a place to negotiate for a promotion to editor. He threatens to walk from pretending to be Margaret's fianc&eacute;, unless he's promoted to editor. Margaret regrettably agrees and their employer tells her all will be forgotten once they are married.<br /><br />All they have to do is convince Andrew's family and a pesky customs and integrations official who is tracking their every move, that the wedding is legit.<br /><br />The movie is cleverly written and directed and has some great scenes that move us and make us smile. In particularly, the scenes involving Margaret interacting with Andrew's family, who consists of great performances by Craig T. Nelson, Betty White and Mary Steenburgen. Everyone has amazing chemistry together, and the characters are portrayed wonderfully.<br /><br />Even though I am a guy, I can admit this is a funny flick that any dude with substance, will enjoy watching on the couch with his lady.rees and their employer tells her all will be forgotten once they are married.<br /><br />All they have to do is convince Andrew's family and a pesky customs and integrations official who is tracking their every move, that the wedding is legit.<br /><br />The movie is cleverly written and directed and has some great scenes that move us and make us smile.

B003102JDM|5.0|This is not a comedy except in the very darkest sense of that concept.  It's much more of an existential drama. By the Coens' own admission in one of the bonus features, it does not have a plot.  Neither does it have a resolution.  But that's what life is like for Larry Gopnik and for many of the rest of us as well, right?  Spoilers ...............................                Larry is beset on all sides by a sexy neighbor, a wife who is cheating on him, a daughter who takes his money to save for a nose job, a son who is getting high on pot in Hebrew school, a tenure committee that is accepting negative letters written about him, a student who tries to blackmail him regarding a grade, a Columbia Record house salesman who wants money for records Larry never requested, etc.   Larry tries to talk to others about all this, especially rabbis, but nobody has a real answer for why he is suffering.  In this sense, he reminds me of Job in the Bible.   There is no tidy wrap-up at the end, only the promise of a tornado and very possibly some bad medical news for Larry.    This is an existentialist film for sure.  It requires concentration and thought, and it's definitely not a sitcom or some silly comedy that goes for an easy joke.  It's no wonder that few theatres carried it and few people saw it on the big screen.  But I think it plays even better on the small screen, since it is not carried out on some epic style.    Coen fans will also appreciate the brothers' attention to detail, especially the 1967 Minnesota setting.  They talk about this in the bonus features, which are helpful to watch before seeing the film.  It also helps to check out the Hebrew translation feature so you know what people are saying, since not all of it is subtitled.
B003102JDM|1.0|I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers but this is by far their worst and easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It had some interesting moments, but there was no story. I guess that's how it was designed and I'm just not deep enough to appreciate it. The characters are entirely forgettable. The performances are good, but it all amounts to a train wreck of pseudo-intellectual post modern hogwash.

B003102JDM|5.0|t's been mentioned many times that A Serious Man (2009) is a retelling of the Book of Job. It very well could be - as only Coen Brothers could adapt the Biblical story to the screen. They placed Job, the Schlimazel of the Old Testament in Minnesota suburbia of their own adolescent. They named him Larry Gopnik, made him a physics professor in a local college, a nice, loving, and pious man, and let him watch hopelessly how his life was collapsing around him while he tried to make sense of what and why was happening to him and desperately sought after a spiritual help from his religious advisers, three rabbis - in vain. A Serious Man is not an autobiographical movie but it is set in the very atmosphere and spirit where two Coen boys grew up in the year 1967, the exact year Joel Coen turned 13 and was preparing for his own bar mitzvah - just like Danny Gopnik, 13 years old pot smoking Jefferson Airplane fan Larry's son whose Bar Mitzvah in the movie is a truly unforgettable event for many reasons. Now, as the experienced celebrated filmmakers who have proved (at least for this viewer) to be among THE best modern filmmakers, Coens look back at the place and time that shaped them as individuals, men, and creative personalities, and they ask eternal and often impossible to answer questions. Does life have meaning? What is the point of it? Or is there point at all? Why do bad things happen to a decent person who &#34;did not do anything&#34;? Is there any certainty in life or all we can do just accept the fact there is no explanation, no certainty, and no fairness, and the best is - &#34;to receive with simplicity everything that happens to you.&#34;<br /><br />I can understand how this film may be puzzling and even disappointing for many viewers even among the fans. A Serious Man is different and original even for Coens, always innovative and creative artists, but it is undeniably and unmistakably, their film, with their finger prints all over. Take for example the opening scene, the black/white prologue spoken in Yiddish and set somewhere in Eastern Europe back in the 19th or 18th century, in a small Shtetl. It involves a married couple and their mysterious visitor who could be a dybbuck, an evil spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. The scene certainly would stay with a viewer and make them try to understand its meaning. As one explanation, the husband and wife could be the ancestors of Larry Gopnik before his family immigrated to the USA and ended up in Minnesota. The encounter with the dybbuk could bring the curse to the future generations, and that may explain all assortment of &#34;tsuris&#34; that poor Larry tries to deal with. Coen's explained that they wanted to include a folk tale to set the tone in the film that explores among many things Jewish traditions, religion, faith, and character. They could not find a tale they'd like, so they wrote one and made a very stylish, ominously dark yet funny and mysterious opening to their film. As a perfect balance to the fairytale/ghost story opening, the final scene comes that literally can blow you away. As it has happened before in a Coens 'movie , the open ending has as many admirers as haters but I believe it was no other way to finish the film, and I found the ending perfect in the universe that Coens create.<br /><br />The brothers' decision to cast mostly unknown stage actors in the main roles, proved to be successful one, and everyone was up to their job. Michael Stuhlbarg positively shines as Larry and he makes one of the most sympathetic characters in Coens' movie. Sari Lennick, Richard Kind, Fred Melamed as a seriously creepy man whom Larry's wife Judith wanted to leave Larry for as well as the rest of the cast are all memorable. The camera work by Roger Deakins', the longtime collaborator of Coens in recreating the long gone era of the late 60s in the Middle of America is above any praise. A Serious Man is beautiful, profound, and perfectly well made. It is funny, too. Seriously.Seriously.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video works great. I have felt my body changing and it doesn't require a lot of time, just a little over 20 minutes. The way this video is set up is great. There are three levels and each level is set up in 3 segments: 3 minutes of toning, 2 minutes of cardio, and one minute of abs. It works everything in a way that you don't need to spend forever at the gym. My body starting feel toned and more fit not long after doing this video.

Her words create a very visual banquet of emotion. This was a beautiful insight to a life of two people who shared and cared for each other,especially in their innocence of youth. A humorous,touching and very fast read. That like all good books,leaves you wanting more!
B000RZGFYS|5.0|This CD has a beauty like nothing else.  I love the riffs and drums especially on RiB (I don't pay much attention to the lyrics, but the vocals are very powerful).  I enjoy Seasons and South also, but I listen to this almost daily.  There is no real blasphemy here, just fast metal.  This christian sees no problem with the album!  I don't know how long I'll be on a Slayer kick, but this sure hits the spot for me.  The remastered sound is awesome.  If you want a wall of sound to blast you in the face, this is the cure.  Love it!!!
B001J8I2DE|1.0|Poorly thought out movie with even worse execution. By lazily putting Indy in his old get-up the filmmakers heighten Harrison Fords aged look. He reminded me of the old guys who wear pants too big and have to hike them up to their armpits. Storywise..if we skim past the fact that they are searching for aliens....which they find, and that there is a psychic character which is never explained...the plot lollops along from one rediculous set up to another. Want examples? name your poison!...surviving a nuclear bomb by hiding in a fridge?.. er swinging through the trees with a mass of cgi comedy monkeys, eaten by ants or whatever....just utter nonsense.   In no way encourage such fecal matter by buying this dross. Go buy Raiders of the lost Ark and try and remember a happier time when Indiana Jones was cool.
B00003XACV|4.0|As with more than a few of Thomas Newman's soundtrack compositions , this one maintians a never-ending theme of quirky uneasiness as if something is never quite right. Think of his wonderful theme music to the HBO series \\" Six Feet Under\\" or the wonderful Robert Altman dark comedy on Hollywood agents , \\"The Player\\".<br />  The individual pieces are relatively short , as is with most film soundtrack collections , but that theme is so potent that I often just let it play through in its entirety as if it were an \\"American Beauty Suite\\". Eventually I will take the time and cherry-pick the parts I love best and craft a mix of my own with his other works such as a a mix including his \\"Six Feet Under\\" theme. I even have this fantasy of how an actual suite of Thomas Newman's work would sound in the way Lenny Bernstein  recomposed his entire soundtrack to \\"West Side Story\\" into a single piece for ballet which i always refer to as the \\"New York Suite\\". If you are at all familiar with that soundtrack then you understand why I fantacise about what that kind of recomposition would sound like with  2 favorites of his ,\\"Shawshank Redemption \\" & \\" Road to Perdition\\".<br />  I find the mood set by this soundtrack is as mischievous as it is infectious and influences me when I'm writing satirical pieces and find that my rough drafts wax evermore sarcastic & cynical as this soundtrack works it's quirky little sorcery. Not heavy mind you , but definitely<br />ever-conscious of a \\" fly in the soup\\"  or a \\"there be gremlins afoot\\" mood that never quite goes away. Sort of like the hovering influence of the devilish character Jack Nicholson played in the \\"Witches of Eastwich ( another masterful soundtrack work in the same vein by John Williams ) As a matter of fact I put on pieces such as this when i actually *want* this mood to influence me. I'll probably mix it with themes form \\" the Player\\" if I really want that mood to saturate me while I saute in its charms.<br />  Bottomline: Definitely one of Newman's best works without a full orchestra.man's best works without a full orchestra.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I originally bought this CD for my Dad, because I thought he would appreciate her beautiful voice and find the music relaxing on a long drive.  That he did, but he did comment on the fact that the songs were chosen to showcase her voice vs. being entertaining.  It's almost too relaxing. However, there is no doubt that Susan Boyle has an amazing voice!
0765350386|4.0|\\"Mistborn\\" by Brandon Sanderson<br /><br />The Lord Ruler has imposed his will with an iron grip for one thousand years keeping the Skaa under his foot. He has displayed infinite power which only serves to fuel his legend and draconian rule. Some of the Skaa have grown weary of his rule and intend to do something about it. An impossible plan is launched by Kelsier the Mistborn and his usual crew of alomancers and a new recruit named Vin...<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson has succeeded in crafting a unique magic system and he blends it nicely into action sequences. I wasn't so sure about Mistborn out of the gate but I was eventually sucked in.<br /><br />The Good: Partially through good dialogue you get the since that the characters are well drawn and that they truly know one another. The way in which the magic system is gradually unfolded was well thought out and its use makes for solid action sequences as it isn't as simple as throwing of lightning and the like. Sanderson has provided a solid blend of creating interesting characters and character evolution, building a unique system of magic, world building and plot. Where many writers are good at one or the other Sanderson have found some collective success at all.<br /><br />The Bad: The only negative I noticed was there were some gaps left in the telling of the Skaa people. The people appear to be more or less owned by the lord ruler however while some appear to freely move about the cities others are help on plantations like slaves with no freedom. I never had a solid since about how that worked or why.<br /><br />Overall: \\"Mistborn\\" is a solid read and I highly recommend you pick it up.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This brilliant but short-lived series is a must-have!  Delightfully odd, it's built around the classic \\"lifeboat\\" scenario (take several people from diverse backgrounds, force them to live close together, and take the dramatic and humorous potentials to the max).  Jayne, Kaylee, Mal Reynolds, the preacher, the prostitute, et.al.,  scrape against each other, form bonds, fight, cope, and deliver some of the finest one-liners I've ever heard in filmed entertainment.  Seriously, this is Joss Whedon at his most inspired, and there isn't a disappointing or a slow episode in the batch.
1572816112|4.0|I got out my ruler and measured the length of these cards.  They are a full half inch longer than the Rider-Waite cards, making them impossible to shuffle for many people.  I am 5' 10\\" which is exactly the average height for a male in the US, and so my hands are probably of average size too.  The cards are so large that I can just barely shuffle them.  Since my hands are probably of average size, about half the men who purchase this deck are not going to be able to shuffle it.  And since women's hands are, on the average, smaller than men's hands, I would guess that about eighty percent of the women who purchase this deck are going to be unable to shuffle it.  That is a crying shame.<br /><br />Other than the fact that about two thirds of all the people who purchase this deck are not going to be able to shuffle it, it is the most fantastic deck of Tarot cards I have ever seen.  This deck has two things going for it, (1) the fantastic art work and (2) the set of card meanings that come with it.<br /><br />The art is stunning.  The deck consists of seventy-eight pictures you actually enjoy looking at.  And all the card pictures are a bit mysterious, which makes them even more captivating.  The card pictures are not only creative, but actually qualify as art.<br /><br />I would say that about ninety-nine percent of the white booklets of instructions that come with Tarot card decks are totally useless.  But, these Deviant Moon card definitions are an exception to that.  The creators of this deck actually seem to know something about what constitutes a good set of Tarot card definitions, and when you use this deck to do divinations, the cards that come up actually make a lot of sense.  With almost all other decks, the booklet of card meanings is so useless that you have to sit down and create your own card meanings if you want to use the deck as an oracle.  But with this deck, if your hands are large enough to be able to shuffle the cards, you can use this deck as an oracle from the git-go.<br /><br />The only criticism I would have of the booklet of card definitions is the inclusion of a version of the Celtic Cross layout.  I participate as a reader in many psychic fairs and psychic expos throughout the South and the Midwest, and I have never seen a professional card reader use the Celtic Cross spread.  The only card in the layout that people want to know about is the Final Outcome card, and real life is much too multidimensional and multifaceted to be adequately explained by only one card.  Professionals use card layouts in which all the cards represent the final outcome.<br /><br />Tarot decks come and go, with the exception of the Rider-Waite deck.  I think the Deviant Moon Tarot is probably one of the very few that is going to be around for a long time.  It is unfortunate that only about a third of the people who purchase this deck are going to be able to shuffle it.  For that reason, I will have to rate this deck with four stars, not five.The only criticism I would have of the booklet of card definitions is the inclusion of a version of the Celtic Cross layout.

0307454541|4.0|I just finished reading this book last night and it's hard to imagine it being the same book that I began a month or so ago.  In fact, reading the last third of the book was like reading a completely different book from the first third.<br /><br />The first third of this book made me want to gouge out my eyes--it was so slow and boring that I had significant problems even wanting to pick it up off my nightstand to read it.  It was great for sleeping but not so good for reading!<br /><br />Everywhere I went, people were raving about how fantastic this book was, and I was astonished, since I thought it was a complete bore!  The sheer number of glowing reviews pushed me to continue reading when I was way past wanting to give up on it.<br /><br />Having now finished the book, I can safely say I am so happy that I kept reading.  The story just gets better and better the further you go along.  By the half-way point, I was finally starting to get interested and wanting to keep reading.  By the final third, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo ends up being a great murder mystery that delves into the closets of rich and powerful characters, tossing skeletons left and right.  I have read a lot of novels about devious, sadistic killers, but I have never read anything quite like this.<br /><br />The thing that made it different from a novel by Jeffery Deaver or Patricia Cornwell is that it wasn't JUST a murder mystery--it was a sweeping family saga, a portrait of two troubled young girls, a story of financial intrigue AND a murder mystery all rolled into one book.  And Lizbeth Salander (one of the aforementioned troubled young girls) is a character you are not likely to forget.<br /><br />If I could grade the parts of this book separately, I'd give the last third 5 stars, the first third 2 stars and the middle third 3 1/2 stars.  While that doesn't exactly come out to the 4 stars I gave it, I felt that the originality of this story and its indelible characters warranted a little boost in the rating.ting.
B00319ECHE|4.0|I've been a big Fear Factory fan for a long time, and I was so pleased when I heard this album.  It's the hardest and heaviest Fear Factory album since \\"Obsolete\\".  This album marks the return of original guitar player Dino, along with a new drummer who completely kicks ass! The band seems tighter than ever before with the current line-up.  Despite it's heaviness, Burton C. Bell's vocals are still both brutal and majestic at the same time.  I highly recommend this album to fans of \\"Obsolete\\" and \\"Demanufacture\\".  Fear Factory is back with a vengence with \\"Mechanize\\".  A must have for Fear Factory fans! 4.5 out of 5 stars.

0765342294|4.0|The annals of popular science fiction are decorated with archetypes of human heroes and heroines triumphing over technologically-advanced alien races. But what if these protagonists were children? Enter the premise of Orson Scott Card's first novel, Ender's Game, a fun, fast-paced, and imaginative read (notwithstanding its moderately far-fetched environment). Its heroes are children, born and bred for a singular, special purpose that holds the key to human survival.    These children, most notably Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, are separated from their Earth-bound families and moved to a covert military training facility. The reason? Well, many decades previous, planet Earth was attacked by a an advanced alien race--termed \\"buggers\\"--in what history remembers as \\"The First Invasion\\". These \\"buggers\\" attacked a second time and were repelled, with the remaining survivors retreating in the reaches of space. Under fear of a third attack, the government has commissioned a secret military project, in which children are \\"engineered\\" and trained to be intelligent and ruthless military commanders, all by playing an elaborately-designed, zero-gravity \\"game\\". The story follows the most promising candidate, Ender, as he realizes the intent of the game and questions his ability to assume the role for which he is being groomed.    If that seems preposterous, it's certainly fair to say that it is. But Ender's Game is aided by sharp (if not spectacular) writing and vocabulary on the part of its author. This gives the book an authenticity that intensifies the creative premise and moves the book at a quick pace. The book is just plain enjoyable, and doesn't pretend to aspire to any sort of high philosophical statement or ideology. Not to devalue the book's depth; in truth, it certainly paints an intriguing and compelling picture of the lengths to which a desperate humanity will resort in order to protect their continued existence. At its heart, though, it is simply a great story of adventureand strategy, the perfect page-turner for a week away on vacation or a long weekend at home.    Read this and more reviews at my blog: [...].

0811870987|5.0|Zuckerman is a magnificent photographer and conceptualist , with a fine team of handlers and keepers that enable him to create portraits of birds that are beyond compare.  This book is to the modern, and photographic, world what the intricate drawings of creatures were to The Enlightenment.      The book is a joy to experience.  Small wonder that it only has a single-word title, for it defines the concept of \\"Bird\\" completely.  Zuckerman captures the complete range of the species, from regal presence to menace to thrill.    I was so taken by this book that I ordered \\"Creature\\" immediately.  They are both treasures.

B0026P3G12|5.0|The CD contains her most well known songs and some others I didn't expect her to try but she succeeds wonderfully - all simply show off her really pure and clean beautiful voice. Hate to buy anyone's CD these days because there usually are a few tracks you'd like to skip while it's playing - not so for Susan Boyle's CD. Just let it play and enjoy the music - you can even understand the words! Susan Boyle, Celine Dion, Julie Andrews - all pure beautiful female voices for the sake of singing - no stage bells and whistles, no Grammy's, no sexy pop tart image needed.
B000FIMG68|5.0|In its second season Lost brought in a plethora of new characters, phenomena, plot developments, and plot theories.  It all worked becuase the series let itself bring things in at their proper pace, rather than rushing all elements and major characters into the first few episodes of Season 1.  The bonds and relationships that got started in the first season grow, as do the inter-group rivalries - surprisingly, the most profound rivalry affecting the series isn't between Jack and Sawyer, but between Jack and Locke, who end up on opposite poles of the leadership spectrum.  Jack's approach is practical, oriented towards finding a way to get the group off the island they're stranded on, and completely skeptical of any of the increasing hints as to a possible supernatural aspect to the island.  Locke's stance is grounded in the belief that there's something far bigger at a work than a plane crashing on an uncharted island, on the idea of fate, and his quest to explore and understand and participate in the 'big picture'.  In one regard, though, Locke's approach is more 'practical' (in the conventional sense of the word) than Jack's: Locke is the first in the group to become convinced that there are other people on the island, that they're hostile, and that there's something abnormal about this other group and its purpose (in other words, it's not a question of 'there might be a couple of cottages over on the other side of the island where people have their summer homes', it's something more unorthodox).  Most of the rest of the group seems determined not to accept this because of it's implications; Jack seems determined at this stage not to accept any suggestion that would require him to look at the island and its particular circumstances in a highly unorthodox manner, or even a fantasical one.       The flashbacks in Season 2 are among the best of the whole series, with flashbacks delving into the back stories of Mr. Eko, Sawyer, and Sayid all being particularly powerful.  Of all the seasons, Season 2 is the one that may gain the most from a second viewing.  Part of the reason for this is that in the second half of the season, developments occur that initially have one wondering if all the revelations are going to end up being a letdown.  Without being too specific, there was an uncomfortable sense that the series was going to move in a direction that revealed all the great mysteries as more or less red herrings, that we'd get an explained situation that was too bland and stripped away the 'awe factor'.  Without going into what develops later, I think it's safe to say that the series doesn't do that.  Not at all.  At the same time, these possibilities arising Was a vital part of the show, and the affect it had on certain characters (Locke in particular) was an important part of their overall development.  Another reason it gains so much on the rewatch is that you can appreciate certain happenings that, on the first time around, no one had any idea how pivotal they were going to be.  I'm referring in part to the first appearance of a certain character who goes on to have a much larger role in the overall story than it would first appear when he's discovered.  Actually, come to think of it, there are two characters who could easily fit that bill...  And even the characters introduced here who turn out to be more or less 'supporting players' in the overall story have important impacts.       Topped off with a tremendous double-cliffhanger ending that couples with a truly shocking revelation, the conclusion of this set'll have you rushing to buy Season 3, and with good reason.  Everything from the acting to the special effects to the cinematography capturing the island (at times gorgeous, at other times menacing) right through to the care in the packaging of the boxed set itself is first rate.  Highest reccommendation, although obviously newcomers to the series (or those just starting to rewatch the series afte seeing its first runon television) will want to start with Season 1.

0393327655|4.0|The End of Faith, a bestseller which propelled its author, Sam Harris, to international fame, is a curious little book. It was published a couple of years before the almost orgasmic spurt of \\"new atheist\\" writings seen in 2006-2007 by such big names as Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens, and Richard Dawkins, and, sharing the same insolent and revolutionary spirit of those works, laid the foundations for them. Religion usually enjoys something of a free pass in our society. This is taken for granted, even by the majority of atheists. Even in the early years of post-911 America, people were generally reluctant to point out the elephant in the room.    Then along came Sam Harris and his book, which did a little more than point it out. It started actively shooting at the elephant.    The elephant, forced to contemplate a threat to its existence, started to fight back.    I don't mean to push my poor metaphors to the edge of their credibility. What I do mean, however, is to convey the sense in which I think the book matters most: as a match-lighter.    Atheism has seen better defenses elsewhere (although, to be fair, despite its reputation, this book is not primarily a defense of atheism), and religion has been attacked much more efficiently before and since. It is not a great book. Despite being well-researched in some areas, it lacks in others. But it got people talking. It represented (what is in America, at least) a widely despised minority viewpoint which has been historically underrepresented, giving a voice to unbelievers worldwide. But more than anything, it had the sheer nerve to bluntly inform the majority of people in the world that their beliefs were insane, incoherent, and were going to eventually lead to a potential global cataclysm, and this changed the tone of the debate. Atheists were no longer going to keep their mouths shut while the religious majority stupidly heaved the world headfirst into nuclear and environmental catastrophe.     In short, it is, if nothing else, an important book.    I do have my issues with it. It is, for one thing, excessively alarmist in tone. While Harris is fully justified in finding current (if 2004 can still be thought of as \\"current\\") international affairs alarming, I feel he allows it to affect his judgment negatively. Moreover, Harris evinces a poor understanding of Islam and Islamic history. Some of his arguments are incredibly disturbing (no, I do not believe someone deserves to be killed for having a certain belief, no matter how stupid and insane it is, although I would indeed advise protecting oneself against such people). I'm not really impressed with his defense of Eastern mysticism near the end of the book. And his attempted explanation of the American War on Drugs racket strikes me as borderline paranoid.    The book puts forward several excellent arguments. It is unique, however, in offering an eminently reasonable defense of the use of torture in the War on Terror (which, as Harris points out, is actually a War on Islam). I'm not fully convinced by it, and even considering it gives me chills, but it has defended adequately what most non-wingnuts consider indefensible, and for that I respect it.    The End of Faith is not a perfect work, but it is an important and fascinating one. It should be read by anyone who wants to keep up with the current debate. Heck, it should be read by all thinking people, period.
B002WTOXUK|1.0|I love sci-fi, I love bad sci-fi...D9 isn't good enough to be bad sci-fi.  My 7 yr old could have made this movie.  The documentary style was interesting at first but soon became annoying.  The acting was horrible.  The characters had no depth, they were sterile and fake.  The Wikus character's \\"happy\\" disposition didn't fit in with the story line.  D9 is like taking a bad idea for a movie, and using it to make a bad movie.  If you think smashing your hand with a hammer would be fun then you are going to love this movie.

B0031OCY2E|4.0|From the trailers I saw I thought this was a quasi comedy. It really isn't and if you're looking for belly laughs, this won't fill the bill. But what it is, is very good. The film tells the story of an insider working for a very large corporation who finds himself involved in illegal activities and is faced with a moral dilema - go along with it and make a lot of money, or blow the whistle and take the moral high ground. There is also a question of his personal motivation to blow the whistle - is it completely moralistic or is it coupled with personal ambition and the desire to be a hero? Here's a man in over his head and not sure what to do and so he simply does, day to day, week after week without thinking through where each step is leading him. Damon is excellent in the role. The rest of the cast, also fine. Good story telling and quite enjoyable, particualarly for anyone with a background working inside a big company where you see things others don't. Get the popcorn ready.
1932100660|4.0|This was an extremely interesting book.  I actually sat down and read it over several days.  I have become a vegatarian and after reading this book I am sure I made the right choice in doing so.

I sent an e-mail to the Oprah show telling them they need to do a show on this subject.
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|This film puts a new twist on the standard robot movies. Somewhere between I Robot and the Stepford Wives. I found it very interesting in premise and filled with good performances through out. It's not one of the dazzling special effects laden thrill ride so many movies are today, it doesn't try to be or need to be. Perhaps because it tells a story and has a plot, it doesn't need to rely on an overload of special effects to hold the audiance. While I have some minor criticisms of the storyline, overall it was well written and Willis gives a strong performance as an \\"everyman\\" trapped in a world where he doesn't necessarily fit in. So if you're looking for a good thought provoking movie, I think you'll enjoy this. If you're looking for flashy non stop special effects, you might want to look elsewhere. Four stars. Good job.
B002T9H2ME|4.0|At last, a return to that 70's vibe when sci-fi meant thought provoking, and not whizz bang gee whizz displays of special effects.  Here, the illusion of a future world is perfectly maintained, but effects are very low key, and the emphasis is in drawing you into the tale, and even more into the character's head.  Sam Rockwell gives an amazing (set of) performances here, as the man on the last few weeks of his 3 week stint alone on the moon with only Gerty the robot (voiced by Kevin Spacey) for comfort.  When he has an accident, his reality starts to get challenged and he questions who he is and how much of what he knows is truth.  To say more would give too much away, but suffice to say the film's success is partly due to the slow burn but absorbing script, but at least as much again to Rockwell's performance, never less than convincing, and by the end, you may well want to go back and watch it again to grasp the nuances of what is going on.  The set itself is low key, and even one might say familiar, with elements of the sparse whiteness of 2001, and also the lived in but blocky 70's style of Space 1999 or even Silent Runnings, for those that remember that far back.  It's interesting to remember that the director's father is David Bowie, and wonder how this might have influenced his visual choices, remembering Bowie's sci-fi outing in The Man Who Fell To Earth.  Clearly the visual style owes a lot to past visual styles, but that does not mean it does not have it's own originality.  Gerty is no HAL clone for all his similarities, but an intriguing pseudo-anthropomorphised functional robot who is Sam's only companion as the movie begins.  The music is similarly sparse and atonal, but it's simplicity suits the frame of mind being conveyed and the bleakness of the setting.  All told, this is no crash bang wallop special effects display - far from it, but it is nonetheless one of the best sci-fi stories around in years, because it actually IS a story and not just linksof set-pieces.  The resolution may irk you, or it may satisfy you, and certainly given how languidly the plot moves throughout the movie, it's a shame the ending is so quickly wound up with a few too many questions lingering.. but whatever your impression on viewing, you'll undoubtedly be thinking about it some days later.  Recommended thinking man's low budget sci-fi.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to see this movie!  I'm 40 years old but I'm young at heart and I rented this movie on Netflix, saw it for the first time and fell in love with it!  In fact, I loved it so much that, after watching it, I immediately went online at Amazon.com and ordered a 2-disc, Platinum Edition copy of it.  I love every single thing about this movie, from the characters(Ariel, especially, 'cause she looks so beautiful & has a wonderful voice, to match), the scenery above and below the sea, the songs, especially \\"Part Of Your World\\", \\"Under The Sea\\" and, yes, even \\"Poor, Unfortunate Souls\\" as well as the making of the film plus the \\"Disneypedia: Life Under The Sea\\" which talks about the real-life animals that inspired the movie characters.  In fact, of the 3 2-disc, Platinum Edition copies of Disney animated movies that I own(The Little Mermaid, Aladdin & 101 Dalmatians), The Little Mermaid is my most favorite of all 3 of 'em!  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Disney movies, animated movies or a combination of both 'cause it's a treat for the eyes and the ears and will definitely take your breath away 'cause it is WONDERFUL!
B0012GN0FI|5.0|I got hold of this years ago...too many years ago to mention comfortably...as an import vinyl, and I was staggered. Most people who hear it now or heard it then remark on the \\"in-your-face\\" sound of the snare and toms in the mix, and hearing this album once more, particularly the masterful ride cymbal on the \\"Love Child\\" track, reminded me of a rumor that was circulating at the time of release concerning the drum tracks: that they had been doctored with \\"extra care\\" by the drummer himself, who had (allegedly) been the only member of the band in the studio while the masters were being mixed. Who knows? Who cares? I love this band...I grew up on this stuff, and I still can't get enough!

031606792X|2.0|I heard some of the things people said about this book before I read it. After Eclipse, which was my favorite in the series, I was prepared to be let down. I was not prepared for craziness however, and that is exactly what I feel this book is. The plot itself is ludicrous and laughable, but I won't harp on that, for the few people out there that haven't read any spoilers yet. What I can say is that I felt this book had a lot of filler. The other books have had plenty of detail, but I enjoyed reading it. I could read about Bella cooking dinner and studying any time, but I have a harder time reading about the inaction in this book. In addition, we have Jacob's point of view. The majority of events in his section were not important, and I didn't feel the joy reading about his story as I felt when reading Bella's. It seemed totally different. Bella's sections were always eloquent and intelligent, whereas Jacob's parts are harsh, choppy, and repetitive. I found myself skipping sections waiting for the punchline. The book is entirely too long to me, but that may be because I wasn't enjoying the subject matter. This has to be the first series where I've disliked the first and last books, but enjoyed everything in between. I would have been happier stopping at Eclipse, if you aren't into the wacky and strange, you may want to skip Breaking Dawn and just imagine your own ending to the series.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|With the enduring interest in the novels of Jane Austen, an author eons ahead of her time as far as writing stories that dealt with women's view of the world, it is not unexpected that the film makers repeat versions of these rollicking tales.  This may be the fourth or so version of EMMA and for this viewer it is the most successful.  A large part of the success of this version of the novel is both the screenplay by Sandy Welch and the direction by Jim O'Hanlon who elect to open the graphic gates of Highbury with a sequence that shares with the audience the background of the diaspora of the children whose parents have died and whose lives will eventually come together as adults.  It works very well in setting the scene and the mood of class distinction so prevalent in England of the period.<br /><br />Emma is brought fully to life by Romola Garai and this role further establishes her as one of the more important character actresses on film.  The remainder of the cast is perfectly balanced, with Michael Gambon as Emma's ever needy father, Jonny Lee Miller as the perfect Mr. Knightley, Lousie Dylan as the ditsy Harriet Smith, Tamsin Grieg as the hilariously boring and mouthy Miss Bates, the striking Blake Ritson as the vicar Mr. Elton, talented Laura Pyper as Jane Fairfax, and Jodhi May as the governess turned neighbor Anne Taylor.  The ensemble casting is as fine as any of the Austen transitions to the visual and the cinematography and costumes are first class.<br /><br />The words may not all belong to Jane Austen (Sandy Welch has introduced some very apropos new lines), but the feel of the novel would likely please the author as much as it pleases the audience.  The 4 episode BBC production comes in two CDs and the quality of production is superb.  In every way, this EMMA is a joy.  Grady Harp, February 10
B002R2L008|5.0|I listen to the CD daily, and my favorite track is\\"Tell Yer Mama\\"  However, that song is not in the list of the contents of the two CDs.  If this is a mistake it should be corrected.  If the list is correct, then do not buy this version - Tell Yer Mama is the great song of The Fall.   Let's assume the list is a mistake.  What I have been hearing in the music of Norah Jones became explicit in my thinking when I saw Blueberry Nights.  At the end, I said to my date, \\"That end credit music sounds like Ry Cooder,\\" and it was.  I am hearing a lot of Cooder's style in The Fall, and that brings two of my favorite artists together.
B001ECE6C6|3.0|The inspiration is really high in this work. The great talent of Anna Maria match perfectly the music of Pat, supported by a pool of really amazing musicians. The really great regret about of this CD is the poor quality of the mixing/mastering: probably because of the excess in \\"pumping\\" levels you will perceive an amount of distortion that will vary from light to unbearable, depending of the reader...  Unacceptable in a product coming from a usually professional label.  The three stars are only because of the high level of the music that , in itself, deserves a five stars; the CD deserve a zero star.
B00000G3PL|5.0|No matter how many times I watch these films, they never get old, most buddy cop films & shows rely on the chemistry between the two pals ( shows \\"Miami Vice\\", \\"Starsky & Hutch\\", & \\"NYPD Blue\\" did this quite well) & of course this film series where two cops who have nothing in common are partnered up ....    \\"Lethal Waepon\\"(1987)  This is the best one, it definately takes you back to 80's L.A., In this one we get to know the characters & who they are, Mel Gibson who had been known for the \\"Mad Max\\" films is Martin Riggs, a disgruntled cop who is still grieving over the loss of his wife & is a bit suisidal which makes him a bit more dangerous than the bad guys, Danny Glover who had yet to be recognized as a bankable actor, & got his big break here is Roger Murtaugh, a family man who in some ways is just waiting on his retirement, when Murtaugh's vietnam pal's daughter plunges from a highrise, Murtaugh who is partnered with Riggs sets out to find out why & discover that his friend was involved with drug lords from their vietnam days, Gary Busey is on hand as a enforcer for this drug ring & is intimidating, his & Riggs face off in the end is somthing you knew was inevitable, the action set-pieces toward the end are well done, especially the Hollywood Blvd scenes, as well as the foot chase, all in all, the best of the 4 films    \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\"(1989)  With the success of the first film, this one is my least favorite of the 4 films, not that it is bad, it is on par with the first film in terms of action, but these bad guys(South African Diplomats) are just not as scary as the drug ring in the first film, the bomb on the toliet scene while original seemed far-fetched at best, plus Riggs takes an interest in a secretary working for the guys, which seemed a bit out of character for him, however despite these faults this one works as a solid action film, the opening moments are the best with an all out chase in downtown Los Angeles & Joe Pesci is quite fun as Leo, an accountant who enbezzeled money from these bad guys & Riggs & Murtaugh are assigned to protect him, & there are many laughs when these 3 interact, but the accountant angle reeks of \\"Midnight Run\\" out the year before with Robert DeNiro & Charles Grodin, it is almost as if they wanted to take that idea & do it over again, however this one has its many  moments but a bit overated I think     \\"Lethal Weapon 3\\"(1992)  Many felt this one was a step back from the first two films, however I disagree, this one had a interesting story angle to it, I can see why Gibson really jumped on this script, this one deals with a cop gone bad who with his police connections is stealing automatic guns seized from street gangs & recirculating back out for a profit, Stuart Wilson(Mask of Zorro) is this bad/former cop Jack Travis who is also using armor-piercing bullets that can penetrate bullet-proof vest, Murtaugh is close to retirement & is a bit too careful here, Renee Russo is introduced as a Internal Affairs cop pursuing Jack & his misdeeds & doesn't quite see eye to eye with Riggs & Murtaugh in their investigation but eventually allows Riggs to know what she knows when Murtaugh ends up killing a street gang member who was a friend of his son, who was supplied his gun by Travis, they then set out to stop Travis altogether, & what results is another cool standoff followed by another cool chase scene, Joe Pesci once again returns as Leo that is more or less comic relief, but still fun, the opening moments are fun as Riggs & Murtaugh try to disarm a bomb in a building parking structure & accidently trigger it, this scene is a classic, always wait for the bomb squad, this one to me was a bit better that  \\"2\\"     \\"Lethal Weapon 4\\"(1998)  Yes, this one is a bit more comical in its approach, but this one is my 2nd favorite next to the original, the opening moments with a flamethrowing trigger-happy individual is a quite fun, especially the way Riggs disarms him, this one is sort of a throwback tothe first film that has Jet Li as a former Chinese Triad who is counterfitting foriegn money to get his men out of China, & is using chinese slave labor to make the fake money, Jet Li sort of puts Gary Busey's scary villian from the first film to shame, & when Riggs & Murtaugh face off with him, you know there is going to be hell to pay, this one brings back Renee Russo & Joe Pesci(again) back & introduces us to Chris Rock as a up & coming detective, when you watch this one, you feel the sense of loss of the first film's 80's feel, but this one is without a doubt probably the most action packed, aside from the opening, you have another foot chase,a face off with Jet Li, another freeway chase(best action scene in my opinion), a Pontiac Grand Am crashing through a building, a shoot'em up fiesta at the end & another Jet Li face off, the action scenes do seem a bit redundant, but hey, that is why we watch these films right, & this one must have been sharing  space with \\"Rush Hour\\"(out a few months later), because places in both films look the same, these two were made at the same time, all in all a great action film & this one has the deleted scenes from the other three films in its special features section if you don't want the Special Edition versions
B002T9H2L0|1.0|If QT set out to make a movie where the Americans were just as disgusting and terrible as the Nazi's then he succeeded. I hated everything about it. I would rather spend 10 straight hours watching Band of Brothers than to watch one second of this movie again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|With over 3000 reviews, it's all been said.  I had never heard of Firefly.  Nothing.  Nada.<br /><br />Then I watched [[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity]].  Yes, I am a serious science fiction aficionado (mostly books), but I don't watch broadcast television.  So Serenity was a new story to me.  Great movie!  But then I learned that it was based on... Firefly?<br /><br />\\"What's that?\\" I asked.<br /><br />\\"Serenity,\\" was the reply.<br /><br />So I finally got around to experiencing Firefly, the complete \\"incomplete\\" collection.  The show was canceled during its first season, so this collection even has three episodes that weren't broadcast.  Now I know what \\"Serenity\\" means.  As far as the \\"American space western television series,\\" you don't get this flavor in Serenity, but it is there in Firefly.<br /><br />So I've watched Serenity, the movie.  Now I've finished Firefly, the series.  And next?  What else?  Serenity, the movie, again!<br /><br />Ah, anticipation...<br /><br />Firefly is not an \\"in your face\\" series that makes everything clear in the first episode.  What WAS Shepherd's story?  How was River going to be \\"outed\\" in the series?  Does Jayne ever think of a person other than himself?  Does Kaylee ever find true love?<br /><br />Does Firefly ever stick it to the Alliance?<br /><br />I can just envision the pent-up demand for Firefly's fans to get their questions answered!

Cassandra Clare has done the impossible:  knocked Edward off his pedestal.  A side benefit is the funny repartee among the characters.  I'm almost done with City of Glass and don't want the series to end. I'll be dreaming about Jace...
B0012GMU8Q|5.0|Could you imagine juno without this soundtrack? It stands up just as well, if not better, without the movie. Plus the orange vinyl makes it near impossible to resist showing it off. We all know thats half the reason we love vinyl... along with an excuse to buy those nicer speakers so you can hear Kimya Dawson singing in your living room.
B002SJIO4A|3.0|This flick is extremely imaginative, although I feel obligated to note that its basic theme has a fair amount in common with \\"Alien Nation.\\" The film is done mostly in documentary form. A huge alien spacecraft comes to rest over Johannesburg, South Africa. Eventually humans board the ship and find about 1 million destitute and starving aliens. Due to their crustacean-looking appearance, they are derogatorily nicknamed \\"prawns.\\" The film revolves around a scenario in which the South African government seeks to relocate the \\"prawns\\" to a reservation in the South African hinterlands, away from the big city.<br /><br />There is not much in the way of characterization in this film.  Part of this is because the aliens themselves are essentially portrayed mostly as ignorant slum-dwellers who mainly only speak their own language. The poor treatment meted out to the aliens is, unfortunately, all too plausible and this is the real point of this film.<br /><br />This one is worth a try for science fiction aficionados and given its limited budget and lack of big-star cast, it is impressive in its own way. RJB.
B000093BDX|5.0|I grew up on the Beach Boy's music, and in my opinion there has been nothing better to come out of California since them.  For kids these days who insist on avoiding classical, I don't know if there could possibly be a better option for them.  It expresses a good spirit and sentiment, friends living by the ocean, nice cars, fun, love, surfing, relaxation.  But long gone are the days of the Beach Boys:  R.I.P. California - You were once the best, and now you have sunk to the bottom.  As much fun as you and I have had in the past, I would rather be in a desert than this.  Though I must leave you now, you'll always have a place in my heart, a memory of the golden days when life was untainted and all about innocent fun.

B000001EUP|4.0|Phew what an album. From all out rockers 'Blackout and 'Now' to rock ballads 'You Give Me All I Need' & 'When the Smoke is Going Down' this album has aged well. Memorable tracks abound with 6 of the 9 on heavy rotation on my ipod though to be fair there isnt a weak track to be found. The songs are varied in pace and approach. If I had to choose then favourites tracks for me are 'No One Like You' and 'Blackout'.

0316044938|5.0|As a rule I try to stay away from sad novels but I was assured that I should make an exception when it came to this book and I am glad that I did. While this may be a sad premise the author manages to make it beautiful and heartwarming at the same time. By juxtaposing the best and worst of human nature she softens the blow of what could have been an unbearably depressing subject matter in a lesser writers hands.

B000ZELISO|5.0|I constantly and consistently hear complaints from Harry Potter book fanatics about the film adaptions. Oh they left this out! Oh they left that out! It's the same sorry grumbling time after time. And I wish it would stop. The mediums (literary and theatrical) are not 100% compatible. Period. It will NEVER, EVER happen. This movie alone was 153 minutes long, right in line with the rest of the series in terms of length. But this one stands out quite a bit compared to the others for a couple of reasons...<br /><br />The first is that this is a mature story. As Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, [[ASIN:B000Q6ZG52 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]), Hermoine (Emma Watson, [[ASIN:B000Q6ZG5C Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]) and Ron (Rupert Grint, [[ASIN:B000PAAJW4 Driving Lessons]]) continue their natural physical growth, so does the story. With age comes interest in the opposite sex, increasing responsibilities, and increased danger. It is this last one that stands out for the film, too. Dangerous and dark, this story is the most muted in terms of fun that any of us have seen so far. Director David Yates ([[ASIN:B000A59PL0 The Girl in the Cafe]]) pulls off a stunningly stark and surreal landscape that has altered Hogswart from a place of fun and learning, to one of deception and dread.<br /><br />The second reason this one stands out is that it never spoonfeeds the viewer. If you don't know what something means, or where you're at, or why someone is interested in someone else, well, you're outta luck. But the connections within the film, if you pay attention, will give you all the answers. I applaud screenwriter Steve Kloves for stepping up and giving us an adult fantasy story that, at times, can make you squirm in your seat or jump out of it. I was actually surprised that the film retained a cool PG rating instead of PG-13.<br /><br />The third reason this film works is that it touches on relationships in a hard way. Fomenting strong bonds with each other, and sticking to them, is not something that is normal in society, and we see the fraying of friendships as they mutate, and watch how death can affect even the sturdiest of hearts.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE outstrips all the other Harry Potter films for these very important reasons. And as for the ending? No complaints on that from me, either. I can't wait to see what Harry and his friends do next.omething that is normal in society, and we see the fraying of friendships as they mutate, and watch how death can affect even the sturdiest of hearts.

B002VLNB1Q|4.0|John Mayer has succeeded in releasing yet another great album. For the most part, I love almost all of the songs, they're performed beautifully with passion only Mr. Mayer can convey. However, I wouldn't say this CD is as good as his last one, as that would just be impossible! Part of the change is the fact that John is more serious, or somber, on this album, using \\"war\\" metaphorically for intimate relationships. And how true is that? Love really can be a battlefield sometimes. I also love it that this album is somewhat poppier. It has his trademark sound but is more top 40 friendly, which in my opinion, isn't a bad thing. All in all \\"Battle Studies\\" is a diverse record combining pop, rock, the blues, and more, it is yet another step in the growth of John Mayer. Add this to your cart, you know you want to, it's worth the $9.99 - you won't regret it!
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I have not enjoyed an album as much as this one in a long time. Great tracks excellent production, lovely 80's synths and vibes happening here really poetic and raw at times.

Only negative Beyonce spoils the album with her tune.

0670021652|4.0|It sure is great when you are a good writer and then have something happen in your life that is worth writing about.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert did the classic \\"If life gives you lemons, then make lemonade,\\" with her book chronicling her round the world trek to recover from her painful divorce (\\"Eat, Pray, Love\\"), and it now looks as if she has done it again with \\"Committed - A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage.\\"<br /><br />While anyone, no matter how skilled, would find it hard to surpass the pasta in Italy and romance in Bali of the bestseller \\"Eat, Love, Pray,\\" \\"Committed\\" does a pretty good job.  Few of us ever have to manage what Gilbert and her sweetheart Filipe had to go through in order to be together.  Thank goodness.  \\"Committed\\"'s very first chapter is so hair-raising that the rest of the book can't help but be a bit of a downer.<br /><br />Even so, Gilbert's meditation on her ambivalence about marriage - really, she wasn't ambivalent at all, she started dead set against ever marrying again - is excellent reading for people who are having some hesitation about moving towards legal commitment to another.
B000LW7OWE|2.0|The Doors is not the best movie. While the begining of the movie seems to promise something good, and the end of the movie has you walk away with some emotions. After this first hour of this nearly two and half hour movie, it becomes boring.<br /><br />There is hardly any focus on the music. Besides the concerts, events of the movie seem pointless. Their only point seems to show how crazy the singer was. Jim Morrison, the singer and main charater, was just a crazy idiot, and thats not what he was in real life. The last thirty minutes will respark interest, but does not save the movie at all.<br /><br />I would recommend someone to rent this movie, not buy it.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this dvd a little over a year ago and did the workout for a solid 30 days, never going beyond level 1 or level 2.  I saw some results, but didn't lose the promised \\"20 pounds in 30 days.\\"  The music and dialogue was repetative (obviously, as it was the same thing every day) and that was frustrating, but the workout is a killer.  Though the movements are extremely basic, they work.  I stopped the shred after that 30 days, but started it back up again in January.  Here's my revised opinion.<br /><br />Start out with 3 lb weights.  It's enough to built muscle and get a hard workout.  After doing level 1 once or twice, turn the volume down and listen to music during the workout.  This will make it seem shorter and \\"mix things up.\\"  I started out doing level 1 ten times, and am now on my 7th day of level 2.  I have not done the workout every day, but never skip more than one day (every other day minimum.)  I have noticed a HUGE difference in my size, but have not lost any weight yet.  My thought is that the weight will drop off after the muscle has been developed.  Of course, diet changes have been made as well.<br />I also suggest finishing out all 3 levels first, then varying between the 3.  This will mix things up a bit and give lower impact days as well.<br /><br />I also plan to move up to 5 lb weights for when I go back to the lower impact days.  But this is my biggest advise... don't give up!  It is a HARD workout and will make you sweat buckets, but will deliver results!

0316044695|5.0|One of the most gripping books I have ever read. The story is tragic but inspiring as well.
6305428352|5.0|It is cold and rainy today. Snow is coming. I needed something warm and friendly. \\"Mr. Holland's Opus\\" seemed like it would fill the bill. It is a film I have seen four times prior to today. I have enjoyed it each time, but today I found myself very moved by it. Maybe it's late midlife, maybe it's being unemployed, maybe it's my general state of concern for our educational system, or maybe it's my need to focus on what really counts and how we really touch each other's lives.<br /><br />Today, what held my attention was the relationship between a father whose life is built upon music and a son who cannot hear a note. Each struggles to \\"listen\\" to the other but lack a common medium. And then music shows the way. A deaf Beethoven lies upon the floor listening to his piano by way of the vibrations that pass from piano through wood. Cole tunes an engine be touching his ear to a screwdriver resting on the motor. Glenn Holland learns to speak to his son through sign language and the linking of sound to light. The film is all about listening and hearing. A new teacher who teaches because he cannot make a living as a composer listens to a principal who challenges his lack of connection and he becomes a master teacher. A husband listens to a wife looking to make a life, to have a home, and to reach beyond the deafness of a child to enter that child's mind. A wife listens to her husbands desire for fresh love from a student infatuated with him and stands off to the side knowing that he would do the right thing. A football coach befriends a music teacher, becomes his ally and then teaches his band to march, and his football players to dance listening to a side of himself that was easily shut down. A teacher listens to a football coach who says that the failure of a student to learn is a greater challenge to the teacher not the end of the road for the student.<br /><br />In the closing scene Mr. Holland, ending his career because the music program that he created has been eliminated, figures his life has amounted to very little. And then he gets to conduct a piece of music he has been trying to complete for 40 years. That piece of music is not confined to the pages before him or to the instruments that sound the notes. The musical masterpiece, his opus, is the great work he has done with the people whose paths he crossed in his apparently not-so-great life.<br /><br />The film has moved into my top 20 for \\"those that inspire.\\"is life has amounted to very little.

The FBI takes an interest in the case and Rachel Walling is one of the agents on the scene.  As the FBI chases terrorists, Harry continues to pursue the case as a simple murder.  His new partner, Iggy, is more conservative than Harry and questions him all along the way.  I generally can't figure out \\"whodunit\\" in Connelly novels because the plots are so intricate.  In The Overlook, I was able to figure out a good bit of the plot very early on.  Still, an enjoyable and fast paced Bosch storyline worth reading.

B002ZG997C|5.0|The Hughes Brothers film, \\"The Book of Eli\\" is a well-acted, well-crafted, surprising story of faith, love, and hope, even in the midst of chaos and destruction.<br /><br />The film takes place 30 years after a nuclear apocalypse. A lone traveller named Eli, played by Denzel Washington makes his way toward the Western United States. In his possession is a King James Bible, thought to be the last one in existence. Books of faith like the Bible have been held responsible for the worlds destruction, and therefore most have been destroyed. Eli feels that he is being lead Westward and the book will be safe at journey's end.<br /><br />As he travels, he encounters the familiar kind of desperation that we have come to expect from watching the Mad Max films and similar post-nuclear movies. Roving bands of thieves stealing, raping, and killing. Things like water and fuel becoming rare and prized possessions, and a general bleakness that threatens anyone and everyone. Through this landscape, Eli travels, until he comes to a town run by Gary Oldman and his maurauding gangs. Oldman's gangs are in search of a particular book that Oldman thinks will leverage his power over the townspeople. The book? The Bible. He soon discovers that Eli has one in his possession. One that only Eli opens and reads. The tale continues as Oldman's gang pursues Eli in order to get the Bible. Eli has been saddled with a sidekick, played by Mila Kunis, the daughter of Oldman's blind girlfriend, who is played by Jennifer Beals.<br /><br />This film has lots of familiar elements, indeed, but also rises above what could seem to barren ground on the strength of the great performances - Washington, Oldman, Kunis, Beals, etc, and a surprise or two at the end that causes one to revisit lots of what they saw in the last hour plus. This film is a very good one because it has a lot to say, and it says it well.

B002GMNLKQ|4.0|Across the Dark, the new release by Insomnium is much like the previous albums so I am sure previous fans will enjoy the record just the same. The only problem I currently have with Insomnium and the previous record is that who ever they have mixing does a TERRIBLE job. Vocals are pushed behind the mix a majority of the time, guitars and drums do not really seperate. At times in the album there is a lot going on, and while you can make it out for them to really woe me their next release I would hire a better audio engineer to mix my album. As for the music its superb, very melodic. I was expecting some heavy breakdowns but they never prevailed. I still listen to it so I am fairly happy with my purchase.

B001974DG0|5.0|I don't give many five-star reviews, but this book was simply awesome. I've not read any other Dean Koontz, so I can't tell you how it compares with his other bountiful output (though the author himself says in the recently written afterward that people STILL tell him after all these years that \\"Watchers\\" is the best thing he's every written). I will tell you that the only reason I read this book was because Amazon dropped the price to $1.90 for the Kindle edition. What a bargain. This book had me on the edge of my seat, in a serious \\"can't put it down\\" state for several days. I don't want to give away too much about the plot, but let me say that if you have EVER loved a dog, I mean REALLY loved a dog...if you have ever dreamed about being able to more deeply communicate with a canine, you simply MUST read this book.<br /><br />In the afterward, Koontz sums up one of the major themes of this book:<br /><br />\\"We have within us the ability to change for the better and to find dignity as individuals rather than as drones in one mass movement or another. We have the ability to love, the need to be loved, and the willingness to put our own lives on the line to protect those we love, and it is in these aspects of ourselves that we can glimpse the face of God; and through the exercise of these qualities, we come closest to a Godlike state.\\"<br /><br />Can I have an \\"Amen\\" ?<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Koontz!

B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|A movie about a robot Bruce Willis fighting crime?  Sounds like an action-adventure extraordinaire!<br /><br />People who watch surrogates expecting \\"Die Hard\\" with a Sci-Fi twist are going to be disappointed.  But if you watch the movie without any expectations at all, you'll find a very interesting character piece that explores a bifurcated existence for the entire human population that is an obvious metaphor for how the internet simultaneously unites and divides us.  The movie explores how a safety-obsessed culture, aided by technology, becomes universally agoraphobic, and what effect that has on human interaction.<br /><br />The year is unstated but from the look of the film it is in the not-too-distant future.  A technological advance allows people to control a robotic body--a surrogate--from the safety of their own home.  Originally intended to help handicapped people get around and carry on in the real world free from their physical impairments, surrogates are rapidly adopted by the populace at large.  Having a surrogate means always being beautiful, or in fact, being whatever you want.  The effects crew on this film do a wonderful job of taking live actors and digitally airbrushing their skin to give them a somewhat unrealistically perfect appearance.<br /><br />Willis loses his robot body during pursuit of a criminal, and has to venture out into the real world himself.  He finds it terrifying.  His partner comes to pick him up at the hospital, and despite years working with him, she's never seen him before.  He desperately wants to connect with his wife, wonderfully played by Rosamund Pike--but she is more interested in hiding behind her surrogate than most.  While the ideas of surrogacy aren't new ideas, they aren't new because they affect us --today-- which, in my mind, is part of what makes this film interesting.  Here in the real world there are people who fly drone missions in Afghanistan from the safety of an office in California--the most dangerous part of their involvement in the war is their commute to work.  Surrogates explores this idea too--soldiers on a \\"peace-keeping operation\\" fight via surrogates from the safety of a command center thousands of miles away.<br /><br />I don't want to give everything away, but I think this movie was wonderful.  I watched it on pay-per-view without knowing ANYTHING about it--no expectations--and enjoyed it immensely.  I went right out and bought a copy the next day.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|I enjoyed this movie greatly - it takes normal sci-fi tropes and turns them on their ear. Instead of an alien invasion causing a huge, world-wide military response against the \\"evil\\" aliens, the humans are the bad guys. What an interesting concept! It was executed deftly by the cast and crew. In addition, it was nice to see a movie taking place outside of the United States, reminding us that there is, indeed, another 85% of the planet on which to operate.<br /><br />The special features are interesting, with loads of great how-they-did-its. I haven't watched the commentaries yet, but I've scanned through the extras with enjoyment. I also liked the downloadable copy!

B00275EGWY|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from The Hurt Locker. The rave reviews and hype suggested it was just propaganda for the war (\\"Yeah, war is horrible, but...\\"), but I wanted to see for myself. I was actually quite surprised. Yes, it's got some propaganda elements. The horrors of the war in Iraq are understated in the film. Where's Blackwater? Where is the random murder and rape of civilians and children? Lacuna like these aside, the film is interesting. (Spoiler warning!)<br /><br />The Hurt Locker follows the operations of an elite U.S. army bomb squad as they handle IEDs, car bombs, \\"body bombs\\", and investigate the scenes of exploded materials. Its fairly realistic look and narrative is probably because it was written and produced by Mark Boal, who spent time embedded with a real bomb squad in Iraq.<br /><br />The script reveals only what the characters see and experience and for those who are paying attention, the absence of any real explanation for the violence throughout the film is telling. Bombs are discovered, but never their creators. Stashes are found, but never their owners. A young boy is found murdered, a bomb sewn into his abdomen. In fact, except for a sole sniper and his companions, the so-called \\"enemy\\" is never seen, only assumed to be real. This is understandable, given the fact that armed resistance is a given in any occupied territory. In fact, the only villains seen in the film are the occupiers, like the commander who suggestively orders the murder of an Iraqi man with a survivable wound, or the British (SAS?) bounty hunters dressed in Arab clothing whom the main characters encounter in the desert.<br /><br />The noticeable absence of any real \\"terrorist network\\" is particularly evident in two scenes. In the first, the bomb squad is called to investigate a suicide bombing in the Green Zone. The team Sergeant is the only one to point out that it was probably a remote detonation, not an actual suicide bombing. How many remote bombings, committed by persons unknown, are written off as \\"suicide bombings\\" without any real investigation? In the second scene, some soldiers encounter a \\"suicide bomber\\" with a bomb vest. While the majority of the near-hysterical soldiers want to shoot the man on site, it's revealed that he was forced against his will, by parties unknown, to wear the vest and approach the soldiers. He was coerced, again by persons unknown.<br /><br />In fact, while the film doesn't reveal it, the truth is that the vast majority, if not all, of the \\"suicide bombings\\" in Iraq are orchestrated and engineered by U.S., U.K., and Israeli intelligence to give the illusion of a real enemy, thus justifying an extended occupation and a profitable War Without End against a fabled enemy. The thought patterns concerning the war in Iraq, whether of the soldiers themselves or the American and world public, are built on the false premise that there is an enemy. We naturally \\"fill in the blanks\\", but only after the key pieces of data have been provided to complete our collective substitution of data. As a result, the absence of a real enemy isn't noticed. It's straight out of [[ASIN:0141036141 Nineteen Eighty Four]]. (Haven't read it? Do so, and learn a lesson from Emmanuel Goldstein.)<br /><br />For those readers used to being fed on the unwholesome chaff of the mainstream media rags, these statements may come as a shock. Scoffs of disbelief and the occasional outburst of \\"Ridiculous!\\" accompanied by frantic gesticulations are to be expected. But in a society where entire professions rely on people deliberately manipulating the truth in order to \\"win\\" an argument, where policing serves politics and quotas, not care and protection of citizens, where military personnel protect \\"national interests\\" and not national safety, and where people are so used to lying that it is considered normal and perfectly acceptable, is such a reality really so hard to believe?<br /><br />When we consider some facts that, taken separately, are relatively easy to believe, the situation becomes clearer. Psychopaths thrive in corporations and politics (witness Madoff and Blagojevich), and the violent ones are considered the worst of the worst criminals (most serial killers are psychopaths). And with unlimited black budgets, cannon fodder soldiers, crafty intelligence agencies with generations of experience in making murder look like an accident, political psychopaths (check out [[ASIN:1897244258 Political Ponerology: A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes]]), simply by virtue of the scope of their influence, are potentially the most dangerous. While The Hurt Locker doesn't go there, the fact that it leaves the interpretation to the viewer is a relief. There's too much terrorism propaganda coming out of Hollywood these days.becomes clearer.

B001JNNDBA|5.0|As most people do, I think this is a great movie.  I've seen it several times over the years, but decided to buy the blu ray version despite mostly bad reviews for the transfer.    As far as why the movie itself is so great, it's unique, there's a lot to figure out, and many of the theoretical physics type of topics such as time travel are interesting to a lot of people anyway.    The blu ray has both the theatrical release of the movie and the director's cut.  Each of them explain what's going on in different ways really.  The director's cut version explains a lot of things which the theatrical release leaves more open ended.  It explains by showing the pages from the time travel book on the screen between some of the scenes.  However, I personally like the ending of the theatrical version better.  A lot of \\"helpful audio\\" is present at the end of the theatrical version, but not there in the director's cut.    As far as it being on blu ray, I disagree with those saying not to buy it.  Most places sell it for close to $10, including here on Amazon.  The transfer seems BARELY better than the DVD version to me.  However if you don't already own BOTH versions of this movie on dvd, why not spend $10 to get to have both on one disc and compare them back and forth?  Then I still believe it has SLIGHTLY better picture quality also.    So if you own BOTH versions of the movie on dvd I guess skip it.  But otherwise it's easily worth the $10-$15.  The movie itself is one of my favorites of all time.    The director's cut mostly just adds in deleted scenes already on the original dvd abd then overlays those time travel book pages, but it also has different music, added audio, removed audio, a little more in way of deleted scenes, etc...  It's different enough to be interesting to anyone who loves the movie.  The music is better in certain places in the theatrical release though, so I still rate the theatrical as the better version.
B003102JDM|4.0|\\"A Serious Man\\" provides us with a view of 1960s middle class suburbia as only the Coen Brothers, in all their warped glory, could conceive of it.<br /><br />Larry Gopnik is a mild-mannered college professor who lives with his wife and two teenaged children in a spare, homogeneous housing tract, where every home comes replete with its own perfectly manicured lawn and gnarled antennae.  Larry may be leading a life of soul-sucking banality, but it isn't until he discovers that his wife is planning to leave him for a mutual friend of theirs that he begins to question God's purpose for his life.  The Coens deftly satirize the age-old Jewish propensity to heap scorn and guilt upon oneself when things aren't going well in life, and to seek out divine explanations for all one's problems, even with the awareness that such a search will likely lead to more questions than answers in the final analysis.  Larry even has his own King David moment when he espies a neighborhood Bathsheba sunning herself in a nearby yard.  But he's a David who, for all intents and purposes, has no real kingdom to rule over - his wife and kids being, at best, indifferent to his needs and dismissive of his authority - and no special connection to a God who remains stubbornly silent to all Larry`s pleadings for help and understanding.  In fact, the Biblical character he comes most to resemble is Job, as the afflicted man begins to question why, after a lifetime of trying to do the righteous thing, God has suddenly seen fit to rain down all sorts of trials and tribulations onto his increasingly balding head.<br /><br />It makes perfect sense for \\"A Serious Man\\" to be set in the 1960s, a time when traditionalism and modernity were duking it out for supremacy, even in the drab placidity of a sterile suburb, the last spot on earth one would expect to find such upheaval taking place.  Yet, unlike in urban centers or on college campuses where it was taking place out in the open and in full view of the public, the cultural revolution in suburbia was occurring largely within the nuclear family unit and behind closed doors.  Thus, in \\"A Serious Man,\\" we have youngsters who study Torah in between smoking pot, listening to Jefferson Airplane on cheap transistor radios, and watching \\"F Troop\\" reruns on TV, and adults who plan their child's bar mitzvah while partaking in the \\"new freedoms\\" of divorce, marijuana and extramarital hanky-panky.<br /><br />With its relatively low-wattage drama, austere visuals and trademark inconclusive ending, \\"A Serious Man\\" is not a sure-fire crowd-pleaser on the order of a \\"No Country for Old Men\\" or \\"Burn Before Reading\\" (as much of a crowd-pleaser as any Coen Brothers movie can be, that is), but those with a taste for understated quirkiness should derive a great deal of pleasure from this movie.  Jewish viewers, in particular, may find much to identify with in the knowing satire put forth by the authors.<br /><br />As Larry, Michael Stuhlbarg turns the ultimate nebbish into a perfectly recognizable everyman character.  He receives fine support from the likes of Richard Kind as his troublesome older brother, Sari Lennick as his unfulfilled wife, Aaron Wolff as his socially awkward son, and a whole host of other superb secondary players too numerous to mention.ral revolution in suburbia was occurring largely within the nuclear family unit and behind closed doors.

B002XTBE6K|4.0|Emma has never been my favourite Jane Austen novel.  I tried to read it, but I couldn't get into it.  I've seen a number of adaptations, but I found them (mostly) boring.  I have trouble keeping all the characters straight, especially since some of them have taken different names (Frank Churchill is actually Mr. Weston's son, for example).  When I started watching this, I was as confused as ever.  But I kept watching, hoping that I would be able to get everything straight in my head.  By the time PBS aired the last of the three parts, I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.<br /><br />Good casting, fine scenery, and gorgeous costumes are things I've come to expect from BBC productions of classic works, and Emma didn't disappoint.  After seeing this beautiful adaptation, I may have to rethink putting Emma at the bottom of my list of favourite classic stories.

B0000640VN|3.0|Kate & Leopold<br /><br />Released Christmas Day 2001, a romantic comedy with some sci-fi elements.  The comedy is not that funny and the scifi elements are full of plot holes.<br /><br />Sad but interesting premise: A man, Stuart, finds a portal in time and goes back to the 1800s to research the inventor of the elevator, Leopold.  Unfortunately Stuart is not to careful with his mini-camera and is found out.  In being chased by Leopold (to find out who this guy is who's spying on him) they fall into the portal and reappear back in 2001.<br /><br />Meg Ryan plays the ex-girlfriend of Stuart.  Not only does she flatly refuse to believe anything Stuart says regarding Leopold, but she gives her brother, Charles, a hard time, too when he joins Leopold in a song & dance.  Meg's character is vindictive and not very attractive at the start of the film.<br /><br />I'm thinking, \\"This is a date movie?  Not!\\"<br /><br />Leopold (played expertly by Hugh Jackman as a nobleman) has the manners of a 19th century man, stands when the lady stands (Kate shirks this as nonsense) and has some difficulty cutting through frozen TV dinners.<br /><br />Most of the film has comedy activities as Leo has difficulty dealing with the year 2001 and desires to return to his own century as soon as possible.<br /><br />In this film, time changes occur slowly.  I never understood this concept.  Things should change all at once (as in Frequency).<br /><br />Meg's character gets frustrated with what she considers an \\"act\\" by Leo, \\"pretending\\" that he is from the 19th century, but he says something that gets her thinking about her next marketing ploy at the job.  With Leo's help, she may be able to make vice president!<br /><br />Stuart meantime is very worried that to keep Leo in the 21st century will create a time space continuum rift (which is never fully explained).<br /><br />Interesting scenes:<br /><br />Kate doesn't get that her boss has other motives when he takes her to dinner and Leo insists on being a Chaperone.  Kate doesn't have a clue and goes out anyway with predictable results.<br /><br />Leo rides a horse to stop a purse thief.  Mildly interesting.  At this, Kate starts to reconsider that Leo just may be a duke.<br /><br />Stuart attempts to get on the phone to make sure Leo stays in the apartment, ends up dislodging some guy's air tubes.  Not that funny.<br /><br />There are several continuity and anachronistic errors.  If the producers had not used the incorrect date of 1876, yet he is at the dedication to the Brooklyn Bridge which was 1893.<br />Cute if predictable ending!<br /><br />There are other plot holes:  If his disappearance affected elevators being invented, then why are there still elevator shafts?  And wouldn't buildings be shorter?  And what of the Otis Elevator Company?<br /><br />Lots of nitpicking, but if you fail to pick the nits, and are a Hugh Jackman or Meg Ryan fan, you should enjoy this on a slow Saturday night for your next rental.<br /><br />Better Meg Ryan films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000YDBPAM You've Got Mail (Deluxe Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000CCBCB2 Sleepless in Seattle/When Harry Met Sally]]edictable results.

B002IYEQR4|4.0|If you're a fan of the comic book, then this is the most strictly accurate retelling of the story. It doesn't improve the film overall, but it does give you more of the same. Much more. Thing is, Snyder is quite a vulgar film maker. And while Watchmen was never particularly subtle, this just rams every goddamn point home with a massive CG sledgehammer. So while it's slavishly faithful to the text and gives every geekboy what he wants - and is very, very entertaining, in case I need to point that out - it's just not a classic in the way the comic is. Which was probably too much to hope for. Anyway, no self-respecting fanboy should be without this version.

B002N1RM5A|4.0|My touchstones for this wonderful song cycle have always been the recorded performances of Aksel Schiøtz accompanied by Gerald Moore - an incomparable, vintage account, but obviously in hissy, mono 1945 sound - the delectable sibling team of Ian and Jennifer Partridge in a speedy, thistledown-light 1973 CfP disc and, in pure vocal terms, Fritz Wunderlich's 1966 version which is unfortunately compromised by stodgy, unimaginative pianism. All three of these tenors are demonstrably lighter and brighter than Kaufmann and thus capable of injecting more fantasy into the quieter, higher passages; Kaufmann, with his baritonal timbre must work far harder to fine down his big sound and achieve a delicacy and poignancy which come more easily to his tenor forebears. He also has to work harder to achieve intimacy in the big, resonant acoustic given to him by Decca; at times, especially in the earlier, exuberant or declamatory songs he seems a little crude alongside the poise of, say, Schiøtz. He does not really have the right vocal \\"face\\" for this music but does wonders with the voice he has, even if it is not as intrinsically beautiful as others.<br /><br />One thing is certain: Helmut Deutsch draws upon his vast experience to provide some of the most fluid, fluent and subtle acccompaniment we have heard for years in this deceptively simple music; he is alive to every nuance of phrasing and dynamics and matches his singer with unfailing sensitivity.<br /><br />My first listening of this disc prompted an odd sensation of dej&agrave;-vu. I do not mean that necessarily as a criticism, but Kaufmann's vocal characteristics are so individual that I knew how he would sound in this music before I heard it: the husky, slightly \\"windy\\" Vickers-style production of his mezza-voce, the long breath, the baritonal heft the perfect German diction, are all very welcome - but I am sometimes more aware of listening to Kaufmann than I am to Schubert, if you follow me; some effects sound a little calculated compared with the simplicity these folk-songs require. He also sounds decidedly ill-at-ease in the near Sprechstimme of \\"Die J&auml;ger\\", which at this speed requires a fleetness beyond him. I think if I did not have an attachment to the older recordings mentioned above, this could be a first choice as long as you favour his style, but I cannot in all honesty say that I find Kaufmann's larger scale delivery as moving or affecting as his predecessors. It is still a lovely performance by perhaps the best tenor before the public today and conforms to my (and, according to the liner notes, Kaufmann's) conviction that this cycle is far better delivered by a tenor than a baritone. Who could believe that one of the reasons why Kaufmann chose to record it was that he is already forty and wanted to capture his interpretation while his voice still encompassed youthful ardour? He certainly does that and, in addition, manages a welcome degree of yearning melancholy. His fans will not be disappointed.<br /><br />PS: What marketing genius at Decca sanctioned the tacky cover photo?ith the simplicity these folk-songs require.

An overweight, unkempt, blue-collar, middle-aged, tolerated, mostly ignored person, found a way to display her god-given gift with a few in Scotland and then the rest of the world. In her own way, drawing on her limited and earthly experiences, Susan blends her personality and shares her feelings through her music with a talent that immediately mesmerizes her audiences.

Everything about the songs in this album - how they flow together, the different influences in all of them, the various instruments and sounds, and the overall vibe they give out - makes this album something that you need to buy. Some people might disagree with me on what I've said, but OneRepublic is definitely my new favorite band after I've heard this album. If you like the single, \\"All the Right Moves,\\" then you'll love this album. I think this album is way better than 'Dreaming Out Loud,' the first album from OneRepublic. I've listened to this album many times over and still listen to it without becoming tired of the songs. So, go out and buy this album and hopefully you'll like it as much as me!

1439138311|4.0|In Colm Toibin's latest novel, Brooklyn, young Eilis Lacey leaves the struggling economy of her small hometown in southeast Ireland to forge a new life in Brooklyn, New York.  In unadorned prose, Toibin describes the daily struggles and triumphs of Eilis's life in the unfamiliar, and often inhospitable, urban environment of her new home.  In many ways, Eilis's story is a small, insignificant one, but it's one that was repeated thousands of times in the 1940s and 50s.  The backdrop of these repetitions, coupled with Toibin's deft use of just the right amount of historical detail, lends resonance to Eilis's journey.  The question at the root of Brooklyn, and the one that drives much of the action, is whether it's possible to truly leave home.<br /><br />This is not a book filled with impressive literary effects.  The chronology is simple and the story is familiar.  Nevertheless, Toibin's gift for storytelling maintains the momentum, particularly in the last third of the book when Eilis is faced with a difficult decision.  Eilis rarely takes initiative, instead merely reacting to what happens around her, including the overtly manipulative actions of stronger characters.  Some readers will find Eilis's passivity annoying, but this trait seems a natural result of her sheltered upbringing.  A more hard-charging personality wouldn't ring as true.  Overall, Brooklyn is an emotionally rich story about leaving home and starting over.

Taking a multi-generational approach to her story telling, Shilpi Somaya Gowda teaches readers about both rural and large city Indian life, the importance of the stability of marriage, and the overriding influence of a supportive immediate and extended family in the development of individuals. A valuable lesson is that families can be accepting of connections with people outside of their blood lines and racial identities if there is a loving, strong, and self-sacrificing matriarch anchoring the social group.<br /><br />The dramatic focus of the novel is on Usha, a daughter born to a poor woman in rural India.  Because of the very limited resources of the family, female children are a liability but sons are an asset. Sons can work in the fields and carry on the blood line.  Kavita makes an important decision at the birth of her daughter that will haunt her for a lifetime. She and her husband Jasu can have ultimate peace only through knowledge of the life of Usha.<br /><br />The structure of the novel causes the reader to look forward to the next episodes of several family stories in alternating chapters.  The development of the characters is realistic and their emotions strongly affect readers. The book is similar in structure, character development, and emotional impact to another very good novel set in Uruguay, The Invisible Mountain by Carolina De Robertis.<br /><br />I recommend Secret Daughter to readers who like stories that take place in international settings and characters who create strong emotions. You will experience sadness and joy and will shed more than a few tears as I did.
0684824906|5.0|After Reading Gore Vidal's Lincoln, for the second time, I yearned to read more. I wanted to read more on Lincoln's Presidency including some of the people around him especially, Salmon Chase, William Seward,Edwin Stanton and lessor known characters as Kate Chase,John Hay and John Nicolay.    I found Team of Rivals a brilliant read on the Presidency and had no trouble in devouring the whole book.    The characteristic that impressed me the most, was Lincoln's refusal to carry grudges against those who opposed him and in many cases won them over to his side to help him achieve his goals in carrying him all the way to the Presidency.     Lincoln had a very strong belief in himself that allowed him to pick the very best men for his cabinet, to withstand the pressures of a divided political party and to carry on a war that for a very long time contained one reversal after another, and not least of all a wife that didnot know when to stop spending, and with all of this a death of a beloved son.    I found the details in the book were very informative and enteresting and were not a hinderance as some have suggested. Highly reccomended
0385751893|4.0|The Boy in Striped Pj's is a short fable about the son of a German Commandant who befriends another similarily aged Jewish boy incarcerated in Auschwitz (which he refers to as out-with)<br /><br />The narration builds tension well, despite the main character being oblivious, we are made well aware of the danger, particularily for the Jewish servants of the boy's family.<br /><br />My main concern of the book, is that it is too short. I realise its an attempt to be a simple story or fable, but there was so much potential to develop the characters. Instead the story ends abruptly, in an ironic but slightly too forced event which left me dissapointed.<br /><br />Also a problem was the unneeded last chapter with a last sentence which left me a little WTF? Was is intended to be more irony, sarcasm? Or what.<br /><br />One can't help feel a jaded sense of that the Boy in Striped Pj's is just another book attempting to evoke emotions from the holocaust, but its not bad. It won't take long to read, so well worth it.
1591843162|5.0|The best thing about the book is that it makes you actually start DOING something. And it's the biggest value. I've listened to it and will be buying a paper copy - for myself and friends.    I'm amazed at how everything seems to fall into place after reading Linchpin. It's the Buddhist wisdom, it's the most natural thing to do, it's the \\"art of the start\\" and everything else, condensed in one place. It's finding your true self, and pushing away the things that society imposed (or seemingly imposed) on you.    I've been watching TED conference, and a lot of things said there also resonate a great deal with Linchpin. Get up and do it, that's what it is. The new type of business - the ideas that have been around and are, hopefully, turning into a stream and then - mainstream.
0786868724|3.0|Have a Little Faith is a touching shortish novel about a Rabi reaching the end of his life, and Mitch Albom's experience of knowing the man.<br /><br />'Reb' is an insightful spiritual leader and his memoir is well worth the read.<br /><br />Mitch's opinions thrown into the mix, are slightly more annoying and naively preachy, but luckily are few in number.<br /><br />The story about the homeless christian preacher Henry is also interesting. Althought perhaps I missed something, but I couldn't see why we were reading about him and Reb?<br /><br />Overall Have a Little Faith is nice, and hardly a difficult read, but one struggles to see where the hype comes from. \\"Required reading for life?\\" Perhaps I read a different book to some reviewers, but I hardly found anything within these pages that changed the way I think, or challanged me, or had a depth of feeling beyond any other memoir. Maybe I'm just cynical.<br /><br />Give A Little Faith a chance, it doesn't take long to read, maybe you'll see what exactly it is inflating this book?
B002S9DRA6|5.0|Enigma has really intrigued me over the years.  The music never gets old.  Probably due to the complexity of sounds and ever-changing feel with each new CD.  I appreciate collections like this to get new listeners interested in an artist they might not otherwise be exposed to.  Sometimes \\"greatest hits\\" or \\"best of\\" fall short of expectations.  This CD with its expanded 3rd disc is a treat for fans and newcomers.  Highly recommended!!
B002T9H2LA|2.0|Just not what I found enjoyable. Rather disjointed and not a plot that held my attention.<br />Would not recommend buying.
B002E2M5IC|2.0|It's amazing to me how much hype this movie has gotten, as well as all the deep meaning people have managed to pull from it.  I found it to be droll at best, and downright pretentious at its worst.  Basically, just like the series Seinfeld, \\"A Serious Man\\" is about nothing.  That's it - nothing.  The only problem is that the movie even lacks a punch line, something that the series Seinfeld made sure to deliver.  I'm sure that the Coen brothers are laughing to themselves at all of the profoundly Earth-shattering \\"truths\\" that people are falling all over themselves to extract from this pointless movie.<br /><br />You want a \\"deep\\" movie that explores the random and existential nature of life, and yet reveals what really lurks in the hearts of men and women?  Get a copy of \\"Leben der Anderen\\" and watch it instead.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Loved Julia Child and loved Meryl Streeps portrayal of her. If one is into cooking or even thinking about it this movie is a great motivator. Enjoy!
B00000K3UU|5.0|Sonny Koufax is 32 years old. He's a law school graduate. He's got a nice apartment in Manhattan. There's just one problem. He does nothing, except sit on his butt and live off an investment that was the result of a meager lawsuit he won a year ago. But after his fed up girlfriend leaves him, he comes up with the ingenious idea to adopt a five year old boy to showcase his newfound maturity. But things don't go as planned, and Sonny finds himself the unlikely foster father that will change his perspective on just looking out for himself. This is a great movie and it will make you laugh. I would recommend this to anyone who like to laugh.
B002RSDW80|5.0|My sister and I loved this movie!  I think Meryl Streep deserves the Oscar for this one!
B00003CY5J|4.0|Nick Wells, a professional criminal, decides to leave the business for good, since he nearly got caught on his last job. His plan is to live in peace with his girl Diane, running his Montreal jazz club NYC. Soon Max, his good friend and financial partner in the illegal affairs, comes along with an offer Nick can't refuse: A historical and priceless French sceptre has been discovered while being smuggled into the country. It is now under massive surveillance in the Montreal Customs House, and soon to be returned to France. Nick has to team up with Max' man inside, the young, talented and aggressive thief Jackie Teller to get the precious item, and suffer no more financial problems ever. Only one question remains: Who will trick whom out of their share? The Score seems to start off slow for some, but speed up. It shows how DeNiro's character lives his life and his life is essential to the plot. Norton's performance is doubly magnificent. Brando delivers a number of scenes that are right on key and provides some comic relief that fits nicely. Overall a really good movie that will leave you with your jaw on the floor.

630471193X|5.0|Everybody in the small town of Harmon knows George Malley as a nice guy, a good auto mechanic, and a dependable friend. George observes a strange light on his birthday at a bar. The following days he becomes very intelligent and puts the intelligence to good use in his community. When word gets around he becomes known as a freak and everyone wants to figure out why this happened to a car mechanic. The government also wants to get their hands on it to put it to other uses. Without giving anything away, I will tell you that the ending is sad, but also heartwarming. George has his \\"experience\\" for no other reason than to suggest what we as humans can become. \\"Phenomenon\\" is a story about our potential, the good and bad things that can happen to us if we achieve it. We could only be so lucky, and watching the movie is a good start.
0061914177|5.0|If you're in business and you haven't read this book, you are truly missing out. Gary has a very refreshing view of the world and what it takes to build a brand today. Highly recommend you read this and really LISTEN to the words.
B000A0GP18|4.0|Paul \\"Wrecking\\" Crewe was a revered football superstar back in his day, but that time has since faded. But when a messy drunk driving incident lands him in jail, Paul finds he was specifically requested by Warden Hazen, a duplicitous prison official well aware of Paul's athletic skills. Paul has been assigned the task of assembling a team of convicts, to square off in a big football game against the sadistic guards. With the help of fellow convict Caretaker, and an old legend named Nate Scarborough to coach, Crewe is ready for what promises to be a very interesting game. It's only the warden and the guards who have no idea who or what they're up against, with Paul the driving force behind the new team. A good comedy worth seeing. Especially if you are a Sandler fan.
B00278U1WA|5.0|I waited for this cd to come out for many many months and when i finally got it I was very pleased with all the new songs Regina chose for this album. The new single \\"Laughing With\\" is poetry by itself and the songs \\"Eet\\", \\"Human of the Year\\" and \\"Genius Next Door\\" are just extraordinary! The DVD inclues 4 video clips and its comes with a nice booklet with all the lyrics of the songs.  A must have for any Regina Spektor fan, I never thought I would get it singed by her and her cellist! Support musicians, buy original music!
630542828X|5.0|Jan Schlichtmann, a tenacious lawyer, is addressed by a group of families. When investigating the seemingly non-profiting case, he finds it to be a major environmental issue that has a lot of impact potential. A leather production company could be responsible for several deadly cases of leukemia, but also is the main employer for the area. Schlichtmann and his three colleagues set out to have the company forced to decontaminate the affected areas, and of course to sue for a major sum of compensation. But the lawyers of the leather company's mother company are not easy to get to, and soon Schlichtmann and his friends find themselves in a battle of mere survival. \\"A Civil Action\\" is a great courtroom movie. John Travolta is great here and so is the rest of the cast, among them William H. Macy, Kathleen Quinlan, Sydney Pollack, John Lithgow, Stephen Fry, in a small cameo role, Kathy Bates, in an even smaller cameo role, and the great Robert Duvall. In the end, it is Duvall who steals the show in his quiet, unemotional musings, advice-givings and deliberations with Travolta. He embodies the restraint for which the movie strives. This is a great movie that is very entertaining.
B0027HBAB2|5.0|For anyone planning to buy this new album, I would definitely recomment getting this version because it includes a cd with all the tracks from the regular album version, and of course it's aways nice to listen to these wonderful songs on your turntable. :) Quality is pristine and it sounds exactly like the regular cd.     Includes:   Vinyl Record (double-sided)  Lyrics  Original CD with 13 tracks
0061914177|5.0|Read it, learn it, live it.  This book will change your outlook on where marketing is going. It will also motivate you on a personal level! It's a business book that could be equally at home in the \\"Self Help\\" section. Get, and then read it... Twice!
1933308087|4.0|This book is very complete with types of blocks and history of each block with all the names the blocks are known by. It is very heavy.  As a new quilter I guess I wanted a little more pattern/construction help.  It will be a great book to have as I progress in my quilting.

B003629IPW|5.0|After sitting through every bonus item on the DVD, I just could not help but wonder what could have been had he took the stage at O2 Arena. A 3D concert that no artist could have ever thought of...this man is simply brilliant. He is ALWAYS one step ahead of everyone!    This CD is a fitting finale for MJ. I love his music but never a die-hard fan but this made me one now. Great to get to know the people behind the scene - most importantly the band and the dancers. They were awesome. The best band MJ has ever had.    This is it...thank you MJ for all the everlasting songs that will forever be remembered.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|... Which I must admit were not too high. I'm generally not a fan of sci-fi, and especially can't stand computer generated graphics in a movie. And predictably, I hated it at the start of the film. It all looked like a glorified cartoon. But soon enough I got immersed in the story and forgot about the cartoonish presentation.<br /><br />I am generally a total sucker for movies about indigenous, 'primitive' people. In fact I'd love to learn from them how to live in the wild in various parts of the world, with no job, no mortgage, just hunting, gathering, and finding my place in nature and using its resources with skill. My favourite all-time movie is Apocalypto.<br /><br />So it's no surprise really that this film entertained me. I'm not too fussed about 3D and the technical aspects, like I said if you don't get into the story, then it all looks like a video game, rather than a film.<br /><br />Heard comments that this is as Anti-American movie. Hmmm I don't know, the movie certainly made heaps of money to some globalist Americans in Hollywood. Go figure. Maybe the makers are so arrogant they don't care what people think, as long as they get their money. I think the global market is increasingly anti-imperialist and eco-conscious, and the producers saw a demand for such a movie. Lucky for us. But wait till you can watch it cheap.

B002ECJZ76|4.0|This charming, low-key Finnish film about the origins of Santa Claus has much to recommend it.  For one thing, it's truly a visual feast.  The costumes, the sets, and the art direction are all outstanding, and Mika Orasmaa's cinematography is literally stunning - several times I found myself smiling with childlike delight at the beauty of individual shots and scenes.  Leri Leskinen's musical score also adds to the magical ambience of the film without calling undue attention to itself.  And the performances are all just fine; I think the fact that the actors were all unfamiliar to me leant the film a certain veneer of plausibility.<br /><br />In fact, my only quibble with the DVD presentation of the film is the fact that subtitles were not available.  Instead, the film was dubbed into English ... and a bit poorly, I might add, since the movement of the cast's lips did not always match the dialogue.  This would not have bothered me so much if I were a child - especially a youngster who had not yet learned to read! - but as an adult audience of one, I much would have preferred to have heard the actors' natural voices and read the English translations at the bottom of my screen.<br /><br />That one minor and adult-specific detail aside, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Christmas Story\\" and can't wait for the pleasure of watching it with my young godchildren when the holidays roll around again.  The joy and enthusiasm I know they will feel toward this delightfully told story are sure to double my own appreciation of the film.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has the voice of an opera singer, such a beautiful full trained voice and so pleasant to the ears.
0385341075|5.0|Complex, tragic, bitter-sweet; everything about this book felt TRUE! A story of isolation, guerrilla warfare, poverty, despair and violence ran counter-point to cooperation, determination and hope.  A story of human failures, disappointments, petty jealousies, personal redemption, and day to day survival against tremendous odds!!<br /><br />Mr. Watt's reading of \\"Great Expectations\\" (or rather his version of the book) creates an escape to another world of imagination; a wonderful distraction from the horrors of day to day life on this remote and increasingly harsh island.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book, the reader is transported to England, where we finally solve the mystery of who Mr. Watts was, as well as who he was not.<br /><br />A beautifully crafted story with so many messages woven throughout; well worth the time!!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Arrived in time for Christmas even though I ordered it rather late.  Was in great shape.
B0000DC14V|5.0|In an era during which the western movie was simply tuckered-out - tired of endless TV series' that chanted the same worn diatribe - and audiences searched for and demanded something different - along came &#34;One-Eyed Jacks&#34;...featuring one listless, troubled, mumbling loner - fretting, ruminating, and deliberating...see, you actually can describe him with something other than &#34;brooding&#34;!  No one besides Marlon Brando, as Rio, could have portrayed this man of few words - with tender, endearing lines, like - &#34;You get up - you big tub o'guts!&#34;, &#34;Get up, you scum-sucking pig!&#34;, and - &#34;You gob of spit!&#34;  Along with an equally colorful actor - Karl Malden, as the dispicable &#34;Dad&#34; Longworth, there is a relationship between these two men seared in the fires of deep, infesting hatred and forged in revenge.  In a friendship marred by bitter betrayal and hyprocrisy, two former tequila-saturated, bank-robbing buddies finally separate when surrounded by Mexican troops.  But, when his mentor, Longworth, fails to come back to rescue him - having been dispatched to locate horses for their getaway and leaves him for capture and a long prison term, Rio just wants to settle the score.  He soon learns that his former buddy is now Sheriff &#34;Dad&#34; Longworth in Monterey, California - which just happens to be the location of the next bank that Rio and his new compadres are about to rob - the stage for sweet revenge.  With the fragile and lovely Pina Pellicer as Rio's love interest, Louisa, the solid Katy Jurado as her mother, Mrs. Longworth, and great character actors like Ben Johnson, Sam Gilman, and Larry Duran as Rio's new bank-robbing friends - along with Slim Pickens as the reprehensible Deputy Lon Dedrick and including notable appearances by Elisha Cook, Jr., Ray Teal, and the amazing Timothy Carey - the supporting stock in this picture elevates it to cult classic status.  Now, add the haunting and memorable score by Hugo Friedhofer - and you have a truly wonderful motion picture that deserves the careful and diligent restorative techniques of a powerhouse like - say Criterion - to remaster it completely.  Filmed chiefly against the backdrop of Monterey, California with its rockbound shores and crashing sea rollers - it was a refreshing change to see a location other than some wind-swept, border town surrounded by paper-mache saguaro cacti.  What makes this film different is the carefully designed, chess-like series of ploys as Rio and &#34;Dad&#34; Longworth position themselves for the inevitable showdown.  SPOILER ALERT:  And, when Longworth finally gets his, it is satisfying to say the least, but certainly short of the real &#34;Sonny Corleone&#34;/&#34;Clyde Barrow&#34;-style, bullet-riddled dessert that he really deserves - even if Rio is carrying a nine-shooter revolver!  UPDATE: To its credit, Criterion (as mentioned above), has taken on the task of releasing this classic - fully-restored in Blu-Ray widescreen on November 22, 2016.
B00275EGX8|4.0|This is a very good movie, it was very well directed and the acting is outstanding.  Filmed in Jordan, it is also extremely realistic looking in the portrayal of a mideastern city and the residents, although many Iraq veterans are critical of the film's depiction of how the army and the EOD teams actually operate.  The movie centers entirely on the three members of the EOD (\\"bomb squad\\"), particularly the squad leader Sgt James, extremely well played by Jeremy Renner.  In-between the bomb disarming scenes, the movie develops the relationships between the three men and especially explores the character Sgt James.    The one thing this movie lacks is any actual storyline or plot as such.  At the beginning of the movie Sgt James arrives; there are a bunch of individual action segments depicting disarming bombs or perhaps the squad being pinned down by a sniper; and then the movie ends with a segment that completes the portrait of Sgt James' character.  The action segments are unrelated and in fact could be rearranged in almost any order with minor changes for continuity.  There is no unfolding \\"story\\" that builds to a climax and then is resolved at the end.  The only thing that is \\"built\\" throughout the movie is the relationships between the squad members and the character study of Sgt James, and in fact it is that character study which provides the movie's climax (in a scene between him and his toddler son, where we understand what ultimately drives him).  Basically, this movie is NOT plot-driven but is more of a character study.  With bombs.    The bomb sequences provide most of the suspense for the movie, and they are very gritty, white-knuckle hold-your-breath scenes.  Unless you find disarming-bomb-scenes to get a little old after a while, in which case you may find yourself patiently waiting through them.  Even so, the other elements of the film - the realistic-looking portrayal of the environment, the extraordinary acting, the evolving of the relationship between the team members, and particularly the depiction of the character Sgt James - all add up to an excellent film.

Fantastic music from Joe Hisaishi, who is responsible for most of the Miyazaki's films -- Princess Mononoke, Nausica of the Valley of the Winds, Spirited Away, Howls's Moving Castle...  If you like this movie, you might give Hirokazu Koreeda's \\"After Life\\" a try.
0316174483|5.0|This book and other books by Ed Emberley are nothing short of amazing! My six year old daughter had a blast making thumb and finger print drawings. Other members of the family of varied age groups find it equally intriguing. It is just astonishing that how many things we create with just a few strokes of lines.  This book is bound to fire your imagination. You can make amazing greeting cards, birthday cards, messages... just be creative.    I see many kids (including mine) stuck to their DS or PS2 or other kind of video games and older ones to their ipods and whatnot! I find books like this and Ed's other books such as Picture Pie as an oasis. They make neurons dance while you amaze yourself with creativity.  Picture Pie is also a wonderful book to introduce geometry to little kids without using words like 'math' and 'study'!    If these books are not already part of your home library, please make them now. Thanks for reading.

B000641D2Y|5.0|Our mischievous Kevin is separated from his parents going on a trip once again. This time, he ends up in New York while the rest of the family is in Florida. Having his father's money and credit cards, he stays at a swank hotel. There is a painful scene: The twin towers of the WTC (World Trade Center) are shown, and Kevin views the scenery from the observation deck of one of them.<br /><br />The two burglars who had once burgled his house have escaped from prison, and are now planning to rob a toy store after closing time on Christmas Eve. But Kevin has other ideas. The robbers get outsmarted and attacked. Then they follow Kevin to an unoccupied relative's home, and the action continues.<br /><br />As was the case in the first Home Alone, Kevin's life is saved by a marginal character--in this case the pigeon woman. She has long lived a reclusive life owing to the heartbreak of her husband having left her.<br /><br />Absolutely hilarious from beginning to end!
1400052173|5.0|I can't really add anything to the other positive reviews - it was simply a TRULY fascinating read!  I read a blurb about this book in a news story and picked it up.  For days, I couldn't put it down!  I've been done with the book for almost a week, and I've recommended it to everyone I know.  I can't stop thinking about it, it's THAT captivating.  The book was well written, and easy for a layman to read.  The medical and cellular aspects were educational, but definitely written in a way that it was easy to understand.    I honestly can't wait to read it again when I get the book back!
6305268177|5.0|One Night Only is the Bee Gees in all of their absolute shining glory.  It is one of the finest performances I have ever seen by these guys but more than that, it is one of the finest performances I have ever seen of anyone.  Their catalog of hits songs is so vast that I had forgotten some of the songs they made famous until I heard them again.  They did a very moving tribute to their late brother, Andy.  One Night Only is a must have for any fan of the Brothers Gibb.  A stellar performance.  It was so tragic to lose Maurice a few years ago but even though we will never see them perform live in concert again, we have DVDs like this to ensure that their memory lives on and on.

0142000671|5.0|The tension and pathos in John Steinbeck's \\"playable novel\\", \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is palpable. It tells the story of George Milton and Lennie Small, two itinerant field workers in 1930s depression era California. Milton, a cynical, intelligent man, by a combination of habit, intent, solicitude, friendship, love, loneliness and, one might even say, bad luck, has allowed himself to become the surrogate father or brother for his companion traveler, Lennie Small. Small, (undoubtedly a name chosen by Steinbeck for its irony) is a retarded adult with the social skills and gracelessness of a young child, trapped in the body of an enormous and physically powerful man.<br /><br />Forced to run away from their last job when Small was wrongfully accused of rape, Milton and Small have now found a quiet farm and a crew with which they hope they work long enough to accumulate a stake. They want to buy a small piece of property that they can farm for themselves. Lennie's sole childlike dream for retirement is to live with his friend George and \\"tend rabbits\\". But, once again, Small's complete lack of adult social skills and the failure to understand the magnitude of his own strength undermine their dreams when Curley, the owner's mean-spirited and small-minded son draws Small into a fight and his lonely wife uses her attractiveness and feminine wiles to draw him into a conversation that ends in tragedy.<br /><br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a short novella. At only 118 pages, it can be digested in a mere two to three hours. Written as a \\"playable novel\\", the story is told almost exclusively in dialogue with the intent that it would translate easily into a three act play. Such small bits of narrative and exposition as exist in the story actually serve more by way of stage directions and hints as to the scenery backdrop that might be used in the live stage production that Steinbeck envisaged when he wrote it.<br /><br />But for all its simplicity and brevity, the power and pathos of the themes of helplessness and loneliness embodied in Steinbeck's story are not to be denied. As with so many other classic novels that I've finally had the good sense to read over the last two years, I feel like I've not only come late to the party but all of the other party-goers have already come and gone. Well, I'm sure I wasn't the only one but if you're one of the few people who read and enjoy classic literature in the English language, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" deserves a place on your must-read list.

As with so many other classic novels that I've finally had the good sense to read over the last two years, I feel like I've not only come late to the party but all of the other party-goers have already come and gone.

B00005T7I1|3.0|Here is how I would have produced Dick Tracy: First of all, I would fire Warren Beatty. He just isn't right for the role. Before the film was released there was a big publicity push which showed Dick Tracy in silhouette, and his chin was not the sharp, jutting chisel of Dick Tracy, but the chinless wonder or Mr. Beatty. When all of the other actors were in heavy make up, why not a prosthetic chin for Warren, too? Warren Beatty is too handsome to play Tracy, and too vain to ugly up for the role. His vanity prevented him from obscuring his vaunted Hollywood leading man profile.<br /><br />Bulworth, Bugsy, George Roundy in Shampoo, Clyde Barrow or Mickey One. All great roles that fit Beatty like a glove. He was great as Milton Armitage on \\"The Many Loves of Doby Gillis.\\" But Dick Beatty, Warren Tracy? No thanks.<br /><br />Beatty was not believable as an inarticulate though loyal boyfriend, either. There was a bit of a triangle with Tess, Breathless, and Tracy, but it sure didn't work. Beatty was not believable paired with either corner of the triangle, and Madonna was neither attractive nor believable as Breathless Mahoney. Wasn't there a documentary about Madonna on tour where Beatty was kind of having an affair with her but it wasn't working so well there in RL, either. Truth, or Dare?<br /><br />I would dump Warren and hire James Woods to play Tracy. Problem solved. By a fortuitous bit of serendipity I watched James Woods in \\"Cop\\" right after watching \\"Dick Tracy.\\" Cop was grittier, less cartoonish, but essentially it shared the same plot as Dick Tracy. Woods already has an angular Tracyesque face, and with just a little bit of make up, the spitting image.<br /><br />Now that James Wood is in place, you might find my next move controversial, but I would fire Glenne Headly, even though she was a good Tess Trueheart, and rehire Sean Young. Though she and Woods had their differences in the past, they were great together in The Boost. If they could work out their mutual restraining orders, it would be box office dynamite! Channel all of that tension between them onto the screen. Sean Young was originally supposed to play Tess Trueheart anyway but was fired. Not maternal enough, they said. Or was it casting couch retaliation by director Beatty? Glenne Headly had good rapport with \\"The Kid\\" but she wasn't so maternal, either. She called him the eating machine, and threatened to break his arm when he stole the tip. So the excuse that Sean Young wasn't maternal enough rings very hollow.<br /><br />With Warren out of the way and the dynamic team of Wood & Young reunited, Madonna would be the next one to go. Madonna was really miscast. Bad acting, as usual. She was very unattractive, fragile looking, with frizzed out blonde hair and lots of pale make up. At one point she climbed on a table and stuck her bottom in the air like a cat on a hot tin roof, in Tracy's face--which betrayed a sense that something just didn't smell right. Just weird, not sexy, Madge. Desperately Seeking Susan seems to be her only movie success. Bomb after bomb, and meanwhile Sean Penn has two Oscars (for Mystic River and Milk; and three Oscar nominations for Sweet and Low Down, I Am Sam, and Dead Man Walking). Shanghai Surprise his only misfire, and whose fault was that?<br /><br />Bernadette Peters is the only choice to play Breathless Mahoney. Bernadette is well versed in Sondheim (Into the Woods), and can be very sexy, funny, and musical simultaneously. Check her in Steve Martin's The Jerk if you want proof. Stephen Sondheim did some songs for Dick Tracy, but then Madonna had to go and sing them. Danny Elfman did the musical score.<br /><br />Mandy Patinkin didn't work as 88 Keys, the piano player. He sang one of the Sondheim songs in a high, effeminate voice. He is a good singer with a strong musical theater background, but his character, 88 Keys, didn't work as either the piano player or an extortionist, IMHO.<br /><br />Instead of Mandy Patinkin, how abouta totally different direction with Tom Waits? Sure, his voice is gravelly, but he can sing just as well as Patinkin, and he would be infinitely more believable as a black mailer. Have you heard him do \\"There's a Place for Us\\" from West Side Story? That is Sondheim, too, and in spite of the gravelly tone, he hits the pitches, and brings out the beauty in the tune.<br /><br />Al Pacino was really chewing up the scenery. Annoying, but funny sometimes. He was always giving out quotes that were obviously wrong. When he rehearsed Breathless Mahoney in her musical number it was funny, because he was so unmusical, yet he fancied himself a maestro. He told her how to sing, and inserted himself in the song, and it was just kind of funny, how unmusical people think they know it all. Simon Cowell? However, he should have held back a little, left 'em wanting more. Restraint is not Pacino's forte.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman was great as Mumbles. Even though the rest of the movie was kind of a shambles, Mumbles was quite an achievement. You could say he was just mumbling, and any fool could have done it, but he really brought a lot of character to his character.<br /><br />The Kid (Charlie Korsmo) did good, but what a bunch of tired clich&eacute;s he had to say. Catch him in \\"Hook\\" or better yet, as a young teen in Can't Hardly Wait.<br /><br />The scene where Dick Tracy beat up the tough old man who abused the kid was great, with the tough old guy really grizzled and scary. He is hitting him and then there is a long shot where you see the walls of the shack tilting, and the whole shack collapses. That was a great visualization of the comic strip world of Dick Tracy. But it wasn't followed through.<br /><br />Good art direction and they created a comic strip world, but Beatty, the director, just didn't know what to do with it. They used a color palette of mostly primary colors, like you would see in the Sunday Funnies of a newspaper. Edward Scissorhands used a similar color scheme, of pastels, the set the scene of bland suburban conformity. Tim Burton, in Edward Scissorhands or Batman, knows how to tell stories in a visual way. Beatty, clearly, does not. I like all the hoods, like Prune Face, Flat Top, and Little Face. Great make up and it is to be commended. But a weak story and poor understanding of how to work with strong visual elements doomed Dick Tracy, The Movie.<br /><br />For director, fire Warren Beatty--again--and hire either Tim Burton or Terry Gilliam. Not only do they both share a strong visual sense, but they have a strong  sense of how to best use visual elements in the service of the story. Batman, Brazil, The Fisher King, Edward Scissorhands.<br /><br />Quick recap: Fire Warren Beatty, as actor and director. Hire James Wood as Dick Tracy and Tim Burton or Terry Gilliam as director. Fire Madonna, cast Bernadette as Breathless. Dump Glenne Headly just to get that dramatic tension between Wood and Sean Young. Have Pacino dial it back a notch, and leave Hoffman's Mumbles exactly the same. Mandy Patinkin: Out. Tom Waits: In. The Kid stays in the picture.<br /><br />Sidebar: [Wrist band radios sure are annoying. There is a scene where Tracy was at the opera and he got a call on his wrist band radio. Kind of funny, what with the proliferation of cell phones and how annoying they have become. Tracy was the prototype for the 'loud cell phone talker' of the early part of the 21st Century].<br /><br />Bottom line is that Dick Tracy was one of Warren Beatty's most commercially successful films and it won Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration for Richard Sylbert and Rick Simpson; Best Makeup for John Caglione Jr. and Doug Drexler; Best Music, Original Song for Stephen Sondheim for the song \\"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)\\"; and was nominated for Oscars for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Al Pacino; Best Cinematography for Vittorio Storaro; Best Costume Design for Milena Canonero; and for Best Sound for Thomas Causey, Chris Jenkins, David E.

B00278U1W0|5.0|When Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood coraborated on this project they really did it right.  As a long standing fan of both artists, I knew without listening that it was going to be an excelent disk!  I was correct there wasn't a single song that disappionts.  Eric Clapton a tasteful \\"lord of the strings\\" has been undergoing a  major trans-formation of sorts.  I will explain my thoughts by saying that I have followed him from pre bluesbreakers all the way to the present.  I have always loved the blues and blues guitar because it allows the artist with the chops and taste to reveal the feeling of the music as related to \\"lifesong\\".  The cry of ecxtasy, the the triumph of love, the soulful keen of love lost, the remorse of love betrayed and  finally sweet revenge and retribution.  When a peformer of Clapton's  ability learns the importance of portraying the \\"lifessong\\" of the music you get something very rare indeed!  I always been a fan of Steve Winwood his contribution to this project is no less important.  Perfection no not quite but close cudos to both performers! Additionally it seemed that the perform-ers were enjoying playing together almost as much as I was enjoying hearing them play together was refreashing.  In our world of anything and everything for a buck it was refreshing to see that money wasn't the only issue in doing this project. Oh and by the way my email is: dblues@opton line.net I chose that email name because i am and will probibly always be a blues afectionado!
0670021652|5.0|I love her writing - and her honesty. Marriage has changed so very much in the last few decades, that those of us even thinking of commitment have a whole new world to contemplate. The old rules we learned don't work any more - we have a different set of expectations, a more straightforward look at the reality of two people getting together.<br /><br />The honest look she has taken at marriage has generated some ideas and considerations that are very, very helpful!<br /><br />I was impressed even more by this book than by Eat, Pray, Love.
B002W1HBN4|4.0|To be honest, I really don't hear anything \\"remastered\\" about the CD. I was just anxious to hear \\"My Whitney\\" again. The extra dance versions of the songs are okay. The acappella version of \\"How Will I Know\\" really showcases her voice. The $14.99 that I paid for the CD/DVD is completely worth it for the live version of Whitney singing \\"I am Changing\\". Simply priceless!

3527406018|5.0|Doing physics homework is rarely truly fun, but a good textbook can at least reduce the stress and confusion/frustration levels associated with working problems and learning material.  This book is basically what I said in the title:  Helpful, clear, and readable, which are three things that are essential in any informational book yet sadly lacking in so many physics textbooks.  Excellent book.  Also, there are amusing footnotes sprinkled throughout the text, including some anecdotes/commentaries on physics pillars such as Niels Bohr.

B002ZG98JG|2.0|I am a GIANT fan of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, and my friends and I were waiting with bated breath for the movie to come out.  I'll admit I had high expectations (after all, Chris Columbus did a FABULOUS job with Harry Potter) and they were totally dashed.  If one hadn't read the books, the movie would rate a solid 3.5.  Not amazing, but not total garbage either.  After reading the books however, this movie failed.  On so many levels.  I'm not going to bother explaining all the things they changed (that would take far too long!) but in general, it just didn't work.  It seems as if the people behind this movie skimmed the dust jacket and decided to create their \\"own version\\" of what happened.  It was just off.  The casting (although I did love Grover), the character of Annabeth seemed like a bad Clarisse-Annabeth hybrid, and Logan Lerman as Percy was hot as hell, but the character was so different from the book, as were all the others.  An okay movie, but for anyone who has read the book, a complete disappointment.

B002RVZV9U|3.0|Being a huge Led Zeppelin fan from day one (early '69 in college), I was anxious to see Page again. I'm not a big U-2 fan and I was not even familiar with Jack White.    This is a fun DVD, with excellent video and sound, but I was hoping for a little more playing and a little less talking. Don't get me wrong, I'm a rock music history adict and this has chunks of that but I was looking for a little more balance towards the playing side.    I don't think this DVD is for everyone. It's not a concert. You really can't put it on and go about your business and listen around the house. To get anything out of it, it's something you really need to sit down and focus on.    So check it out if you like the players, but I'm guessing you won't be watching it over and over again.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|The Dark Knight is about the Joker and his attempts to prove that hate, anarchy, selfishness and evil is more powerful than good in Gotham City.  I've never been a huge fan of this movie and it's taken me this long to figure out why: the film is a complete downer - which is actually fine - but it's just not entertaining enough to offset its bleakness.  Heath Ledger and his amazing performance IS the movie, and that's kindof the problem.  He's got all the best lines, the best makeup, the best clothes, all the comic relief - everything.  But he's also an evil rotten murderer.  But since no one else in the cast even registers, Ledger and his performace outshines everyone and you end up rooting for him!  After I watch this film I literally feel filthy.  Now, the premise of the flick is sound, and the telling of the story is competent but this movie could have been SO much better and so much more entertaining if they'd cast Viggo Mortensen as the Batman.  Christian Bale is just a cipher: he registers as nothing more than an entity.. a justification, sounding board or counterpoint to the Joker's evil. If the filmmakers would have had the sense to cast Viggo Mortensen as Batman everything would have fallen into place.<br />Think about it: you can see Mortensen as an anti-hero.  He's got the jaw for it; the eyes and the teeth..  If you don't believe me watch the movie A History of Violence and check out the look on his (Mortensen's) face right after his son shotguns Ed Harris's character in the back.  Youtube it right now.  See what I mean?  You can see Mortensen's Dark Knight accidentally killing a bad guy and then going out, getting drunk and puking on his Lamborghini.  Remember that police station interrogation scene?  Where Christian Bale irritates us all by growling and yelling?  Great scene for Joker..  But put Mortensen in the Batman role; You can see his Batman pulling out a butterfly bat-knife and after a mettalic flourish stabbing it into that desk and talking to Joker about removing fingers and perforating nostrils.  I'd like to see Joker go on about 'just want(ing) to make a phone call' after the loss of a digit or two.<br />With a script built around Mortensen as Batman this film would have been so much better! Everything would have been different: The first time we saw Luscious Fox he wouldn't have been going on about the batsuit or whatever.. He might have been giving Bruce Wayne a tattoo.  Maybe a tattoo of Scarecrow - his most recent caught villain.  At that dinner party with Harvey Dent, Bruce wouldn't have shown up with a bunch of blond headed supermodels in evening gowns, he probably have shown up with 3 or 4 brunette and red-headed whores dressed in mild s&m gear smoking cigarettes and pulling pit-bulls on leather leashes.  Furthermore, the Batpod would have been chromed out and had a smoke screen.  And finally, much as I love Michael Caine, if you cast Mortensen as Batman, Caine would be out and you know who would play Alfred?  Peter O'toole.  A man who was filthy nasty dark down and dirty before most of the rest of the cast was even born.  THAT'S the Dark Knight I would have liked to see.<br />Christian Bale's Batman was always going on about how Harvey Dent was the best one out of all three of them (Dent, Batman and Comm Gordon); I never understood that because in this movie Batman wasn't dark at all.  He pouted alot and growled alot but far as I could tell he was as good and pure a superhero as Gotham City could have asked for.  Bale's Dark Knight wasn't dark at all.  He was too pretty, to clean cut.. too boring to come across as the anti-hero.  For me that's the film's biggest flaw.<br />2 stars.r about removing fingers and perforating nostrils.

B0001KZM3O|3.0|You have the early Floyd stuff - which shows some flashes of brilliance, but hardly foreshdadows the greatness of latter Floyd. Then the game changed with Dark Side of the Moon (although you can see some nice stuff on Obscured by Clouds right before DSotM). From Dark Side of the Moon until Animals, Floyd wrote long meandering musical numbers, driven by heavy keyboard/effects and interspersed with airy, but darkly poetic vocals. Wish You Were Here and Animals had 10 songs between them. Then The Wall came along and changed the game again - Waters took over Floyd. These were short lyric dependent songs - 26 or so on the album. Gone were the long, meandering keyboard and guitar ramblings. The problem with the Wall (although I consider it a good album) is that it was almost like a broadway play - the story (spectacle really) was more important the music. There was still plenty of keyboards but it was rather bland piano based playing, quite different from the effect based, inventive keyboard of the earlier albums. Waters changed his voice too, instead of the airy, edgy voice from the past he half talked, half sung a lot of the songs. The effect, imo, is that he ended up sounding whiny in a lot of cases. Subtlety was gone and his anti-war rants basically knocked you over the head. Gilmour still had some of the old Floyd on display in Comfortably Numb but it was a minor peice in Water's opus. The reason I haven't mentioned The Final Cut yet is because it was basically a continuation of the Wall. If you liked the Wall, you'll probably like the Final Cut. I miss the old Floyd, which wasn't regained in the later Gilmore albums (although he tried admirably - he lacked the genius and driving poetry of Waters).     The Final Cut has 12 songs (13 in the reissue which I don't have). The first 10 make a cohesive anti-war polemic, but the final two (not now john and two suns in the sunset) don't fit in the album at all.  Pros-Clever lyrics and imaginative effects. The music is complex.  Cons-Water's half-talking, half-singing vocals. Pretentious, unsubtle lyrics. An emphasis on lyrics over music.     Like the Wall, it could be considered a work of art, however, its lacking the one important part of great art - beauty.

B00003CWLF|5.0|Anna and the King is a beautiful, captivating story that is surprisingly only remotely similar to the musical \\"The King and I\\".

Certainly one of TV's best.
B002Z8LPZ4|4.0|While this is far from a perfect film, it is a very competently managed thriller.    The weaknesses in the story come from the narrative itself. Much (though not all) of the \\"whodunit\\" aspects are fairly predictable.    However, stories like this are less about the story and more about the mood, atmosphere and scene. This is a point that Raymond Chandler made in his essays on detective fiction. (Chandler, if you don't know -- and, if you don't know, then you really need to take yourself out behind the woodshed and give yourself a substantial smacking -- Chandler was one of the best writers of detective stories ever; but even beyond that, he was a substantially better essayist on the genre.)    So the real interest of this film is seeing a fairly ordinary detective story transplanted to such an inhospitable scene as the South Pole. Quite aside from the really disturbing possibilities this opens up and explores, this also touches (albeit, only *touches*) on some interesting existential themes as well. Such themes are \\"meat and potatos\\" of the genre, which this setting allows to come out quite beyond the surfaces of the story telling itself.    Altogether, an interesting piece to watch.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers is a great strategy game geared for a wide audience.  The pieces and board were made to be durable and every match is always different due to the different land tiles and different number placings.  I'd say the game is a mix between Risk and Monopoly.

I have listened to it several times thinking it will click with me but that just hasn't happened yet.      *I have been listening to it a lot lately and I am starting to like some of the songs.  There are still a couple that I skip over but I increased my rating to three stars.  I still like the first CD better.

0312330871|5.0|And Then There Were None is a fiction novel that will take a reader to the highest point of intrigue of any mystery book.  This book has become one of the best mystery books every written and I cannot disagree.<br />  Agatha Christie changed the world of literature by writing this book.  She uses an ingenious style of writing which can be easily recognized by any reader.  Being a high school student, I did not understand or respect the brilliance and detailed writing of the author.  My whole view of literature has changed because of this book and I now understand how clever an author, Agatha Christie, has to be in order to write a book that is at the top of its genre.<br />Christie manipulates the reader's thoughts and opinions by continuously changing the pace of the story.  No book will mess with your head more than And Then There Were None.  Each character is described with such great detail and each scene is so perfectly planned out.  Reading this book gives people the full mystery effect and readers will not be disappointed.  Though the book is written beautifully it can be a bit far fetched at times.  Ten different guests each agree to attend a random vacation on an unknown island; very unlikely but then again a reader must never put it out of question!<br />This mystery novel overlooked the topic of a serial killer long before the serial killer was even known.  Agatha Christie is ahead of her time and you can see the effects of her book on many authors nowadays.  And Then There Were None was the platform from which many other great books have taken off.
B002SJIO5E|3.0|The acting was amateur and the attempt to look like a documentary was distracting.  There were a few good moments.

B00005B4ND|1.0|I am totally unhappy with my purchase due to the fact I did not know what a region 2 dvd meant.  Nobody I know as a matter of fact knew either.  This should not be allowed to be sold in the U.S.  It was a used dvd, on top of that, and I can send it back but it will probably cost me as much to send it back as it did to purchase the movie.  It should be clearly stated what region 1,2 ect. means. I would not have ordered it if I had known it can only be played on European dvd's. I am disappointed and feel mislead.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I confess, before buying this album I thought of Paramore as basically being \\"the band that did some songs for the \\"Twilight\\" soundtrack.  I was not a fan, but I thought the video for \\"Ignorance\\" was interesting, and I liked the song.<br /><br />Truth be told, I would not have purchased Brand New Eyes except that I received a gift card for Christmas and bought it on a whim.  I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Every song is full of hooks, easily memorable, and some even have some very poignant lyrics.<br /><br />Frankly, since buying this album I've heard Paramore's other works and the songs...er...kind of all sound the same on their previous albums.<br /><br />But Brand New Eyes is different.  I rank it one of the best albums I've heard in the last few years.  Not only do the songs not all sound alike, for some reason I detect a huge leap in writing ability between this and the previous album Riot.<br /><br />Die-hard fans may (or may not) wince at the fact that this record has a couple more slow songs than previous efforts.  Let the slow songs draw  you in.  I discussed them with a longtime Paramore fan, and after playing the album for several weeks he agrees that the slow songs are some of the best on the album.<br /><br />The hard-rocking songs, of course, are probably what drew you to the album in the first place, and the ones on this album are more \\"pop\\" than previous efforts.  Judge the harder rocking songs by \\"Brick by Boring Brick,\\" not by \\"Ignorance.\\"  \\"Ignorance\\" is probably the only song that sounds like it could have been recorded for a previous Paramore album.<br /><br />All in all, Brand New Eyes is fantastic and I swear it gets better every time I hear it.

B0030BOCEG|5.0|This is an amazing album. It's a little different from what we're used to hearing from HIM since this album seems to be influenced by music of the 80s making good use of the keyboard and synthesizer but it still maintains that great unique sound and emotion we're accustomed to hearing in HIM songs. In the lyrics, there are quite a few references to the bible as well as Greek mythology which makes for intriguing lyrics. Overall, this album is fantastic.
0470477237|5.0|The gist of this book is that, thanks to social media and the new ways in which we use the internet, even the basic web2.0 theory goes out the window.

0123694965|5.0|So, I'm not a professional game designer whatsoever, actually I'm on the business/finance end of a small company.  I've always had a curiosity with game development, however, and had an idea for a game.  I asked a close friend of mine to join me in making this idea become a reality but we weren't sure where we should start.  While I have a very basic understanding of programming (from my youth) and how things should be structured (again very basic), we knew we didn't want a technical book - we already had a couple software engineers for that.  What we really needed was a resource that would help us avoid some of the typical mistakes/pitfalls that novice designers tend to make.  What would be even better is to find a book that would give us the tools and perspective from a philosophical vantage as well as explain 'why'.<br /><br />The Art of Game Design: A book of lenses is exactly what we needed.<br /><br />This book is not technical, it doesn't get into the specific details of how a game should be structured or coded.  Rather it explains the different facets of the design process and how they fit together, starting with the Designer and the experience the Designer creates.  From there it flows into what makes a great game, such as what should the interface include, how about including puzzles, interest curves, transmedia worlds to name just a few.<br /><br />The final few chapters deal with the management and financial pieces of the game development process, which was also very interesting to learn about.  I think the parts that I enjoyed most were the ones about the psychology of game playing and what the player feels during gameplay.  This is really what gaming is all about, how you feel and what the experience is while you're playing and even after you've completed the game.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very complete book and I would recommend it to everyone who wants to really understand the process of designing games.  It was funny, after reading the book, many of the principles explained can not only be applied to game design but to other real world situations and interactions with others.<br /><br />And just to say it, I very rarely give five stars but this book deserves each one.an not only be applied to game design but to other real world situations and interactions with others.    And just to say it, I very rarely give five stars but this book deserves each one.
B001FB55H6|5.0|The movie pulls you in right away and doesn't let go.  It builds on the turmoil that the characters or their heirs are having to contend with in their later years and how society is handling their relevance.  All in all, it is a very good movie that will hold your interest throughout.  This is a dark story for adults about how a system of checks and balances for the superheroes has gone bad.  That is why this movie is not for younger viewers.<br /><br />Nothing is glossed over, the entire show is in graphic detail and the Blu-Ray makes it awesome.
B001GM28HO|5.0|There rarely comes a new artist that you just know will take the genre down a different path, and Lady GaGa is one of those artists.  This CD is fresh, fun, and entertaining to say the least.  When I put this CD in, I have to listen to every song, which is very rare when it comes to a CD. I love this new sound.
B002VKE1K2|2.0|This movie was just okay.  Both characters started to annoy me.  The girl should have ousted her boyfriend sooner for being such a douche and making things worse.  Also, I would have ran to a catholic church after seeing the demon footprints.  I especially would have ran directly to a catholic church after being dragged out of bed and bitten by a demon.  What I would NOT have done is continue listening to my douche boyfriend and letting him try to solve the problem via Google searches.  I also would NOT have burned a cross assuming that would scare the demon away.

I am disappointed with this version of the film. They should have done never before seen extended scenes.
B0018BB20W|5.0|For many rock/pop fans Days Of Future Passed was the first concept album when it was released in November 1967.  It predated Tommy by The Who by 2 years and Pink Floyd's work The Dark Side Of The Moon, Animals, Wish You Were Here and The Wall did not arrive until the 1970's.  Fans of Johnny Cash could cite Ride This Train from the early 1960's, but that is another story.  I doubt if the mixture of classical and rock music has ever worked so well, although followers of Deep Purple and others may disagree.  This remaster from 2008 is exceptional in its sound quality and offers some interesting bonus tracks.  Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood is sung in a rythmn and blues style and of the other 5 additonal songs (which are in mono) I like Fly Me High for the vocal harmonies and Cities for it's descripitive narrative of city life.  Finally there are 4 alternate takes from the original album, but they don't hold my interest.  All the same this is a masterpiece of 1960's music which should be enjoyed over and over again.

It has been done thousand times better in the past (CAPTAIN BEYOND, SIR LORD BALTIMORE, BLUE CHEER, GRAVE, BUDGIE, BUFFALO, HACKENSACK, MEGATON, MADHASH, INCREDIBLE HOG, MOUNTAIN, ORANG-UTAN... the list is endless!).    If you need great, devastating, authentic 70ies sounding heavy rock, better look for ORANGE SUNSHINE, DZENGHIS KHAN, SIENA ROOT, GRAVEYARD, LORD 13, WITCHCRAFT or HORISONT. This polished, somewhat forced effort should be your 2nd or 3rd priority.

B000001GQQ|5.0|While she may be accused of being a speed demon, Argerich is in her element with all these composers. The sound is precise, deliberate, and quite exuberant.<br /><br />The album starts with the spirited celerity of Prokofiev's 3rd concerto, first movement. Argerich is swift as the wind, but everyone keeps together and the piece manages to stay exciting without feeling rushed or unnecessarily blurred. The second movement is paced and sensibly performed with the perfect bursts of atonal frenzy coupled with gorgeous melodies that make Prokefiev's pieces so mesmerizing. The third movement is simply a masterpiece of perfection that makes the listener wonder if there's really any other way to play it. Argerich renders such difficult passages so easily, and nails the ending with unimaginable control. Her strokes on the keys are almost unworldly and truly something to behold.<br /><br />The Ravel piano concerto is nicely played as well though its as much a show of the orchestra as it is for the piano. The orchestra rolls with the watery phrases of Ravel while Argerich does a superb job respecting and working with the instrumentalists. This coordination comes out especially in the second movement where the listener is taken away by the serene yet exquisite accompaniment that the piano does with one of the wind instruments that echoes the original theme. The last movement maintains the circus-like tones of the piece with scrutiny without any overexertion on the pianist. Perhaps, it could've been taken slower, but it doesn't suffer at all from a faster treatment.<br /><br />The Gaspard and other pieces of Ravel are flawless. Even Marta's critics cannot deny she plays the Gaspard de la Nuit impeccably. The other two pieces carry a gravity that should prove a deep sensibility that's often obscured in dazzling technical prowess. Le Gibet is probably the most moving piece on the album along with the third movement of the Prokofiev.<br /><br />Overall, this whole album is a thoroughly enjoyable collection of beautiful piano pieces played with care from a master, leaving any music lover with sweet satisfaction.

B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|IT's a movie... and Bruce Willis makes it work.  Without him, this movie is just ok.  The effects and storyline are good.

Probably not, but another very watchable movie with Bruce Willis carrying us along for a serial ride.  It's a good, what if?//  movie.  What if you could live through a robot surrogate?  Hmmm.

0393075966|4.0|Rather than write an extended review discussing the details of \\"Freefall\\" I think it would be more useful to briefly summarize the scope of the book and its strengths and weaknesses.    SCOPE:  First, Stiglitz traces the roots of the financial crisis of 2008-2009 to specific practices within the financial services industry.  Second, he criticizes the goverment for creating a system of corporate welfare where private banks and insurers were given billions of taxpayer dollars with few strings attached.  Finally, he makes the argument for greater regulation of the financial servcies industry to prevent future financial crises.    STRENGTHS:  Stiglitz makes it very hard for anyone to argue that financial markets can be left to regulate themselves.  In a world where mortgage lenders make their profit on transaction fees and default risk is passed on to others via securitization there will always be an incentive for lenders to make risky loans to unqualified borrowers.  In a world where bond rating agencies are paid by the underwriters whose bonds they are rating there will always be an incentive for ratings agencies to inflate credit ratings.  In a world where the rewards of risk taking are enjoyed by management while the losses of risk taking are absorbed by shareholders there will always be incentives for bank executives to gamble with shareholder (and now taxpayer) money.  Stiglitz makes the case that as long as these perverse incentives exist there will be a need to some form of public oversight to mitigate these risks, especially now that so many financial institutions have accepted public bailout money.  Free-market apologists have always argued that the market will impose its own discipline without the need for government regulation but Stiglitz exposes the variables (what he calls \\"externalities\\") that make market self-policing all but impossible in the real world.    WEAKNESS:  There is only one weakness with this book but it's a big one.  Stiglitz covers a lotof ground but doesn't do a good job of pulling these ideas together into a cohesive narrative.  Put more bluntly, his writing style sucks.  He bounces around from one topic to the next and while he is spot on with his analysis he is all over the place.  Instead of a clearly flowing book this is more of a collection of separate insights that are poorly connected to each other.  The result is an outstanding book full of excellent content that unfortunately drags on without a clear direction, it's definitely not a page-turner.  I think this book would have been more effective as a collection of stand-alone essays rather than this attempt to force a bunch of disparate ideas together.      SUMMARY:  Good book, definitely worth reading as you will learn a lot.  However, this isn't one of those books that you can't put down.  At times it's a long slog, especially towards the end.  Still, I highly recommend it to anyone with any interest in economics or current events.

You remember concepts of things (mom, school, friends, etc.), but no specific names, faces or memories.<br /><br />You don't know how old you are, either, but you do know one thing: your name.<br /><br />The metallic room lurches upward, accompanied by the grinding, clanking, grating sounds of pulleys and gears. The smell of burnt oil assaults your nose, inciting waves of nausea. You pound on the steel doors, but there's no way out. The box continues to ascend...and then stops.<br /><br />The top opens and dozens of arms reach down to lift you out. It's bright and you're surrounded by strangers, all boys.<br /><br />Welcome to your new life. Welcome to The Glade.<br /><br />To reveal more than this about the absorbing Young Adult novel The Maze Runner by James Dashner would be giving away too much and doing the book/author a great disservice, in my opinion. The intrigue, action and surprises speed along, the characters well drawn, believable, and the \\"oh my God!\\" ending making an already excellent novel one of the best I've ever read (yes, it's that good!).<br /><br />However, just as a book like Lord of the Flies can be enjoyed by those of all ages, so, too, can The Maze Runner (i.e. if you're over 30, don't be put off by the fact that this book is designated YA or that it features boys).<br /><br />If you're bothered by violence against children, though, you may want to weigh that predisposition against reading/owning this book (for example, my husband loved the book up until ¾ through for this reason, swearing that he wouldn't read the rest of the series--which surprised me, actually). Although I am, indeed bothered by violence against children in real life, it doesn't bother me in a fantasy novel--especially since the readers really can't be sure what has really happened until the end of the series (I'm guessing).<br /><br />Teeming with high-tech, horrifying monsters, resourceful kids and several mysteries (Who are the Creators? What is the purpose of the Glade? The moving maze? Why can one-kid a month arrive in the metal box but no one can descend from where it came?

B000E5N6LG|5.0|Kevin Costner does a good job as Wyatt Earp.  According to historical records, Wyatt was fearless and humorless.  He also does a good job of aging through the film.    A minor problem with this film is that there are photographs from the 1880s of the Clantons and the Lowerys, and the actors in this film look nothing like these guys.  If the historical character was fat, why make him skinny in the film?  There are other historical inaccuracies in the film but not so gross as to ruin the entertainment value.    This is a movie for lovers of Westerns, and the Wyatt Earp saga.

This is a good book however, and it coaches people into seeing how the rich tend to view their financial assets which the poor and middle class do not.  It is a coaching book only and not a get rich quick scheme.  There was one reviewer who wrote that starting a corporation is difficult or nearly impossible for the average person.  What I have to say is you still don't see how the rich view corporations.  I believe that Kiyosaki is sincere and wants to guide people into realizing their financial destinies.
0670021652|2.0|I was looking forward to read another book by Elizabeth Gilbert and was somewhat let down.  Don't get me wrong' this is not a bad book per se.  It is just an incredible boring one.  It talks about marriage through the ages and it just goes on and on about some psychosis of having cold feet about re-marrying.  Sure, I get it, Elizabeth had a very bad experience in love before.  But unlike her previous book EPL, where she just dove into the depths of her soul, this time around, she just skims the surface choosing instead to give you a glimpse of how marriage has evolved.  It felt somewhat impersonal.

However, I don't care for the 'graphic' element of this novel. The black-and-white images just didn't capture my imagination. This was about the story, the writing--for me.
0380730405|2.0|This book was written in 1938 so it seems very long winded for today's standards.  The suspense is there and it holds your attention but at the same time, I just wanted the author to get on with the story already.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|I'm a bass player by trade and I already have a tuner I use on stage, I bought this for a little guitar rig I was assembling to play at home, or for friends to play.  It tunes pretty accurately, and the LEDs are nice and bright, especially the blue \\"in tune\\" light.  I don't think anyone would have any problems seeing that, even if you were playing outside.<br /><br />If you are the kind of guy that throws your pedal down stairs, spring for the Boss tuner.  This is plastic, and I wouldn't expect it to stand up to tons of abuse.  That said, I have another Behringer pedal of the same construction that I use on stage, and it has been fine.  I keep my pedals in an enclosed pedal case, and that's the only way I transport them.<br /><br />If it broke really soon, I'd probably just get a higher quality pedal, but if it lasts a year or two, I'd probably get a new one.  For what I'm using it for it does a great job, and it didn't cost me $100.
0452284937|5.0|This book is a gem, like any and all of Tracy's novels, it is superbly well written and carefully researched.  The characters are engaging and the story compelling.  You will be instantly transported in time.  Are you ready to spend a few hours with Vermeer?  Well, just step inside...
B001RQ0SJO|4.0|Being a fan of prog rock and heavy metal I have a soft spot for female artist who know how to write and perform songs as if they were singing them to me. Through the years I have collected such artist like Berlin, Heart, Tori Amos, Sarah Mclachlin, Dido, A Fine Frenzy, and now Bat for Lashes. If you like those bands and are into good songs and great production give \\"Bat for Lashes\\" a try.
0385340540|4.0|Grisham has such a way of creating believable, 3 dimensional characters and telling us about their lives and surroundings.  Joel is not the most likable guy, but he is involved in an interesting tale.  And how can you beat Italy as a setting?  I could not wait to finish this one - and it only took me 2 days to do so.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Today is my second day and I'm definitely feeling it!     I'm overweight by 100 pounds and with a history of illnesses/diseases through my family (depression, diabetes, overweight, cancer, epilepsy, etc), I want to get healthy. I'm on 15mg of phentermine and it's doing wonders of my appetite control and I'm eating at exactly 1200 calories a day, if not a little over. But what's a pill going to do if I don't watch what I eat AND put exercise into my life? I can definitely take just 20 minutes out of my day to do it.    I used to do P90X but I missed three days and it threw me off so I stopped. Outside of P90X, I do \\"Just Dance\\"wii, \\"DDR\\"xbox ps2, \\"Biggest Loser\\"wii, \\"Wii fit\\" wii. It has helped with a lot but.. GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLY..    One hour of p90X would leave me feeling nauseous* at the very end because it was so hardcore-ish. But only 20 minutes of Jillian Michaels leaves me nauseous* at the end! *Nauseous in the sense that my body is being worked out in a way that it hasn't been worked out before! The 3-2-1 method she uses is pretty brutal but boy do I feel it in my legs and DEFINITELY in my abs. When I lift my hands/arms to do anything, I definitely feel it too.    They have a girl doing modified moves and a girl doing advanced moves. One moment I can do the advanced moves but the second time around, my legs are on fire so I switch back and forth from the modified to the advanced.     As Tony Horton would say: \\"Quality versus Quantity\\". If you gotta take a break because your posture is slacking and not doing it right, take it so you can do it right.    And Jillian has levels. Levels 1, 2 and 3. Unless you are Jillian Michaels herself, please start at Level 1. Atleast look through the video. I'm expert on DDR and everything but being this is my second day, I wouldn't even THINK about going to Level 2 until I'm ready. I also bought Biggest Loser Yoga Workout as a big warm-up because that's definitely going to tone out and learn how to balance this body. Withdoing Jillian Michaels, I will lose my goal weight on time, if not a lot sooner than planned. And look pretty darn smoking hot too!    If you are looking for a good workout, this is DEFINITELY a good one.     You WILL need a mat and some light weights. I usually use 10 pound weights but I would recommend 3-5 pounds. Unless you want to take it up an extra notch.
B002Y5FKUE|4.0|I don't know, but when I indulge in opera, it's not for the scenery or the production.  (I didn't quite dig the recent, controversial staging of Tosca, but that's an extreme case.)    Here we have a clever comedienne (a very poised actress) and a tenor with a piercing, rewarding tone.  The story may be silly, but you have to love Donizetti.    Don't you love it when Dessay the orchestra wait while she puts her costume shoes on, right at the end?
1400067936|5.0|This is an insightful book written in a unique style that challenges superficial thinking about events that some may ascribe a cause and effect relationship but can be more simply seen as an event that is possible within `normal' variability. This is not a fast read. If you enjoy thinking, you will enjoy this book. I had to use a `big' dictionary to understand more fully some of the author's statements. I have a background in chemistry, physics and mathematics, professional experience in process and product design engineering and an amateur, limited but mostly successful experience in investing. My many years of these experiences and those of life are generally consistent with the author's assertions. I would also recommend \\"The Black Swan\\" written by the same author. (I bought copies of the Black Swan to give as gifts to thoughtful acquaintances.)

B002ZTIIXK|5.0|From 1987's \\"Angel With A Lariat,\\" k.d. lang's first American debut up to this very day when I just finished watching her singing \\"Hallelujah\\" at the XXI Olympic Opening Ceremony, I find myself (as you will be asking about your own personal favorites), where is \\"Pullin' Back The Reins\\" from \\"Absolute Torch And Twang?\\" Where is \\"Lock, Stock and Teardrops,\\" along with several other classics from \\"Shadowland?\\" The gorgeous \\"Still Thrives This Love\\" and \\"Save Me,\\" from \\"Ingenue\\" are nowhere to be found, as the astonishingly beautiful \\"Infinite and Unforeseen\\" and \\"If I Were You,\\" from \\"All You Can Eat\\" are sorely missing. Instead of the admittedly more dramatic \\"Theme From Valley of the Dolls\\" and \\"Till The Heart Caves In\\" from \\"Drag,\\" we get \\"Smoke Rings,\\" and \\"The Air That I Breathe,\\" the latter which proves that when Miss lang covers a song as in Dionne Warwick's \\"Theme From Valley of the Dolls\\" or the Hollies' \\"The Air That I Breathe,\\" both definitive versions, she makes them her very own on a par with the originals, a truly rare gift indeed. Unfortunately, there are also a few excellent but neglected tracks from 2000's \\"Invincible Summer,\\" 2004's \\"hymns of the 49th parallel,\\" and finally, her stunning return with 2008's \\"Watershed.\\" While \\"I Dream Of Spring\\" and \\"Thread\\" were included live on the bonus disc, as was the studio version of \\"I Dream Of Spring,\\" I found myself longing for \\"Coming Home\\" as well.<br /><br />The reason I mentioned all of those favorites is because the 2 discs have a LOT more room to accommodate at least some, if not all of my favorites above, or whichever yours might be. Disc 1 clocks in at a mere 47:14, and Disc 2 at 48:47.  That's another 63 MINUTES, or an entire CD of music! (If you include the third live bonus disc at 42:09, that's another 37 minutes, for potentially 100 MINUTES!)  I don't normally time CDs, but when another 63 to 100 MINUTES (!) of music could have been added to this already excellent set from one of my all-time favorite singers, it is hard not to question why many more of our favorites could have been added but were not. The inclusion of a new version of \\"Hallelujah,\\" with more orchestration was somewhat extraneous in my opinion, adding even potentially more time to Disc 2. Having said that, the songs on the discs in this collection ARE superb, and worth buying for the remastered tracks alone. I happen to have the 3-CD + DVD box set (please see my review), and have listened to all three discs over and over again already.  In my humble opinion, the remastered songs, live CD, DVD, booklet and very well thought out and elegant packaging all combine to make the box set the definite version of \\"Recollection\\" to own.<br /><br />There ARE a few gems to be found on these 2 CDs, such as \\"Golden Slumbers/The End,\\" from the 2006 movie \\"Happy Feet,\\" as well as Miss lang's contribution of \\"So In Love,\\" from the 1990 \\"Red Hot & Blue\\" AIDS benefit tribute to Cole Porter CD. k.d.'s gorgeous, ethereal duet with fellow Canadian Jane Siberry's \\"Calling All Angels\\" is here, which appeared on Jane's 1993 still amazing \\"When I Was A Boy\\" CD, as are k.d.'s reverent and beautifully done versions of Siberry's \\"The Valley\\" (on Disc 1), and \\"Love Is Everything\\" (on the DVD only), both from \\"hymns of the 49th parallel.\\" Obviously, I'm enamoured of Siberry's writing as Miss lang is. Speaking of writing, MAJOR kudos and props to Ben Mink, as her fellow lyricist and band member since her career began, as well as to the long-time collaborators in her band as well.<br /><br />There is also one new song on CD 2, \\"Beautifully Combined\\" (2:41), though brief in length, the lyrics (as usual), are excellent. There are also duets of k.d. with Tony Bennett on \\"Moonglow,\\" and her memorably famous duet with Roy Orbison on \\"Crying.\\" The first song, \\"You're The One\\" from Roy's 1992 \\"King of Hearts\\" album could easily have been included here, as it's practically a duet with Roy as well.<br /><br />The only two things I'm really disappointed about is that I've never been to one of Miss lang's concerts, and after hearing her sing \\"The Right To Love,\\" which ends the live CD and I'm sure (or would hope), is a concert staple for her, I am saddened that I will probably never get to hear those poignant lyrics and the incredible jazz piano accompaniment with her soaring and passionate vocals in person. The second is that Miss lang is one of the most deserving, finest artists/vocalists EVER, and truly deserves to have a more thorough, comprehensive and complete boxed set, with a lot more of her timeless, older material remastered (it's time... it HAS been over 20 years!), as well as more rarities, CD-single mixes and many guest vocals on other albums, soundtracks and compilations she has done. It would be spectacular to have all of those remastered in one boxed set, wouldn't it?<br /><br />Some of these include \\"A Kiss To Build A Dream On,\\" from the 2005 compilation \\"Timeless\\"; her duets with Tony Bennett, \\"What A Wonderful World\\" and \\"Dream A Little Dream Of Me,\\" from their 2002 duet album of the same name, and two personal favorites, Carter Burwell conducting an achingly beautiful intro and accompaniment to Miss lang's superb version of \\"Secret Love,\\" (never before released on any CD, from the end credits of the outstanding 2001 DVD documentary, \\"The Celluloid Closet\\"), the other being her heavenly duet on the title track of Bruce Roberts' 1995 CD, \\"Intimacy,\\" to name only a few more. I'm aware that in some cases there are licensing issues, but in ANY case, the fans suffer, as we would gladly buy an extended, complete boxed-set containing all of the above and more.<br /><br />While I will admit this technically IS an excellent 2-CD set, it would have been great to see \\"Recollections\\" reach the full potential this collection was truly capable of. And that's a compliment of the highest order. That, along with the extensive variety of songs in Miss lang's repertoire, and those yet to come, combined with each new (single CD) release of hers :-) , all prove where she is concerned, it just doesn't get any better. To bring so much joy to so many with the power or subtlety of a lyric, sometimes both in one, is truly an amazing gift.<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, I'll be waiting patiently to hopefully be the first of k.d. lang's countless fans to own a copy of that COMPLETE boxed set! :-)I've never been to one of Miss lang's concerts, and after hearing her sing \\"The Right To Love,\\" which ends the live CD and I'm sure (or would hope), is a concert staple for her, I am saddened that I will probably never get to hear those poignant lyrics and the incredible jazz piano accompaniment with her soaring and passionate vocals in person.

1416550534|2.0|I can't imagine that this author will ever become a good writer.  She is so willing to use the most tried and true, cliche'd, sentimental word or phrase rather than creating something original or at least natural that it is obvious she either doesn't care or doesn't know what good writing is supposed to be. On one page she used the word grief or grieving four times. (Meanwhile presenting all the visual cliches of grieving to go along with it.) As an elementary writing instructor would tell her, don't tell us about someone's grieving (or lack of it), show us. The only thing interesting to me in the story was just how hard Grace and her fellow servants had to work for such paltry wages.  This is the reality of the times and the only truth in the book. And yet Grace is so entranced by the romantic aura emanating from her masters that she never seems to feel her hours of hard labor.  Even if she doesn't feel the efforts of her duties, I certainly began to feel the efforts of reading about them.
0307716988|5.0|Michael's autobiography is well-written, and I enjoyed reading his stories. The one downfall of this book has to do probably with editing: We all know Michael never referred to his father as \\"Dad,\\" yet that is the way it appears in the book. I would imagine the editors intended to make the book more readable, but for me, I kept stumbling over it.   It is copyrighted in 1988 (when he was only 30), and most MJ fans will be saddened that he did not have the opportunity to update it.
B001GKYBXA|1.0|It must be a burden trying to outlive Ringo. A melted Mr. Potato Head and Humpty Dumpty too old to climb the wall. Gods and legal documents. It must be unnerving watching yourself slowly turn into a beagle. But nice of Sir Paul to air out his death rattle here in digital form for safekeeping.<br /><br />I think the cover explains it all: A small, red ship with a big-headed, blank-faced captain is under attack by an orange umbrella. What this is trying to tell us is that the things you do to protect yourself can ultimately be what destroys you. It's deep, like the ocean. Speaking of deep, \\"Travelling Light\\" has me in its grip ... oh wait, that's just the nurse taking my blood pressure again. She slakes her nostril hairs across my pale, weak chest as an act of dominance. I recoil, helpless and smelly.<br /><br />Back in la-la land. Rooms filled with mush and stools made by toads. We were gathering on viking pillows as fat, feathered mosquitoes danced across the liquid sky, doing the backstroke to the regal tune, \\"Lifelong Passion.\\" Had Lucasfilm come calling? Was this secretly \\"Jar Jar's Theme\\" from the long-awaited \\"Passion of the Binks,\\" a journey of self-discovery? In the cups of butter and the bees from killers, I sat perturbed, like a shaken-up soda can without an opening. Then we fell down the stairs at the animal jail, our backs snapping like crab legs. Grandpa dyeing his hair blue and doing the king tut across the pizza parlor, eyes bugging under thick dark lenses, legs like forceps made out of wet straw. Fitting, then, to close with a hidden track (hidden tracks are so tres-moderne!) that sounds like the unsticking of the opening at the lower end of the alimentary canal of God at the other end of this fleshy tether.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|In addition...HULK SMASH STUPID ANG LEE VERSION!!! I actually liked many aspects of Ang Lee's HULK! It was different and had a great cast. All Ang had to do was end it after the army battle, but NOOOOOOO! Ang had to go all Brokeback Hulk with 20 extra minutes of daddy issues and a WTF was that ending? The Incredible Hulk is simply put: AWESOME! It is a reboot that kicks Ang Lee and his daddy issues movie's ass. It pays homage to the HULK t.v. show most of us all loved (see opening sequence and listen for some familiar music). The cast is even better than last time. Eric Bana was good, but Bruce Banner was made for Ed Norton! And for the record, Tim Roth is one of hollywood's best actors and plays a fantastic antagonist, again (i.e. Rob Roy and Planet of the Apes). The movie follows Banner on the run still searching for a cure. General Ross is desperately seeking to capture the Hulk and turn him into the weapon he intended. Once he tracks him down the mayhem ensues and Ross' top soldier Blomsky wants the power of the Hulk for himself! It all leads to a knock your socks off battle that is one of Marvel's best!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: The Incredible Hulk rages on this transfer. Universal does it again with amazing picture and sound. I thought that the CGI Hulk would look less real on Blu because the clarity would only highlight flaws...I WAS WRONG! The blacks are great and actually the finer detail is picked up and makes the Hulk more lifelike! All the special features are carried over (watch the Alt Opening and see if you can find Captain America)! FINAL VERDICT: Seriously, I will HULK OUT if you don't upgrade. HULK IS STRONGEST ON BLU RAY! UPGRADE!!!
0784011680|5.0|This movie is one of the best peformances of Robert Downey Jr.'s career.  Although this is one of his earlier performances the depth of his acting is delved into the deepest parts.  This was filmed during his days of trouble with drinking and drugs and yet he pulled it all together and poured all his personal fears into the emotion of this movie.      To see Chaplins own daughter playing the part of her grandmother was emotional enought but, Downey became Chaplin and translates us into another time and space.  A must see for any Downey Fan and a must see for anyone who loves amazing acting.
B001KOFH2G|4.0|A cowboy/pirate space opera? Whatever you want to classify it as, I will classify it as REALLY GOOD! Captain Mal Reynolds commands the Serenity and her crew. His real problem? Dr. Simon Tam and his little sister, River. When she suddenly goes berserk in the middle of a smuggling deal, the Cpt. must investigate her bizarre behavior. What he finds is that River is a psychic and a weapon of the shadowy Interplanetary Alliance. While being chased through space by hordes of Reavers and a deadly government assassin, the crew of Serenity learn a secret that the universe must know!<br /><br />This movie is based on the failed TV show Firefly, and is a hit that works as a complete stand alone! The characters are great! The action and special effects are STAR TREK worthy! It deserves a sequel!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Another Universal Studios triumph! I am so wowed by every Blu Ray they make! The picture soars and the audio rocks! All the great special features are carried over! FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE NOW! A MUST OWN DEMO DISC!

0316044938|2.0|The first time that I tried to read The Lovely Bones I couldn't get past the first chapter, in which Susie Salmon matter-of-factly describes her rape and murder at the age of 14.  I finally picked it up again a couple of years later, mostly because I kept hearing what a wonderful book it was and how I must read it.  This time I made it past the first chapter and was relieved that the rest of the book is not as upsetting to read.  However I still didn't really like The Lovely Bones, which I found slow and lacking in dramatic tension.<br /><br />As you probably know, the book is narrated by Susie from heaven.  Although she has died at 14, she continues to watch over her friends and family (and her murderer) from above as they move on with their lives.  All of them were profoundly affected by Susie's death and in some cases it changed forever the arc of their lives.  The book is really about this - the way damaged people pick up the pieces and move on - and although at times it pretends that it's about the hunt for her killer, Alice Sebold chooses to let that be a sub-plot that quietly fades away without resolution.  Susie is able to forgive her murderer more easily than the reader is.<br /><br />I found the book interesting and quietly affecting - I liked the idea that the dead stay with us - but overall it was still a long, slow read that I was relieved to finish.

Thank you Gilbert for an honest look at modern matrimony. None of this \\"if you ever have a smidget of doubt about your union you should bolt\\" crap that the media feeds you. There is finally something out there that disputes the fact that not all women want children or to be married. And yes, we are completely normal people!

Yes, there are epiphanies. Yes, she is still a likable a writer. It isn't the narrative that EPL is. I enjoyed reading the thoughts that most modern woman think about written eloquently. \\"Committed\\" is so appropriate for the new generation of children from divorce families. People who fear divorce, etc. I would call this intelligent chick lit because I am pretty sure I will never get my husband to read it no matter how well written, laugh out loud funny, intelligent it is.

1400082773|4.0|Written by now-President Obama when he was a recent law school grad, Dreams from My Father outlines a young man's search for a sense of purpose and place. It begins with news of his father's death, and then fills in the back story: Obama's life in Hawaii, then Indonesia, then Hawaii again with his grandparents. He describes his time as a community organizer in South Chicago, focusing on the people he worked with and the challenges he faced. Through this, Obama reflects on race, community, family, and his difficulty in coming to terms with who his father was. The book's third and finally section sees him joining his half-sister for a trip to Kenya, where he meets relatives and begins to resolve some of his issues.    The stories are interesting. The writing is good: it flows like a novel. I appreciate the reflection, though some of it comes across clumsily because its more meaningful to him than to us.
0316044938|3.0|This isn't the type of book I normally read, but it recieved so much good press and it sounded interesting from all the blurbs I've read.      It's not horrible...It's not the worse book I've ever read.  But it's okay.  Just okay.  It's like a \\"Monday Night Movie of the Week\\" from the 70's or a Lifetime movie.  Only a lot more artistic (and that is the part that is good about it.      Susie is a character that evokes a lot of empathy from the start.  However, the voice in which Ms. Sebold writes seems a little mature for her. She talks like a college grad. Her sister Lindsey looks/acts more like a typical teen.  However, there are references throughout the story to Susie's intelligence.  Maybe she's just very smart for her age.  That being said, someone that smart would have known to avoid a bad situation when her creepy old neigbor invited her to his \\"Hiding place.\\"    What I found humorous was Susie wasn't (exactly) a Mary Sue, but she fancied herself becoming one if she had lived long enough to attend High School.     I also loved her family...I really felt for them, especially the father and Lindsey.      It was well-written, and the voice in which ms. Sebold writes is very stirring, and emotional.  Her flaunting certain literary conventions to help the story flow a certain way is to be admired.    Now for what I didn't like about it.  And, you'll have to pardon that it's the criminal justice major in me making these assertions: Your adverage reader might not see things the way that I do and/or will escuse them in light of a \\"good read.\\"     A) ALL of the evidence points to Mr. Harvey, and the cornfield...and detectives in the real world would have come across the remains of his underground hideaway in no time.  Even in the seventies.  In addition to that, as someone who has studied the field of forensic investigating, there is the fact that all criminals, even \\"smart\\" ones like Susie claimed Harvey was tend to make mistakes.  ESPECIALLY as they hurry to cover their tracks.  He's a wood carver, not a physicist (sp?).  The less-educated criminals are usually caught quickly.    Why weren't the FBI or any other crime task forces called in?  WHy just the local cops?  (like I said...yeah, this is the CJ student talking moreso than the bookworm).      B) She comes to earth in the body of a friend FOR SEX with her would-have-been boyfriend on earth?  NO.  Rape victims in real life FEAR sex, some even with their own spouses for a significant time...   NO BOY on EARTH is going to be that hot that you are going to instantly get past that to be with.  And, as desperately as Susie seemed to want to lead her parents to her body & help them solve her murder...?  WHY didn't she embody her dad or sister...Why?    Yes, I know teenagers do dumb things in the name of lust/love.  Even ghosts of teenagers.  But, this is someone whos last memory on earth was being violated...    C) An icicle??? An icicle falls and knocks the murderer into a ditch where his body is covered in snow and his body lays undiscovered for an undisclosed amount of time?      Susie talks about how she wishes her Dad would \\"Bronson him\\"...I was hoping for that too.  There was no real sense of justice.  I was hoping that the girl he talked to in the train station was waiting for her boyfriend and his street gang of big burly guys, who would have beaten him to a pulp for looking at the girl...  Or maybe she could have called the cops, because some creep was bothering her and then busted him.      But no...just icicles.  Yet, I get the fact that he wound up trapped, and burried....just like he trapped and burried her.
0141439475|3.0|Dr. Frankenstein's unnamed monster is eloquent, agile, and sensitive. He wants to be helpful, ably drives a dogsled, and smarts at rejection. He's not the Frankenstein of the movies. Shelley uses a \\"story-within-a-story\\" technique for sharing her tale: A sea captain tells his wife precisely what Dr. Frankenstein has told him, and the good doctor's narrative is littered with quotes from letters, stories from friends, and even a long monologue from the monster himself.<br /><br />Two hundred years ago, this story may have \\"caused one's blood to congeal in terror its premeditated course through one's very veins,\\" but now it seems pretty un-horrific.
1401223176|5.0|One of the best Batman graphic novels out there.  This is definitely one of the few comics where you get both a great story and great visuals, instead of one OR the other.  Visually it is beautiful.  Jim Lee is a fantastic artist and really makes all the characters and action look great.  The story is also great as Batman tries to put the pieces of an extraordinarily complex puzzle together.  Some have critizied that it is obvious who Hush is but this novel is more about the journey than the ending.  I know that is an over used expression but what makes this story great is how so many characters are used in such perfect ways (according to their unique personalities) and how they all tie together at the end.  It is also great in that every time you read it you will likely pick out something new, instead of a one and done comic.
B002TYZKIM|3.0|I've been a Michael Jackson fan since I can remember. My first album bought was Thriller. When Michael died, it was like I lost a piece of myself. I was excited to learn they would release Michael's preps for the THIS IS IT concerts as a movie/dvd.It felt like I'd have a little piece of magic...the magic of the last moments Michael spent dreaming, creating, and being himself. Instead, when I viewed THIS IS IT, I got something different. Michael was in TOP form, don't get me wrong...it just lacked when it came to moments with him. I wanted more. I guess it just wasn't ENOUGH to satisfy someone who grew up loving and watching him. I felt a little disappointed with THIS IS IT. However, I will say, Michael's vision for the concerts...SUPERB! He was so creative and talented. There is NO DOUBT in my mind that if he had lived, THIS IS IT would have been the BEST concert EVER. Instead, THIS IS IT is bittersweet at best. A dream never coming true...an icon lost way to soon.
B002KS1IJC|1.0|I tried to watch this movie. It had an interesting opening sequence.    5-10 minutes into it I realized the acting is terrible, the plot(so far) is predictable and cliche, the dialog is on the nose and full of exposition. My sister and I are now laughing at every single scene. This movie is terrible. If you like bad TV-shows then you might like this film.  I feel sorry for the director who definitely tried. Big sound effects, special effects, stunts, and very professional and highly skilled cinematography. But the director lacked one thing, a sense of who to cast and a sense of how to fix bad, over acting.    I've wasted my 3-4 dollars on this film. I would be very angry about it, but I'm not because obviously someone spent a lot of their life making this film, and doing the best they could.     I have turned it off before seeing the end and am moving onto another film.
0143116177|4.0|I read this book for a book club (ie, I didn't choose it). I expected it to be dry and difficult. Just the opposite, I could hardly put it down. Ferguson's writing is clear and concise. His knowledge of financial history is encyclopedic and dotted with interesting anecdotes.  The book is organized well. My only criticism is that, in the later chapters as he gets into derivatives, I had trouble following the financial nuances, but then, so did Wall Street in 2007!    I learned a lot and enjoyed learning it.

B00387YA6C|4.0|In Episode 14 of the Vampire Diaries, many thematic elements that have been introduced across the season have finally come together. Damon's quest to free his love Katherine, who was locked inside the Mystic Falls church in 1864, comes to an explosive head as Stefan rescues Elena from her vampire kidnappers. Matt and Caroline are still trying to make their fledgling romance work, while Jeremy has fallen for the strange new girl, Anna, who is much more than she appears to be. Even Tyler makes a (not-too-notable) appearance (his first post-hiatus, I think).<br /><br />All of the elements from the last several episodes come together in a satisfying conclusion, including the identity and purpose of the new vampires in town and Damon's quest to obtain Emily Bennett's grimoire in order to break the seal on the tomb. Elena, Stefan and Bonnie have promised to release Katherine, but not the other vampires. Unlike the previous episode, there are no flashbacks in \\"Fool Me Once.\\" Elena must appeal to Damon's attraction to her after she's broken his trust in the last episode; his acquiescence is vital to their scheme. Bonnie's grandmother (Jasmine Guy) also plays a pivotal role in opening the long-sealed tomb.<br /><br />The pacing, plot and performances show just how far this show has come since the pilot. There's a new maturity and depth of emotion to the storyline; several characters lose someone they loved. Ian Somerhalder shines in this episode; Damon is taken from hope to anger to the deepest grief, and we feel along with him every step of the way. There's a palpable sense of tension and foreboding that runs throughout the episode and carries the dramatic moments without resorting to cheap effects or gore. This episode would have made a perfect close to the first season, as it does such a good job of wrapping up many of the loose ends.
8483468549|5.0|Albert Einstein wrote a letter to Franklin Roosevelt urging him to develop an atomic bomb, fearful that the Germans would be first. Einstein latter said it was the greatest mistake he ever made. Within a few short years of that letter, humans mastered the technique of obtaining a tremendous amount of energy by eliminating matter, expressed by a very familiar formula. The first demonstration of this mastery occurred in the New Mexican desert, in July, 1945, and within less than a month, an atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.<br /><br />Within a year of the bombing, which was instrumental event in bringing the Second World War to an end, John Hersey wrote this poignant account of six survivors, each of whom were between a mile or two from ground zero, and each in their way was lucky, or unlucky, to have survived. Hersey tells the accounts of two women: a clerk in the personnel department, and a tailor's widow; and of four men: two medical doctors, a Japanese Methodist minister and a German Catholic priest. Hersey tells their stories with a very flat affect, in that style of \\"just stating the facts,\\" and allowing the horror which occurred to these six, as well as others, speak for itself.  Time and again Hersey selects the detail to bring this horror home, from the mother who held her dead baby for four days, as it was decomposing, awaiting the return of her husband, to the still alive anti-aircraft crew, whose faces had \\"melted\\" in the blinding heat. All the emergency services were eliminated or overwhelmed, and one of the two doctors above was the only one staffing the sole hospital. Supplies and exhaustion constrained him to perform only the most rudimentary first aide.<br /><br />Most of the book is focused on the immediate impact on these six, over the first 72 hours. But Hersey does have an informal \\"epilogue\\" section that covers their lives over the following six months, and the arrival of Allied occupation forces.<br /><br />Because it was the first use of nuclear weapons in war, Hiroshima receives a disproportionate share of the attention. No similar book has ever been written about Nagasaki, bombed three days latter, with almost the same number killed. Also, the Allies had deliberately fire bombed cities such as Tokyo, and Dresden with \\"conventional\\" weapons, with at least as many casualties. Does it matter if your face is melted by fire bombs, or an atomic weapon? There is a difference though, in that there are the lingering effects of radiation, which quite often includes death, that occur with the survivors of an atomic bomb attack.<br /><br />I've been to the A-bomb museum in Hiroshima, and consider it quite bias against the Americans, in that all causative reasons for such an attack are not mentioned. It is presented very much in the form that this was a cruel experiment, conducted at the very end of the war. Hersey's book however, I consider fair and factual. He allows the horror of war to speak for itself. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the immediate likelihood of nuclear war has been reduced, but with the increased proliferation of the bomb, coupled with on-going wars, the chance of another use of the bomb, even by accident, remains high.<br /><br />Hersey's account of the lives of six people at Hiroshima should be part of the core curriculum in every American high school. A solid 5-star read.<br /><br />(P.S.  I didn't read this book in Spanish; hopefully Amazon will move the numerous reviews of this book to an English language version of the book)lear weapons in war, Hiroshima receives a disproportionate share of the attention.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|Great Dexter - Creative writing and interesting story lines - never takes itself too seriously.
B002QW7AJY|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  You'll spend the entire movie asking what the heck the characters are doing, both because their actions make no sense and also since you will have figured out the plot sequence ages in advance.  That extends to the conclusion, as well.  Needless and obvious detours are taken in what I guess is an attempt to make this longer than the 30 minutes the story may deserve.  The camera bounces from one angle to the next, serving to both confuse and distract from the already sucktacular scenes.  Trust me, you'll walk away disgusted in the fact that you can't get the time you spent watching this movie back.
1605092762|5.0|This book presents a novel and sensible approach to making a difference in world poverty other than simply throwing more money at the problem.  A very worthwhile read. It's not just theoretical, the guy walks his talk and has a history of positive results.
B000JLSLZQ|1.0|I loved the movie itself, but I have a HUGE problem with the fact that the sound is only dolby digital.    I have no idea what is wrong with Warner Bros, but they failed to provide the superior lossless Dolby or DTS sound tracks on this disk.  The lossless sound is on the HDDVD version of this movie.  So you know that Warner Bros had already gone to the expense of creating it, before they created the B.R. version.    HELLO, this is a musical.  The sound quality is of paramount importance.  I have both versions of the movie.  The HDDVD sounds much better.  When I first played the B.R. version, I could immediatly hear that something was wrong.  I never thought to check the B.R. versions stats before I bought it, or I would not have done it.    My advice is to wait until they master this movie properly, then buy it.  Had I known better, that is what I would have done.
0743298039|2.0|I wanted to like it.  I did.  It gets great reviews, and it seems like the kind of book I'd enjoy.  But all it has going for it is a meandering and anachronistic plot, a cast of characters that are ultimately unrealistic and cliched, and a finale that is not so much moving as it is dull and devoid of meaning.      The main difference between the protagonist and the characters the author aspires to have her be like is that she lacks a personality and any kind of gumption.  She's a dull, plodding spinster with no interests, talents, or friends, and I found it impossible to engage with her in any way.  As for the mysterious and extraordinary novelist...well, I'd rather have written any of the novels that SHE wrote than this one.  They sounded far more interesting.

B002VPE1AW|3.0|not much can be said about this film that hasn't already been said.  It does have an environmental ethic moral and does highlight the dangers and spiritual emptiness of greed.<br /><br />but the main reason to enjoy and appreciate the movie is for the \\"eye candy\\", the visuals, which are truly state-of-the-art.  Kudos to Cameron for delivering another top notch action film.

B000QQFKYE|3.0|this being a David Lynch movie, certain things are understood.  First, the film will be visually interesting, and colorfully shot.  Second, the film will be populated by quirky and extreme characters.  Third, the plot will not necessarily be linear.  Fourth, after watching a Lynch film, he will provoke your brain in ways it hasn't been provoked or stimulated before.  Fifth, a typical Lynch film has comedy, drama, action, and existential pain all rolled into one.<br /><br />\\"Inland Empire\\" is no exception to these rules.  Although I found it difficult to follow the thread of the story, the acting by Laura Dern is some of her best work (if not her best).  Jeremy Irons was also impressive.<br /><br />It is something of a 'movie within a movie' in that the story concerns a film production and the literal actors are playing the characters of actors in the film.  There is some drama about marital infidelity, and a back story about a curse that seems to be repeating itself.  There is some vague-ness about what is real and what is imagined.<br /><br />worth watching if you already appreciate Lynch's work.  In summary:  a Lynch film is to be experienced, not understood.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I bought this Blu-ray knowing full well I'd enjoy it because I'm a pretty big dork. I didn't see it in theaters, and I've seen no more than 3 episodes of the original series (or any other generation), yet I blindly went ahead and bought it. Once again, I proved that I know myself all too well.    I loved this movie. I could go on about what makes this film so entertaining, but I'm sure it's already been said much more eloquently than I ever could. Basically, it's highly entertaining and fully accessible for people who aren't even fans of Science Fiction, never mind Star Trek. At its core, it's a fun, exhilarating film that's sure to bring in a whole mess of new fans. Including me.    Now, about the Blu-ray. Ever since watching all 9 or so hours of bonus footage provided with the Lord of the Rings Extended Edition DVDs, I've become very spoiled and hard to please with it comes to Behind the Scenes content. The bonus footage on this Blu-ray is easily the best I've seen since. Pretty much everything you'd ever want is included here, with over 3 hours of footage. This means ACTUAL FOOTAGE; none of that slide-show-put-to-music BS. And it's all in high definition! Quite honestly, it's the perfect package. One of the best movie buys I've ever made.

I thought they would enjoy seeing this story in a different format. The movie itself was great! Even though there was no speaking going on, like the book, it kept the children's attention. I was disappointed that the movie had a lot of background noise (like crackling) which detracted from the movie. This movie was bought new from a vendor.

1401219268|1.0|I have nothing against comic books. They're fun. This one isn't. It's a heavy-handed (to the point of the author /spelling out/ the points he's making) and ultimately irritating in its lack of any real intellectual stimulation as a reward for the time required to read it.<br /><br />The issue addressed is pretty much summed up by the title -- who watches the people with power? The question itself implies almost all the possible answers. Moore does little to explore the use and abuse of power in depth. And by introducing a character -- Dr Manhattan -- who is, for all practical purposes, omnipotent, he discards the possibility of analyzing the question of the moral responsibility of power in \\"the real world\\". Yet he misses the opportunity to compare/contrast Dr Manhattan with God, especially with regard to his/His behavior and responsibilites.<br /><br />Alan Moore doesn't /really/ understand that comic books are fundamentally visual, which is why they're so heavily populated by super-heroes and other fantasy characters. Visual media (including motion pictures) don't easily lend themselves to philosophical discussions. Had \\"Watchmen\\" been a rousing adventure story in which the philosophical issues were the subtext, it would almost certainly have worked better.<br /><br />I was expecting something special (especially considering TIME's encomium *). What I got was an intellectually and visually boring book (the fixed panel size is stultifying). And what can you say about an artist who wants to be taken seriously who includes a lesbian wrestling match? Fifteen-year-olds who know little about history or philosophy might find \\"Watchmen\\" stimulating. I don't think any reasonably well-educated adult will.<br /><br />If you want to read good books that reward the time and effort needed to understand them, try Bobbitt's \\"The Shield of Achilles\\" or Barzun's \\"From Dawn to Decadence\\".<br /><br />* Which also happens to be a piece of electronic music by Charles Wuorinen.

B00005MP58|5.0|Since I am a fan of Colin Firth, the video held an added attraction for me.  I thought the video was quite like the book, almost word for word and the scenic countryside was mesmerizing.  The characters were true to the book.  Since Jane Austen doesn't allow her characters more than a look or a touch, it was, as usual, hard to wait to the end for the Lizzy and Darcy connection.  It would have been nice to see her hold his arm walking down the lane.  The video was well done and the characters did an excellent job.  I like the fact that more of Darcy was seen in this one.  An A+ rating, I received the video in less time than it was determined, and the price was wonderful. Thank you, thank you.
B00062IVKS|1.0|I saw this movie in my film studies class. At first I thought, \\"Boxing movie? Cool!\\" but only a few minutes into the film I discovered that it was miles away from exciting. Jake La Motta is an extremely unsympathetic character whose temper and jealousy don't give any motivation for the audience to like him. He alienates everyone close to him and I couldn't bring myself to feel sorry for his eventual fate. Robert De Niro's portrayal of La Motta was well done, but being well-acted doesn't make the film any more watchable. The boxing scenes were the parts I was most looking forward to, but again, I was sorely disappointed. I am well aware that the boxing wasn't the main focus of this film, but a director of Scorsese's caliber should have been able to make it slightly interesting.     The only thing that angers me more than the fact that my time was wasted by this film is the fact that so many hail it as a masterpiece.
1416948678|1.0|It seems as though the author feels he is an expert on all men, which is totally impossible. Some of the cases he brings to the table do in fact fit a lot of men to a tee. However, he can in no way speak for the character of all men all over the world. Sure, there are a lot of men who use women simply to amuse themselves. But there is no way of knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that all men are liars and cheaters, Just because a man does not return a woman's phone calls within a reasonable time or, he's no where to be found for a couple of days does not mean he's not into you. Seriously, maybe the man really is busy. For the author to say, \\"The explanation is universally that if the guy really wanted to be with you, he would not be acting in this way,\\" is totally unfounded. He also said,<br /><br />Quote: \\"I know it's nice to have companionship and wake up with somebody that you really like, but that's what pets are for. Pets are God's way of saying, \\"Don't lower the bar because you're lonely.\\"<br /><br />What kind of warped thinking would make him compare human companionship to pets? There have been many instances whereas I have been so busy that I have neglected someone I was very much into. So, does that mean I wasn't into him or, cheating? The same way a woman can be bombarded with work or, other life's issues, a man can too. I truly believe there are some men out there that genuinely care for, respect and, are truly into some women.<br />[[ASIN:055700778X Reflections Of Life]]
B00001OH7N|2.0|I have to admit this creeped me out when I was a kid. The bizarre subject matter and Bowie at his most affected were just too strange for me in my adolescence and time has not improved my opinion.  I will admit to a certain fascination with the psychotic narrator of \\"Running Gun Blues\\" the quirky little interruption of \\"Black Country Rock\\" and the title cut and \\"The Width of a Circle\\" still have an exotic majesty, but the overall effect is an odd mixture of apocalyptic science fiction and pointlessness. Musically there are a lot of interesting choices but by the time Bowie gets done with his various methods of doing in humanity, I found myself bored by the repetitiveness of these themes. While I'm sure this Bowie incarnation has its defenders, I'm really glad he outgrew this stage rather quickly.

B002XZ62HK|5.0|It looks as if this new hit from Celtic Woman has debuted at the top of the World BillBoard charts and appears destined to repeat another of their record-breaking runs there as experienced by their earlier releases. If you were among the millions of Americans who saw the broadcasts of Songs From The Heart from among the thousands of broadcasts from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (PBS) stations across the nation, you should know this is the music from that show. Celtic Woman is presently at the start of a nationwide tour in which performance of these numbers may be seen live.        If you liked their prior releases, such as A New Journey filmed in 2006 at Slane Castle in Ireland, you will certainly love this! Filmed at the castle at Powerscourt, County Wicklow, Ireland in July 2009, it has all the elements we have come to the love of the group, created under the direction of the group's creator and musical director, David Downes, whom many regard as a genius from the body of his work thus far and his many fantastic accomplishments, which appear far beyond what one would normally expect of one of his years.     If you care at all about this group and their music, you will certainly want to get it and having done so, will rue that you waited so long to do so!
B002RSDW80|4.0|All in all an enjoyable film. Streep gives an upbeat incarnation of Julia Child that is worth seeing. The present day segments of the film with Adams are a bit slow in places. The scenes with Streep showing the life of Child are placed just right to pick the pace of the film back up. There is plenty of humor in Streep's performance. The film is well directed by Nora Ephron. Sound and lighting are consistant in the film as well. Costume and  sets appear to match the period segments of the film. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give the film a solid 7. Some where betweeen simmer and sizzle. The meals prepared in the film are more gourmet than the film but it's still good eats if you enjoy Meryl Streep.

0307266303|5.0|I am not a runner, and always thought that those who did run were a little insane.  There just seemed to be so much damage to the knees, back, and ankles caused by running that it seemed the negatives outweighed the positives.  And besides, don't most doctors recommend walking instead?      After reading this book, I wanted to start running the next day.  Not only does McDougall tackle why so many runners have these injuries and what can be done to stop them, but he also created a book that is a great blend of entertainment and science.  The buildup to the big race at the end is just as riveting as anything you'll find in the best fiction novels, from the introduction to all of the zany characters to the roadblocks (figuratively, not literally) that they run into to actually successfully hold the race.  And the science and history that is provided makes it seem crazy that more people aren't running.  The only thing that I didn't like (and this is a small nitpick) is that in some places, it got a little too bogged down with science, but that is a minor quibble in what was a fantastic book.  Very highly recommended.

B002XTBE6K|2.0|I have to say that Emma is one of my least favorite Jane Austen Characters to begin with.  She is not especially sympathetic and in this version I am most displeased.    First of all, Knightly (Johnny Lee Miller) is way too young - isn't there supposed to be a 15 year age difference?  It looked to me like the producer's wanted a good looking actor instead of staying true to the story.  That brings me to my next point - the dialouge.  It seems that the screenwriter has decided to make changes that were un-necessary.    The best versions of all of Jane's stories are the ones that stay true to the entire story.  In the case of Emma, the version starring Kate Beckinsale is far better.    This movie is watchable, but if you have read the book and have seen better productions, you will be disappointed.
0618918248|4.0|Given that this is a rather acclaimed book, you probably do not need another opinion, but this book is unique because it will make you think. If you are religious or not you will walk away certain you understand Dawkins better. Contrasted against \\"The Devil's Chaplain\\" this is significantly less personal, but also more structured, as one would expect, since the this is focused, whilst the other was a collection of essays.<br /><br />The format is fantastic, Dawkins does not preach but analytically deals with every topic he sets out and makes his point. You may not walk away a changed person but you will feel happy to have learnt something about yourself and your believes (or lack thereof). Personally, I believe, though in a narrow way, Jesus as a great teacher, and the benefits of social structures offered by religion. What this book made me confront is the way religion does not give morality and how it often fails (or should fail) to offer comfort, and i am grateful for these realizations.<br /><br />There are some issues with Dawkins's work, as there always are. For one thing towards the very end he seems to waver and concede that there are some benefits, something that feels as though there always has been (though it may be an interpretation issue) and he suddenly feels like a young little boy sort of awed and wondering, which undoes a lot of what he had been saying but ... no not undoes, it strengthens it because it makes you see, but it may come a little late, especially if you want to know what he's thinking.<br /><br />Also, Dawkins lacks the vision of Carl Sagan, i don't believe in the notion of physical constants that make the world what they are, i believe they are constant, and are the way they are, or they aren't but regardless, i feel life would still evolve regardless. It would find a way, as Sagan put it in \\"Cosmos\\" (the book, haven't watched the series), we don't know what life might be like, but odds are alien life would be so completely alien to us, we might not recognize it (naturally i paraphrase). Sagan was talking in the current instance of the universe, but the same applies outward to alternate configurations and Dawkins fails to consider this.<br /><br />Another aspect that feels to be lacking is the notion that water is the key to life, which goes hand in hand with my last contrast to Sagan, odds are life could exist without water ... but then we really are interested in the kind of life that we would recognize.<br /><br />There are other instances in other areas where it seems that Dawkins lacks the wonder (optimism?) Sagan especially was so able to communicate and although the subject of \\"The God Delusion\\" vs \\"Cosmos\\" is completely different there is an overlap (at least for myself) in the joy of science, which both wonderfully proclaim.<br /><br />Thank you Mr Dawkins for this wonderful book. It has both strengthened my faith and helped me see clearer what i believe. I don't agree with you all the way, but regardless you made your case beautifully and i'm sure this book gives thousands if not millions great joy, just as it did for me.ze it (naturally i paraphrase).

B000OMF3K6|5.0|I read this book more than 20 years ago for the first time. I have re-read it multiple times and enjoyed it every time! When I started listening to books on cassettes, I bought it in that version. When it was released on CD's, I bought that version. When it was released as MP3, I bought that version for my Cowon D2 and now D2+. Every time I re-read this book it is like visiting with an old friend you haven't seen in awhile. After reading this book, I read everything of Dean Koontz I could get my hands on and still do. I pre-order his books as soon as Amazon offers them, then anxiously wait for the release date!<br /><br />This particular purchase was to give as a gift. Once I learned our veterinarian had not read this book, I searched until I found a hardback in excellent condition to give him. I hope that he will love this book as much as I do.

1400052173|4.0|Rebecca Skloot did a terrific job of explaining the history of the HeLa cells and making what could have been dry science into a book with suspense, color and vibrancy.  Readers should be warned that there ARE portions where scientific concepts are dealt with exhaustively but the author never talked down to the audience and did an excellent job of putting it into \\"plain language.\\"  She also did a wonderful job of making all the participants come alive on her pages, especially Henrietta Lacks herself. That added considerably to the book.    I found it to be a real page-turner, until the latter half when Skloot tells us about the research she did, primarily with Lacks' daughter Deborah.  Way too much detail about Deborah's back and forth, willingness and unwillingess to be involved, in part because of her mistrust of the writer and in part because of prior experiences with doctors.  While it's true that readers have been given many examples of why African-Americans distrust scientists, I felt that the author could have taken far less time and done a better job of summarizing her efforts and her many trips to Clover, Baltimore, etc.      Another weak point of the book was that the author was relentless in pushing her agenda of emphasizing the substandard care given to African-Americans. For example, while it's true that pneumoencephalography was an awful test, the fact is that it was done in many hospitals because there was no other way to see the brain at the time.  It was NOT done only to indigent, epileptic African-Americans in the institution where Lacks' daughter lived - although that is the clear impression that Skloot left. Similarly, tissue was taken from all patients without letting them know, not just Henrietta Lacks.      The author has done a remarkable job of speaking to people involved in Henrietta Lacks care, helped by the longevity of many of the participants, as well as family members and friends.      All in all, a very good read!
B00000IFWE|5.0|It was around the time that Highway Companion came out that I went to see Petty and the Heartbreakers live just to go.  That show made me realize just how embedded Petty's songs were into my mind as every single tune was amazing and the band played so well.  An amazing show that opened my eyes and got me to start listening to more Petty.<br /><br />And it took me this long to get to Echo.  Boy did I miss out on that one.  I guess I listened a bit too much to the people that were down on this album.  It even got ragged on a bit in the Runnin' Down A Dream documentary.<br /><br />Echo doesn't deserve the criticism.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of 60 minute+ albums.  I think too many artists have been suckered in by the amount of space on the CD.  Most albums are best at old LP length - around 40 minutes or so.  So many albums end up with a bit of filler as an artist or record label or producer or whoever insist on packing more stuff onto an album.<br /><br />I think that happened on Wildflowers for Petty, though that is a generally excellent work - it just tapers off a bit toward the end.<br /><br />But not Echo.  This album is laced with raw emotion and amazing melodies, kicking off with one of Petty's best, Room At The Top.  It doesn't let up, with great melodies, raw guitars, and some insightful lyrics.<br /><br />The three singles are excellent - Room At The Top, Free Girl Now, and Swingin'.  The title track, Echo, is six minutes and doesn't feel like it.  It is such a sad tune as we hear of a once strong love that has turned bitter after hearing on the previous song that the couple will stand forever Accused Of Love (the title of that great song), but things start to go bad there.<br /><br />Every song here is a gem akin to how it was early on with the Heartbreakers' first four albums (and maybe beyond as I think Long After Dark and Southern Accents are underrated).  This album isn't Damn The Torpedoes or Full Moon Fever or Wildflowers - it's different.  It feels different.  It has fewer fist pumps.  There are many great choruses but they can be very thoughtful.<br /><br />It's not easy to describe this album fully other than saying it's a powerful and emotional ride.  I'd say it's one of Petty's best but most of his albums can stake that claim.  Tom Petty doesn't get the kind of recognition he should as one of the greatest writers of the rock era, up there with Springsteen, Lennon-McCartney, Jagger-Richards, etc.eat choruses but they can be very thoughtful.

B003102JDM|1.0|This has to be the worst film made in the last 100 years.  Ugly, abhorrent, painful, disgusting and a waste of resources.  Sure hope these two sociopaths are being watched.  Children and pets are certainly not safe around them.  Felt neither sympathy, concern or interest in any of the characters or their actions or activities.  Not a moment of humor throughout the entire ordeal.  I would have found more pleasure in calling up roto-rooter and having them come over and perform anal surgery without anesthesia than have to watch this again.  I, unfortunately, give the benefit of the doubt to people and I believed the reviews on the dvd box - thief, liar, pervert!  I kept hoping the chipper/shredder from their Fargo movie would show up and all the characters and the Coen cretins would dive in and we would finally have something to cheer about! Unfortunately you can not return a dvd just because it's a rotten movie.  Call the cops.  I've been robbed!

B00333NCTM|5.0|If you are a literary critic, then this book is not for you. If you are a fan of Ozzy Osbourne, then you will find this book difficult to put down. I'm a 42 year old male who has been into Ozzy's music since the late '70s. This book is a fantastic journey into the life and times of Ozzy Osbourne and his rise from humble beginnings to super-stardom, fame, and fortune. The most intriguing element of this book for me is the humble approach that Ozzy takes to tell his story. I quickly learned through this autobiography that Ozzy is quite humble and how his education and early family life molded him into what he is today (or has been in the past.) When I was younger, I thought all rock stars were boozers and drug users, and It didn't affect my opinion of them. I just find it appealing to read Ozzy's humble and candid accounts of all the rumors I heard in the past, and a few that I didn't hear. This book is also full of interesting encounters Ozzy had with other people in the world of rock and roll...

I have run my own business, for the last 10 years and have met many business consultants eager to help but, they have all fallen short in so many ways. Gary is a natural, gifted entrepreneur with a valuable, genuine vision to share. This is a must read for anyone in any business-at any stage of the game. And guess what??? He will own the NY Jets one day and he will give me season tix! ;) Love ya, Gary! Jennifer Carrillo Thomas AKA sallypants49 / @jayctee
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This story was difficult to read and difficult to put down.  I praise the men and their families as well as to thank them.  I have finally found something that is tougher then pregnancy to delivery - Navy SEAlS.  Some people who wrote reviews stated that the menitoning of the liberal media and politicians should not have been part of this story.  The fact of the matter is that right now we have 4 Navy SEALS charged with abuse of a known terrorist (murderer).  Why?  Why is a world wide known terrorist given any credibility, rights and a lawyer.  As stated in the book the thugs know how to use our system against us.    Back to the book; it was amazing to read what these men go through to become defenders of our country.  The SEALS, Green Beret, Special Task Force all are heroes in all that they do for our freedom and security.  The training of these patriotic men is sometimes beyond comprehension and I thought I was patriotic.  If you give a damn about our country and the brave men and woman serving this is one of the best books.  I would stop reading this book to relay the events back to my husband.  God Bless all our Men and Woman who bravely fight for all of us, even those who don't like the military.

B0038A4N3O|3.0|I am not feeling season three at all! First of all I hate all the new characters. I hate this new super chuck. I hate the girl from smallville. I hate that Sarah and Chuck are not in love anymore. That was my whole reason for watching the show. The only reason I have purchased the show and gave it three stars is because I have faith that they can turn it around. GET IT TOGETHER PEOPLE OR I AM OUT!!!
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Movie was informative without being overly disgusting or using scare tactics.  Information was presented somewhat matter of fact with interviews with actual farmers.  Glad I spent the time to view and more people need to see this.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I just finished watching Gran Torino and it's the best movie I've seen in a long while.<br /><br />Maybe I'll come back to write a more in-depth review, but at the moment I just can't.<br /><br />For the average film critic there is probably a handful of false notes that would keep this movie from getting the very best rating. Typically I'm one of those \\"critics.\\"<br /><br />But this movie touched my heart more deeply than I ever expected.<br /><br />This film gets my very highest recommendation.
B000JML90Y|5.0|Variations exist within populations that compete for scarce resources needed for survival, and many of these variations not only affect the ability of the individual to compete, but also can be passed onto children. Those variations better suited for competition will be passed on at a higher rate than those that are less suited for competition due to higher rates of survival. In this way, nature itself non-randomly selects those variations most fit, thus diversifying populations, creating branches in the Tree of Life.    While this book is 150 years out of date, and the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection has been significantly modified since its publication (especially since the discovery of DNA and the mechanisms present in both heredity and mutation), the main principles of Darwin's argument, stated in the above paragraph, remain the core of evolutionary science. This is an important work in the history of science, one that everyone should read for historical literacy. If, however, one is seeking to learn the modern evidence for evolution, collected both through laboratory testing and through field observations, then Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne, or The Greatest Show On Earth by Richard Dawkins would be better choices. Indeed, while the hierarchy of shared characteristics amongst animals, and the hierarchy of interspecies variations interpreted in light of the aforementioned hierarchy of shared characteristics itself constitutes great evidence for common descent, and Darwin's argument for natural selection as the mechanism by which diversity within the animal kingdom has increased remains extremely convincing and effective, it is best to familiarize one's self with all of the modern data, and all of the independently arrived at trees of life from non-overlapping fields of study that are all *gasp* identical.

B0012GMZDG|5.0|I have always known who Jeff Beck is. But, for some reason, I never got around to adding him to my library. One night I was riding with my guitar playing friend down the freeway and he plugged in \\"Space for Papa.\\" I was blown away! The car seemed to transform into some sort of friction free transport that floated along the highway. That song is the fastest seven plus minutes in rock and roll history! I made my friend play it two more times before we reached our destination! My mind still reels from thinking about that first listen! I bought this album from Amazon soon after and it is a great album!     If you like great rock and blues guitar, and want to cut your teeth on some Jeff Beck, this is the album to start your collection. I recently gave that CD to another guitar playing friend of mine and re-ordered it for myself. Today, I am ordering three more.    P.S. This album has a great sound engineer. I have a JBL pro sound DJ system with 4500 watts of fine tuned power. Of all the CDs I play, \\"Who Else!\\" is the album I use to set up the EQ for the night. When you use pro sound, you can hear the differences from various sound engineers on different albums. It can be very annoying some times because some CDs sound great and others just so-so. This album sounds perfect. Tight and clean in all aspects and instruments. I wish all my CDs were engineered this clean.     This album is meant to be CRANKED!!! I think I'll do that now, again!
B001NXDIMK|4.0|The second season of \\"Damages\\" had quite a lot to live up to. The first season was an incredible tour de force, loaded with twists, solid writing, and outstanding acting. It also introduced its brilliant time-jumping element, which came to a close as the two timelines intersected at the end of the first season in its brilliant conclusion. So what comes next?    Season two of \\"Damages\\" sees new characters, a new case, and plenty of new twists and turns. It also introduces a new flash-forward timeline, which, while perhaps not quite as compelling as the chaos of season one, still provides many interesting surprises and cliffhangers as the series progresses.    I know that this season was not nearly as well-received as the first, and while I can see the reasons to prefer the first, this still offers an excellent series of television. If anything, it lets us go deeper into the lives of the central characters of the story, with Patty's personal life and past history more clearly explained and examined, and Ellen's own motives are unclear and questionable. Season two is much more of a character study than season one, and at times results in a slower pace. Consider the shift that takes place though, and it is easy to see what this season manages to accomplish: Patty becomes a fleshed out, much more human character over the course of the season, and Ellen starts to come to grips with the dark realities of the world in which she lives. These two women grow together as they try to destroy one another, and the chemistry between them is absolute gold.     The new characters in season two are hit-and-miss: William Hurt as Daniel Purcell offers an excellent performance, though his character was at times understated, whereas the executives of the company UNR (Patty's legal target in season two) are less developed and compelling, and of course cannot hold a candle to Ted Danson's deliciously evil Arthur Frobisher in the first season.    Nevertheless, the season is still a blast, and will keep you guessing until the end. It should under no circumstances be watched without seeing the first season first, but if you've seen and enjoyed the first season, there's no reason not to watch this one. It may lose its balance slightly in the middle, but stick with it--the finale is a satisfying payoff and will leave you craving for season three, which so far has been out of this world good.

0061914177|4.0|This book really pushed me to act on \\"building my personal brand\\" in the social media world.  Gary presents some great ideas and got me thinking about how to apply my passion(s) in a different way using the new tools.  He really IS inspirational.  As a further endoresement, I purchased copies of this for all my children (along with their domain names as he suggests in the book.)  For me this tells what the near future will look like.<br /><br />The only negative is his writing style....while this was an extremely quick read I wish it had been better written.  The ideas are all there however, don't miss this book.
B0000033IR|2.0|I was disappointed in this cd because it didn't have many of Aretha's really good songs & it seemed that even the good ones had vague variances from the popular versions.
B002G1K82Q|4.0|Pretty good movie, seems a bit cheesy at first, but eventually you get used to the continual singing and dancing. Good storyline, excellent soundtrack, and lots of trippy scenes that you'll especially like if you're high.

The tragic story of a woman with 5 young children who, by way of her death from a particularly vicious cancer, should help save the lives of probably almost every one of us, is positively fascinating. I also like the author's style as she weaves the stories of the past and the present, along with updates on the people we've met in the book and an afterword discussing the moral and legal implications of the issues in the book, and they make a very satisfying read.
B002WCLG48|5.0|This is simply an 8 episode index of the history of the halo universe.<br />All episodes are not related and are showcasing a certain aspect of the Halo Universe. It's for the fans who want to see more of the Halo Galaxy outside of the Master Chief, even though he will appear in this Chronicle. All of the episodes have a different anime style and are made by different anime legends. This will be a very cool DVD to help build the Halo Lore.<br /><br />I am so going to buy this DVD, though i do not know what is included in the Specai l edition yet.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Being a fan of the band for about 2 decades now - from their amazing records though the great and not so good ones, I was really looking forward to this one when it was first announced. I got really excited about it when I saw the viral campaigns. I've listened to this a couple of times when it first came out and I would have given it a 4 or a 4.5 star rating had it not been for the really awful compression and loudness. I have to agree with a couple of the reviews here - where's the 'hi-fi'? I'm left wondering if Peter Buck can listen to this record twice in a row and not get a headache. Is it just the CD or is the vinyl better? It's too bad as there are some really good songs here. You're probably wondering just how bad the loudness is on this disc... for those who have the Reveal CD, try this experiment. Try listening to Accelerate and then Reveal just right after. The first song on Reveal (The Lifting) will feel (or sound) like a breath of fresh air. It happened to me with my disc changer and I was stunned by the clarity of that CD.     Anyway, if you're a true REM fan, you probably have this already. Hopefully, if ever this record gets remastered they will find a way to fix the awful loudness.

0743298039|5.0|I hadn't anticipated enjoying this book so much. It starts out a little dark but very intriging. I think the author is a fabulous writer and draws you in quickly. I spent a lot of time trying to guess what was going to happen and failed. The end was a surprise. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this book. It was our book club read and I am anxious for our meeting to see how everyone else feels. There are questions at the back of the book for bookclubs as well as a suggestion to read Jane Eyre following this book.

0061914177|5.0|I am currently in a live ustream with Gary and with so much amazing new things going on, he stepped up and asked how many people have left a review.  He did get a lot of no's.  I will first say, I am sorry I did not write a review earlier.  I did drive 10 hours to meet Gary and get my book signed.    First off, I have read this book once and am about to re read it.  I loved it.  It's very detailed and to the point.  I enjoy how it really is a blue print to follow.  Now you don't have to follow this, but it's good to compare with your own experiences to see how well you really are crushing it.    I am a college student.  I have given this book as gifts to other college students.  A big goal is to give lectures using this book before I graduate to help show people how to use these tools to their advantage in crushing it and hustling.    I give this book a five star rating.  I am working on a more in depth review on the book/vlog/audio version.    Thanks for being a great human being Gary and I look forward to getting to visit with you again in the future.      Luke

0061703257|5.0|I read this book in 24 hours; couldn't put it down.  Like others have said: I didn't see the ending coming at all! The author created a brilliant plot without the use of gratuitous details that tend to weigh down most writers today. I appreciate that the author trusts his audience's imagination to create the images in their own mind; while still doing an excellent job of detailing the setting and mood. Excellent read!
B000WYCF6Q|2.0|I mounted this mirror on the fork first but because it was far from my eyes and quality of the mirror was not that good, I actually couldn't see much. Then I mounted it on the bar - it was better that way, closer to me and I could see better, but still because of the distortion of the mirror, I couldn't see exactly what was behind me - unless the cars behind had headlights on, it was difficult to figure them out. What they have on the picture is incorrect - you can't see a car that clear.  Gave two stars (rather than just one) because it was easy to mount, and it seem to handle bumps quite well - i.e. I didn't have re-adjust the mirror despite the bumpy ride. Nonetheless, I returned it.
0307387178|4.0|Jon Krakauer warns us in the \\"Author's Note\\" that he's not \\"an impartial biographer\\" but that he makes a good faith effort to \\"minimize\\" his \\"authorial presence\\" in \\"Into the Wild\\" in spite of himself.  Usually, I'd applaud such an effort, but one of the most fascinating things about \\"Into the Wild\\" is Krakauer.  He confesses to being \\"haunted by the particulars of the boy's starvation and by vague, unsettling parallels\\" to his own life, and this haunting is as compelling as any ghost story you will ever read.  Throughout the book, it seems that Krakauer discovers more than a kindred spirit in Chris, he discovers his doppelganger.  His skillful reconstruction of Chris' adventures and dogged investigation into his death reminds one at times of an amnesiac trying desperately to discover his own identity.<br /><br />Krakauer and McCandless are souls moved by ideals.  Words aren't \\"merely\\" words for them.  Words are transubstantiated upon utterance or transcription into the reality they represent.  This has always been a rare belief but it is almost unheard of today.  Unfortunately, about the only folks these days who truly seem to \\"take words to heart\\" and make the evening news are religious zealots bent on others' destruction.  Chris was zealous, but for the most part his doctrines touched people's lives in positive ways.  His family, of course suffered horribly both when he disappeared and when he was found dead, and Krakauer does not shy away from this reality.  He illuminates the damage McCandless did to his family with as many gut-wrenching details as his testimony of McCandless' salvation of Ron Franz.<br /><br />Idealism by definition isn't practical.  So it's not surprising that McCandless entered the wilderness ill prepared for survival.  It's not surprising that he lit a stack of cash on fire or that he spent so much time intently labeling what he saw in nature and in life like some 19th-century explorer.  Krakauer understands this and summons the ghosts of explorers, hermits, climbers and adventurers to stand by McCandless' side, proving to the reader that Chris' actions, while brash and in the end disastrous, were not unprecedented or without context.  He opens McCandless' books and shows us the notes in the margins.  He allows us to watch Chris' mom gently lift a patched pair of jeans and breathe in the memory of her son.  It is this extra work, this extra effort that makes \\"Into the Wild\\" so valuable.  We are fortunate that Krakauer could not distance himself from this story.

0316069906|5.0|Disclaimer: I'm not a vegetarian (yet, but probably soon). I do enjoy meat. I'm certainly not an animal activist, and one recent post on my Facebook account (before reading the book) was \\"PETA= People Eating Tasty Animals\\".    Having said that, my opinion is that if everyone in the U.S. read this book, the world be a better place.     As Amazon customers, we search endlessly for those rare gems, the books that are entertaining, engrossing, and yet life-changing at the same time. Books you can't stop thinking about. Those books only appear once in a great while.     This is one of those books. It's loaded with facts, but it's not preachy. It's not JUST that eating meat is cruel. We already know that. So why put yourself through the tedious facts yet again?    Well, that's not what this book is about. You could say that it's about a father's love for his son. Or his grandmother's odd food habits learned in the Depression and the Holocaust. About his father's culinary experiments. And yes, about his dog.    It's also about the people who inhabit the \\"food chain\\", the people between the animal and the meat on your plate. Those who wanted to speak on the record were presented in their own voice.    These are the characters that inhabit the book. It's a book about food. But since many of us eat meat at every meal... well, we need to confront what it means to eat animals.    Even if you choose to ignore every fact in this book, it's reasonable to ask ourselves what it means to eat meat. One argument that sticks with me is, why do we eat pigs and not dogs? Pigs are just as intelligent (if not more so) than dogs. Millions of stray dogs are euthanized every year, so why not use them as meat instead of tossing them into the trash? Why try to control the dog population instead of allowing them to breed freely and \\"harvesting\\" the strays? Cheap meat! Free range, too. Since they are already near human population centers, transporting them would also be cheaper and have less of animpact on the environment (\\"eat local\\").    By the end of this argument, I was thinking, \\"yeah, that makes sense, I could eat dogs\\". And then you go \\"eww\\"... and then when you substitute \\"pigs\\" for \\"dogs\\"... the whole book is like this. You have no choice but to engage with this book. If you're going to eat meat, fine (I had some chicken yesterday, as a matter of fact, because I'm weak), but are you going to fully consider and confront what it means to do that, or are you going to repress it and let it fester in your subconscious, ricocheting and feeding off the other repressed, uncomfortable ideas you've got locked up in there?    (By the way, did you notice the near absence of facts in that argument?)    Isn't this why we read books in the first place? To discover more about ourselves and possibly question our relationship to the world? (another disclaimer: like Mr. Foer, I also majored in philosophy)    Is it a happy, comforting book? No. But neither is Stephen King, and he sells a lot of books, right? But that's fake horror. You can laugh that off because none of it's real. Let's see how you deal with true horror and evil.    My wife and I already buy humane meat (and no, free range and cage free and all that nonsense is NOT HUMANE). We buy directly from the couple that raises the chickens, the chickens are out pecking in the yard every day, and they are slaughtered at a kosher facility. We also buy the highest humane ratings we can find at Whole Foods.    These are still only rationalizations. There's still the damage to the environment to consider. Ask yourself, are you the kind of environmentalist that sends $25 to WWF once in a while, or are you willing to put your mouth where your money is?    Do we love our meat enough to eat, well, not OUR OWN dog (our beloved Fluffy!), but ANOTHER ANONYMOUS dog if it's humanely raised and slaughtered? If the only meat you could eat were dogs, would you eat meat then? If not, what's the difference between a dog and a pig? Or a cow?    Now think about this. What if that dog was not humanely \\"harvested\\"? What if, instead of a quick painless death, you were to slam a meat hook into that dog's face and drag it into the pen until it stops struggling (as we do with large fish)? Or, what if you were to flatten it in a cage so that it couldn't stand up and cut off its paws (without painkillers) so that it couldn't scratch the other dogs, and yank out its teeth so that it couldn't bite the other dogs? Or what if, when a dog is too \\"damaged\\" to \\"harvest\\" (they are called \\"downers\\" in the industry), they left them out to die of exposure and starvation, because they don't want to spend the money on a mercy killing? Would you eat dogs then?    What if there were dogs mixed in with the cows and pigs, and we randomly shoot into the pens, killing a few dogs in the process? Or, what if we end up killing more dogs than cows? Or we merely wound the dogs, but left them out there to die on their own? Oh well, we call that \\"bycatch\\". A lamentable but necessary consequence, given our method of \\"harvest\\". Are other methods of \\"harvest\\" available? Yeah, but not as cheap. (For 1 pound of shrimp caught, 26 pounds of \\"bycatch\\" gets tossed back. If the bycatch is not dead yet, it will die soon. Is the bycatch death a painless one? No.)    Why do we put people in jail for organizing dogfighting, when every day far worse goes on within the slaughterhouses? Animals getting \\"processed\\" while they're still alive. Sadistic workers torturing animals for fun, because there's no oversight at the slaughterhouses. Even the USDA doesn't monitor what goes on when the animals are killed. We don't put these people in jail because when it's done for a corporation, that's OK.    OK, one more tidbit. Chickens are separated into \\"broilers\\" and \\"layers\\". They are genetically different, and you can't use one for the other. OK, now, if you're a \\"layer\\"... well, we know that only females lay eggs, right? What happens to the males? Before reading the book, I always thought they got slaughtered for food, but why be reasonable when you can be CRUEL. If you want to know, search Google for \\"huff post chickens\\", and view the first video (the title gives a small hint of the subject matter: \\"Chicks being ground up alive: Video\\").    It's difficult to imagine designing a more insanely cruel system. I won't further belabor the details. Stephen King is a master of horror, but his worst characters rate favorably to Mother Teresa compared to the food industry. What's a few murders compared to billions of painful agonizing deaths every year? Actually death is a relief when it comes, it's their life that's agony.    For the food industry spokesfolks out there, I say, let us tour some of your facilities, of our own choosing. No? 'Nuff said. Go away.    And after all this, I still eat meat? Yeah, I do. I'm a hypocrite. A big one. I am an end customer and I feed money into this system, allowing it to happen. I need to change. This book will help.    Please don't let my ranting review stop you from reading the book. Mr. Foer is a far more skilled writer than I am. Unlike my clumsy attempts in this review at arguing against the food industry, his book is not full of bullet points about why the food industry sucks.     Instead, it's about something more important, about who we say we are (as human beings), the stories we tell ourselves, and how hard it is to live up to those stories. And who we want to be.    AND, the book is enjoyable, well-written, funny at times, and reads at times like an action or horror novel. Buy it, read it, and enjoy.    UPDATE: I am giving up all meat for Lent (even though I'm an atheist). We'll see how that goes.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|Believe you me when I say that I was very very skeptical and cynical before I started watching this version of Emma.  I had my doubts about Romola Garai and being such a big fan of Jermey Northam, I did not think Jonny Lee Miller would make a good Mr. Knightley.  I was proved wrong on both accounts.    This new version of Emma is absolutely delightful!  Some reviewers have called this Emma \\"skivvy\\" and too modern, but I found her to be fresh and lovable.  She is energetic and full of life.  Romola Garai portrays the many emotions of Emma so very well.    And as for Mr. Knightley--KUDOS to Jonny Lee Miller!!  I really did have my doubts--I just keep seeing him in Trainspotting--but he played this role like he was born to play it.  He begins to grow on you as Mr. Knightley right away.  The chemistry between the two is so very sweet.  The scene when they dance together at the Crown Ball was my absolute favorite--even more than the proposal.  I've watched that scene about a 100 times now (NO JOKE) and it makes my heart swell every time.    The supporting characters do a great job as well--though I prefer the last adaption's Miss Bates (PORK!).  The music is beautiful as well as the scenery.  Overall, so very well done!  Yay!

B001675SOY|5.0|I recently listened to \\"Hatebreeder\\" and \\"Follow the Reaper\\" side by side, and while I have concluded from them that \\"Children of Bodom\\" are a much better band then \\"Are You Dead Yet\\" had me believe at first, it is \\"Hatebreeder\\" that gave me chills down my spine!  Every song stands out on this album and the neoclassical guitar and keyboard work sets this band apart!  While other offerings may be more hardcore, this album is the most musically interesting!
B00005MNP8|5.0|Insanely creative at a particularly insanely creative period in rock music history, Blondie's \\"Parallel Lines\\" delivered on all the promise that you heard on their first two albums.    If you're looking at this thinking that every song is going to sound like \\"Heart Of Glass\\", then go somewhere else. This is musical diversity at its best.    It has great melodies, great beats, great humor, and great emotion.    Are there any female singers today that have the combined looks, intelligence, creativity, stage presence and vocal abilities that Debbie had in her prime? Don't think so!
0399230033|5.0|This is a perennial contender for inclusion in storytime with my daughter.  Unlike most children's books, this story is driven entirely by the images.  At first I was perplexed about how to tell the story -- hey, there's nothing here to read!  Then I got into the spirit of it, drawing out what was happening from each image, adding dialogue, talking about what was happening and where the characters were going, etc.  It's a lot of fun.  The story is largely the same each telling, but it's always a little different since you aren't using the same text each time.  Each page has enough detail and surprises (e.g., the balloon that appears on each page, however tiny) to reward returning to the book again and again.      I highly recommend this book as part of every parent's storytime library.

Freek Out would seem an apt word here, but it is not: this album has a reason for every use of noise, dissonence and feedback<br /><br />Bands from Hawkwind in the 1970s to Hovercraft in the 90s owe their careers in spirit if not direct musical influence to Saucerful Of Secrets
1402720602|5.0|If you were to purchase the Cumpiano manual and this book, you would have about 95% of what you really need to build a classical guitar (well, knowledge wise, anyway).  Not only is this book loaded with high quality photos and information, but it is also hardbacked with a nice dust jacket and high quality paper.  In short, it would make a nice 'coffee table' book when not serving it's intended purpose.     It is not the 'end all' perfect reference, however, some steps and information are missing or are not covered in great detail, but in short, for around $20, you can't go wrong and I am sure you will really look at it as money well spent.

It can help us all to grow spiritually, no matter what religion we adhere to, and can help us to find the way to reach or at least get a lot closer to the goal of peace, love, interdependence, and understanding.    It is a book to be read multiple times because there is always at least a couple of nuggets that you will uncover each time you read it.     It would be great to connect with others who find the same benefits and learn more and share to help each other grow.

0312370849|2.0|This would have been a great book to have borrowed from the library.  I'm a little disappointed that I paid money for it.  The story of Sarah is gripping, well told, and was news to me.  I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out what happened to little Sarah and her little brother.  **SPOILER ALERT**  Once this mystery was solved, however, and the secondary mystery of the Tezac/Sarah tie, then the rest of the novel was just plain silly.    For the last 24 pages, we knew what Juala named her daughter.  But we had to drag through 24 pages of stilted writing, with the author using every stupid device available to NOT say the name of her daughter.  Worse even than the first part of the book where she worked so hard at not telling us \\"the girl's\\" name.  Too affected for me.  By the time she \\"revealed\\" the names, we already knew them.  Does she think we're that stupid?  I guess hundreds of people thought this was an ok way to develop the climax.      This is a book I ran through, and when finished, wanted to throw across the room.  It could have been so great.  I have to agree with other reviewers that said that the story of Sarah was beautifully done, and far too short.  The story of Julia, which the author seems to feel is more important, is weak and poorly done.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Stop! Spoiler alert! Do not read on if you don't want any spoilers! Let The Right One In is not a typical vampire movie.There is nothing typical or \\"Twilightish\\" in it or  a silly Vampire in a cape running around in a castle with a coffin hidden in it,intsead what one has is a thoughtful,disturbing tragedy and a film that strangely enough seems to have strange similarities to the 1980's Swedish film Barnens O.Both Barnens O and this film are Swedish films set in the early 1980's and have characters that look amazing similiar as they traverse a strange landscape which ultimately end in a rather strange life or death struggle in a pool-the sililarities are really amazing. In both stories,the main character is told through the eyes of a 12-year old boy.In Let The Right One In the boy is named Oskar. He happens to live next door to a girl who turns out to actually be not a girl or a boy -though a boy who is not a boy since Eli is undead,sexless  and has been been this way since the late 1700's using his power of mesmerism to find one caretaker after another to care for him since he was casterated and left for dead centuires ago and them \\"saved\\" by a Vampire and given undead life.What one is left wondering most about by the end of the film is if Eli has idenditified himself as a girl,does he love Oskar or is Oskar just under a spell to become the next caretaker for a creature that just uses all humans for his purposes?.Does Oskar chose to ignore the fact that his \\"love\\" is a boy and not a girl and not even alive or is more of the Vampires power over him? And what of Oskar's fate-is he doomed to age and grow old while Eli remains young forever and will Oskar come to the same fate as Eli's older caretaker...alot to think about in this film.If you like this film see Barnens o- the stories are both set in Sweden in the early 80's with two boys who seem so very much alike and who look alike as well in taking a surreal journey.

If you don't know who Harry Potter is, then this DVD would not make any sense to you. Continuing story of Harry and his friends.

I'd read his 'American Gods' before because it was touted 'as good as Stephen King' or my money back.<br /><br />It was as good, in my opinion, but that also meant his writing was on the dark side.<br /><br />When I picked up Stardust I expected something that was more of a YA fantasy read, but it's definitely not that.<br /><br />A literary-type fantasy tale geared toward the adult reader (and maybe the oldest YA readers), this story was interesting, but took some work to get through.<br /><br />Normally I don't bother to criticize choice of character name, but Tristran tripped me up in my mind and aloud as I read this book...and I did read it both ways.<br /><br />The characters weren't as well developed as I'd have liked, but as a cast they worked well.<br /><br />Having watched the movie first definitely ruined me for this book as there were things I was waiting to see play out that never did...I was disappointed by that.<br /><br />Some of the 'missing' bits made me think the book story was much weaker for it. More like a lengthy short story than a novel.<br /><br />Overall, it was a decent time-passing read, but nothing that thrilled me.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|I recognize that this is not intended to be anything more than entertainment, therefore, I enjoy it. It is bloodily gruesome, profane and gratuitous (sexuality and nudity), however, the folks at STARZ are attempting to depict the way life was prior to the collapse of the Roman Empire. Historically speaking, that period was not for the moral or the squeamish. I think that this show may be overblown, but the acting is solid, the action sequences are fun and the story is entertaining. Go into it with a tongue firmly planted in your cheek and you may enjoy this show.

We played all ten parts over the weekend and I was stunned at the quality and the realism as I never recalled the broadcast version ever looking this good and to get to viewing them in a running format over two days leaves a strong impact.  As a Veteran of Vietnam Era myself and fully understanding war is hell no matter what generation or where it takes place this presentation was stunning and worthy of repeat viewing on occasion as a reminder of the evil of man against mankind visits upon us historically again and again.  There's a part of this story telling that weaves a comraderie that soldiers share in such a way I've never observed outside the military and sticks with you the rest of your life.    Bravo to Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg to tell a story that's as genuine today as it was then as there seemingly will always be Hitlers that hunger to control and reign Supreme at the expense of the weak. Amazing that you could gather young actors that weren't alive during that action and recreate a portrayal appearing so genuine.

B002E9LHX4|5.0|There are lots of books were the protagonist is ultra-human. Whether it be Heinlein's Uber Mensch or Doyle's \\"Sherlock Holmes\\", the classical Achilles, or a Manga vampire-like creature, literature (good and bad) is full of them. What really separates the Good books and Bad books that have such people is whether the protagonist pulls a solution out of his rear end, or whether we've been methodically led to each achievement, ready and primed for him/her to do their 'stuff'.<br /><br />Kvothe's story, in Rothfuss' \\"Name of the Wind\\", falls into the latter category. Kvothe is a character that can do many things well, but none of them can come as a surprise or as unbelievable if you've been paying the least bit of attention to the story. Rothfuss brilliantly prepares the reader to understand how each feat was achieved. And honestly, it's been a long while since I have read a book that was so well conceived and derived. It is simply brilliantly micro-managed.<br /><br />Now, some of you might be looking at the book size and thing 'egads' that's a lot of words. Let me tell you that the book is a quick read. I mean, I'm as slow as molasses when it comes to words per minute, and I finished it in a few days.<br /><br />The story is told as a memoir, but the book doesn't start at that point. It starts in it's own 'present' and then for it's own reasons goes into the flashback. When I first read the 'present' chapter I was somewhat discouraged, and thought that in all likelihood, what I had in my hands was an average sort of book. But that was not the case.

0061876747|3.0|How many ways can you say formulaic and derivative? Let me count the ways. I got this book because I've sort of liked things Boyd wrote in the past (e.g., On the Yankee Station, a long time ago), and I ran across a good review of it in the Times, and I was on the BART and had just finished my last book and my Kindle was sitting there with a live connection, soooooooo I downloaded it. Boom. $9.99 or $12 or whatever it is now that the pricing has destabilized like corn prices at the Kremlin.<br /><br />From the moment the book starts, two things are apparent. First, Boyd is a good writer. His rhythm is nice, the sentences flow, action follows action in a logical sequence, the prose is not purple, etc. Even the character development is good -- a little off on on a number of the peripheral characters, but Adam was definitely well-done, as was his female copper girlfriend, and Mhouse, and the SAS thug was realistic (from the standpoint of fictitious characters, anyway). However, the head of the pharmaceutical firm (Rilke) was terrible, and so was his silly English counterpart who somehow let his firm be taken over by someone who bought a 20% stake -- I'm sorry, that just doesn't happen, and it sounded a sour note in the whole story.<br /><br />The second point that was oh so obvious, was that the plot was flat out dumb. Oh, the idea was intriguing, but the execution was dumb. You don't kit yourself out as a homeless guy on $87 with a bedroll and cooking utensils and then luck across the one spot in London that NO OTHER BEGGAR HAS EVER THOUGHT OF STAYING right after seeing a murder and running away from being killed yourself, nor does anyone's beard and hair grow in so lustrous and thick in 3 days that no one can recognize you from your picture on the telly, nor do blind beggars rake in $200/day day-in-and-day-out, nor do homeless shelters at churches serve \\"generous\\" portions of delicious food, nor is it nearly so simple to step into someone else's life simply by shaving your head and wearing a little goatee. The list of dramatic defects could go on for a bit, but I don't want to rant (too much), and I still liked the book alright.

B0030L2BWG|3.0|\\"Graceling\\" has been highly recommended to me by a number of people and so I have to say that I was stunned that I didn't find it to be the fantastic read that everyone else did. What makes this even harder to understand is that I read Cashore's \\"Fire\\" first and quite liked it.<br /><br />My first observation was that I was over 100 pages into the book before anything of note seemed to happen. Yes, there was the evil king, and there were the sidekicks, the introduction of the love interest, and the introduction of a truly fascinating world, but honestly even at 150 pages I could have put the book down and walked away.<br /><br />The writing on a technical level was okay. The descriptions were apt enough, but the character development seemed underdone, even for YA. (\\"Fire\\" fairly blazed in comparison and certainly had a better romance)<br /><br />Overall, it's worth reading, but I'd have to warn anyone that there is a chance that you'll have to grind through some pages before the pace picks up. Some of the action scenes require a little imagination to figure out what's going on and towards the end you'll need to suspend your belief to accept what happens.
0307389839|5.0|One of my friends gave me his copy of A Wild Sheep Chase in 1992, and I immediately became a lifelong Murakami fan. If you're one of those people who saw this book and immediately thought \\"Hey, that's like the Ray Carver title . . . \\" then you probably will like this book quite a bit, not only because Murakami translates Carver stories into Japanese, but because they share some otherworldly affinity derived from booze, bars, and odd relationships. Which is, I suppose, an odd comment to make about a book which is ostensibly about running, but the book is more like a memoir that involves a lot of personal stories about running interspersed with a good deal of autobiography about other aspects of Murakami's life. If you don't run, however, or if you despise running, then this is probably not the book for you. I run a lot, so I can relate to Murakami talking about running his 6 miles every day no matter what else is going on in his life, and running 12 miles if he misses a day, and even letting his obsessive-compulsive side take over and running 18 miles if he somehow manages to miss two days' training in a row. While I wouldn't put this up there with any of his novels, if you are a fan, this is definitely on the must-read list.
031606792X|4.0|Well I must say I have enjoyed the Twilight saga more than I thought I would, and even though this final installment dragged in some places, and could have been shorter for my personal liking, I enjoyed it. Weird, though it was, I enjoyed the twists and turns, and did not see some of the plot twists coming. That said, I enjoyed the series and give this one four stars, though I believe I enjoyed the first three much better over all.
6305692572|5.0|This movie is a lost gem, and should have gotten Meg Ryan an award. There was very little wrong with this film and so much right out there. Needless to say I liked the acting by all and the storyline.  This was not a chick flick but a movie of substance a deep raw emotion. It is a timeless film.
159102594X|1.0|I was very interested in finding this book and eager to begin reading it.  My library had at least 6 people before me put it on hold so I thought it had to be good.  I will admit I couldn't finish this book. (about only the 2nd book I can say that about.)  While not a bad piece of writing it never really drew me in and got me interested.  Logen Ninefingers was probably the only character I was interested in seeing his plight the others I had a difficult time finding their pulse much less their interest in the story. I think Jezal was the absolute most boring character and there was too much build up about his self absorbed character (we get it already!)    When I got interrupted and put it down I was left wondering what would happen next and digging time out of my schedule to read again.  Amazon recommended it to me because I liked George R.R. Martin and I can see the resemblance and how some might like it, but it was much too dry for me.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|James Cameron's Avatar does for science fiction movies what Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight did for action thrillers in 2008. Both of these pictures raise the bar as to what must be considered entertainment and expand on the notion of a movie-going experience, not to mention the fact that both films blur the boundaries of their respective genres.    Like The Dark Knight, Avatar is a movie that refuses to be defined by labels, a movie that is so delightfully entertaining that it makes the viewer question why they have settled for so little during their previous movie-going experiences.    Simply put, Avatar is a movie of epic proportions. It's a film that boggles your mind not by its complexity but by the strength of its creator's imagination and willingness to push the envelope to previously unforeseen depths.    It's clearly evident that James Cameron spared no expense in filming Avatar, but he didn't do it for the sake of overspending. The world he conjures up, that of a different planet with an indigenous population that speak their own language, deserved tremendous scope - from CGI filming, to humongous battle scenes, to blowing things up, to costume and makeup design that must've made daily routine a nightmare on the set.    You might've heard the critics claim that Avatar's plot is unsatisfactory. Although it might be the case that the plot is very simple, the visual storytelling more than makes up for the simplicity of the story. Visually, it's hard to find a more worthwhile movie to see in theaters. Not only did Cameron reinvent the way 3D movies are filmed, he recreated the way they look on the big screen. Then again, I would even go so far as to argue that the world that Cameron created in Avatar is so rich, so gratifying and so magnificent, that the actual plot of the movie is secondary, at best.    As someone who thinks Titanic is the one of the most overrated movies of our time, I found the incredible vision of the legendary filmmaker compelling, tosay the least. It's hard to fathom that the man who was responsible for dragging the viewer through a sappy love story can envision a world this richly textured.    If there ever was a movie that must be watched in theaters, specifically, on an IMAX screen, Avatar is definitely that film.    Is Avatar the smartest film you'll ever see? Hardly. Is it a film of Academy Award caliber? Definitely. Is it a breathtakingly beautiful film that you'll want to watch again and again? Absolutely! In fact, I'm going back to experience it in IMAX 3D as soon as I can.

B0023P1D8S|4.0|As someone else reported this isn't remastered like a few other import versions but it does have some very rare songs on the second disc.  I now have this edition and the several other of this truly classic cd. This is the one that influenced all the hard dark metal that was to come down the pike. This metal is about the dark side but it's artists weren't devil worshippers or deviants.  Just metal heads making some of the best hard rock of all time.  I would say that this is worth owning especially if all you had was a single disc warner brothers edition.  Sabbath is a band that reminds me of classic horror movies and their music is nice and sludgy with great guitar work from it's lead guitarist. Ozzy Osbourne also lays down really cool vocals on this one. This disc is a hard rock masterpiece that led the way into the future of darker metal stylings and will last far into the future because of it's power and place as forerunner of the metalized future.  This version is worth owning because both discs sound good and nowhere else will you get the rarities.  You can always buy the remastered version too, this is worth owning two versions of.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|Her voice and music are pleasant. I don't think anything is ground breaking here, but I do enjoy her music once and a while. 3 Stars people. Nothing more, nothing less. She is talented.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|First, let me say that what goes on in this movie is very much like a real haunting, but you can see this info on Ghost Hunters and other TV shows. That makes this movie nothing special. I've personally experienced water turning on by itself, lights coming on and off by themselves, sounds of drawers opening and closing, doors opening and closing, objects moving around the room, the bed shaking, scratching noises in the walls, whispers, and footsteps in the attic.  I've also awakened to find my eyes have been open for hours and, when I was little, I would walk in my sleep occasionally. Most of these occurrences, I can chalk up to the same conclusion I had regarding this movie--psychokinetic energy. It is very similar to poltergeist activity, only the energy comes from you.    The main characters decide to move in with each other. The woman having previously been aware of some unusual haunting-like behavior having gone on around her, warns her boyfriend of this unsafe possibility. He is fascinated and buys a video camera to see if they can catch activity on tape. Various bumps in the night occur, generally while she is sleeping. They do contact a psychic, who is too afraid to deal with the problem. They try various ways to prove the existence of an actual entity in their house, but the woman is afraid to press the issue and possibly anger the being. The ending was what I expected. If you liked the Blair Witch movies, you probably will find this an enjoyable viewing, but it really doesn't even rank up there with those movies. It is more like an amateur video you would see on You Tube, just a home video that is poorly edited.
B00192IV0O|3.0|I'm not going to totally bash this, but it seems that this band became so corporate. I cringe everytime I watch them perform live because it's embarassingly bad. That being said it's not a bad album by all means. A lot of effects behind their voices though.

0920668364|1.0|I bought this book hoping for a lovely tale of how a mother loves her child, well, forever.  What I got was a weird, creepy story about a mom who can't let go.  As I read through it for the 1 and only time I realized I hated this book.  First, it didn't rhyme--and I like books that rhyme or have sing-songy verse.  There was too much reading per page for my young children.  Worst was the fact that this mom crept into her son's room while he was sleeping(even as a teenager and stalked him down at his house as a grown man) to hold him (as in picks him up) and repeats the same flat verse...\\"I love you forever, I'll like you for always (what does that mean?), As long as I'm living, My baby you'll be.\\"  At the end of the book my 5yr old suggested we throw it out the window.   I thought about it.  But...we will donate it to anyone who'll take it.  A much better book to get would be, \\"I love you through and through\\".  My kids and I all LOVE that one.
B000002UC5|5.0|40 Years after its release, McCartney's first solo effort still holds up as an example of his great musicianship.  And in my humble opinion, Maybe I'm Amazed, is one of the greatest love songs of all time.  On a personal note, I was 14 the first time I heard this LP, and each time I listen to it, it takes me back to Summer of 1970, to a more innocent time when so much of the world lay ahead to be discovered.  Anyway, this album was a great start to McCartney's solo career apart from the Beatles, and shows why he has been the most consistently successful solo Beatle in his post-Beatle career.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I started off being a big fan of the Sword of Truth books so when I saw they were going to re-invent them with this show I was so happy! The show is a bit different from the books but I love it! I think the actors they picked perfectly correlate with the characters in the book. Some of the storylines are a bit out there but hey it's fantasy, people! It's a great escape from normal everyday drama shows and that reality crap. I love it and the first season is a must-have. The second season has started off great too and I can't wait till they release that DVD set! Plus, who wouldn't get it just for Craig Horner and Bridget Regan?!!!! So hot!
0307454541|2.0|I'm still trying to figure out what novel the back cover reviewers read that led them to labeling it a \\"blazing literary sensation\\" and a \\"legal thriller and...psychological suspense story.\\" Really? Thrillers, I thought, needed to have suspense or action or a threat of doom or psychological intensity, but I guess that's changed. TGWTDT meanders for hundreds of pages as we delve into a family history and a variation of the closed-room mystery. The crime in question is also a part of history, and that takes away any sense of danger or threat, so that it feels like reading a fictional history account, not a thriller at all. There is a mystery here, and because of limited suspect pool it has potential, but it certainly can't carry nearly six hundred pages. I also wonder about the translation--I don't know Swedish but the prose is often robotic and mundane. I came to this novel wanting to believe the hype but it just doesn't deliver.

B00003CXA2|5.0|I think of Forrest Gump (1994) directed by Robert Zemeckis as a fantasy or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is.<br />It's been 15 years since I saw the film for the first time with my 13-years-old son.  We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. We laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent Forrest Gump, the most unusual lead character you can think of. FG was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture, Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play. The film's Oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among the film viewers. Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards and its love. The others, and quite few to that believe that the film is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the American propaganda of mediocrity. They believe that the film's main idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you would achieve the success in your life and even would change the history by simply being at the right place in the right time. How wrong I believe they are. You can't think of Forrest Gump as a real person. He is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for about thirty years of the last Century. Forrest may not be an intellectual prodigy but he was led through life's hardships, by the inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his Country.<br /><br />The movie covers the look at America not only from Forrest's point of view. Another look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture America was very well presented through Jenny's life. Between them two, I believe the film's creators were able to show the changing times and changing face of this country. Technically and visually, the film is a marvel. The best songs of the time that were used in the film soundtrack are great and I don't mind them sound almost all the time -the more the better. Tom Hanks had achieved the very difficult task. His Forrest is simple but not laughable. He is a decent and very good man. It is not easy to create such idealistic character and to make him alive and sympathetic. There is not a single false note in Hanks' performance, and he absolutely deserves the Oscar.<br /><br />When I rewathed the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a great movie. And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump.nother look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture America was very well presented through Jenny's life.

B000EUDAWG|2.0|On the pictures, it looks so real, and because it was from an educational toy company, I expected it to look or move somewhat like a real tarantula.  It's about 4 times the size of the biggest tarantula I've seen.  And it doesn't crawl, it sorta rolls across the floor on wheels while the legs jerk.  That is, if you have a floor smooth enough for the wheels to turn on...The nasty plastic hair smells toxic too...I was disappointed.

This was using the tool for old 33 rpm records.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|Yes, this is the worst project Chris Cornell has ever done.  I really do think it could be saved (at least make it more easy on the ears) if they released the vocal tracks for people to do remixes.  Timbaland seems to be lazy and using a $10 keyboard to produce the sounds and beats.  They sound horrible, cheap, and like it should be used on a mexican soap opera commercial.      But really though, if someone had a bright idea in this project, it would be to allow fan-created remixes.  But oh well, it's too late and this will go down in trash cans as an embarrassment that nobody wants to remember.
B0000640RX|4.0|Finishing my First Blood part 2 review. I'll never get why this got a whole bunch of Razzie nominations it's not a standard dumb action movie if idoits would understand the story of 1st Blood part 2 it's about the treatment of our soldiers & our Government sitting on there hands & doing nothing about it back in the day. Rambo First Blood part 2 is worthy sequel to First Blood.
B002JIEYLW|2.0|I have to agree with the review about not wanting to give this album/cd a bad review. The album itself is one of the greatest of all time. It's the description that falls way short. I bought Vol.4 and the other four re-issues from another site because they were only ten dollars apiece. They are worth less than that. I was expecting as it said a DIGIPAK tri-fold like that of Past Lives or all The Beatles Remasters. Instead there is a booklet that has no new pics. A plastic holder for the cd and nothing new. At least if they were re-issuing they could have enhanced it even a little. Black Sabbath should request these be taken off the market or sell for something like $5.99.

On with the plot Rambo is in prison from the events of First Blood Colonel Trautman comes to tell him about a mission is Vietnam if he accepts he'll get a Presidential pardon he has to go & save POW's the head of the operation Marshell Murdock has been sent by the Government but he has his own agenda Rambo believes something isn't right he even tells Trautmam that the Platoon that Murdock said he was in was never in Nam. It even feels like Rambo is being sabatoged when he parachutes out of the plane he gets stuck his mission is to find POW's but don't engage the enemy just take photos. In the Jungle he meets up with Co Bao I guess she's a lover or something.
0810994739|1.0|I HATE this book with a passion!  If this is what parents and teachers are reduced to in order to get children to read, I'm appalled! The main character doesn't  appear to love anyone in his family.  Neither does he appear to really care for his best friend, whom he tricks into kicking a dumbbell and breaking his toe.  His brother is even worse- locking him in the basement overnight while the brother has an unsanctioned party without parents.  Deceitfulness, manipulation, laziness, disrespect of parents,mediocrity, smugness in one's cleverness at getting out of work, it's all there. Mankind used to have heroes and legends that were held up as worthy examples.  The knights of the Round Table, Hector, Ivanhoe, Joan D'Arc, Gandhi, Dr. King, Sojourner Truth,- there's so many better examples children could read about.  Who are the modern counterparts?  Is it Brittany Spears, Paris Hilton, John Gosselin and the like?  Children today are bombarded with so much junk culture -video games, T.V., even music- that now, more than ever, they need tales that tell moral lessons. Childhood should be a little magical.  Books like this steal that magic away, and leave instead, cynicism and defeatism.  Do yourself and your child a favor, buy instead a book that has a good message, maybe a Cadbury or Newbury award winner.
0330508121|3.0|The Google Story covers major milestones of the company up through its recent push into China, all along the way documenting the eccentric and often unorthodox business approach of its founders: Sergey Brin and Larry Page. The tone is overwhelmingly pro-Google, the only exception being a chapter on click fraud(that mysteriously disappeared in new versions...) that questions Google's practice of charging/reimbursing advertisers. A few good lessons can be learned about entrepreneurship and venture capital, but--albeit an entertaining read, The Google Story feels more like a veiled public relations effort than a subjective and independently researched work.
B0030BOCKK|3.0|Even though his lyrics are up to standard unfortunately the music behind them is not. I'm not surprised \\"Heartkiller\\" was their first release. It's the only catchy song on the whole damn thing. I give it 3 out of 5 stars.
B000BT97AO|4.0|To keep it short and sweet, this is very worth watching if you love eye candy. The fantasy sequences here are truly astonishing at times, and are so colorful and imaginative that they're a treat to watch. Alas, if only the story and acting had done as much for me. I found it pretty slow going, all told, but am duly impressed with the vision presented herein.<br /><br />Allegorical, weird, wild, and yet also somehow a little too ambitious, Mirrormask is certainly worth checking out if you like Henson's firm's imagination enough to put aside story concerns for a couple of hours.<br /><br />Phantasmagorical, plus and minus.

1400032717|5.0|Title: The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon.    Pages: 272.    Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: Maybe 2-3 days.    Days spent reading it: 2 days.    Why I read it: This little gem of a book ended up on one of those \\"BBC must read 100 books of all time!\\" lists. How it ended up there, I'm not quite sure. But that's where it first caught my eye. Then I saw it at the C&MA guest house here in Thailand. Then I saw it at this book sale. When books keep popping up on my radar, I usually try to check them out.    Brief review: I loved this book! It was quirky and unique. I always love unique. The narrator is Christopher. He is a young man with Asperger syndrome (or this is what I surmised, he never comes out and says it). He is socially awkward, but in math and science he is brilliant.    This tale is a murder mystery that Christopher tries to solve. A dog, Wellington, is killed across the street from Christopher with a garden fork. As Christopher begins to unravel the mystery, the heart of this book unfolds. You see what Christopher's condition has meant for his family and the painful decisions that were made. There is a lot of emotional material in the book, but it's slightly removed because it is told through the eyes of Christopher who clearly does not understand the nuances of events that take place around him. Pulling off the emotional material with a slight detachment is Mark Haddon's crowning achievement in this book. You feel great sympathy for Christopher as we journey through this mystery with him.    This book was top-notch. I only wish the author had left out the numerous f-words throughout the book. They were completely unnecessary, even if reflecting the speech of real-life people. Besides that, I highly recommend to anyone who wants a book that is told from a unique perspective, with an incredible protagonist, it is very funny (although Christopher claims to make no jokes, Mark Haddon clearly knows how to set up some great lines), and has a ton of heart. I highly recommend.    Favorite quote: \\"I also said that I cared about dogs because they were faithful and honest, and some dogs were cleverer and more interesting than some people. Steve, for example, who comes to school on Thursdays, needs help to eat his food and could not even fetch a stick. Siobhan asked me not to say this to Steve's mother.\\"    -Actually my favorite quote is the last paragraph of the book, but it wouldn't be fair to write that paragraph now would it?    Stars: 5 out of 5.    Final Word: Curious.
B000O98R7A|5.0|Well, this is one of the band's most known albums, and for many, the best work of this English band. This record is about progressive/experimental music, so if you are looking for something more commercial, this is not for you.
0375836675|4.0|Title: I Am the Messenger by Markus Zusak    Pages: 357    Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 1 year.    Days spent reading it: 2 days.    Why I read it: I enjoyed The Book Thief by Zusak, and I was interested in reading some of his other stuff.    Brief review: I really looked forward to this book because of how much I enjoyed The Book Thief. And while this book was alright, it was not nearly on par with the quality and insight that I know Zusak is capable of achieving. I Am the Messenger is about a young man named Ed who mysteriously receives a playing card in the mail one day with addresses on it. As the story progresses, Ed realizes he must go to these addresses and accomplish some task.     The driving force of the book is Ed accomplishing these missions, which range from heart-warming to butt-kicking. It was a strange mix. The clear message of this book is that normal people can be extraordinary if they open their eyes and address the needs around them.    I had two problems with this book. First is the use of violence in this book. Ed uses violence to accomplish his goals. A mysterious \\"benefactor\\" uses violence against Ed to force Ed to act. It is like there are no other alternatives to violence in these scenarios. I think that is a dangerous message to put into a young adult novel. Second was the ending. I will not spoil it, but the concluding revelations at the end made the rest of the novel weaker. It was just not convincing to me. And unlike some endings, the very premise of this book hung on the ending.    I did enjoy I Am the Messenger, but I thought it could have been better. There are moments of wonderful writing and story-telling. The characters are believable and you are clearly invested in their lives by the end of the tale. With a stronger ending this book could have dazzled me, but instead it was just middle of the road.    Favorite quote:  She soon says, 'You're my best friend, Ed.'  'I know.'  You can kill a man with those words.  No gun.  Nobullets.  Just words and a girl.    Stars: 3.5 out of 5.    Final Word: Average.
B0000025C0|4.0|... that was posed by someone else I know: Where does the first album end and the second album begin?<br /><br />Okay, serious now. Tom Scholz suffers from a rare problem, kind of like Santana: a fully developed sound. This isn't a bad thing, mind you, but it does tend to create a larger issue for a musician: Where do you go from here? If all the \\"growth\\" in developing your sound is done before you begin recording, all your music will tend to sound very similar. That is the problem Tom has here and also on the third album.<br /><br />The songs are a mix of great and merely \\"routine\\", which is to say they are all good, just that some are not as good as the great ones, which we've all heard on the radio for years. In other words, Tom's standard in writing is consistent here on this album as well. And the production values are well done here, too.<br /><br />I guess since there was so much time between the release of the first and the second, I expected more, that all the songs should have been awesome. Oh, well. As a song writer myself, I understand that they can't all be amazing. But each song is good in its own right. So in that sense, again, a very consistent album.
0553278398|5.0|Title:  Prelude to Foundation by Isaac Asimov    Pages: 528.    Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 3 years.    Days spent reading it: 5 days.    Why I read it: I started reading the Foundation novels awhile back, and at some point I asked for them for Christmas. I received this great book, but was unable to read it due to my somewhat strange habit of almost always reading books in the order the author wrote them. Although it is a prequel, Prelude to Foundation is one of the last Foundation novels Asimov wrote. SO I had to get through 5 others before I could even start this one.    Brief review: Prelude to Foundation is chronologically the first book in the Foundation series. The story centers on the character of Hari Seldon, who is by far one of the better characters Asimov has created. He is memorable, likeable, and unique.    Although Prelude to Foundation is one book, its really a series of short stories as Seldon travels across Trantor fleeing from Imperial power that wants to control Seldon so it can control the future. As I stated in my previous posts, Asimov does great short stories (Foundation, the first book the author wrote in the series, was actually a group of four short stories that were published in a Sci-Fi magazine). He has interesting ideas and fun places to visit. However, in my opinion, Asimov struggles with longer plots. He has trouble bringing a longer book to a satisfying conclusion. So in this book the individual chapters are great, but the overarching plot is shoddy.    In Prelude, we see Seldon in a number of different environments that he explores, then leaves. However, it seems like nothing is really gained at any one location. But the stories in those locations are interesting. In one place all the people have their heads completely free of hair, including their eyebrows. Asimov uses stories like these to discuss culture, anthropology, taboos, and how humans rise or fall to these social forces. Some of the time its interesting. Other times I was bored or tired of being told for the hundredth time how humanity needs to grow out of its prejudices (whether they be gender, social, economic, race, etc. related).    The overarching story was a little weak. Once again Asimov oddly ties in his foundation series to his Robots series. I found the connection forced and strange yet again (as I discussed here about Foundation and Earth). But this book was much more readable and more enjoyable than Foundation's Edge or Foundation and Earth. I would recommend it as a worthy successor to the Foundation series, even if its not quite as good as some of the earlier works.    Favorite quote: \\"Thalus, Emmer--A sargeant in the armed security forces of the Wye sector of Ancient Trantor.

Final Word: Foundational.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|I won't go deep, but simply say that if you are a true fan, this will add to the mystery, answer a few questions, create more questions and infuriate you to no end.

0553381687|4.0|Title: A Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin<br /><br />Pages: 837<br /><br />Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: About 3 years.<br /><br />Days spent reading it: 2 weeks.<br /><br />Why I read it: A Game of Thrones is one of my favorite board games. (Check out the board game description at boardgamegeek.com ) The friends who introduced us to the board game seemed to also love the books. So I decided to check it out. Every page I read, I wanted to play the board game a little more. Luckily I finally got to play this last weekend. I won with House Greyjoy. Pretty happy with that one.<br /><br />Brief review: A Game of Thrones was an incredible introduction to the land of Westeros. It is epic fantasy in the vein of Robert Jordan (The Wheel of Time Series). AGoT (how it is commonly abbreviated in the board game circles) is full of intrigue, action, double-crossing, double-double crossing, crazy plot twists, and deep characters. Interestingly, I've read it is loosely based on the War of the Roses.<br /><br />What I like about AGoT is that the characters are truly interesting. You are drawn into the story through multiple perspectives. I definitely cheer for House Stark; but even their enemies, House Lannister, has interesting characters and motivation for what they do.<br /><br />This book is not for the weak of heart. At 800+ pages it is only the first book in a series of probably 6 or 7 total books. There is plenty of bloodshed, violence, and sexual content to make you skip paragraphs. But the storytelling is top-notch. Few can match Martin in his ability to draw you into the world. He tells an incredible story, with unexpected twists coming frequently. This book will keep you on your mental toes. I highly recommend for the high fantasy crowd. If you do not mind longer epic books, this is your series.<br /><br />Favorite quote: \\"Winter is coming.\\" -House Stark's words.<br /><br />Stars: 4 out of 5<br /><br />Final Word: Epic.
B00005K9QP|5.0|This is the album that \\"started\\" it all, at least that is what they say, whoever they are. The rumoured claim is that someone, after hearing this album, went down into a London subway station and scrawled \\"Clapton Is God\\" on the wall.<br /><br />I grew up during this time, too, though a little younger than these guys. And this was a critical album, without question. While in some ways it sounds quite dated - more due to the production values and the musicians beginning to experiment with \\"new\\" equipment just coming to market, new amps and recording techniques than with the recording process (which is very, very clean here) - the music itself, the songs, are vital, immediate and even desperate at times; all necessary elements of the Blues if you want people to \\"buy\\" what you're \\"selling\\".<br /><br />The performance of any music has to be \\"authentic\\" in order for people to \\"believe\\" you. I'm a musician of over 42 years' experience. Let me tell you, if you play music and don't honestly convey it in a way that says: \\"I own this, I AM this music\\", you will not find much of an audience.<br /><br />At the time of this album's release, the English music scene was awash in Mods and Rockers battling it out with R&B and Rock n Roll respectively. The Blues scene was common to both camps, but separate at the same time. Crossing over into the Blues camp was seen as a betrayal. But somehow Clapton managed to do so without alienating anyone. He did this because his heart was always in the Blues. The Yardbirds was just what paid the bills.<br /><br />This album works because everyone involved is so vested in the creation of this music, in conveying it in a way that had yet to be done succesfully by any band outside the Chicago Blues scene. This album works because these people are living through the music, the music is living through them. They made the vital connection necessary to be able to create the \\"magic\\" so people will see you are serious, and they will buy into it because they know you already have done so yourself.o yourself.
0393312836|5.0|Title: A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess    Pages: 212.    Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 0 days.    Days spent reading it: 3 days.    Why I read it: I enjoy dystopian society novels, like 1984 and A Brave New World. I heard that A Clockwork Orange was in the same vein, so I checked it out.    Brief review:  A Clockwork Orange was a great gem for me to discover. While it can be compared to the types of worlds described in 1984 and A Brave New World, this novel stands on its own for me. I loved the main character of Alex and we are in his mind during the whole novel.    Essentially this book asks one question: What if we could solve all crime committed by humans, but the cost was our free choice? Would the price be too high ? In this novel, Alex is a juvenile punk, and when he gets caught in the act of breaking into a home, he is sent away to prison. While there he is offered a treatment that will get him out of jail in 2 weeks. He takes it, but in the process loses his ability to act out in violence. He gets physically sick when he thinks about hurting someone. He also loses his love for music (one of his few redeeming qualities before his incarceration). He then revisits his previous life, but there are some surprises in store for him as he encounters people who he attacked or knew from his earlier life.    I love how this book explores the big ideas of good and evil as they are presented in humanity. I love how it explores freedom and bondage. I love how the themes could be taught in a theology class and not miss a beat, and a theology class would be all the richer for it. Is this book for everyone? No way. The language is difficult (Burgess made up a kind of teenage slang for the book) and the events include senseless violence and sexuality. But for those willing to get past the first few pages of slang (which oddly enough actually mutes the violence and sexuality present in the pages), the book opens up into a wonderful treat that is both entertaining and philosophical.

B000YJ85BI|4.0|Title: The Last Colony by John Scalzi    Pages: 320    Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 1 week.    Days spent reading it: 2 days.    Why I read it: It is the next book in the Old Man's War series.    Brief review: The Last Colony is the continuation of the story that began in Old Man's War. I have enjoyed the series so far. I love how John Scalzi writes. He has great plot and characters.  And he's funny, which is always wonderful.    In Scalzi's stories, humans are not the only sentient beings in the universe. They are actually a small portion of the universe's population. And all of these alien races are fighting for every scrap of world out there. In order to stop the fighting a coalition has formed. No more colonizing planets, in essence a freeze on colonizing is declared. Anyone who resists is destroyed. So, being stubborn like we are, the humans decide they will not kow-tow to alien forces. The humans plan to establish a colony on a planet called Roanoke. And in a smooth move, when the colonists warp to their new home, they realize that they have been warped to an entirely different planet. The colonists find out they are a part of the galactic power struggle and have been put in hiding to embarrass the coalition. That's when the story really takes off as Roanoke colony pushes the universe to the brink of war. Always fun to read about!    I enjoyed the book a lot. It was not quite as original as Old Man's War or The Ghost Brigade, but it was enjoyable. I look forward to reading more of Scalzi's work. He has a great imagination and is definitely a Sci-Fi author to keep watching.    Favorite quote: \\"Neither Jane nor I were under the illusion that we could create universal harmony through dodgeball, of course. That's a little much to rest on the shoulders of a game played with a bouncy red ball.\\"    Stars: 4 out of 5.    Final Word: Engaging.

0375842209|5.0|Title:  The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.    Pages:  552.    Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf:  6 months.    Days spent reading it:  7 days.    Why I read it:  The book looked interesting, I had seen it a few times in the bookstores we frequent, so I finally picked it up.    Brief review:  I love a unique perspective in a book.  Therefore, when I read the dust-jacket and saw that this book was narrated by Death, I was hooked.    This book starts off a little disjointed, images are flashed quickly, and dropped quickly as Death begins his tale about the Book Thief.  However, as the tale begins to unfold I was sucked in and did not want to let go.    What can I say about this book?  It is a unique telling of Nazi Germany through the eyes of a girl, named Liesel, and her adoptive family who do not buy the Nazi propaganda and help to hide a Jew named Max.  The tale is wonderful, as we see Liesel's life through the eyes of Death.    I must admit, Markus Zusak has entered a very elite group of writers in my life.  I do not cry very often when I read books.  Not even if they are extremely sad.  However a few authors know how to pull my heart strings and make a few tears roll down as I read.  Kate DiCamillo does it to me in all of her books.  And now Markus Zusak.  If you are under the impression that a book narrated by Death about Nazi Germany is going to end with all sunshine and no gloom, look again at the pieces of the puzzle.      The Book Thief will have you praising the virtues of mankind in the midst of despair, as well as cursing the hatred that mankind also possesses.  I would highly recommend this book to just about anyone.  The Book Thief makes us think about love, war, loss, friendship, and the perseverance of men to bring hope to hopeless situations. And these are good topics to think about and discuss with our families and friends.  This book is marketed to young adults, but once again it definitely transcends that genre and can certainly be enjoyed by adults as well.    One side note--This book truly made me think about the people in Nazi Germany.  I guess in my mind there has always been this monolithic idea that all Germans at that time were compliant and empowered Hitler.  I don't know why I have thought this, but The Book Thief brought a fresh perspective and names to the masses of people who were simply living life in Germany under one of the most evil tyrants in history.  Many were forced into compliance.  Some were killed because they dissented.  I did not cheer when bombs were dropped on Germany in this book, I cried.  And that alone was worth reading this book.  It brought a new perspective of war to me.  The Book Thief reminds me that our enemies are human, just like us.  That lesson is just as pertinent now as it would have been during WWII.     Favorite quote:  \\"It kills me sometimes, how people die.\\"  --Spoken by Death.    Stars: 4.5 out of 5    Final Word:  Provocative.

0547258305|5.0|Title: Graceling by Kristin Cashore    Pages: 472.    Time spent on \\"to read\\" shelf:  A month.    Days spent reading it: 2.    Why I read it: My wife really liked this book, and said I would probably like it too.  Susan has a definite influence on my young teen reader literature.  I read all kinds of things she has liked or suggested, and for the most part also like or appreciate them.  Alas, she rarely reads books that I like.    Brief review:    This book was freaking amazing!  I read 100 pages one night, and 370 the next time I picked it up.  I read well into the night in order to finish this book.  I just had to know what would happen next.  This book has love, loss, adventure, betrayal, good vs. evil, super powers, fighting, snowy mountain passes, and underwater caves, plot twists and turns, and a gripping climax.  In short, everything that I like in a good fantasy book.    The title \\"Graceling\\" comes from a unique element in the book.  Some people in this fantasy world are born with special gifts, \\"graces\\", that enhance their abilities in some special way.  Some are graced with fighting, so they fight really well.  Others are graced with some form of mind reading.  Some are born with pragmatically useless (but fun) graces, like tree climbing.  The book centers around Katsa (\\"Kat\\" for short).  Kat is graced with killing.  Yeah, killing. And from the first chapter until the last, this author had my complete attention.      There are great moral questions as Kat begins the book as a thug like character, but who develops a deeper sense of the moral questions before her.  Should she continue to obey her master who demands that she kill or maim people who challenge him?  Does she have a choice in how she lives (and kills)?  Are there ways to combat the evil she is forced to perform?    My only warning for this book is that it would definitely be rated PG-13 for the violence depicted and the cheesy (and thankfully brief) sexual elements in the book.  There is not much described, but it was enough that if it were a movie, I would cover my eyes!    Which brings me to my one concern from this book--marriage and long term commitment are seriously down played in this book.  The main character wants relationship without the commitment.  She sees commitment as being tied down, or stuck in a cage. She wants to roam free, but the conflicting image is that she wants her relationships there when it is convenient for her.   She wants certainty that her love interest is still there when she comes back.  I imagine that the target audience (teenage girls) would hear this message and accept it as a positive way to avoid the commitment of marriage.  If a teenage girl I knew read this book, I would make sure to talk about this particular topic because it is prevalent in the book.    That being said...In conclusion this book was spectacular.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good adventure story.  It is aimed at teenagers but do not let that deter you.  Graceling was a thrill from start to finish.  One of my favorite books of the year.    Favorite Quote:  \\"Her hand had flown out and smashed him in the face.  So hard and so fast that she'd pushed the bones of his nose into his brain.  Ladies in the court had screamed; one had fainted.  When they'd lifted him from the pool of blood on the floor and he'd turned out to be dead, the court had grown silent, backed away.\\"    Stars: 5 of 5.    Final Word:  Extraordinary.
1151097764|5.0|It's hard to believe that 20 years have passed since this book was first published.  I had a chance to read it during the recent blizzard(s) and was pleased to laugh out loud only to realize that we have sunk further into narcissism than this book so scathingly depicted, to no good end.  I actually wonder whether this book would be printed today.  Heaven knows, it isn't politically correct.   Except for the hating white men, particularly wealthy white men, part.  All others portrayed as flawed might not be deemed acceptable for print.  The truth is like kryptonite to narcissists.  They lose all their power....alas!  A great read and a trenchant wit!
B002NPCSJG|5.0|Title: Old Man's War by John Scalzi    Pages: 311.    Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 0 days.    Days spent reading it: 2 days.    Why I read it: I saw Zoe's Tale come out a few months ago in hardback and liked the cover. So I checked into the original book in the series, which was Old Man's War. After doing some checking into it, it sounded like a book I might actually like a lot. So I picked it up and bought it before I took off for Thailand to pass a few nights reading.    Brief review: I absolutely loved Old Man's War. John Scalzi is a witty writer. Sure, he borrows many ideas from Ender's Game, Starship Troopers, and other classic sci-fi books, but that does not make his own book inferior. It is going to be a classic on its own one day, I'm pretty sure.    The plot is simple. We meet our hero at the ripe age of 75 as he is about to enter the military for a 2-10 year stint. Yes, you read that correctly. In this book, military service (in space) is for the old who have already retired. They are taken into space and rejuvenated (I'll let you read the book to find out how). We follow Poole through his training and career in the military (and it's a pretty exceptional career). It is a fun romp that is over all too soon. The pace and point of view reminded me heavily of Starship Troopers (which was written by the master of science fiction Robert Heinlein). But some of the ideas and concepts were pure John Scalzi.    I'm glad I picked this book up, and I look forward to reading the other books in the series (and perhaps Scalzi's other works). He is a great writer and I find him very fun to read.    Favorite quote:    \\"You may refer to me as Ambassador, unworthy though I am of the title,\\" The Consu said. \\"I am a criminal, having disgraced myself in battle on Pahnshu, and therefore am made to speak to you in your tongue. For this shame I crave death and a term of just punishment before my rebirth. It is my hope that as a result of these proceedings I will be viewed as somewhat less unworthy, and will thus be released to death. It is why I soil myself by speaking to you.\\"    Stars: 5 out of 5.    Final Word: Refreshing.
0385523904|4.0|The growing flow of North Koreans fleeing their failed state is at last providing insights into the condition of ordinary people in the DPRK. The hermetic seal maintained so long is beginning to leak; knowledge of the better conditions across the border in China is spreading, and the propaganda of the regime is losing some of its power to guide thinking. Demick, a correspondent for the Los Angeles Times in Asia, has woven together the detailed accounts of a number of different North Koreans as their lives evolved in the north, as they first began to doubt, as they finally fled, and then as they sought to adjust to the vastly different conditions in the South. I found this fascinating and hard to put down as I read it on the Kindle while ill and unable easily to hold a hard-cover book.

0460874551|3.0|Title:  The Tempest by William Shakespeare<br /><br />Pages: 187 (including commentary and notes).<br /><br />Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 2-3 years.<br /><br />Days spent reading it: 1 evening.<br /><br />Why I read it: I was reading some sci-fi books (Illium and Olympos by Dan Simmons) that used characters and plot points from the Tempest as a major element of the book. I figured it was about time that I read a classic Shakespeare and figure out why these characters were used and why someone might use them again in a sci-fi story.<br /><br />Brief review: What an odd play. The Tempest is about a storm that causes a ship to basically wreck on an abandoned island. As we get into the play, we are introduced to the main character Prospero. Prospero has apparently caused this storm to happen and has plans for the people whom he has shipwrecked.<br /><br />It's difficult to say if I liked this play or not. It was very difficult to read. I find Shakespeare brutally difficult to understand, and this play was no exception. His sentences and syntax are so difficult to read its hard to follow what exactly a character is talking about.<br /><br />A major part of this play is Prospero's plans. We are never told explicitly what Prospero's actual plans are. He apparently changes them at some points in the play. He has no advisors and no confidants. The critical introduction to my version of the play says that is what makes this play unique amongst Shakespeare's plays. Prospero is an enigma. He's ambiguous. He's hard to pin down. And what are we to make of his \\"monster\\" Caliban, who serves Prospero but also wants to overthrow him? He repents, but are we to believe his repentance? What are we to understand about love as represented by Miranda and Ferdinand? Can love be setup? Can we recognize our true loves in a matter of minutes? Or seconds? Shakespeare has some unique insights into the nature of humanity, but some of his ideas ultimately seem forced or unnatural to me.<br /><br />I realized once again, I'm not a big fan of Shakespeare. I'm sorry. I just do not think the effort of understanding is worth the payoff. I know, blasphemous, but that's my take on the Bard. I'll stick with my greek tragedies please.<br /><br />Favorite quote:<br />Caliban: \\"Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,/ Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not./ Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments/ Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices/ That, if then had waked after long sleep,/ Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,/ The clouds mehtought would open, and show riches/ Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked/ I cried to dream again.\\"<br /><br />Stars: 2.5 out of 5<br /><br />Final Word: Ambiguous.I'm sorry.

B0035V35P8|3.0|Technically, this movie is awful. The script is poorly paced and the material is extremely shallow even for a kung-fu movie. The special effects are a bit cheesy (although some claim that this is a throwback to the visual effects of old-school kung-fu movies, despite not matching the seriousness of the movie's tone). People that aren't fans of the martial arts genre will be spending their time wondering how this movie even got made.    However...those that don't take movies too seriously and enjoy martial-arts action movies are in for a treat. The fighting scenes are quite good and the cinematography is pretty solid. Fans of old-school ninja films will appreciate the gratuitous violence and blood splatter. The story is seriously one of the worst I've ever seen, but I can appreciate the difficulty in weaving ninja clans into a contemporary setting.    If you're in it for the \\"Fightan and Butt-Kickan\\" then this is your movie...otherwise move along.
B000002KD5|5.0|Gradually altering membership after the departure of Peter Green this album marks not only Fleetwood Mac's first full fruitation of their pop oriented sound but the beginning of the sound that most FM radio listeners. One of the main reasons for this is the addition of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Their writing and singing. Buckingham does bring a lot to this album overall as his \\"Monday Morning\\",\\"Blue Letter\\" and \\"I'm So Afraid\\" add an edgier,more experimental rock style to the mix. Christine McVie also more than makes her mark as a talented keyboardist/composer with her low,smokey vocal style on the lushly textured \\"Warm Ways\\",the more upbeat \\"Over My Head\\" and a collaboration with Buckingham on \\"Sugar Daddy\\". Considering this is he debut with the band Stevie Nicks not only gets three of her own compositions on this album but each one of them is a show stopper. \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Crystal\\" not only both showcase the awkward chordings and dreamy quasi mystical lyricism that would become her songwriting stamp not only on her music with Fleetwood Mac but throughout her solo career. \\"Landslide\\" puts her right up in the league of some of the great confessional singer-songwriters and was later made famous as a re-make on the bands album [[ASIN:B000002NHG The Dance]] decades later. This album endoctrinated Fleetwood Mac into the world of radio pop in a huge way and did so with a lot of creativity to boot,engaging the band in the type of musical transformations other pop/rock bands such as The Beach Boys and The Beatles made in the decade before and that baught them all continued and often renewed success. All pop/rock bands from this point on did,or should've taken cues from this album to build up their careers in the contexts of maintaining creative integrity and having commercial success. That is possibly one of the reasons all of the Fleetwood Mac albums from the late 70's have held up on every front so well as the years have passed.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I had never heard of King Crimson or heard them until I started frequented music forums online. They sometimes get mentioned. You never hear them played on commercial FM stations here in Australia. Wish that would change now that I've heard this album. Classic Rock magazine's spin off \\"Prog\\" had this album listed highly in their reader poll of the greatest prog albums of all time. In such a magazine I also came across the comment that a band member left because they found the music to sound \\"evil\\". Not sure if that was because of this album, but I have to say I can't really hear anything evil here...some of it is sublime. Can't say that I am that familiar with different supposed genres like \\"prog\\" or \\"art\\" rock etc. To me this album is a very pleasant listen. I suppose the use of symphonic elements marks this album as \\"prog\\" in some way. Anyway, the sound quality on this 2004 remaster is brilliant.        The classic track:        In the court of the Crimson King - the entire track runs to 9:22 minutes in length, and it's a track where you can actually tell where the different, listed parts begin and end on it. That's assuming that it has two parts to it. On first listen, I liked this track, mostly for the first part, which takes up most of the running time. On second listen, I elevated it to 'classic' status, pretty much. It did take more than one listen though. Anyway, this track has a big sound to it, due to the use of a symphony. Maybe you could say that it has the quiet/loud format often used to describe the method of alt.rockers Pixies. There are quiet bits and then the sublime and bombastic orchestral/choral bits. Has fantasy lyrics and pretty guitar notes (not unlike those which Metallica use to introduce some of their heavy metal songs). The choral parts to this song are majestic. Organs and keyboard appear. The last minute or two of this track has a rock version, perhaps, of the first part...might be viewed as a parody of it...maybe. Really, I can't see why Australian commercial FM stations don't play this kind of song...it's as good as, if not better the numerous prog-rock tracks by Pink Floyd which they regularly play.        The best of the rest:        Moonchild - 12: 13 minutes long. Has symphonic elements like violins, percussion (including a bongo or whatever you call it) and wind isntruments. Vocals are pleasant. Mostly an instrumental track with some soothing 'doodling' by the instruments. Guitar plays delicate notes. Percussion is good and varied (different types of drums used, including metallic sounding percussion, which is interesting to listen to). Not in the same class as the title track, but nice nonetheless.    Epitaph - 8:47 long. has a certain grandeur to it. Symphonic elements like violins and the percussion used. Lead guitar is nice on this, with the notes it plays. Not sure, but it may be a semi accoustic steel string guitar or something. Other steel string instruments feature. Interesting lyrics, beefy drumming and pretty note picking mark out this song. Maybe not quite so good as Moonchild, but not much between these two tracks.          The rest:         21st century schizoid man - 7:24. Has an eerie intro and the vocals book-end this track. The vocals sound filtered...a distant, mechanical sound is achieved. Drums are solid sounding. Brass instruments are featured and the bass guitar is jazzy. Middle part of this track is jazzy too. Not sure how good my memory or intuition is, but the track seems to have a variation on the theme to the tv show \\"Mission: Impossible\\". This track has more than one part to it, according to the track listing. I can only hear distinct parts for the final track on this album, my pick as the classic off of it.    I talk to the wind - 6:05. Features a flute type of instrument and gentle (dual) vocals. A mild/pleasant track with clear vocals. Lyrics are on the hippy side...singing is a bit like you hear with the band \\"Bread\\". Piano features as does some sort of steel percussion, I think.        Recommendations:        Have tended to ignore \\"prog rock\\" as it seems pretty boring to me, but I'll definitely be wanting to check out more King Crimson stuff. Pink Floyd's \\"The wall\\" is a good listen, and they're regarded as a prog-rock band. It's quite accessible and has many good songs on it. It also has a concept which you can get just by listening to it!    Other pleasant sounding albums I've heard and which have been mentioned as 'prog' are:    Jean Michel Jarre - Oxygene (entirely instrumental)    Air - Moon safari (synthy pop)    Mike Oldfield - Tubular bells (pretty varied, but some interesting tracks on this).

B000002KIK|4.0|If you liked \\"Technical ecstasy\\" and \\"Mob rules\\", I think you may enjoy this album too. Have come across views from critics and fans that Ozzy's last two albums with the band were their decline. To me, \\"Never say die!\\" is a good note on which to close the Ozzy era. \\"Technical ecstasy\\" marked a move into more light and accessible territory. \\"Never say die!\\" continues that trend, but is just more accomplished in its execution. The Dio led \\"Mob rules\\" album is also a part of this phase by Black Sabbath, as I see it. Ozzy's last album with Sabbath is entirely listenable and accessible to those who may not be attracted to their earlier phase of heavy swamp rock.       The best song:      A hard road - this song has grown on me the more I've listened to it. It may be their best song outside of my favourite Sabbath album, Paranoid. It's boogie rock with a driving rhythm...like a polished standard from a pub rock band. Ozzy's voice has a sort of Marianne Faithful vibe to it. Backing singing is nice at the end...very sing-along-able. Perhaps Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder listened to Ozzy's vocal noises at the end, because \\"Jeremy\\" utilises the same style.         The best of the rest:        Never say die - good riffing here...not unlike Thin Lizzy's \\"The boys are back in town\\". Feel good rock with positive lyrics and sing-song vocals.    Air dance - starts off rock, but goes into light, jazz lounge mode, with pleasant piano notes playing. Keyboard appears later. Has some bluesy lead guitar and effects.        The rest:        Johnny Blade - starts with the synthesiser. Riffing is good. There are two sorts: 1) a heavy metal type riff and 2) one heavy rock type rock. Lead guitar is good in this song. Engaging narrative to this song, but the wording is weak at times. Detected influences on this song would include \\"Mac the knife\\" and \\"Ziggy Stardust\\".     Junior's eyes - a laid back, spacey groove on bass and cymbals. Has riffing parts and bluesy lead guitar. Chorus is poppy.Shock wave - tougher rock. Thematically, it seems to delve into \\"Crack the skye\\" terrritory (Mastodon)...that should be vice versa, of course. Riff at the start put to mind their earlier \\"Sweet leaf\\" (off of \\"Master of reality\\" album).    Over to you - good time rock with a rocking start. Big riff...sort of Alice Cooper's \\"Department of youth\\" type stuff. Piano tinkles out some notes. Lyrics are a bit weak and the long vocal notes are a bit like that in their earlier classic \\"Planet caravan\\" (off their all time classic album \\"Paranoid\\").    Breakout - a brassy instrumental running at 2:35 long...the shortest track on the album. Has sax and is a bit jazzy.    Swinging the chain - not sure who is singing on this track...doesn't exactly sound like Ozzy here. A bluesy/boogie rock'n'roll number. Heavy. Not to far off the Aerosmith kind of sound. Not a bad track, has harmonica.        Recommendations:      If you are serious about discovering Black Sabbath, I think that their studio albums are the way to go rather than compilations. Their first three studio albums are essential as that encompasses their three distinct phases. In order, they are:    Black Sabbath - folk rock which many regard as the origin of heavy metal (though I wouldn't necessarily agree with that). My least favourite Sabbath album.    Paranoid - an all time great album with their best and most memorable songs. A move away from their folk rock type of start.    Master of reality - the album which set the template for all their subsequent albums until \\"Technical ecstasy\\" stopped that phase. If you like this album (it's my third favourite Sabbath album, behind Paranoid and Sabotage) you should check out all their albums up to and including Sabotage.    - if you like \\"Never say die!\\", check out Technical Ecstasy and Mob Rules.    - if you like their debut, then check out Led Zeppelin's debut, which is also folk rock type of stuff, but coming from a different place.

B001QOGYBI|3.0|In A Nutshell: The movie reminded me of some of the movies I saw as a child because the animation is \\"stop-motion\\" like the Rudolph's Shiny New Year and A Year Without A Santa Claus.<br /><br />Roald Dahl is a brilliant author and James and the Giant Peach was one of my favorite books when I was growing up.<br /><br />This is a grown up animated story. I tried to get my 4 year old to watch with me but she was uninterested. I think it is because the colors aren't as vivid and the images weren't as quick as the movies kids are used to these days.<br /><br />There were parts I wasn't comfortable with like farmers shouting, \\"lets kill kim\\" before shooting Mr. Fox's tail off. Also, the scene where Mrs. Fox is bandaging up Mr. Fox's bloody butt, where his tail came off keeps replaying in my head. I could have done without the bloody bandage. Other than that, the movie was smart, and older children or adults may be more interested than your little one.<br /><br />It was too wordy and slow for today's kids to sit through but the idea of stop-motion animation in a new format was fun. I really loved the soundtrack/score.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I've had this bad boy in my i7-860 system for about 6+ weeks now....and so far it's been great.  If you need an stock HSF upgrade and don't want to spend a ton, this is a pretty good choice.<br /><br />Not sure I follow the review about it being hard to install.  Yeah, you may have to push the pins down really hard to get it to latch on properly....but it's not rocket science to figure it out.<br /><br />Right now, just running 1 fan....but thinking of hooking up a second one.  The low-volume of the 120mm fans are really nice.  You'll love it if you are use to the older and smaller fans.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the dimensions may make it difficult (or impossible) to mount on a board that is skinny.  You probably need a case that's at least 180mm wide for it to fit in ok....just an FYI!<br /><br />Yes, there are better HSF upgrades out there, though Amazon doesn't seem to sell many of them!  But you'll have to spend around a minimum of $45 or $50.  And it will only help you out a little.  All and all, 212+ is probably the best bang for the buck HSF you can buy right now.
0307269760|4.0|I think Alice Munro is one of the most talented living author of short stories. For anyone who has never read a Munro story, don't be fooled by the kindly, harmless-looking old lady photo in the back cover flap. Munro provides just enough interesting surface details to lure a reader into her characters' lives - until she's got you irretrievably involved in the dark underbelly of those details. Believably bizarre and macabre events in a person's life story, drawn in the most delicate prose.    All that said, I did not love all the stories in this collection. For instance, the \\"title track\\" feels too experimental, not as clean and well-crafted as the others. \\"Wenlock Edge\\" could also be shored up a bit. Although it is intricate and involved and plays around interestingly with literotica, one suddenly feels as though Munro got bored or lazy and ended the story as quickly as she could; and although her ending is the usual elegant, understated affair, the part just beforehand feels as though it got lobbed off. Aside from those two, however, the collection lives up to Munro's usual high standard. In my opinion, the best two stories are \\"Fiction\\" and \\"Free Radicals\\" (especially the former) - and \\"Dimensions\\" is a fabulous opener. The most disturbing, \\"Child's Play,\\" succeeds on a double level in that Munro produces the same effect on the reader that the child storyteller is trying to achieve on her friend. Wonderful.    If you like short stories in the (non-Southern) tradition of Flannery O'Connor, I am sure you will like most of this collection.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Every person in America should view this.  It might possibly change the garbage that's being offered, to the american public, as food. It has certainly changed how I purchase food and what we eat in my household. I've told everyone I know about this film.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I haven't seen a lot of films by Wes Anderson.  I've seen (and loved) `The Royal Tenenbaums' and I saw (and found highly overrated) `Rushmore'.  Even with only those two viewings though, it is apparent that Anderson has a unique style, visually as well as vocally.  His humor is very dry to the point where he is either astonishingly clever or almost too gimmicky.<br /><br />Ok, forget it.  I was going to go into this longwinded (as usual) spiel about how Wes Anderson's style is apparent all over this film, but in a good way, but I'm getting too impatient.<br /><br />All I want to say is, \\"THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC\\"!<br /><br />If you know me then you know that I don't normally get overly excited about animated films.  Sure, there are the occasional animated features that really reach me, but as a rule I'm not entirely drawn to them.  There was something about this film though, that grabbed me from the first promo I saw.  I just knew that I HAD TO SEE THIS!  I took my daughter (my wife refused to go) and I liked it more than she did (to be fair, this is a very adult cartoon with mature humor and a bland color palate that fails to ignite the interest of a toddler).  This is not you average `laugh out loud' type of comedy, but if you are familiar with Anderson then you know that that is not his style.<br /><br />This humor is subtle yet totally spot on.<br /><br />The story is that of Mr. Fox, a retired chicken thief who has settled into the life of husband and father, yet he still feels that aching need for adventure.  When Mr. Fox attempts to get his thrills in by stealing from three very nasty men, he finds that these men will stop at nothing to destroy Mr. Fox and his family.<br /><br />The voice work couldn't have been better.  The deadpan delivery suits comic actors like Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman effortlessly, but even George Clooney and Meryl Streep fall beautifully into line.  Anderson's direction captures the humor in every scene, and his ascetic is seen all over the place, to glorious effect.  I'd easily say that Schwartzman is best in show (I never thought I'd ever say that about him).  His voice work totally embodies his character (Ash is just such a brilliant creation) to the point where his every word and action is undeniably unforgettable.<br /><br />I will say this, the film is not really one I'd recommend for young children, you know, when they are going through that `impressionable stage'.  Some of the dialog, while not explicit, could be objectionable to parents.  If you don't want your children running around using the word `cuss' in place of colorful expressions you might want to keep them away from this.  This is a Roald Dahl adaptation, so the darker themes are to be expected (there are some deaths on screen and some malicious violence), but they are handled with wit and cleverness (that \\"soap\\" line is priceless).<br /><br />I totally recommend this for any adult willing to embrace his inner child!'d easily say that Schwartzman is best in show (I never thought I'd ever say that about him).

0060245867|5.0|superb!!  One of the best books of this type.  I must be one of the last people in USA to have read it.  My grandchild's favorite book, by far, even preferred to the others of similar nature by this author (by slight margin).
B001VLBDD0|5.0|I got blasted for pretty much panning Cameron's 1984 `The Terminator'.  I was crucified to put it nicely.  It's funny, because I still feel the same way.  It's a film that just doesn't hold up well as the years have come and gone.  Cameron's 1991 sequel, a film that I nearly didn't see because of my feelings on the '84 film, is drastically different.  Thanks to recommendations from friends I finally took the time to check this one out, and I have to say that it totally blows the first film out of the water in ALL AREAS.  You see, I attacked `The Terminator', not only for its graphics (yes, they were great for the time and paved the way, but the don't impress now, at all) but also for the density of the story and the acting (I over praised Hamilton; definitely reaching for something to praise).<br /><br />I don't know if I have enough praise for this film though.<br /><br />The acting (even from the Schwarzenegger) is leaps and bounds better than the '84 film (even if young Furlong has his moments of cringe inducing overacting) and the graphics are nearly as good as things we see today (I prefer these graphics to Cameron's overrated mess of an `Avatar'), but it is the depth of story that really impresses me the most here.  This film doesn't feel like your average action junkie film.  It has a beating heart, and while the whole idea of man being mans worst enemy has been explored many times (two years before this film Cameron expressed similar feelings in `The Abyss'), it is a subject that lends itself to many variations and thus has a long shelf life.<br /><br />The film picks up YEARS after the first left off.  Sarah has gone crazy (or so the government would have you believe) and has been locked up.  Her son, John, is living with neglectful (or maybe they are just tired) foster parents.  The Terminator returns, except this time he is not the savage killer he was initially.  In the future, John has rewired him to be his protector, and he ventures to rescue John from an advanced killing machine sent to destroy him.<br /><br />Madness ensues.<br /><br />The underlying morale of violence and it's claws in humanity are embellished in many ways, from the overlaying plot regarding the future and the machines, to John's own views of The Terminator's knack for killing to his simple yet powerful observation at a gas station (\\"we're not going to make it, are we?\\").  The film really understands how to rise above its own genre, creating something truly powerful within all the explosions and bloodshed.<br /><br />I kind of attacked Arnold for his lack of acting skills, and while some protested that that was the way he was supposed to play it, I still kind his performance in the first film to be rather ridiculous (but a lot of that was the script).  It's amazing what a little brain power can pull off.  With the advanced script work, this particular performance reaches all new heights.  Arnold, while still awkward and unintentionally comical, carries a human heart here, slowly learning how to adjust to the human world.  Robert Patrick makes a better villain than Arnold (and thus Arnold makes a much better `protector' than `terminator').  He has the suave viciousness needed to make him less robotic (he is an advanced model).  I mentioned already that Furlong has his moments of `ouch', but he also has many moments that work.  He is surely the films weakest link, but I won't fault him too much.  He works (and his work in 1998's `American History X' is sheer genius and proves that he had the talent).<br /><br />Linda Hamilton is a goddess here.  She grapples EVERYTHING to perfection.  I don't truly understand why so many consider her a supporting actress here though.  Some may argue that the machines (the terminators) are the leading characters, but that's like saying Shia LaBeouf is supporting in `Transformers' because the main characters are the transformers.  Anyways, no matter where you put her, she deserves to be somewhere.  I didn't thinkthat anyone could knock the `Thelma and Louise' ladies from the top of my ballot, but Hamilton has done it.  The way she balances the macho with the insane with the tenderness is just astonishing.  She never flinches in her delivery, proving to transcend the genre and just deliver brilliance.<br /><br />This may be taking a lot of you by surprise (it has me) but I tend to believe this may be the perfect action film and surely one of the best ever made.  With heart, soul and a TON of fantastic action sequences (the initial chase scene, through the mall, on the street, OMG), this film is a must see, not just for the action junkie, but for the film lover in us all!adies from the top of my ballot, but Hamilton has done it.

B002NWRMVS|1.0|Norah Jones has been the trusted modern artist that I could rely on for beautifully mastered albums without succumbing to making ever track as \\"loud\\" as possible.  I hate to say it but that has all changed on this album.  I do not know who mastered this album or who made the decision to master this CD loud \ compressed but Norah please fire them.<br /><br />If you do not know what I am referring to or unfamiliar with the term \\"loud\\" in reference to the loudness war, please look up \\"loudness war\\" on Wikipedia and YouTube before you disagree with my opinion.  Almost all modern artists' albums are mastered as loud as possible destroying the dynamic range of the music; this in turn makes them tiring to listen to and destroys the punch of pronounced sounds like the kick of the bass drum.  I heard it right away when I listened to the first track on this album and was very saddened by this change.  You can open any track in the free Audacity audio editor application and compare it to any of her older albums, you are in for a big disappointment.<br /><br />My justification for ranking this 1 star is that this album is very tiring to listen to and you cannot make out what she is saying clearly due to the poor mastering job.  What good is album if it tiring to listen to?  Now I do appreciate her exploration of different avenues with this new album and as always think she is a brilliant musician.  I doubt the mastering has anything to do with a decision she made but none the less, the decision was made and the result in unacceptable to me.

B00000G3AZ|4.0|I was surprised by all the other reviews that hacked this film to bits.  There seem to be a great number of \\"authorities\\" on what is correct for Regency England.  May I offer a gentle reminder that unless you were alive then and lived it, you aren't an authority? I always assume that the movie version will never be as good as the book, so I allow some slack for that.  Jeremy Northam is delicious no matter what he does.  My only grievance is Gwynneth Paltrow--she never plays the character, she always plays Gwynneth Paltrow.  And am I the only one that hears her whining through her nose?  Why does she do that???  Overall, I enjoy this film and have watched it several times.

I love that song. Same with \\"The Moon and the Sky\\". \\" Skin\\" is a good track with a nice groove and a nice MJ reference in it.  If you are a Sade fan, this is a good CD.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|The latest genesis of the Star Trek franchise is a great stand-alone movie that pays its respect to the \\"product\\" that proceeded it.  This \\"Star Trek\\" was definitely created with the goal of drawing in a younger audience without offending the thousands of Trekkies who grew up with the show.  As one of those original fans of the 60s television show, I can say without hesitation that I thoroughly enjoyed the \\"rewrite\\" of the Star Trek Mythology and found the movie to be a blast.  The special effects were outstanding, the sound quality was wonderful, and the actors (even though faced with an almost impossible task of playing roles so well-known that they're become iconic), all succeeded in making the film work quite well.<br /><br />In thinking about the task that faced these young actors I really am quite impressed that they were able to pull off their portrayals so well.  They made it easy for the viewer to forget that in addition to playing their role assigned to the film, they also had to play the actor who played the role in the original series.<br /><br />Oh sure...there are some liberties taken with the film. (Vulcan, for one, is surely treated roughly.)  (Spock and Uhura?  Who'd thought it?)  All in all though, the film is true to the series and has included a great cameo by an old friend.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of this film has plenty of extras and will keep the viewer busy looking over deleted scenes, getting a great close-up tour of the Enterprise, plus the 30 \\"behind-the-scenes\\" featurettes.  There's really nothing not to like about \\"Star Trek\\" and the Blu-ray extras.  I give the whole package a whole-hearted, \\"Live Long and Prosper\\"!

B002VKE0XA|4.0|Those of you who \\"weren't\\" scared, it sure feels like you're just trying to show off and laugh it up so that you can make your fightened soul feel better. Watch it again alone (so that you won't feel obligated to laugh in order to show that you're brave) and watch it at night and try to go sleep... alone and with no lights on. While you're trying to sleep, think of the scene where the sheets are moving by themselves... or try to sleep with your leg hanging over the edge of the bed... I know the bravest man on Earth will be scared. Even just a little. Heck! I'm brave. I'm not easily scared. I'm not afarid of the dark. Yet, i do think of the movie from time to time when i close the lights. OK, i think of it with a smile cause to feel a bit uneasy is kind of silly but still, i think of it.     You liars.     I'm not talking about the movie itself. I can understand that some of you didn't like the structure, the acting, the point of view or whatever. But what it was suggesting... if it didn't even make you feel a bit uneasy, well i simply don't believe you. It's my choice and i stand by it. If you're not a little bit scared by it, you're lying. A little, i'm saying. Not a lot. Not trembling. Just a bit uneasy. Even if you don't believe in that kind of stuff... which i don't. But we all have imagination.     \\"Serious\\" movies about ghosts or demons always have a different effect on me than any other horror movies as they deal with something you can't really explain. I'm not talking about \\"Constantine\\" or something deliberately overblown here...      No hollywood-type special effects, no gore or monsters, no music. Everything is made to look normal, amateur-style and very, very minimalist. The authors have the brilliance to protect themselves by making one character (the boyfriend) a bit resistant to what's going on. Like most of us, he doesn't necessarily believe what's happening. Like all men, he wants to show to his girlfriend that he is in charge. That he isn't scared.So by the time he doesn't have a choice but to actually BELIEVE, we, as a spectator, also believe. For the time of the movie, of course. After it's over, we know it was just a story but while it lasted, we agreed to believe it. That's the whole point of cinema: to make you believe while the movie last. AFter, you discuss it.     Also, the film make it a point to warn us that the house is not at fault here. It's the girl. Wherever she goes, the entity WILL follow. She just has to deal with it. It doesn't matter if she always sleeps on the same side of the bed, beside the door or not. It doesn't even matter if that darn door is closed or not. IT will come after her. It will possess her! So this argument of putting the movie down because she never changes her position in the bed or because they never leave the damn house is not valid. It will follow her wherever she goes. And the boyfriend will ALWAYS be seen as an enemy.     The film deals with little things that are sure to scare us. Strange noises, afraid to sleep with one arm or one leg hanging over the edge of the bed, surreal shadows, an object misplaced, the sensation of being watched, invisible footsteps, strange footprints, etc... The filmmakers let our imagination do the rest. Even Spielberg agreed to that when he wrote \\"Poltergeist\\" even if his movie was a lot more special effect oriented. The little things, he said, are what scare us the most.     The end may be a bit overblowned but at this point, the desired effect is successfully integrated in our soul. We are scared stiff! And it will leave a mark...     The alternate ending is more \\"believable\\" but makes you wonder why would the entity do all this, for all those years, simply to do what it does at the end.    I would have loved for the movie to keep on going and see actual professionals take care of the girl. A bit like \\"The Entity\\". It would have been the natural path, i suppose. But that wasn't the idea here. Things happen too fast and one expert has left them alone has they are waiting for another one to show up.    Gee-whees, just having the girl get up and stand rigid over the bed, watching her boyfriend sleep for hours, is enough to get your blood going. At the end, when the entity actually becomes physical, it becomes a lesson to all filmmakers on how to genuinely scare an audience. Just like the first \\"Blair Witch Project\\".     Very good movie. Very frightening. The kind of movie you can dare a friend to watch. But that friend has to watch it ALONE, AT NIGHT, IN THE DARK and WITHOUT ANY INTERUPTIONS. Or else, the desired effect is lost. Like \\"Blair Witch #1\\", watch it with someone else and you won't be scared as much. Leave the light on or talk or get up to do something else while the movie is still playing and you've wasted the whole point of watching it. Cause the sacry parts are in the little details and the general athmosphere.     After that, if that friend tells me that he wasn't scared, i'll know that he's lying and that's just his or her way to feel brave.     I'm saying all of this with a smile of course. Everybody has their own opinion. I simply have serious doubts over those who play brave or jaded about it.

B002WY65UQ|4.0|As a long time fan of the classic (relative term)   St. Trinian's movies from the late '50's / early  '60's, I approached this most recent version with  a lot of trepidation.  I was honestly expecting a  bastardization of Ronald Searle's notorious school  for young ladies, but truth be told, I found this   very enjoyable and quite in keeping with the madcap   comic tone of the earlier films. In fact, it plays  less like a remake and more of a continuation of  the series. I expected Rupert Everett to be funnier   in drag (as Headmistress Fritton) even though his   performance eventually grew on me.  Alastair Sim's   performance(in the original) was hilarious.  Colin   Firth does his usual steller job, even though he's  playing an unsympathetic character.  There are a  few referances to his 'Pride and Prejudice' heart-  throb status - like his emerging out of fountain  in a wet shirt, and having his leg humped by a dog  named Mr. Darcy.  Russell Brand - a comedian I've  always had a certain repugnance for - actually made  a very effective Flash Harry, the iconic character  originated by George Cole and who's turned up in all  but one of the St. Trinian films.  The young ladies  are a mixed bunch, but all are attractive. (How cute   is Lily Cole as computer geek Polly?)  The U.S. DVD   release also contains some very nice bonus features,   especially the out-takes and the music video of the   theme song performed by grrrl rockers Girls Aloud.    Great fun!  I look forward to the next one.
B002GMNLLA|5.0|That label wouldn't be fair to Insomnium.  I can see where people get the doom part though, due in large part to the use of atmospheric keyboard sounds backing the guitar riffage and the grinding vocals.

Yes, he does make valid points and the book is peppered with FBI anecdotes but its more like reading prose.

The Definitive Guide to Body Language is a much better read. It is more concise and contains more information. Its funnier too. Having said all this, I give it three stars because it is a good book. Just not a great one.

B003102JDM|4.0|\\"A Serious Man\\" is the closest that the Coen Brothers have come to writing something semi-autobiographical; they grew up in a largely Jewish suburban Minneapolis neighborhood (St. Louis Park) and they set their story in a Minnesotan Jewish suburban enclave, in the summer of 1967 (when Joel was 13 and Ethan was 10). God help them, however, if their family was anything like the Gopniks (although if they were, it would explain a lot about the world view they expound in their films). Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a \\"serious man\\"- a buttoned-down physics professor who can map out the paradoxical quantum mysteries of Schrodinger's cat on a blackboard, but is absolutely stymied as to why his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) suddenly announces to him one day out of the blue that she wants a divorce. To add insult to injury, she wants him to move out of the house as soon as possible, so that the man she wishes to spend the rest of her life with, a smarmy neighborhood widower named Sy Abelman (Fred Melamed) can settle in.    This situation alone would give any self-respecting mensch such tsuris, nu? Yes, it gets worse. Larry gets no sympathy or support from his snotty, self-absorbed daughter (Jessica McManus) or his stoner son (Aaron Wolff), who spends more time obsessing on his favorite TV show \\"F Troop\\" than brushing up on his Hebrew for an upcoming Bar Mitzvah. He also has problems at work, ranging from the usual politics of academia to staving off a deranged student who is attempting to blackmail his way to a passing grade. And then there is his perennially underemployed brother (Richard Kind) who has become a permanent house guest who spends an inordinate amount of time in the bathroom, draining his, erm, cyst (ah, yes-we're still firmly entrenched in Coen territory here, kids).    Teetering on the verge of an existential meltdown, Larry seeks advice from three rabbis, embarking on a spiritual quest in order to glean, well, \\"Why me?\\" The story takes on the airs of a modern fable from this point onward, neatly telegraphed by the film's opening ten minutes-a blackly comic, old school Yiddish folk tale with semi-mystical overtones strongly reminiscent of Woody Allen's \\"Love and Death\\". In the context of the Coen's oeuvre, the character of Larry Gopnick is not really so far removed from William Macy's character in \\"Fargo\\" or Billy Bob Thornton's character in \\"The Man Who Wasn't There\\" (sans the murder and mayhem, but sharing the plight of the hapless Everyman, ultimately left twisting in the wind by the detached cruelty of Fate...and the Coens themselves).    This is one of those films that I think I need to see again, because it really has some interesting layers to it that I don't think can be fully appreciated in just one viewing (especially for its provocatively enigmatic ending) It's smart, it's funny, it's made (gasp!) for adults, and it's one of the most wildly original films I've seen in a while. The cast is excellent, especially Sthulbarg and Kind, who are very believable as brothers with a complex relationship, and have some genuinely poignant scenes together (does their relationship reflect Joel and Ethan's, I wonder?). I have to mention a wonderful (if brief) performance by Amy Landecker as the sexy neighbor, Mrs. Samsky (channeling Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson), who has a hilarious seduction scene with the uptight Larry.     When the film was in its initial run, there were some mutterings about the film being \\"too\\" Jewish, propagating stereotypes and so on and so forth, the Coens are self-loathing, blah blah blah, but I think that's silly. Hey-I've got relatives that are more \\"Jewish\\" than the characters in the film. Besides, the Coens are Jews-is there some law against artists incorporating their heritage into their art? One might as well condemn Phillip Roth, Saul Bellow, Jules Feiffer, Mel Brooks, Woody Allen and Neil Simon for the same \\"crime\\".

B001UV4XUG|3.0|Some people have compared director Marc Webb's Sundance darling \\"500 Days of Summer\\" to \\"Annie Hall\\". While it obviously draws narrative inspiration from Allen's post-deconstruction of a fizzled romantic relationship, it offers a fluffier, albeit ingratiating variation on that film's theme, buoyed along by a hip (if calculating) soundtrack, winking references for film buffs, and the charm of its two leads.     At the beginning of the film, we are duly advised in mock-serious tones by a narrator with mellifluous pipes that what we are about to see is \\"...not a love story.\\" It is, rather, a retrospective appraisal of a relationship that didn't work out, between a hopelessly romantic young man named Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a more cautiously pragmatic young woman named Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Tom and Summer Meet Cute at the office. She is \\"the new girl\\", he writes greeting cards (soul of a poet?). And in portents of a love affair born in emo heaven, they bond over a mutual appreciation of Morrissey (I'm sure that the filmmakers had `em at the Smiths reference at Sundance).    You math majors in the audience have probably figured out by now that the \\"500 days\\" refers to the length of said relationship. Screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber opt for the non-linear approach in their narrative, giving us characters who (like Kurt Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim) appear to have become \\"unstuck in time\\" (day 147 might segue into day 18, which dissolves into day 310, etc.). While this device does become \\"gimmicky\\" rather quickly, director Webb takes full advantage of the footloose structure to inject a lot of visual playfulness. He throws in everything from Bergman references to an exuberant, fully choreographed MTV-style number (I think it's the film's best scene).    Under closer scrutiny, the film isn't really much deeper than an MTV video; but it's a fun ride all the same, with enough originality and inventiveness to separate it from the pack of largely vacuous piffle that passes as \\"romantic comedy\\" these days (I don't sound bitter, do I?). I've only seen Gordon-Levitt in two other films (\\"Brick\\" and \\"The Lookout\\") but I'm impressed by his range; I think he's got a long career ahead of him. Deschanel (America's answer to Audrey Tautou) has an effervescent screen presence that (for me, at least) makes up for the fact that she plays the same quirky, saucer-eyed Object of Desire in everything I've seen her in; but who can resist those baby blues? Like many first-time directors eager to pull out all the stops, Webb may have put too many eggs in one basket here-but I look forward to seeing what else this promising filmmaker has up his sleeve.

B002ZIAC26|5.0|I have been listening to dream-pop, shoe-gaze, ethereal, indie-rock reacted music for over 20 years now. I have to say that this is just about as good or better than anything in any of those genres and more. There are so many other \\"new\\" bands putting out music that takes me back to my shoe-gaze days but, this album has the best of all those elements. It may not be as \\"experimental\\" as My Bloody Valentine but, the songs and their variations are much stronger in my opinion. MBV never made me tear up like Beach House does. The vocals in BH are just about as perfect as any I have heard in any genre and I listen to very diverse music. The actual words are a little hard to pick out but, I rarely find lyrics good enough or important enough for me to care. I hope these guys can pull this off live when I see them in April. I fear that if they don't use real drums, it might take away from the impact. However, the spot-on vocal delivery should make-up for it. The easiest way to sum up the BH sound: Cocteau Twins mixed with Mazzy Star and maybe some of the more recent elements of \\"hip\\" music out there. The vocals remind a little of The Duke Spirit and Siouxie and the Banshees. Might appeal to fans of Broadcast also. I already feel this will be THE album of 2010 in my opinion. I can't see how any song on this cd could be improved. Listen with headphones and try to get it on cd or vinyl so you can hear it with better sound quality and not the weaker MP3 format. 4.8 out of 5!

B002T9H2MO|5.0|Spoilers!!! This movie does absolutely nothing new in the sci-fi genre. Let's look: lunar base, mining, solitude, self-aware A.I., clones with a limited life span, conspiracy and an evil corporation. All things done before and that's what I like about it, the fact that [[ASIN:B002T9H2MO Moon]] takes bits and pieces from the best movies of that particular genre, then arranges them in a complete easy to follow story line.<br /><br />The plot is about an energy mining operation on the moon, overseen by Sam Bell(Sam Rockwell) and his robotic buddy GERTY(Kevin Spacey) who is essentially a non-homicidal Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Sam is there for a three year contract, which is almost over and he can't wait to see his family on Earth. He ends up crashing his rover into a mining rig, wakes up on the base with no recollection of the events prior. He finds the crashed rover and finds himself inside. The film follows the discovery of the clones, conspiracy and a way to expose said conspiracy. The message has been done before, but still keeps its impact. \\"What does it mean to be human.\\" The visual style is beautiful with its clean lines, and believable atmosphere and it's amazing considering the budget is only $5 million dollars. If you haven't seen it, you need to. The movie represents the return of classic science fiction.

B000UJCALI|4.0|The title of this review tells you what you need to know; despite this being based on a Stephen King novel, `The Shining' is very much Kubrick's baby. The supernatural and personal themes of King's novel are toned down, and many of the characters' traits are very different to those in the book. This version of `The Shining' is much closer to straightforward psychological horror, albeit with a very Kubrick twist.     Jack Nicholson gives his character a very different feel to the Torrance of the novel, but his over-the-top performance is a memorable one. Really, Nicholson carries the entire film, although Scatman Crothers deserves praise for his performance as the sympathetic Halloran. There are also excellent cameos from Philip Stone as the sinister Grady, and Joe Turkel as Lloyd the bartender. Shelley Duvall, however, isn't so good; Kubrick was apparently merciless in his demands on her, and at times I think he pushed her into hysterical over-acting during the intense scenes. As with Jack, her portrayal as a flaky housewife is very different from the more strong-willed Wendy of the novel.     As expected from Kubrick, the technical aspects of the film are exceptional. The use of Steadicam technology to follow characters through the corridors of the hotel makes the Overlook seem like an endless, claustrophobic maze. Again there is an unsettling use of close-ups, both during the intense scenes and to depict Jack's slow decent into madness. Another technical highlight is the opening overhead sequence of Jack's car approaching the Overlook.      Note that, as with all his works, this is very much a Kubrick film first and a genre film second. It is far more intellectual and thought-provoking than most horror, even psychological horror, films. There are plenty of unanswered questions and puzzles by the end, and you get the feeling that Kubrick didn't want everything in the film to fit together too neatly. Some questions seem designed to be open-ended, with no clear answer, but guaranteed to have you discussing the film for a long time afterwards.     Those who loved the novel might not be able to forgive the changes Kubrick makes to the story, but the differences in character and plot do not hurt the film. While it may not be the best adaptation of King's book, `The Shining' stands well enough on its own merits.

B002L7TMAE|4.0|The packaging is excellent: a nifty little box containing the six CD-albums, each in a scaled-down replica of the individual vinyl album-cover (complete with cardboard inner-sleeve) as well as an informative booklet - only in French, please note - giving details about each album and placing it in its historical context. However, the problem with this kind of packaging is that each CD only contains around 30 minutes of music - even those with a number of bonus tracks. In fact, the entire collection could've been easily contained on three CD's.    The sound is also extraordinarily vivid, much more so than on the single-disc compilation I have of some of the same songs. This is no rushed mastering-job: it's clearly designed to be the definitive version of this material.     As for the music, it's highly melodic and romantic 60's-pop with a penchant for swaying 6/8 rhythms and delicious melancholy but I feel it's let down by Hardy's singing, especially on the earlier albums. While her voice is always sweet and melodic, it's under-characterized. In fact, the only thing stopping it from being insipid is the sense that there's a real talent just waiting to emerge - a belief that would be amply confirmed by some of her later albums. Here, however, while she's superb when the material requires delicacy and reserve she is severely wanting when the songs call for projection and drama. Her voice gradually acquired more character and personality over the years and reached its fruition on the great trio of albums, \\"Ma Jeunesse Fout Le Camp\\", \\"Comment Te Dire Adieu\\", and \\"La Question\\" a few years later. And I'd direct any newcomer to Hardy's music to those luscious albums first before examining the juvenilia on this collection. For rabid Hardy-fans, however, I'd suggest this box will be an essential purchase. The sound and packaging are first-rate.

B000001E18|5.0|This is it! The best U2 album! I'm sure that there are many who would dispute that but in my opinion it holds true. The band was never so loose or experimental before or after this one. I remember hearing this for the first time back in 1993 and feeling that a veil had been lifted from a band that I had been listening to for years. There's a synergy at work here on all of these tracks and they just fit together to make the whole album a world of it's own. This is not to diminish the classic stature of other great U2 albums like The Joshua Tree, Unforgettable Fire, Achtung Baby, etc but those albums sound slightly self-conscious compared to this underrated gem. Here Bono and the boys let it all hang out and sound as though they are actually having fun while at the same time preaching a serious message about the dangers of consumerism and isolation in the modern world. A message which feels more apt in 2010 than it did in 1993. If you like the band yet haven't heard this one, give it a try. If you like experimental rock, give it a try. Then try some Brian Eno if you haven't already.

B002XMGGK6|5.0|I rented this film today and enjoyed it...so I will defintely be getting it soon.  I found it to be very entertaining, well-paced, suspenseful, graphic in places.  Gerard Butler was like the devil in this! And with good reason, but his character   gets blinded by revenge. (Good job though!)   Jamie Foxx did a satisfactory job in this and the other cast was sufficient.  Lots of explosions, violence, and other manner of thrills & chills for those   who like that sort of thing...I can't complain about the film overall, but   the ending was very unexpected to me. I give it 5 stars for being a great entertaining   film that won't bore you and you can follow it all the way through.
0872860175|2.0|I got this little book because it kept being mentioned on several sources I was reading on Queer studies (more of a personal interest, as my professional research is not in this field) as one of the most influential gay male poems in the 20th century. I read it twice, the second time forcing myself to make sure I was actually feeling this way about the book: Honestly, how can you call this good poetry?<br /><br />It has some good things: It is not apologetic at all because of the expression of gay love, what was probably quite a bold move for an artist in the American 1950s, and in some ways it does critic the conformist feeling of the era. So, I do understand that, if this was the first main stream poetry book to have been published with this message, that it is considered relevant, not necessarily for its quality, but for its boldness, and plainly for being the first.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is no rhythm, no rhyme, it feels more like reading prose than poetry. Maybe it's because I was born on a completely different historical moment, but this book does not really evoke any meaningful feelings in me.
B000GY729M|5.0|This follow up to the groundbreaking `Hot Fuzz' was not welcome by many critics, hoping for a sequel from their great debut. I don't know if it was the lack of listening to the album one more time forgetting who this band was in the first place to actually appreciate a great masterpiece.<br /><br />By far, possibly one of the most underrated albums I have encountered and all this was due to the bands previous success. On the first listen of `Sam's Town' I realized how quickly The Killers matured from two years back. They surpassed that dancing tune from their first album and decided to try something new. The results in my opinion were magnificent.<br /><br />Different is not a bad thing, and even though the quartet from Las Vegas did let go a bit of their original roots this album should be valued at least for their efforts. `Sam's Town' should be owned by any alternative music fan.

B001CDLATE|2.0|A friend of ours asked us to watch this with them over the weekend. Three months ago, another friend had had us watch Koyaanisqatsi with them. Make no mistake, they are definitely different versions on the same theme. We loved the Philip Glass music score to Koyaanisqatsi, but man, that movie is an hour longer than it should be. It was exhausting to watch the constantly repeated images and repeated takes of rolling clouds, traffic and assembly lines. My husband and I were rather shocked to see the exact same scenes replayed in Baraka. I kept wondering why there hadn't been a copyright infringement lawsuit, until I read that the same person  had worked on both films.     What we enjoyed about Bakara was the superior filming technology, as well as the variety of architecture and cultures portrayed in this version. I was particularly struck with the beautiful religious buildings, and the cultural practices such as the chanting and most notably the cremation scenes from India.     What was particularly annoying were all the scenes that were pretty much image for image taken from Koyaanisqatsi. The rolling clouds, the long segments showing people staring at the camera, the assembly line scenes, the scenes of the streets with the traffic filmed in time-lapse. My husband and I couln't believe how similar the two films were. I am sure that it wouln't have taken such a negative twist if we hadn't seen Koyaanisquatsi first, but alas we did. But yes, they are pretty much the same, there is still the clear message of a disintegration of humanity, and loss of spiritualism. I agree that the message is important. I think we just felt cheated by the fact that they are marketing this as something completely new, and it is clearly not.

B000AP04L0|5.0|Office Space was made in 1999, and still relevant in today's job market.  The sharp plot revolves around Ron Livingston as Peter Gibbons.  His waking life is spent on a mind-numbing job in an office cubicle, reporting to eight bosses.  He has two geeky friends that hope to raise in ranks at Initech, the company they all work for.  Initech wants to downsize and increase profits by sending some jobs overseas, and eliminate others.<br /><br />Peter has a girlfriend that insists he go to therapy before they marry.  He agrees and is hypnotized at a group therapy session.  The overweight therapist that hypnotized Peter collapses and dies before he can take Peter out of the relaxing trance that makes him worry free.  He is now open to do what he wants, not what he feels he has to do to fit in his bland reality.  He was supposed to work overtime Saturday and Sunday, but sleeps through 17 messages from his boss and girlfriend.<br /><br />Peter goes back to work on Monday, not caring if he has a job or not.  He decides to just leave, and no longer have to deal with his boss, (Gary Cole).  However, Peter is reminded that his appointment with efficiency experts is now and he should go.  Because he could care less if he has his job; his leisurely new attitude and total honesty about his work habits, the efficiency experts are impressed.  Gibbons laughs that there is nothing to motivate him.  The efficiency experts are impressed and ecstatic that they found a \\"button\\" to motivate a talented employee.  He is promoted to supervise four people.  On leaving, Peter sees that the efficiency experts plan to lay off his two close friends.  The friends, along with Peter,  hatch a crazy plot to get back at the company.<br /><br />The movie also follows the pathetic life of the office worker \\"Milton\\" and his red \\"Streamline\\" stapler.  Milton moves from space to lower class space until his office is in the basement storeroom.  Milton is key to the ending, as well as many laughs.<br /><br />The plot continues to develop, including Gibbons  interest in a waitress (Jennifer Anniston) at the restaurant he takes coffee breaks at.  There is also a scheme between Gibbons and his two friends on how to make money without working.  The movie has some slow spots, but the laughs and parody of the realities of corporate culture make up a stunningly hilarious and relevant film.to develop, including Gibbons  interest in a waitress (Jennifer Anniston) at the restaurant he takes coffee breaks at.

1607885204|4.0|Whether you're a fan of his or not, you have to admit that Ozzy Osbourne has led a fascinating life.  In his new memoir, I Am Ozzy, he tells of his childhood, finding his way into the music industry, of his marriages and his addictions.  He celebrates his successes and admits his mistakes and is honest about his regrets.    Carl and I listened to the abridged audio version of this book and we both enjoyed it.  The audio is read by Frank Skinner, a well-known British comic, and he does a great job.  The audio lasts approximately four hours and there is an interview with Ozzy himself at the end, after the book.  This book works very well in the audio format because it's written in a very conversational tone - it's almost as if Ozzy is sitting there talking to you.  Having said that, I Am Ozzy is not for the whole family because Ozzy does not censor his language and he is very creative with curse words.    We found ourselves laughing at some of Ozzy's early antics and cringing at some of his later ones.  (If you're an Ozzy fan, I'm sure you know which ones I'm talking about.  If you're not, I don't want to spoil it for you.)  We are Ozzy fans in this house, but learned lots of new things about him as we listened to I Am Ozzy.  I never realized just how lucky Ozzy is to be alive until I listened to this book.    You won't mistake this for great literature, but you will enjoy it, like we did, if you're a fan of Ozzy, music, or memoirs.

B000003T9B|5.0|if you are into screaming and growling heavy metal genre, you have no idea what metal or thrash metal is all about. I started listening to this band when i was in middle school and \\"feel the fire\\", \\"fatal if swallowed\\" are the songs that overcomed anything that anyother thrash metal bands ever tried or wrote in the early 80's. overkill is a band that has never got the credit and a band that new metal bands followed. i have every single album and im 35  yoa and i still listen to them. all their albums are awesome, but this album brings memory of good ol' thrash metal. buy it you will not be dissapointed. as a matter of fact, it is better then early slayer albums, its got more better riffs and \\"blitz\\" voice meets very well with their style. whoever said that Blitz's voice was a disapointment they were sooooo wrong. look at them, 25 years later and tehy still thrash. bands like LAMB OF GOD listened to them when they were younger. OVERKILL is a true metal band and they should be lsited in the hall of fame just like METALLICA.  keep on \\"wrecking\\" OVERKILL.
0307454541|4.0|This book kept appearing on recommended lists for me, and I finally caved and bought it. The book starts out slowly, if a bit stiffly. I can't help but wonder if the sometimes awkward language has to do with the translation. There were times when I felt myself chafing a bit at the authors prose, but I attributed it to the vast differences between tongues.<br /><br />The book takes a bit to get into - at least for me it did - but when I finally bought into the plot, it was a page turner. The book is quite complex, and has numerous plots and sub plots - so much so that you really do need to reference the included family tree.<br /><br />In the end, definitely worth a read, but perhaps not all of the hype.

I think it should be a half star novel.

B001AVCFK6|3.0|You know having watched the whole original tv series every night I could when I was younger and always being a fan of the Original group only, this movie kind of ruined things for me the way LOTR did.  I had read LOTR many, many times and even thought I enjoyed the movie, once they brought the books to life, my own personal in my head ideas of what things were was ruined. Now if I read the books I can't get movie scenes out of my head.  Well the same thing has occured here in a way. I didn't want to know how they all got together really. It didn't matter to me. I knew they would mess it up, but at least there was not as much background info available from a TV series as there was in LOTR books.  Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, Blu Ray or not, but now what do they do ?  And they are right, Spock was supposedly ahead of Kirk in the academy am I correct ?  Why was he a Commander and Kirk a Captain ? and thats not counting the other people. I have all the original series and movies with the original group on DVD. I see no reason to add this to my collection. If my wife buys it as a gift I'll take it but I won't buy it myself.  Now I did recently get a 4 disc Blu Ray of Bladerunner with the original theatrical release.  Now that is good stuff.<br /> If you are into  that Blu Ray stop and pause and rewind stuff to see things, then maybe you are not really a movie fan.  Blu Ray is nice and I like it but no, no, no do not stop the movie to pick it apart for good or bad.

Strangely enough, the music from \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\" (including the effective title ballad) was underutilized in the film itself.

B002T9H2MO|5.0|There's always a danger when you find a movie that you just LOVED - the natural inclination is to go out and want to share it with everyone. MOON is an usual film in that it will probably hit the viewer in one of two ways. If someone stumbles on it and watches it free of distractions (and likes their movies challenging) it may strike you (as it did me) as an incredibly emotional, tricky and original film experience. However, if someone reads TOO much about it in advance and watches it out of 'obligation' to a fan, they may have the reverse experience. MOON is a subtle, emotional and intelligent film, filled with tiny moments that may give you chills as you also scratch your head and even question what your eyes just witnessed. If you stick with it, you're likely to find it a rewarding, sad but heartening story that raises some interesting notions about man's place in the universe. Part optical illusion, part waking nightmare but always warm and involving, the core of the film is the story of a man struggling with his mortality. Sam Rockwell gives an Oscar-worthy performance (SHAME on the academy for ignoring him this year!)as intelligent and sympathetic as anything I've seen in years. And don't be turned off by MOON'S comparison's to 2001 (in case you're not a fan of the Kubrick film) - it may be similar in design or 'tone', but this film is as personal as any 'earthbound' tale you're likely to view. I now add MOON to my list of favorite all-time films - sharing my list with features like Robert Altman's 'MASH' and 'Long Goodbye', Robert Duvall's 'Tender Mercies', George Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' (78) and Terrence Hill's 'My Name is Nobody'.) How's THAT for variety?    ...and THANK YOU, Sam.
B002X9W50E|5.0|I don't even own this cd, but I've owned the dvd for several years. It's truly sad how little our youth knows about rock history. Much of what our young people listen to today is inspired by Bowie, and yet, they haven't a clue. I guess this is just the way of the world. I'm not sure young folks realize how influential the Beatles were or who even influenced the Beatles. Nevertheless, Bowie is one of the pioneers of modern rock. Seven reviews? This is truly sad. I must say that Bowie has never sounded better. I truly can't believe it's been seven years since his last studio album was released. I heard rumors that Bowie had retired from the music industry, but I didn't believe it was true. Well, after seven years, I guess it is true. Thankfully he left us with a true gem in the form of the album Reality and the Reality Tour DVD. This CD/DVD is absolutely amazing. It contains songs from Bowie's entire career. You will hear all the old Bowie standards, but you will also hear great Bowie tracks from the last two decades, which will one day be considred masterpieces in their own right. I hope the young rock and roll fans will discover this brilliant cd/dvd and realize that their current heroes exist because of the brilliant music that Mr. Bowie created.

B002UOMGVU|2.0|Note: The two stars reflect the quality of this release, not the film itself, which would easily garner a full five stars.    Warners has done it again.  This is the exact same disc that was released on Blu-ray before, only with the extra features piled onto a second disc and the whole thing repackaged in a pretty red book.  I think there may be one or two new, but uninteresting features (I think they slapped on a couple of mob-themed Warners cartoons... a tacky move).    If you don't own GoodFellas on Blu already, get the earlier release, you'll be saving yourself about ten or fifteen bucks...  or...  you can wait and see if Warners finally does this masterpiece justice and releases it with a proper remastering.  The video transfer on this release is pretty standard.  It looks a little better than the DVD on a side-by-side comparison, but not much.  The audio transfer is even less impressive.  No matter how nice your sound system is, the whole thing sounds like it's coming out of TV speakers.  Not very crisp, and not much separation.  The whole presentation needs a good scrubbing.    This movie should be treated as a crown jewel of the Warners catalog, and so far it's been given the same treatment as any other catalog title.  It's an Oscar winner for cryin' out loud!  It's considered by many to rival The Godfather, which Paramount gave a very extensive and impressive Blu-ray release to a while back.  The same double-dip release policy has been implemented before, and I'm sure it will be again.  New Line (Warners-owned) is about to trot out Blu-rays for Lord of the Rings, but they will be the standard theatrical editions, not the expanded versions that fans will no doubt be expecting.    So, for now, save yourself some cash.  Don't buy this thing twice, and if you still don't own it, stick with your DVD copy until Warners treats this classic with some respect.
B001LF347E|5.0|This is an excellent family film which is probably why we won't see future episodes in the USA.

I hope they show the next season as well.  If they do, can someone tell us when it will start up again?     Why DVD format?  Blu-Ray is the standard now.
0784011680|4.0|Chaplin manages to be an effective Bio pic of one of Hollywood's most famous Silent Film stars Charlie Chaplin (Robert Downey Jr.) despite simply jumping from one moment in his life to next. For instance when Charlie says he's going to be a director, it just jumps to him saying that after that he directed over 100 movies in one year. The film is long, yet it feels rushed. Downey Jr's performance is inspired and possibly his best performance, but the film itself doesn't feel too inspired.<br /><br />  I mean we're supposed to believe that a woman that is only in 2 scenes was his lost love. This is how the film tries to make us believe that. Chaplin is helping a performer with her dress and sees a young actress changing, she's mad he's there, but lets him hold a mirror for her as she puts on lip-stick. Then suddenly the film jumps to them on a date and him asking her to marry him. Did I miss something ? When did he even ask her out and when did she even act like she liked him before that ? Then the film jumps to him getting invited to act in Hollywood and the film doesn't even bother showing him upset that he had to leave her or even show them say goodbye to each other.<br /><br />  The film introduces Kevin Kline as Chaplin's best friend just as lazy. He simply is just shown playing tennis with Chaplin and I don't think we're even shown how these 2 met. Still, Downey Jr. and Kevin Kline work excellent together. It's the case where Chaplin works due to the actors pulling through better than the script. The film manges to be moving and effective but mostly due to performances by actors like Downey Jr. and Kevin Kline.<br /><br />  The way Chaplin is unfairly treated like a communist by the President (Kevin Dunn) and a lawyer (James Woods) is well done though. Other than that the movie just jumps from Chaplin being with one woman to the next. It's how he was mis-treated that makes us feel for the guy. Chaplin says in public that he won't shake the hand of a Nazi, yet his film The Great Dictator where he dresses up like Hitler backfires in his face and finally gives the President a good reason to call him a communist.s film The Great Dictator where he dresses up like Hitler backfires in his face and finally gives the President a good reason to call him a communist.

B000058983|5.0|This album,one of Rolling Stones' 500 best all-time recordings, is considered to be one of the three greatest rock recordings of all time by many critics. I believe it surpasses the other two(Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and Smiley Smile) in several ways. Firstly, the orchestration, with strings and brass become part of the songs, not merely a sonic, sound-track like background; the string parts both support and echo the words and the feelings expressed in the tunes they are utilized in. The brass parts don't sound like they're just rococo fillagree to the tunes they are in, they variously become cavalry charges, hunting calls and even Mariachi-like outbursts without sounding like Herb Alpert(too much).    Arthur Lee's beautiful, touching word-play gives many of the tunes a singer-songwriter piquancy that is hardly matched by the maudlin sentimentalism of Brian Wilson's effort, and the band can, and does , rock harder than either the Beach Boys or the Beatles when they need to.    This is an incrdible, seminal album that has never gotten it's due; like Bach, someday in the future people will finally realize what a wonder this group has produced.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I thought the movie was great!!!!!!      I am posting this to assist the skeptics, the planet needs our help, our children need our help, you can bury your head and plug your ears.  But the best thing to do is to do REAL research and accept the facts.       ________________________________________     Global Warming Fast Facts  National Geographic News     Updated June 14, 2007      Global warming, or climate change, is a subject that shows no sign of cooling down.     Here's the lowdown on why it's happening, what's causing it, and how it might change the planet.    Is It Happening?    Yes. Earth is already showing many signs of worldwide climate change.    * Average temperatures have climbed 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degree Celsius) around the world since 1880, much of this in recent decades, according to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.    * The rate of warming is increasing. The 20th century's last two decades were the hottest in 400 years and possibly the warmest for several millennia, according to a number of climate studies. And the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that 11 of the past 12 years are among the dozen warmest since 1850.    * The Arctic is feeling the effects the most. Average temperatures in Alaska, western Canada, and eastern Russia have risen at twice the global average, according to the multinational Arctic Climate Impact Assessment report compiled between 2000 and 2004.    * Arctic ice is rapidly disappearing, and the region may have its first completely ice-free summer by 2040 or earlier. Polar bears and indigenous cultures are already suffering from the sea-ice loss.    * Glaciers and mountain snows are rapidly melting--for example, Montana's Glacier National Park now has only 27 glaciers, versus 150 in 1910. In the Northern Hemisphere, thaws also come a week earlier in spring and freezes begin a week later.    * Coral reefs, which are highly sensitive to small changes in water temperature, suffered the worst bleaching--or die-off in response to stress--ever recorded in 1998, with some areas seeing bleach rates of 70 percent. Experts expect these sorts of events to increase in frequency and intensity in the next 50 years as sea temperatures rise.    * An upsurge in the amount of extreme weather events, such as wildfires, heat waves, and strong tropical storms, is also attributed in part to climate change by some experts.    Are Humans Causing It?    * \\"Very likely,\\" the IPCC said in a February 2007 report.     The report, based on the work of some 2,500 scientists in more than 130 countries, concluded that humans have caused all or most of the current planetary warming. Human-caused global warming is often called anthropogenic climate change.    * Industrialization, deforestation, and pollution have greatly increased atmospheric concentrations of water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, all greenhouse gases that help trap heat near Earth's surface. (See an interactive feature on how global warming works.)     * Humans are pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere much faster than plants and oceans can absorb it.     * These gases persist in the atmosphere for years, meaning that even if such emissions were eliminated today, it would not immediately stop global warming.    * Some experts point out that natural cycles in Earth's orbit can alter the planet's exposure to sunlight, which may explain the current trend. Earth has indeed experienced warming and cooling cycles roughly every hundred thousand years due to these orbital shifts, but such changes have occurred over the span of several centuries. Today's changes have taken place over the past hundred years or less.     * Other recent research has suggested that the effects of variations in the sun's output are \\"negligible\\" as a factor in warming, but other, more complicated solar mechanisms could possibly play a role.    What's Going to Happen?    A follow-up report by the IPCCreleased in April 2007 warned that global warming could lead to large-scale food and water shortages and have catastrophic effects on wildlife.    * Sea level could rise between 7 and 23 inches (18 to 59 centimeters) by century's end, the IPCC's February 2007 report projects. Rises of just 4 inches (10 centimeters) could flood many South Seas islands and swamp large parts of Southeast Asia.    * Some hundred million people live within 3 feet (1 meter) of mean sea level, and much of the world's population is concentrated in vulnerable coastal cities. In the U.S., Louisiana and Florida are especially at risk.    * Glaciers around the world could melt, causing sea levels to rise while creating water shortages in regions dependent on runoff for fresh water.    * Strong hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and other natural disasters may become commonplace in many parts of the world. The growth of deserts may also cause food shortages in many places.    * More than a million species face extinction from disappearing habitat, changing ecosystems, and acidifying oceans.    * The ocean's circulation system, known as the ocean conveyor belt, could be permanently altered, causing a mini-ice age in Western Europe and other rapid changes.    * At some point in the future, warming could become uncontrollable by creating a so-called positive feedback effect. Rising temperatures could release additional greenhouse gases by unlocking methane in permafrost and undersea deposits, freeing carbon trapped in sea ice, and causing increased evaporation of water.    What is Climategate?    In late November 2009, hackers unearthed hundreds of emails at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia that exposed private conversations among top-level British and U.S. climate scientists discussing whether certain data should be released to the public. [Do we know who the hackers were? Were they skeptics? Might be worth noting]    The email exchanges also refer to statistical tricks used to illustrate climate change? trends, and call climate skeptics idiots, according to the New York Times.    One such trick was used to create the well-known hockey-stick graph, which shows a sharp uptick in temperature increases during the 20th century. Former U.S vice president Al Gore relied heavily on the graph as evidence of human-caused climate change in the documentary An Inconvenient Truth.     The data used for this graph come from two sources: thermostat readings and tree-ring samples.    While thermostat readings have consistently shown a temperature rise over the past hundred years, tree-ring samples show temperature increases stalling around 1960.    On the hockey-stick graph, thermostat-only data is grafted onto data that incorporates both thermostat and tree-ring readings, essentially presenting a seamless picture of two different data sets, the hacked emails revealed.     But scientists argue that dropping the tree-ring data was no secret and has been written about in the scientific literature for years.    Climate change skeptics have heralded the emails as an attempt to fool the public, according to the Times.     Yet climate scientists maintain that these controversial points are small blips that are inevitable in scientific research, and that the evidence for human-induced climate change is much broader and still widely accepted.

1420925261|4.0|\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a unique story in the Sherlock Holmes canon -- author Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it in the years between Holmes' death and his resurrection several years later.<br /><br />But due to public pressure, Doyle brought Holmes and Watson back temporarily for a sort of \\"memoir\\" tale, a tale of supernatural curses, escaped convicts and ghastly glowing hounds. It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.<br /><br />Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.<br /><br />But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.<br /><br />The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.<br /><br />Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book.

1594488843|5.0|I have read and reviewed all of Dan Pink's previous books and think that this is his most important, his most valuable thus far. As the subtitle correctly indicates, he focuses on \\"the surprising truth about what motivates us.\\" The revelations he shares were generated by a five-year research project that involved thousands of test groups and individuals as well as dozens of research associates whom Pink duly acknowledges with obvious admiration as well as appreciation. \\"This is a book about motivation. I will show that much of what we believe about the subject just isn't so - and that the insights that [Harry] Harlow and [Edward] Deci began uncovering a few decades ago come much closer to the truth.\\" Pink goes on assert that most organizations (regardless of nature and extent) formulate strategies for motivation based on faulty assumptions and then, however well-executed these strategies may be, fail to achieve their objectives. These organizations continue to pursue practices  (e.g., shirt-term incentive plans and pay-for-performance schemes) \\"in the face of mounting evidence that such measures usually don't work and often do harm. Worse, these practices have infiltrated our schools, where we ply our future workforce with iPods, cash, and pizza coupons to `incentivize' them to learn. Something has gone wrong.\\" Indeed, as Pink convincingly explains, something has been wrong, very wrong, for many years.<br /><br />Drawing upon an abundance of research by several behavioral scientists, including Harlow and Deci, provides a multi-faceted, multi-dimensional explanation of \\"what motivates us,\\" what really motivates us. He carefully organizes his material within three Parts. In the first, he examines the flaws in reward-and-punishment system and proposes \\"a new way to think about motivation\\"; in the second, he examines the three elements of Type I behavior i.e. autonomy, mastery, and purpose) and illustrates how individuals as well as organizations \\"are using them to improve performance and deepen satisfaction\\"; and in the third Part, he provides what he characterizes as a \\"Type I Toolkit, a wealth of resources, to help each reader create an environment (in collaboration with others) in which Type I behavior can flourish.<br /><br />Here are a few of Pink's insights that caught my eye. First, a few distinctions about what Type I behavior is...and isn't: It is made, not born; almost always outperforms Type Xs in the long run; does not disdain money or recognition; is a renewable resource; promotes greater physical and mental well-being; is self-directed; devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters; and connects the quest for excellence with a larger picture. (Pages 79-81) In stunning contrast, Type X \\"is fueled more by extrinsic desires than intrinsic ones. It concerns itself less with the inherent satisfaction of an activity and more with the external rewards to which that activity leads.\\" Pink recommends what he calls the Motivation 3.0 operating system - \\"the upgrade that's needed to meet the new realities of how we organize, think about, and do what we do\\" - depends on the aforementioned Type I behavior.<br /><br />I also appreciate Pink's provision of real-world examples to create a context, a frame-of-reference, within which to anchor as well as illustrate his core concepts. In Chapters 4-6, he rigorously examines the three elements of Type I behavior (i.e. autonomy, mastery, and purpose) and explains how and why they are separate but interdependent. All three are essential to help achieve what he characterizes as \\"a renaissance of self-direction.\\" Motivation 3.0 presumes that workers want to be accountable - \\"and that making sure they have control over their task, their time, their technique, and their team is a pathway to destination.\\" With regard to mastery, Type I \\"has an incremental theory of intelligence, prizes learning gals over performance goals, and welcomes effort as a way to improve at somethingthat matters.  Begin with [a Type X] mindset, and mastery is impossible. Begin with the other [i.e. Type I], and it can be inevitable.\\"<br /><br />With all due respect to Dan Pink's previously published books, I think this one is his most important, his most valuable, because the information and wisdom he provides will have much wider and deeper impact.<br /><br />Bravo!ith [a Type X] mindset, and mastery is impossible. Begin with the other [i.e. Type I], and it can be inevitable.\\"    With all due respect to Dan Pink's previously published books, I think this one is his most important, his most valuable, because the information and wisdom he provides will have much wider and deeper impact.    Bravo!
009951155X|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

0385528752|5.0|Chip and Dan Heath have once again summoned a lively writing style to present a series of compelling insights that make this book even more interesting as well as more valuable than its predecessor, Made to Stick. As they explain in the first chapter, \\"In this book, we argue that successful changes share a common pattern. They require the leader of change to do three things at once: To change someone's behavior, you've got to change that person's situation...[to cope with the fact that change] is hard because people wear themselves out. And that's the second surprise about change: What looks like laziness is often exhaustion...If you want people to change, you must provide crystal clear direction [because what] looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity.\\" Throughout, the Heaths work within a narrative, best viewed as a \\"three-part framework,\\" as they provide countless real-world (as opposed to hypothetical or theoretical] examples and - to their great credit - also provide a context or frame-of-reference for each.<br /><br />Moreover, the Heaths invoke a few extended metaphors. The most important of these are the Rider (i.e. our rational side), the Elephant, (i.e. our emotional and instinctive side) and the Path (i.e. the surrounding environment in which change initiatives will be conducted). The challenge is to direct the Rider, motivate the Elephant, and shape the Path to make change more likely, \\"no matter what's happening with the Rider and Elephant...If you can do all three at once, dramatic change can happen even if you don't have lots of power or resources behind you.\\"<br /><br />Donald Berwick offers an excellent case in point.  In 2004, in his position as a doctor and the CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), he had developed some ideas as to \\"how to save lives - massive numbers of lives\\" and his ideas were so well-supported by research that they were indisputable and yet \\"little was happening\\" until he spoke at a professional meeting and proposed six very specific interventions to save lives. Within two months, more than 1,000 hospitals had signed up. Eighteen months later, to the day (June 14, 2006) he had previously announced that he'd promised to return, he announced the results: \\"Hospitals enrolled in the 100,000 Lives Campaign have collectively prevented an estimated 122,300 avoidable deaths and, as importantly, have begun to institutionalize new standards of care that will continue to save lives and improve health outcomes into the future.\\" He had directed his audience's Riders (i.e. hospital administrators), he had motivated his audience's Elephants by making them feel the compelling need for change, and he had shaped the Path by making it easier for the hospitals to embrace the change. The Heaths offer more than a dozen other prime examples (e.g. Jerry Sternin in Vietnam, the Five-Minute Room Rescue, \\"Fataki\\" in Tanzania) that also demonstrate how the same three-part framework resulted in the achievement of major changes elsewhere despite great difficulty.<br /><br />Near the end of the book, the Heaths summarize the key points they have so thoroughly made while explaining to their reader how to make a switch. \\"For things to change, somebody somewhere has to start acting differently. Maybe it's you, maybe it's your team. Picture the person (or people). Each has an emotional Elephant side and a rational Rider side. You've got to reach both. And you've also got to clear the way for them to succeed.\\" By now, the Heaths have explained how others have directed the Rider, motivated the Elephant, and shaped the Path. They conclude their book with a Q&A section during which they advise how to resolve twelve problems that people most often encounter as they fight for change. They suggest, and I agree, that this advice \\"won't make sense to anybody who hasn't read the book.\\" The same can probably be said about much of what I have shared in this review.<br /><br />Although, in my opinion, this is one of the most important business books published during the last several years, no commentary such as mine can do full justice to it. It simply must be read and read carefully, preferably then re-read carefully. Otherwise, it makes no sense to visit [...] to obtain additional information and assistance.<br /><br />I offer my congratulations to Chip and Dan Heath on a brilliant achievement.

It is interesting and fairly authentic but obviously not as extensive as I had envisioned from the description in the Noble catalog.  These do not appear to be the same item.  The movie is great!

B0017SWPXY|2.0|This has to be one of the most cliche books I have read in a long while. The idea of the dog narrating the story and his insight was good, and a good idea, but this novel is too weak on character development across the board, except for the dog's. The racing \\"metaphors\\" and \\"metaphysics\\" are thin and old hat. There is little or no character development of Eve the Wife, other than she's afraid of doctors. The domineering old man and almost believable old woman come off with no sense of relationship to anyone. If Denney is this fantastical insightful daring-do race car driver, why can't he stand up to anybody? And, to not give away the ending, the two types of racing described in the text and at the end are not compatible with the driver and his style. This book should never be compared with Marley and Me. Except for Albom's first book Morey, it's about as weak-minded as Albom's writing since.

1932100385|3.0|I got the China Study awhile ago, because an article in in two vegetarian magazines I acquired praised the author and his book. I noticed some problems with what the book covers (and doesn't cover). Fairly recently, a friend of mine decided to print out the online 1-4 star reviews of this book. I now began to get quite bothered by the book. Also, I sympathize with the people who really want to know the truth.    I've been a vegan for a few years, but I'm not a fanatic one, and I've now studied health for about 16 years. If something is the truth, then it doesn't need to be backed up with fraud or someone who's too involved in her or his own version of reality for anything else to truly exist.    Part 4 of this book appears to be good. It's about how much profit has blurred together the government, industry, science, and medicine. It's also about \\"scientific reductionism\\": to focus on as few as one nutrient, phytochemical, or some other item, when what's best for us to do is based on how everything interacts with each other. Some of the studies that used scientific reductionism are fine, but many of these studies have only given us conflicting informtion. The discussion of the 3 stages of cancer seems good. The book basically states that by keeping the needed genes dormant, a healthy diet can prevent many diseases, a fact also brought up in the Pritikin Weight Lsoss Breakthrough. I don't expect that I'll ever reread much else in this book often.     The author is clearly focused on proving that to eat of animals is bad for us. He partly did this by covering classic vegetarian-supportive studies, many of which are more than a few years old. Another way he used is to show that getting over a certain amount of casein (which is most of the protein in milk) causes cancer in animals given mold-caused aflatoxin. It also causes liver cancer in animals infected with the hepatitis B virus.    One of the 1 star reviewers, D. Tosh, concluded that to reach the amount of casein that caused cancer in these studies by milk instead, our diet must be more than about half milk. With such a large amount being used, another reviewer's question is probably unneeded. That is, since the studies used only 1 animal and 2 plant sources of protein, where's the proof that the results apply to all sources of protein?    For some reason, neither of those 2 points occurred to me. What I did conclude is that maybe a diet low enough in animal protein prevents some causes of cancer from creating cancer, but I doubt it'll do that for all possible causes. Is our intake of animal protein more important than food that's a bit burnt, food that's heavily salted, radon, to use any of the products of tobacco, being sedentary...?    The chapter in the China Study on heart disease has some good data, but it's too focused on of animals as the cause of this. I'm sure that about all I could need to know on this is in Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease. Dr. Ornish covers more causes than just of animals, and he acknowledges (on pages 56-57) that not all of us will get a high level of blood cholesterol by consuming a lot of saturated fat and cholesterol. On page 66 of that book, Dean states that while the Eskimos do have a low risk of heart disease, they also have one of the highest rates of hemorrhagic strokes.    While a large percentage of our diet being of animals is bad for most of us, how much of our diet is of animals isn't the only thing that counts. In the 10th anniversary edition of Diet for a Small Planet, pages 121-138, Frances Moore Lappe outlines 8 changes to the U.S.' diet: more protein from of animals and less from plants, more fat (by of animals and by processed foods), more sugar, more salt, more alcohol than during the Prohibition, less fiber, more sedentary (so we're getting more calories than we need), and more additives, residues of antibiotics, and pesticides.    The China Study doesn't discuss gluten intolerance, food allergies, if weshould avoid non-organic white potatoes, how we should cover omega-3 fatty acids by a plants-only diet, etc. It therefore implies that all of us can consume all plants. Also, it puts beta-carotene with the B vitamins (not phytochemicals), and it apparently doesn't know what folic acid (or folate) is. It's a B vitamin.    The China Study doesn't discuss centenarians. But, aren't they among our best examples of what really works for us? My friend talked about the \\"blue zones\\" to me one day. I think 3 of these locations, all of which have a real and relevant percentage of centenarians, are of course the Okinawans (who we can learn about online and in books), a group in the Mediterranean's Sardinia, and a group of the Seventh-Day Adventists in California. The Oldways Preservation & Exchange Trust have pyramids of the traditional Asian and Mediterranean diets. Wikipedia has a bit on the China Project (or the China-Cornell-Oxford Project), and there are books.    The China Study doesn't really discuss any decades-old vegetarian and vegan groups. The Seventh-day Adventists encourages (not requires) a vegetarian diet, and the Farm (which is in Tennessee) is vegetarian. Research has been done on both of these groups.    Dr. Michael Klapper is running the Vegan Health Study, and he wants by it to get more definite knowledge on what our dietary choices should be. After all, we don't know how to prevent all cases of heart disease, and much more. As for now, the ADA approves of a well-planned vegetarian and vegan diet. Look up its website or consider the two books listed below. (These books do have some errors.)    By the way... whether you want 35% total fat by monounsaturated fat or 10% total fat, the chance of delicious food is higher by the book Get the Fat Out. I doubt that any of us can add many tips to the information in this book.    For us to feel fairly confident about generic health information, we need to build a foundation of great resources. I doubt there's any good resource without any statements that are dated, incorrect, incomplete, and/or shows that some fact of reality doesn't exist for a person or a group. Do compensate for that reality. Many of my resources don't list any websites. I judge the following publications to be good:    Becoming Vegan and/or the New Becoming Vegetarian  (their main focus is a healthy diet)  Dr. Dean Ornish's books  John Robbin's books  Prevention magazine/ Rodale Press  Consumer Reports on Health (from Consumer Union)  Get the Fat Out: 501 Simple Ways to Reduce the Fat in Any Diet  by Victoria Moran  Nutrition Action Health Letter  by the Center For Science in the Public Interest (or CSPI on line)

The story is predictable and for lack of a better word, I would say dubious... But I can't say that it doesn't cheer me up though.  All her stories are extremely girly and somehow, I can always identify with the cluelessness, clumpsiness, and at times naivette of her characters.  I guess that's what makes the books sell right?  If you have nothing to do or in need of a little pick me up, then this is a descent time filler.
160094048X|5.0|I made the fudgy expresso brownies, and they are worth the book.  Anyone who's tried to make vegan brownies knows how awkward the results often turn out- and these are perfect.  They're much like brownies from a mix, which is what I want in a brownie-fudgy, with that kind of flaky top.   They get a bonus for not requiring tofu-although if you like that sort of thing, there's a caky brownie in the book as well.    (I hear good things about the Mexican chocolate snickerdoodles from my former roomate, but I haven't gotten the nerve to add cayenne to my baked goods yet.)
B0035FQ1UU|5.0|I like watching each interpretation of catastrophy movies. End of the world, aliens, destruction, whatever it maybe. I enjoy watching this movie because it gives a different interpretation of what the writers and directors of each movie have to offer. Noted that everyone in the world has a completely different view point of the end of the world, I loved the detail to \\"what might happen\\" as far as the ending of our world with the volcano, to the tsunami, to how we could possibly escape. I watch movies because I like that \\"escape\\" from the real world aspect of it all. Its purely for entertainment. I think some people who reviewed this movie negatively did not view it with entertainment purposes. People who called it \\"stupid\\" does not mean this movie was made for \\"education\\" Of course these are peoples opinions but yet again, it's only entertainment. I'm sure these people can find plenty of personal ways to entertain themselves with their hands since some movies are just \\"dumb, stupid, or omg bad bad bad\\" (quoted from other reviewers.)

0307269981|5.0|Riveting, kept me engaged.  I didn't want to put the book down.  Very well written always with surprises around the corner.  Only difficulty was remembering some of the Swedish names.  Highly recommend for an exciting and fun read.
0812550757|2.0|Ok here goes.  As so many people have written I loved Ender's Game and was looking forward to picking the story up where it left off.  I have battled my way through this book and now am reading the last 100 pages or so and I can say that the story has finally begun to pick up a little, but it has been a slog trying to get to the end as opposed to a pleasure.    The only parts of Ender's Game that I didn't like were the sections focusing on Demosthenes and Locke.  Ender's siblings' development into globally respected political pundits seemed very implausible to me.  Also, I felt like that part of the story was unnecessary to the main story about Ender.  SFTD was, for me, an entire book with the \\"Demosthenes and Locke\\" flavor to it as opposed to the excitement and interest of the Ender story.  This book gives me the same feeling as watching Phantom Menace: here is the same world with some of the same characters and yet, its not the same at all.  They've set up the cameras and started filming again (OSC in this book and George Lucas in Phantom Menace), but this time they're filming all the boring parts.    For one thing, I really disliked OSC's choice of putting the story in this future-catholic Portuguese setting.  I've read some Gabriel Garcia Marquez and enjoyed it, but if I'm going to read about humanity 3000 years in the future on another planet, dear god please don't make it feel like I wandered onto the set of a cheesy Mexican soap opera.  To think that this is the book OSC had in mind and Ender's Game is only the intro?  Wow.  Hard to believe.  All the time and effort that OSC spends on describing the politics of the priests and saints and local government just feels like total fluff and filler while you keep turning pages hoping that he'll get around to revealing some of the mystery that he sets up with the piggies.  And his superfluous use of Portuguese just seems so silly.    In summary, try to imagine the most boring and disconnected sequel possible to theawesomeness that was Ender's Game.  Speaker for the Dead is it.

0385528752|5.0|When I read books I tend to put small flag notes on bits I think are particularly good or helpful. My copy of \\"Switch\\" is filled with them. The book offers a number of pieces of advice to help you change or help others change--all of it backed up with examples, stories, and references.    As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the analogy/metaphor/simile of the Rider, Elephant, and Path is one of the core thoughts in the book. Other reviewers have described it already, so I won't again, but I can say that ever since I've read the book I've explained the concept to at least one person nearly every day. It is a very simple, very \\"sticky\\" idea that provides a valuable focusing lens to think through situations and then come up with appropriate actions.     All in all, highly recommended. Change is not easy, but the advice and the references in this book can help make it possible.
B0006ZE7G2|1.0|Ridiculous amateur attempt at filmmaking. The film is so bad it ruined listening to Pink Floyd for me for YEARS. You would have to be pretty weak minded to think this movie is groundbreaking, deep, or powerful. Maybe if your normal fare is Cheech and Chong, this would seem like a really intelligent piece of art. I wonder if Bob Geldof ever thinks about all the good things that could have been done for the world with the money that was wasted on this crap film. Do the world a favour and don't buy this DVD; give the money to charity and take a nap instead.
B000FA5TTW|1.0|This book was not at all what I expected.  I was left sad and frustrated after reading it.  I was only able to finish it by telling myself that the murderer would be caught or that her body would be discovered.  Unfortunately, even though the writer teased the reader with the possibility of both, neither happened.  The reader, through the eyes of the poor dead girl, helplessly watched as the family fell apart.  I felt so sorry for her father and just as strongly despised her mother.  As for the writing, the sentence structure was so strange that I spent half my time re-reading.  Someone asked me if it was because it was being told by a teenager.  I could allow for that, except that the school systems back in the 70's still expected students to use proper grammar.  Overall a real disappointment that I would not recommend to anyone.  I had planned to see the movie, but after reading the book, I won't bother.

B0000AYJXR|3.0|I had fond memories of watching this movie several years ago and wanted to purchase it for my library.  When I recently reviewed it, I used the subtitles which took a lot of the luster off the film.  I have to rate is as mediocre and caution kids from using subtitles as the conversations are more adult than fun. Also, the story line was not as entertaining as my memory told me it was.

B002VECLVY|5.0|In the run-up to the 2010 Oscars, dominated by well-made but overhyped mainstream Hollywood hopefuls (Up In The Air, Avatar, The Hurt Locker) and Hollywood wannabes (A Prophet), there's one film that lives up to the hype, and then some.  Even now though, the press and critics bafflingly seem to be reining-in the enthusiasm, wondering whether A Single Man has any real substance behind fashion-designer-turned-filmmaker Tom Ford's superficial stylizations or whether there is any real depth behind Colin Firth's performance.  There most certainly is.    Set in LA in 1962, an aging English professor, finding it impossible to publicly grieve the death of his homosexual partner who has just died in a car crash, sets about arranging for his own suicide.  There certainly seems to be little more to the film than George's painful reminiscences of what has been lost mixed with chance encounters in the present day - minor encounters mostly, none of them apparently significant enough to deter him from the direction he is determined to take - but each of the little episodes that make up the film and the manner in which they are filmed, cumulatively add up to a realistic and meaningful consideration of the experience of loving, living and dying.    Tom Ford's direction and visual language - the period detail, the coloration, the emphasis on mood and facial expression over expositional dialogue - would seem to owe much to Wong Kar-wai - an impression enforced by the use of Shigeru Umebayashi on the soundtrack - but the director nonetheless finds in it a personal means to best express the complexity of emotions that the situation gives rise to.  Colin Firth is a revelation in this respect, his usual impassive demeanour appropriate for the reserved nature of his character, but there's a brave openness about his performance that we've not seen before that allows George's vulnerability to break through.  This may very well be the film of the year - it's certainly one of the most beautiful.

I'm glad I read it.  Cold Sweden, cool goth heroine, a plot that is amazing in its intricacy.  It made me feel smart to read this.  Major adrenaline rush at the end, and maybe a bit too many strings all tied up at the end, hence the four stars.  Also it's obvious at the end that we have to read the next coming up, which I damn well am and soon!!

Their plan to transfer the money mid-air to collaborators in another plane goes awry, and the hijackers crash land and lose the money in the surrounding mountains. They radio for help, and former ranger Gabe Walker and his partner Hal Tucker answer the call. Qualen and his men have a high-tech tracking device that shows them the locations of the three cases of missing money, but they need help traveling through the mountains, so they force Gabe and Hal to be their guides. Forced to scale a rock face in the middle of a snow storm, Gabe grabs some of the money and escapes. Gabe knows Qualen will kill Hal as soon as Qualen has the remaining cash, so, with fellow ranger Jessie Deighan, Gabe tries to reach the money before Qualen does. \\"Cliffhanger\\" is one of the most exciting action movies. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad guy. Prepare yourselves for an awesome thrill ride.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I've always liked watching Dr. Quinn and finding the whole set for this great affordable price was amazing. There was only one issue I had: when I bought the box set I also bought the two movies separately, only realizing once I recieved it that the movies are included in the box set. If you are thinking of buying the two separately, just know that you don't have to, they are included.
B000024E9O|5.0|I can think of no other recording in my lifetime that can even equal,  let alone surpass,  \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\".  In every musical genre---this is my personal favorite.  I bought it when it was new,   so of course I have it memorized.  I am listening to it now,  but can also play it in my head,  and never tire of its ethereal majesty.  I was very fortunate to have seen the entire performance of the Lamb back in the 1970's at the West Palm Beach Auditorium,  in the third \\"row\\" (it was general seating) and it was the concert of a lifetime.  I am a prog hound from way back--and the best of the others,  whom I love,  such as Le Orme,  VDGG,  PFM,  Camel,  Banco,  Slapp Happy,  Jade Warrior,  Peter Hammill,  Brian Eno,  Acqua Fragile,  Idiot Flesh,  Caravan,  Kevin Ayers, King Crimson,  and many others besides,  cannot hold a candle to this sublime and powerful masterpiece.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Watched it on Amazon Demand and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Wish I had read the book.      For me it was more than just a love story between two children but about acceptance of another's differences. About knowing one's inner strength and if you're lucky having someone in your life who is going to always have your back.    Maybe it is just a love story.  I don't know.    But I envied Oskar finally having someone enter his life that almost from the start was rooting for him to be the strong person that he is.      Anyway, I don't know if this review helps anyone who is interested in purchasing the film but if you have not guessed it already.....    Highly recommend this movie!!!!
1400049628|5.0|A must have for Zombie fans, Brooks is a great writer and this \\"how to\\" spoof is full of info that makes you think.
0446567329|4.0|I admit, the only reason I bumped this book up in my tbr pile was because the movie just barely came out and I refused to go watch it before I read the novel. The story was very catching from the first few words, I was completely mesmerized by the John's story. The way that he and Savannah meet is not necessary romantic but original in it's own sense. As I continued to read the novel, I could feel John's pain at having to leave Savannah and his joy at finally getting to see her again. I think the hardest part of the novel to read, personally, was his relationship with his father. Also having to make the choice of being loyal to his team and re-enlisting and sacrificing his happiness. I just loved the overall message of this novel. It makes you see things in such a different perspective. If you wanna see Dear John in movie theaters, then I strongly suggest that you read this novel. The movie doesn't do the novel any justice. That being said, I'm giving this novel 4 out of 5 paws.
0767836324|4.0|Get the hook! Get the hook! When \\"Hook\\" came out the buzz was that is was a sub par performance from director Steven Spielberg--an epic flop--but my niece said it was really good, so I gave it a spin. My verdict was that it was pretty good and I enjoyed it. Why did the public stay home in droves?<br /><br />Spielberg's appeal has been and continues to be that he maintains his connection to his inner child. Kids like dinosaurs. So he makes a movie about dinosaurs. Huge blockbuster. Sometimes he manipulates his audience--and the audience is only too happy to be manipulated--until they become aware that the director is manipulating them, and he knows he is manipulating them, and he might also be laughing at them, and how easy they can be manipulated. How dare he? Backlash.<br /><br />Hook, and the whole Neverland, Peter Pan, franchise is all about getting in touch with your inner child. If you believe and think your happy thought, then you can fly! It would seem to be a perfect fit for Spielberg, but it exposes his method. Even Hook knows that he is just a character in a story. During a fight he tells Peter Pan that he is going to wake up and realize that it was all a dream. While watching \\"Hook\\" the audience realizes that they are being Spielberged, making it harder and harder to hold on to that happy thought. I just made up that word, \\"Spielberged\\" by the way, but I am sure you know exactly what I am talking about.<br /><br />There was also a backlash against Robin Williams underway at that time that may have contributed to the film's cold reception. Perhaps it was Patch Adams that drove people over the edge, but Williams had taken on too many cute roles and his appeal was starting to grow thin. Since that time he has declared Death to Smoochy and tried for edgier roles. If anyone saw him in \\"What Dreams May Come\\" they might notice that it bears a lot of similarity with \\"Hook\\" in that it is rumination on the power of dreams and the imagination, but it is balanced with a darker side. One Hour Photo is perhaps his edgiest role to date, but take August Rush for an example. He plays a Fagin-like character who tries to exploit the musical talent of the lost boys he finds. He has a bit of the Robin Williams whimsy we've all seen in him since the days of Mork and Mindy, but it is balanced by his sinister side, so his character never becomes cloying and overly sentimental. Williams has been trying to find that blend of dark and light with varying degrees of success. I think he got it in \\"Hook\\" but at the time people were either sick of the too-cute Robin, or not ready for the dark side to be revealed.<br /><br />---------------<br />Peter Banning: You're not old enough to shave! What are you doing with a sword? I've been flying around - This is an insurance nightmare! What is this? Some sort of the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" pre-school? Where are your parents? Who's in charge here?<br />=====================<br /><br />Once the backlash started, it only picked up momentum with rumors that Julia Roberts--who does she think she is?--as Tinkerbelle was nicknamed 'Tinkerhell' because she was so difficult on the set. Since she spent so much of her screen time hoisted aloft on wires she had a person whose sole job it was to make sure her feet were always clean. Tinkerbelle had a sublet apartment in an empty cuckoo clock and there was a gold MasterCard (or was it Visa?) sitting behind her on an easel. It was kind of cute, in a Spielbergian way, showing how tiny she was, but it was like putting a commercial right smack dab in the movie. Product placement gone amuck. And some people might not want to see a full-sized Tinkerbelle smooching Robin Williams, even if this was a movie about what happens when Peter Pan grows up.<br /><br />Bottom line is \\"Hook\\" is a very entertaining film with great performances by Dustin Hoffman, as title character Captain James Hook; Robin Williams, as Peter Pan/Banning; Bob Hoskins as First Mate Smee; Maggie Smith, Charlie Korsmo, and the lovely Julia Roberts as Tinkerbelle. It stays true to the original J.M. Barrie material while asking the question: what would happen if Peter did grow up? It was unjustly maligned, but if you keep an open mind perhaps you'll find that you do believe in fairies after all. Kids will enjoy it but there is something for grown ups to think about, too. Watch for cameo performances by Glenn Close, Carrie Fisher, Gwyneth Paltrow, David Crosby, Jimmy Buffet, George Lucas, Phil Collins, and also from the band called Genesis: Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks. The cast and crew all seemed to be having a great time, even bringing their kids, some of whom also appear in Hook. At one point a complicated scene had to be cut, but Bob Hoskins bought a round of beer for 300 + extras out of his own pocket.

B0029LHW4U|2.0|To start this is not a review comparing this album to facelift, dirt, or any other previous aic albums. Also I am not going to sit here and rant how layne stayley made the aic, because it wasnt just him. This review is solely about (Black gives way to Blue). To start, One word to describe this album would be boring. Some of the lyrics were solid (ex.Your Decision,Acid Bubble,All Secrets Known) but, even with good lyrics and decent guitar riffs aic still couldn't deliver for me (Yes I am talking about vocals William DuVall). The vocal performances had absolutely no emotion.  This album had alot of problems that i hope the band could fix next time around, one of the main problems is the fact that all the songs on album sound alike and thats where most of the boredom of this album comes from. Maybe next album (and i know there will be a next album)they could do better and i hope they do. Nice try guys. Close but no cigar, actually not close at all.

B000I0RNV6|5.0|I rented a copy of \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" because it was a Foreign-Language Oscar winner and that, to me, is usually recommendation enough.  The movie begins in the present with news of a death.  Like \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" and \\"Citizen Kane\\", \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" gives us the story behind the man we don't yet know.  In the process there are many heart-warming (and heart-breaking) scenes that give us a glimpse of how a young boy's life is affected by so many different elements.  I was struck by how all the characters have flaws of their own.  This isn't \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" where all that is corrected in the end.  We come away from \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" with some degree of disappointment yet very glad that we took the time to give our emotions a good workout.    During the closing cast and credits, my teenage son came into the room and asked what kind of foreigh film was I watching now.  I said, \\"This film is why I watch movies\\".  I'll leave it at that.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I love this movie and it was worth every penny I spent on it. If you are a true MJ fan, you won't wanna miss this and even if your not it is still very good. My girlfriend went to the movies with me and she is not a big fan but was totally in awe of his great performance and how he has \\"say\\" in everything about the concert. She realized exactly how much talent he had after watching this movie.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I loved this series, and was extremely dissapointed when it was canceled, just like many others.  Excellent humor, complete characters, and a universe that had texture, not just a cardboard set.

0375842209|5.0|This book is so creative and well written that I'm shocked it has not won major awards.  Young author captures the atmosphere of WWII Germany with memorable characters and plot.  Great for young and old.  I have never before read a book narrated by Death!

B00006CXSS|5.0|I originally bought this series for my husband as a Christmas present but after watching the first episode I was hooked.  For anyone who is a WWII buff, this is an awesome adaptation of Easy Comp. stories.  While parts of it are definitely hard to watch, it is a good film that shows what our servicemen went through to ensure our freedom.
0312330871|4.0|What a great book to read, especially if you are looking for something quick and absorbing.  In \\"And Then There Were None\\", Agatha Christie delivers the classic whodunit.<br /><br />From the interrogation of the suspects and examination of the crime scenes Christie provides us the clues to start to make our own deductions on who is the murder.  Eventually, like most people I am sure, we need to reassemble our thoughts as our main suspect is killed off.  I found myself more than once going back to review the evidence and constantly rereading the nursery rhyme that makes available the plot.<br /><br />As stated above, it's a great book.  I read that over 100 million copies of \\"And Then There Were None\\" have been sold, making it the seventh highest selling book ever.  Also, only the Bible is said to have more books sold than Agatha Christie's collection.  In terms of authors, her name is readily accepted with Shakespeare's as among the best selling authors of all time.  Impressive.<br /><br />Enjoy the book.<br /><br />Ps.  Look up pictures of Burgh Island if you want to see Christie's inspiration for Indian Island.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I read through all of the reviews for various different work out tapes and settled on this one, simply because I am more likely to do a 20 minute workout than a 1 hr workout. I am glad I did! This kicks my butt every time I do it! Every part of my body was sore the first few days. I recently moved on to level two and I am wincing in pain! I moved on once I was no longer sore, because believe me I always felt exhausted! It feels great, finally a short work out where you feel like you got in an hours worth.
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|I've loved this movie since seeing it in theaters as a teenager.  Certainly one of my top ten favorites.  I was genuinely excited to finally be able to buy this on blu-ray.  Sadly, I was tragically disappointed when I finally saw it.  The grain is abysmal.  I don't understand how anyone can say this picture is great.  I understand that the movie was made in the early 80s, but Bladerunner doesn't look nearly as bad.  Not nearly.    I can only assume that the folks raving about the great picture on this disc are actually studio plants sent here to deceive people into buying this, or they're undiscerning viewers watching on some portable hand-held blu-ray player or a similar substandard playback device.  Star Trek 2009 has a great picture.  The Dark Knight has a great picture.  Bladerunner has a good picture.  The picture on this disc is poor in comparison.      If you love the Wrath of Khan, buy the movie.  Despite my disappointment, I don't REGRET buying it as it is better looking (more detailed) than the DVD.  But if you have a quality 1080P monitor, then you should temper your expectations, as this won't compare favorably to any of the truly high quality blu-ray releases out there.  Hopefully, Paramount will give us a better, cleaner high-def transfer in the future.    UPDATE: Alright, I screwed up.  I finally got a chance to return home for a three week vacation from my current overseas deployment.  My previous review was based on viewing this blu-ray on my computer with a 30\\" (2560x1600) monitor.  When I got home, I decided to give it a second chance on my plasma HDTV (768p) and PS3.  The picture was beautiful, practically flawless.  None of that ugly video noise I saw on my computer screen was visible here.  If I hadn't seen it myself, I wouldn't have believed that there would be such a huge difference in picture quality between two setups. I can only assume that my computer was exposing shortcomings in the transfer that my PS3 and lower resolution HDTV are notcapable of revealing.  In any event, I can certainly see now why so many have been enthusiastic about this disc, and I apologize for accusing them of being plants.  On the right theater setup, this disc looks sharp, colorful, and totally satisfying.

B002ZTIIXK|4.0|I have most of these songs on her previous albums, but it is good to hear all her songs on one collection. I love \\"Constant Craving\\" and the carefree \\"Summerfling\\".  I love her duet \\"Crying\\" with Roy Orbison.  The new song \\"Beautifully Combined\\" is a romantic love song. I also like her \\"Moonglow\\" duet with Tony Bennett.  What is missing here are a few more excellent tracks from her the Drag album from 1997 and a few others.  I would have loved to have seen \\"The Joker\\" and \\"Don't Smoke in Bed\\" included here.  The beautiful reflective duet entitled \\"River\\" with Madeleine Peyroux is also  not included here. \\"A Case Of You\\" is another song by KD that moves me.  This lovely song is missing here.  I cannot give this two disc set five stars because of these exclusions.  I give it four stars for the excellent music that is included here. This music is highly enjoyable.
142313494X|5.0|The Lightning Thief was a phenomenally written and highly educational adventure. The story of Percy Jackson is woven with authentic mythology and when you're reading it, you know you are experiencing something monumental.<br /><br />It's amazingly creative and extremely detailed. I found myself visualizing every event, setting, god and mythological creature described with ease. Percy's struggles and how he deals with them show an evolution of character that is usually saved for later in a series. From thinking like a human in denial to becoming the confident demigod he's destined to be, the progression is nothing short of spellbinding.<br /><br />Rick Riordan has a way of hinting at a characters true identity before revealing it that allows older readers to guess who the character might be.I found this to be great fun as it allowed me to utilize some of my high school mythology lessons I once thought to be long forgotten.<br /><br />I was hooked in the first ten pages and could not drag myself away from the story. Percy Jackson and the Olympians appears to be almost overqualified to fill the void left in the middle grade fantasy genre created by the ending of the Harry Potter series. This is a series everyone, young and old, should experience. Definitely not to be missed.
B002ZG98JG|3.0|Just got back from the theatre and I guess I'm spoiled, for the movie was very blurry compared to what I watch at home on my TV.  Sorry, but this is the last time I go to the theatre to watch a movie, for I'll just have to wait till it comes out in Blu-ray to watch it again.  Very entertaining and I didn't fall asleep despite the theatre's low quality screen version and sound.  Wait till it comes out on Blu-ray to see it, for if you cave in and watch it now at the theatres, you'll be dissapointed.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|Allow me to explain how so. The movie is definitely a fresh take on the vampire mythology. No arguing with that. It's bittersweet, but, first of all, it's greatest achievement is that it manages to be a universal love story in spite of the darkness that surrounds it.<br />Eli could very well be one of those rare, but ordinary people who come into our lives and makes us overcome our own issues, empowers us, loves us for what we are. And are there when we need a little \\"hand\\".<br />It's also a story of people (i'm not saying children on purpose) who belong to different worlds overcoming and accepting their differences to be together. it's unique on its own right.<br />Definitely not \\"the best vampire movie ever\\" like some promptly say; the film does not delve into vampirism properly, it's barely a \\"vampire movie\\"! It's just a movie that happens to feature a vampire as one of its leads. But vampirism is not the focus of the story. If You want to take a look at the vampire world, you go after \\"BS's Dracula\\" or \\"Interview with the vampire\\". But if you come to LTROI expecting a vampire movie, you might be disappointed.<br />The movie excells in its universality and I recommend it to anyone who is in for a touching (yet bloody!) coming of age tale of first love.
B002YIHO7I|2.0|I love love love Sade and will buy every CD she makes because I am one of her truest fans. Her voice is stellar, songwriting skills are genious, and her band is the best. However, I have been waiting ten years for Miss Folasade, and I am thoroughly let down. I was expecting more. Why didn't she do a double CD: this one and then a version with her HAPPY IN LOVE- the victorious soldier!?!<br />  Whew, these are some heavy lyrics and the songs make you drag across the floor and drag about your day and drag, drag, drag, you get the picture. It's too melancholy for me. It's even too melancholy for SADE in my opinion.<br />  BabyFather is somewhat happy, The Moon and the Sky bounces along but geesh..... still dark & depressing; like the Soldier she sings about.<br />This one is going in my Sade catalogue and I will stick to playing my \\"Best of Sade\\" (2001) CD! That one lights my day.

1416550550|4.0|This tireless adventure starts with a little girl abandoned on a ship in Australia. Then we are taken on an adventure that not only lingers between two continents, but uncovers the inner, emotional journey of two women. As one woman tries to uncover her past, the responsibilities of the present prevent her finding the answers. It is her granddaughter who continues the quest and unravels the story to find the hidden forgotten garden and all that it represents.<br /><br />As the characters stumble upon the secrets and the beauty of the garden, the reader cannot help but reflect on the mirrored journey into the soul. This story's search for answers about the past, remind us that it is the present that matters most.<br /><br />This Kate Morton tale is awesome! The characters are extremely well-defined and the settings allow the reader to feel at if she has been there. After this treasure as well as the wonderful The House at Riverton, I can only hope that Ms Morton continues to share her storytelling with us.
B002ZTIILC|5.0|Marina & The Diamonds, despite the plural-sounding name is 24 year old Welsh/Greek singer Marina Diamandis. Her quirky Pop sound has drawn comparisons with Kate Bush or Florence & The Machine (especially her big swooping vocals), but I find she also reminds me of Paula Cole and PJ Harvey.<br /><br />A musical kaleidoscope, the buzzing \\"Shampain\\" has a Dance feel, while \\"Girls\\" is even more Disco-fied. \\"Mowgli's road\\" is offbeat marching Pop with references to The Jungle Book stories, while \\"Obsessions\\" starts off a quivering piano ballad before picking up some speed.<br /><br />Single \\"Hollywood\\" takes a wry look at aspects of the American dream. \\"She said Oh my God, you look just like Shakira, no no you're Catherine Zeta, actually my name's Marina\\" go the amusing picturesque lyrics in part.<br /><br />Other outstanding tracks are the bouncy \\"The outsider\\", \\"Hermit the frog\\" (with a Mid Eastern feel), the symphonic-sounding \\"Numb\\", \\"Guilty\\" (with sweeping strings and clanking beats), and the simply spectacular \\"Rootless\\" (cabaret Pop with a beautiful wall of harmonies).<br /><br />This is one diamond that shines!

B002VPE1AW|5.0|The 1970 film \\"Little Big Man\\", starring Dustin Hoffman and directed by Arthur Penn, marked a turning point in America's perception of its history. It was the fictionalized account of the unforgivable massacre by American soldiers of a  Southern Cheyenne village at Sand Creek, and of the totally justified revenge of the Cheyenne and Souix at Little Big Horn. A huge box office success, Little Big Man followed the fine book \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\"; both the film and the book lamented the genocide committed against the aboriginal peoples of North America. In 1970, it was too late for apologies, but the guilty conscience awakened by  such a confession has persisted. \\"Little Big Man\\" was not perceived, however, as ONLY about genocide; it was recognized immediately as a repudiation of ecological destruction in the name of 'capitalism' and progress -- a manifesto of environmentalism -- and as a 'parable' of America's senseless, criminal conduct in the Vietnam War, that war which the US Armed Forces LOST despite their overwhelming superiority of war machines. The hateful, arrogant, unredeemable villain in \\"Little Big Man\\" was George Armstrong Custer; when Custer was finally \\"rubbed out\\", young Americans cheered in theaters from Sea to Shining Sea.<br /><br />Sound familiar, all you who have seen \\"Avatar\\"? [If you haven't seen Avatar, stop reading! I can't possibly avoid 'spoilers' in this review.] The first two-thirds of \\"Avatar\\" is a remake, almost scene by scene, of \\"Little Big Man.\\" The paraplegic hero of the former coincides with the height-challenged hero of the latter. There's the same inter-racial love story, the same conflict between rivals, and the despicable commander of the American occupying forces is Custer resurrected in all his odious bloodlust. Also, the use of napalm against a forest-dwelling enemy is bound to remind some people of Vietnam, don't you think? But this time, in Avatar, the indigenes WON! Hurray! I'm with them, Pale Face. Go home, Earthlings! Perish on your own ecologically devastated, overheated planet!<br /><br />The levels of analogy pile higher. Detail after detail of Avatar resonates in the context of America's futile occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. As 'Little Big Man' alerted audiences to the ambiguity of America's role in Vietnam, one hopes that 'Avatar' will touch the psyches of Americans who still insist that Might can make things Right in the Middle East.<br /><br />Make no mistake, movie-goers: This is a powerfully, painfully anti-American film! Yes, of course, the Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, Dutch, and Belgians were every bit as guilty of genocide as the Americans, so one could argue that 'Avatar\\" is more broadly an anti-colonialist film ... but, but, but, all the characters are plainly Americans, in an American-owned future. And even more broadly, it's an anti-capitalist film, since the essential conflict it portrays is explicitly between the \\"interests of share-holders\\" and the 'new world paradise' being ravaged for mere greed, gold being replaced in the story by the mineral \\"unobtainium.\\"<br /><br />Oddly enough, it's also a hi-tech computer graphic exposition of the philosopher Spinoza's perception that Nature is the sum of itself, and an adequate explanation of its own existence if one only gathers enough empirical evidence, and that therefore Existence is identical to God and God is nothing more or less than the totality of Existence, i.e. Nature. [Now, if that insight doesn't earn me a few dozen negative responses here on the Amazon, I'm a Neanderthal's uncle.]  [[But Nature has some mighty divine \\"visuals\\" up her sleeve on the sets of 'Avatar'! I wonder how many people recognize that the whole film was shot on location in the interior of Brazil, where the indigenous people are still being ravaged for their unobtainium ...]]<br /><br />Oh yeah ...  The graphics are eye-popping, mind-boggling, paradigm-shifting. But everyone already knows that.erish on your own ecologically devastated, overheated planet!    The levels of analogy pile higher.

B000M5AJQI|5.0|I'm often a bit behind the curve. It's no different with this movie having just seen it this weekend on HD DVD no less.<br /><br />I would have to say that Goodfellas has always been a great favorite of mine. Then I saw Casino which again I would describe as horribly fantastic.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, I can't exactly explain my fascination with Scorsese's movies other than to say that they capture human depravity in a unique and striking way. I don't know if Scorsese's insights into our horrendously flawed fleshly existence come to him by accident, or if he is somehow uniquely able to see into the baseness of the human psyche. But, regardless, this is cinema genius at work rivaling Shakespeare's greatest tragedies in starkness, and complexity.<br /><br />With all that said, Departed is yet another great movie. Great acting by a host of great actors, excellent photography and environment, and smooth pacing. High tension and hold your breath action all the way through. An absolute classic. Highly recommended.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|This was the very first anime-style full length movie I ever bought,and when I first got it I watched it once or twice,then shelved it,having enjoyed it but not fully appreciating it as yet.  About 6 months ago,for whatever reason,I watched it again,and with this third viewing I finally realized what a masterpiece Tekkonkinkreet really is.With every viewing since then,I seem to become more and more involved in the story,the characters,and the themes presented throughout.The music by Plaid adds subtlety to some of the most memorable scenes.  Black's struggle between the light and the darkness is made crucial by the development of the two boys and their interactions with each other and their environment-the resolution of that struggle produces,for me,an almost euphoric feeling;in the moment when the two make contact after having been separated to face their internal realities I invariably tear up and get a chill down my spine...  This masterpiece truly gets better with each viewing.For anime fans with appreciation of more than constant action and who possess an inner sense of what really matters in life,this little gem is surely a must-have film.
B001AQTWF2|1.0|I still have not received the item or a refund.  I am a bit disappointed.
B00337KM2S|2.0|\\"Up In The Air\\" is a smug film. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad film but, considering it'd like to woo audiences into a kind of back-patting \\"smart\\" sentimentality, it certainly can't qualify as a great one.     At virtually every key moment when he could draw the audience closer, director Jason Reitman pulls away for a zing, or to regard his actors, particularly George Clooney, from a pitying, judgmental distance. Exceedingly well-paced for most of its running time - and deft for all its moving parts - its flaws are exposed in the last 15 minutes, which drenches Clooney with one bucket of cold water after another as if to say \\"You see? Feel it!\\" There's something indecent about a comedy doing that, self-defeating. \\"Up In the Air\\" appears to resent its smile, which is to say it doesn't really have one.     The premise veers toward satire without telegraphing its trajectory: Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a corporate samurai who fires people when companies don't feel like it. In the role, Ryan's a method actor, capably (and somewhat inexplicably) adjusting his persona to the newly axed sitting across the desk from him. Clooney is smooth in those scenes, canny and clever. We smile in the midst of misery; it's secretly fun to watch someone good at what they do. A murderer. A thief. A hatchet man.     Believable? Borderline. But Ryan's \\"personal touch\\" is juxtaposed with new sidekick Natalie (Anna Kendrick), fresh out of college with the notion of firing people over the Internet - which means Ryan will be grounded, strapped to a headset, and stuck in a cubicle. Given the timing of \\"Up In The Air,\\" and the economic meltdown that transpired in 2008, Natalie's \\"corporate concept,\\" predictably debunked in the field, is ludicrous, for one. A \\"postal\\" invitation, for two.     Ryan likes his life. He spends 320 days a year on the road. He enjoys an elite level of service in every airport, hotel and Hertz he enters. He's cultivated side career as motivational speaker, wherehe appeals to rooms of \\"warriors\\" like him to limit their lives to a backpack. No family. No entanglements. His parents are dead. His sisters are out of sight and mind in Wisconsin.     But female fellow-warrior Alex (Vera Farmiga) provides a complication: Seemingly unburdened like Ryan, she purrs his way into his bed with the right mix of seduction and sass; Natalie pushes Ryan further toward love by projecting her own wishes for a relationship onto Alex.     Ostensibly a film about a new, cold-hearted American economy - and, by extension, the world - the movie is actually an excoriation of the admittedly lemon-headed values of the Eighties and its offspring, the late Aughties, as children of the Reagan-era yuppie couples stride boldly - and somewhat foolishly - into the world, expecting it to shrink down to oyster size upon command, or, at the very least, the purchase of the appropriate technology and furniture. Natalie, played as a insufferable prig by Kendrick, quickly gets her wake-up call. Ryan's comeuppance marinates for the movie's running time and serves as a stunning detour to the predicted story arc.     These penalties are fine, I suppose, but what's the moral here? Work shouldn't be important? If so, why the proverbial violin scenes where Ryan and Natalie 86 blubbering, pleading employees? Is sobriety the aim? Sadness? Pointed resignation to the world at hand?     I don't think \\"Up In the Air\\" ever tries to figure itself out. Like Ryan, it lives in the moment, enjoying its overhead shots of various cities without minding the meaning. Consider that, in a key moment, we're meant to laugh at a lame engagement ring designed by the fiancee (Danny McBride) of Ryan's younger sister (Melanie Lynsky). The McBride character is a retread of Dermot Mulroney's idiot in \\"About Schmidt.\\" Why is he a dope? Why is it funny that he's a dope, in a movie that makes pains to connect with \\"regular folks?\\" Why are small engagement rings funny? People lose their jobs - but thesize of diamond remains sacrosanct?     Why are we shown scenes of Ryan lecturing sizable groups of \\"backpack warriors,\\" and none of him actually mingling with them? Because it's a construct. Why are they there? Who would choose to attend such a seminar? Samurai warriors? The crudest scene involves a suicide that mostly serves as a double-downer to Ryan's personal journey. Reitman wants to score cheap emotional points late in the game to catch up with the gloss that precedes it.     And the movie has gloss. It's terrifically made, its screenplay light and clever, juggling several plotlines - the road trip, the prodigal son, the caustic corporate rant, the bizarre quest of Ryan's to reach a certain number of airline miles - with speed and ease. The skill in \\"Up In the Air\\" trumps its emptiness in many ways; only in the movie's final act do you see the hustle begin to emerge, the sweet con of overturned, folded cards.     Farmiga is excellent as the sharp, non-committal Alex. Farmiga is comfortable being inside cold, rough characters, and she nails most of the notes she's forced to play. But she also gets off easy, and once the plot turns, you'll know why a short phone call that ends with the line \\"I'm an adult\\" doesn't even begin to explain the decisions Alex makes. Clooney looks thin, old. He's still a nice guy as an actor, self-aware of his charm - and how it wears off, after a moment. Some critics don't care for his sheepish notes, but I like them.     But Reitman doesn't make either Clooney or Farmiga - or Kendrick, who's awful on purpose - get messy with their emotions. The great directors know how to take a scene up to the beat, and then just past it, into a raw, furious scream of drama, delivered in caustic, brittle lines. Wilder knew how. Lumet still does. Woody Allen once did. The best Europeans have that talent. There is a moment in \\"Up In the Air\\" that begs for a showdown. Reitman misses it. A shame. It's a keystone to the film's flaw - that it's trappedin Movieland, without the sense to get out.
B002LE8EFQ|5.0|Her voice is clear as a bell and you feel in in your marrow. She's a world treasure.
B002T9H2ME|3.0|\\"Moon\\" sets the table for a sharp little black comedy in outer space, but constantly finds it necessary to toe the party line on science fiction: Even if the ideas aren't revelatory - and nothing in writer/director Duncan Jones' sophomore effort qualifies - fake it anyway.     The result is a picture that produces faint echoes of \\"2001\\" for too long, alights on a clever conceit in act two, then fails to mine its potential in favor of the same old rant on corporate greed. Look hard, and you can see the smile in Jones' film - especially in the half-daffy lead performance of Sam Rockwell. But you have to squint through the ponderous foreground.     Rockwell is, appropriately, Sam, an employee of Lunar Industries, which mines a new helium energy source on the dark side of the moon. He's on the tail end of a three-year contract - accompanied only by an on-ship robot (named Gerty, voiced by Kevin Spacey) - communicating by tape with his wife and mission control, as the live feed seems permanently broken.     Sam gets in a rover accident and wakes up in the infirmary...changed. He's younger. More alert. And Gerty - along with mission control - doesn't want him to perform his usual repairs outside. Why? And why did Gerty seem to be having a live conversation with mission control when Sam wandered out of his hospital room?     \\"Moon\\" is 90 minutes long, but remains larded with filler. Mystery in space isn't the same as menace, and since \\"Moon\\" doesn't work as horror, we're left with a lot of stock shots of the lunar station, and Sam traveling from one part of it to another. There is no payoff when Sam talks to plants he's tending, or he whittles away at a wooden model of his hometown, and Jones hasn't yet developed a visual mastery that makes these images compelling (like Steven Soderbergh did in \\"Solaris\\"), and Jones lacked the budget and scope of Kubrick's \\"2001.\\" \\"Moon\\" doesn't look cheap, but its fast-forward-through-this-scene quality points to it.     The movie's big \\"reveal\\" is no stunner to the sci-fi veteran, although it gives Rockwell some elbow room. Already accomplished at depicting duality - \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\\" \\"Heist\\" and \\"Choke\\" reflect some of his best work - Rockwell has some fun fleshing out Sam's...many layers. But even these scenes grow tedious - a bit like an one-act play, with gizmos - as the audience squirms for the climax, which includes a rescue ship, a clever switcheroo, and a key sacrifice.     Though it snuck its way onto a few end-of-year Top Ten lists, \\"Moon\\" is more fashionable than powerful. Kudos to Jones for taking a road less traveled, but here's to a bigger budget and stronger story for his next foray into the genre.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|I went into this film with an open mind, but oh my God was it awful.  Within the first 10 mins my friend walked out of the room and said he was not watching it.  The acting was so terrible, I felt like I was watching a cheap play where the actors were reading the script as they went.  They tried way to hard to make the move cool like the first one, but they lost all of it.  They overused similar film techniques used in the first one and replaced william dafoe with some woman who was not even near the caliber of actor.  The guy that replaced there friend from the first one was also a terrible actor.  Sure the movie had lots of killing and unecessary swearing to try and make it appear as cool as the first one, but it really made it lame.  I don't reccomend this movie to anyone, it only reminds me of why the first one is so good.

I won't repeat what the other favorable reviews said, but I do want to mention to readers that Caballo Blanco's website ([...]) has photos from the 2006 ultramarathon described in this book.  It was nice to see the photos and put faces to the names in the book.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|The first time I listened to Teen Dream, I found it to be pleasant enough but nothing all that special.  After hearing \\"Norway\\" on the radio a few days ago, I decided to listen to the full album again.  And wow, am I glad I did.  Teen Dream has many beautiful moments.  The first few tracks are especially great, \\"Silver Soul\\" in particular grabs my attention each and every time I listen to it.  Don't get me wrong though, there is absolutely no filler on this disc.  Teen Dream is one of those rewarding albums that offer more with each listen.  It's relaxing and meditative, but profound and deep at the same time.<br /><br />This is the first time I've heard any of Beach House's material, but I'll certainly be paying very close attention to them and checking out their previous albums now that I've been introduced to this cohesive and gorgeous gem.<br /><br />EDIT: After several more listens, it's evident that Teen Dream is the real deal.  \\"10 Mile Stereo\\" and \\"Take Care\\" are absolutely stunning and have been stuck on repeat for a week or so.  Buy this album now.

0765350386|5.0|The Gathering Storm - Book 12 or 13(if you count Early Spring) - of The Wheel of Time.  25 CDs - this is a review of the audiobook    Author: Robert Jordan & Brandon Sanderson. Brandon Sanderson, New York Times bestselling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan's editor---his wife, Harriet McDougal---to complete the final book. Read by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading - the same who read all of the other WOT books.  Excellent ***** performances.    The Gathering Storm is Volume 1 of 3 volumes which will make up A Memory of Light, the last book of the series proposed by Jordan before he died. In the foreward, Sanderson states that as outlined by Jordan, this last book would have been approximately 3 times as large as any of the other books.  Most of these books were quite large already. WOW.    I came late to this series, but I have listened to all of the WOT books 4 times now, including the last time in anticipation of this book.  Of course there are going to be some nay-sayers, but no one receives universal acclaim.    This book focuses primarily on Rand and Egwene, with chapters for Mat, Nynaeve, Aviendha, and Siuan, and ofcourse the forsaken, albeit sparse chapters. Unlike the last couple of books, here the plot races along towards the last battle, with the Aes Sedai conflict and the breath-taking climactic scene in the battle for Tar Valon.  Egwene plays a much large part of this story than in the last few books.      Sanderson does an excellent job of using many references to earlier moments in the series (e.g. Egwene with the Aiel; Rand captured by the Reds; Thom and Mat's early adventures together; the battle at Falme; and Morain's death; to create an excellent sense of cohesion between all of the volumes of the series and this story.    My best endorsement for this story, is that from disk 1 until I finished disk 25, this story was on my mind even at work. I looked forward to listening night after night. Now that I have finished, I find myself sovery anxious for Towers of Midnight, volume 2. Also, even though I'm behind in listening to stories in my library at Audible, and on my wish list at Amazon, I'm probably going to relisten to this book before I move on.     I recommend this title to anyone that has read or listened to the rest of the series, and the whole series to anyone that hasn't. Thank you Harriet McDougal for chosing such a wonderful (and complementary) author to finish your husband's stunning achievement!     I was worried that no one could pull off finishing this great epic Jordan left us with. After listening, I have to say my doubts are now gone. If he stays true to form with this story, Sanderson will do a great job with the final two books. I look forward to see what is in store for some of my most favorite characters, and in one of my favorite fantasy series.  These stories are an amazing experience that I highly recommend to any fantasy series buffs who haven't already done so.
B00006JIA4|3.0|Would've given it 5 stars if not for that 3rd CD. It is a travesty that was included and I would never have bought the pack if I had found out sooner about that 3rd horrible CD. Still worth the low price just for the 1st & 2nd CD. 3rd CD...BLAH!
0307454541|4.0|If I had stopped to review this book three-quarters of the way through I would have given it a full five stars.  It was that entertaining, compelling, and well done.  The story kept me flipping pages, the characters were engaging and well drawn, and -- let's face it -- there are few literary devices as effective as an expertly turned Dysfunctional Family With Secrets.  I think Larsson is a wonderful talent and I plan to jump happily into his next two (and, sadly, final) books.  That said, he bites off a bit more than he can chew here.  Like many first novels, this one is too ambitious.  There are really two stories here . . . and they are not linked as well as you'll hope. First, there is the disgraced journalist who has been burned by a vengeful corporate titan and is looking for redemption.  Then there is the tale of young Harriet, who disappeared one afternoon back in 1966.  Her uncle -- who cared for her and has been tormented by her disappearance (and more to the point, by the mystery of her fate) -- convinces the journalist to take up his cause and spend a year sequestered at the family compound in a remote part of Sweden, looking into the crime (if, indeed, there even was one).<br /><br />The mystery is (for a long time) well done . . . lots of twists, intrigue (if ever a family compound needed a resident shrink, this is the one), and mystery.  Some of the detective work is novel, clever, and well done, too (without giving anything away, there is some fascinating work with photographs here).  There are, of course, the all-too-convenient Eureka moments, and by the end, we've wandered into rather unconvincing Silence of the Lambs/Red Dragon territory (for a better take on that, read Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon).  But, somewhat disappointing climax aside, it's a great ride while it lasts.<br /><br />But that leads us to my main problem with this book: There's too much of it.  Perhaps it's because I'm a journalist myself, but I found the entire second plot line -- the attempt to investigate and bring down the aforementioned corporate titan, and all the inside baseball magazine intrigue -- a bore.  And fairly laughable in parts, too (for one thing, we journalists are far too chatty and dysfunctional to carry out any kind of secret, coordinated operation to smoke out a mole).  Worst of all, it's largely unnecessary.  Larsson was a journalist and magazine editor himself, and I can see that it must have been tempting to bring in a little of his own world, but that old adage of write what you know is largely bunk.  Indeed, what's exciting to you (because you live it) isn't always exciting to others.  This plot thread is a case in point.  I think it would have been sufficient to give enough backstory to set up the Disgraced Journalist Looking or Redemption and then move on -- and stick with -- the main story, the mystery of the girl.  This secondary plot also makes our hero look a bit too holier-than-though for comfort (he's always railing about failed financial journalism - annoying enough -- yet many of his arguments and conclusions seem oddly naive and misinformed.  It just detracts, and has readers (at least this one) take him a bit less seriously).  The book would have worked better if this whole sideline was expunged and the mystery built out a bit more.<br /><br />A couple of lesser gripes: While I can appreciate that Larsson was clearly an Apple fan boy (no problem with that here), his computer talk is at turns superficial and weird.  He lists the entire spec sheet of a 2002-era PowerBook laptop one character has her pocketbook set on . . . I have no idea why.  And when he talks about encryption and hacking it is clear that he doesn't know that much about either (and no, knowing what PGP is does not qualify you as an expert).  On the other hand, I think the only reason this bothered me was that so much else in the book was so well crafted and presented.  On a related note, I also thought that the character profileof the private investigator who helps out on the case -- and is the real heroine of the story -- was by turns fascinating and rubbish.  At one moment she's borderline autistic; the next she is assuming identities and interacting with bankers on million-dollar transactions.  The romance -- all of it -- is a bit too convenient and unconvincing, too.  Finally, it was a minor bummer that some of the most fascinating characters in the book -- the head of the security concern, the uncle himself, to name a couple -- get sidelined along the way, only to make cursory appearances thereafter.<br /><br />I may have had to drag myself through the last fifth of the book, but no regrets.  This was clearly one of the better thrillers to come along of late, and I plan to get cracking on Book 2 promptly.ator who helps out on the case -- and is the real heroine of the story -- was by turns fascinating and rubbish.

B003102JDM|4.0|Joel and Ethan Coen explore some familiar themes in an unfamiliar environment in \\"A Serious Man\\". -Unfamiliar in the sense that the Coen brothers usually toy around with the idea of a disordered universe in noirish crime films. They gravitate toward film noir, because existential crime films of the 1940s posited a chaotic universe in which protagonists struggled to create order, or just to survive, in the midst of events that buffeted them about and mocked their complaints. But in \\"A Serious Man\\", no one is being chased or giving chase. There is no crime, no shootings, or thrills. There is Larry Gropnik, a Jewish family man living an ordinary life in a midwestern suburb, 1967.<br /><br />Larry's (Michael Shahlbarg) world is coming apart. Everything he \\"felt was one way turns out to be another\\". He's pressured from all directions, but none of it makes sense to him. His wife Judith (Sari Lennick) wants a divorce so that she can marry Larry's coworker and family friend Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed). One of Larry's physics students tries to bribe him to pass the course. Someone is writing libelous letters to the tenure committee. His socially inept brother Arthur (Richard Kind) won't move out of the house. Arthur is working on a probability map of the universe to make sense of it all. And preparations are under way for son Danny's (Aaron Wolff) Bar Mitzvah.<br /><br />Coen brothers fans will like or hate \\"A Serious Man\\" depending upon whether they like the idea of an existential crisis brought on by a fundamentally disordered universe being transferred into an ordinary environment. Larry isn't coping with criminal intrigue but with his inability to make sense of the everyday and his obsessive desire to do so. \\"What's going on?\\" is Larry's refrain as well as the film's. In a bit of daring, \\"A Serious Man\\" mocks the idea that religion has anything to offer people seeking life's meaning. It likes Larry but laughs at his angst. The re-creation of the post-War suburbs with a cultural revolution just around the corner makes this a sharp period film too.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2010): There are 3 featurettes. \\"Becoming Serious\\" (17 min) interviews the Coens and the film's producers about making the film and the actors about their characters. \\"Creating 1967\\" (14 min) gives us a tour of some sets and visits the locations with production coordinator Jess Gonchor and special effects supervisor Larz Anderson. \\"Hebrew and Yiddish for Goys\\" (2 min) defines many of the Yiddish and Hebrew terms in the film's dialogue scene-by-scene.

B00003CX8Y|1.0|To date (February 16th---- two full months since we ordered this DVD!!), we have not received our order.  And I have called Amazon about it . . .   and they referred me to the vendor . . .   and when I e-mailed the vendor . . .   to date, we have received NO NOTICE or EXPLANATION regarding our order from the vendor.       So I would call that VERY DISSATISFIED.      And I will now have to contact Amazon again to see what can be done about this.      Incidentally, this was a nearly $50 purchase that was made with Christmas in mind.  When Christmas went by, we went for my child's 6th Birthday.  The birthday (February 2nd) has now also come and gone.      Again, VERY DISSATISFIED.    Grace Saper

B00005RDRO|2.0|Another reviewer described Truman Capote's acting as unimpressive - decidedly a gross understatement. However, the main weakness of the film is the cornball cheap humor and lack of wit. The great cast is wasted throughout. It's worse than Mel Brooks \\"History of the World\\". Also, there are many convoluted attempts at twists and turns, but the results offer few surprises. In the end, it's more of a high-school script than a movie.  The DVD extras are minimal and mostly unenlightening.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|All the previous Potter movies were great.  This one had great F/X effects.  Although I enjoyed the movie, there seem to be something different. It seemed to be a bit more \\"hammy\\" if there is such a word.  Not to put anybody off though, because I first saw the movie in the theater and enjoyed it enough that I bought the DVD to see it again.  I recommend this movie to anybody with the notion to buy a good movie.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I too was turned of by the savage beating inflicted upon Christ and thought how totally unrealistic to believe a human man could endure such abuse and still live, then it dawned on me...that was the whole point, they could not kill him, hard as they tried they could not kill him because they did not have the power to kill him, no one took His life he laid down His life, He surrendered his life to The Father! Though I would never want to watch this movie again, I thought it compelling in the way it was presented.

B0002IU988|5.0|This is a great freshman effort by the band Alter Bridge...All of the songs on this album are very solid and the band just seem to really mesh well together.  Bringing in Myles Kennedy on lead vocals/rhythm guitar was the best decision that Mark Tremonti could make because the guy is awesome and has some mean pipes.  My favorite songs are Find The Real, One Day Remains, Open Their Eyes, Metalingus, In Loving Memory and The End is Here.  These guys really rock and they have made an awesome record...I can't believe that they are already working on their 3rd album and it is slated to come out this fall.  In my opinion, Alter Bridge has some of the most inspirational and heart-felt lyrics out there right now! I would definately recommend this album to all rock n' roll lovers!  Keep rockin' guys!!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is by far my favorite board game. We encountered it a few years back and it continues to remain the favorite. The standard version is for 4 people, with the minimum age around 10. Extensions are available, and you can easily change some rules if there are only 3 of you. A typical game lasts about an hour.    The players compete to acquire resources and construct roads, settlements, cities etc. There is also an amount of chance since you use two dice at each turn to determine who gets what resources. In that respect it is like many other board games. But there are three main factors that make it very interesting and why everyone feels that they can have a chance of winning each game: (1) the board setup is random, so that everytime you play, it IS a new game (there is a Nexus One app available that allows you to get a more balanced board), and (2) you can trade resources, and only the player whose turn it is can trade so that each time you have a possibility of acquiring points, and (3) there are many ways of acquiring  points to take you to victory.    Incidently, Amir Khan once said on his blog that he likes to play Settlers of Catan a lot.    Due to the large number of possibilities the first time you play it seems a bit daunting. But it is worth every bit of you time and effort. The game was apparently invented in Germany to teach about capitalism. It has one the 'Spiel des Jahres' (game of the year) award in 1995.

B00018D44U|4.0|This is an excellent follow-up to her monster debut album.  Norah fans like me already own it so there is no need to address them here.  Potential new fans that are interested in sampling her music should go to her debut album first, then this one.  Her latest, \\"The Fall\\", is also very good.  I'm not sure the song has been written yet that properly showcases her amazing voice, but there are a couple of songs on this album that do it justice.  \\"What Am I to You\\", \\"In the Morning\\", \\"Toes\\" and \\"Above Ground\\" are all excellent.  When I am in the mood for Norah's music, this is the album I reach for first.
B001676320|3.0|And that would be to have Peter Cetera as the vocalist for Chicago. E,W&F was great and I had high expectations. I knew beforehand that Cetera was not in this concert, but I thought it shouldn't be all that bad (besides, I got it as a present so I really can't complain).     The first third of the show were E,W&F. They played an awesome set.     The second third of the show was the Chicago set. Musically, everything was perfect...until they started to sing. That was really the only low point of the concert, but they somewhat make up for it in the last third of the show (the finale).    The last part of the show is when both groups are on stage to perform together. Shining Star and 25 or 6 to 4 were my favorites (although, I was again disappointed to not hear the original solo for the latter...I have never seen footage in which Chicago plays the original solo *sigh*).     The disc also includes a drum-duel between the two groups' respective drummers as a bonus feature. Eh.     All in all, if I could give half-star ratings, I would give this a 3.5.

0446569895|5.0|When a friend told me that Ozzy had finally released his biography, I pressed a button and ordered it immediately.  Finally!  I have been waiting for this book most of my life. I've been listening since the early 70s, when my father played Paranoid constantly on our family record player, and became a huge fan since Blizzard Of Ozz hit me when I was 12.  I couldn't wait for the book to arrive. A chance to look into his upbringing and track his rise to power as Rock Music's reigning Prince Of Darkness.  We get that, from his humble beginnings as a child in Ashton, his problems in school stemming from Dyslexia and ADHD, his short-lived career as a burglar and subsequent stint in prison,his days working at a local slaughterhouse, and on into the early days of Black Sabbath and beyond.  The first thing that you will recognize as you read, is that the stumbling, bumbling, stuttering creature that we have known as Ozzy Osbourne for all these recent years is just as hilarious and clever as you'd expect him to be.  He writes (with help, of course) with a very English tone that I found hysterical at times and utterly charming.  We are subjected to John Michael Osbourne's first introduction into music through familiy gatherings and on into his first real gig after he posts his \\"Ozzy Zig Needs Gig\\" sign in a local music store window.  Terry \\"Geezer\\" Butler replies and the two become fast friends.  Then enters Tony Iommi and Bill Ward, and Black Sabbath is born.  Getting pissed and touring constantly and shagging the occasional dodgy chick, Sabbath pour on the booze and the drugs and try to take over the world.  Things come crashing down when Ozzy is fired from Sabbath for cheeking off in the press about the band and missing shows and he soon finds himself in the presence of Sharon Arden, his ex-manager's hard-as-nails daughter.  Sharon is the force behind Ozzy's life and his success as a solo artist and we appreciate that.  Ozzy's undying devotion to his wife is stated many times over. So are his appologies.  When you shear away all the trappings of the Prince Of Darkness, what you find beneath is a funny, often sad, strange man fighting lifelong addictions to drugs and alcohol and inner phobias galore.  The fact that Ozzy was never sober for like 40 straight years and the fact that he isn't dead because of that, make for an interesting read.  In the end, love him or hate him, Ozzy is extremely honest and not more than a bit remorseful for some of the terrible things he has done to hurt the people that he loves, his parents, his wife, his children. The death of Randy Rhoads, right when everything was coming together after so many years, takes a huge toll on Ozzy, and we can see that it took years to recover from that tragedy (if he ever has). To see the human side of Ozzy lends to the enormous popularity of The Osbournes and his faimly's descent into mega-fame because of the TV exposure.  Ozzy talks frankly about becoming a media sensation as well.  There is a frenetic energy Ozzy lends to his words and I ate it up like \\"waffle dust\\".  Ozzy takes us on the miraculous ride of his life and it is a ride definitely worth taking. He doesn't smooth over anything.  It's here, wart's and all, for everyone to see.  Do you need to be a fan of Ozzy to read and enjoy this?  Probably not, but it might help get past those early salughterhouse, dove & bat head-biting, Alamo pissing experiences without staggering from shock. Welcome to the Crazy Train... All Aboard!!!!!!

B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Though some will say that the novel has a great amount of idealism and not enough realism (especially at the end); I say that it shows the true sacrifices and consequences that we go through in our lives. Very few pieces of fiction show the emotional significance that one decision can have on others as well as ourselves. In my personal opinion, only Sparks'. \\"A Walk to Remember\\" and \\"Message in a Bottle\\" have been able to impact the emotions of the reader as well as this particular work has. If you love either of these books or if you are looking to read a touching story with considerable weight and charm, then this is it. I would say more but I wouldn't want to spoil the book.

B00319ECC4|5.0|Yes folks it's here-the Fear Factory comeback album that we were all hoping would come out one day.  I gots to say that Mean Gene Hoglan drumming for ff is an upgrade.  Sound is a more organic and while the double bass is still triggered, it's the fills and rolls that hoglan adds that makes up for better drumming.  Also be prepared for blast beats.  They are brutal and will kick you in the mouth.  Dino obviously was sorely missed in the riff creating dept.  Riffs are catchy and super heavy.  Burton's vox are brutal, he returns w/some death metal screams and his vocals have never sounded this angry before, coupled w/his more melodic vocals this is the best he has ever sounded.  The bass-well it's pretty much buried, so Byron is barely heard throughout the disc.  This is the best ff cd since Demanufacture-I would not say it's better than demanufacture though, but it comes pretty darn close.  All the tracks are pretty much pummeling.  Fantastic to finally hear ff add the death metal influence back and have retained their industrial heaviness.  This is review is for the bonus edition, which you should pick up.  They redo crash test from s.o.a.n.m.-sounds really brutal here.  Other 3 bonus songs are the demo from 1991-really had a huge godflesh influence back then, songs are really slow, they sure sped things up for the debut cd that was to come out the next yr.  Anyway this cd smokes and the it's like fear factory '95 all over again.  Killer, hope they continue and don't cave in.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|Actors make good movies and they make bad movies. With any luck, the good outweigh the bad and their careers continue. Gerard Butler return to form after the terrible GAMER, this time as an ordinary citizen with exceptional abilities in LAW ABIDING CITIZEN.<br /><br />Butler stars as Clyde Shelton, a man living in suburban Philadelphia with his wife and daughter whose home is broken into. Attacked and wounded, he is forced to watch as two men kill his family and leave him for dead. But he survives and does what he can to see these two men brought to justice.<br /><br />But justice can be blind. Not enough evidence ties the two men to the crime and one turns against the other in a plea bargain. Assistant DA Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) has a stellar conviction record and wants this one to keep that intact, propelling his career forward. He makes the deal that results in the death penalty for one and a short term for the other, much to the disappointment of Shelton who wants both to suffer.<br /><br />Ten years pass and as the first killer is about to die by lethal injection things go wrong. Rather than the humane system put in place, different chemicals are injected causing him to suffer as he dies while Rice, witness to the execution, watches.<br /><br />The second killer finds his release from prison not what he expected. Captured by Shelton and taken to a remote hiding place, he is systematically dismembered while alive by Shelton who has left clues to these proceedings for the police to find. Arrested, he is taken to jail and soon to be put on trial. But Shelton has other plans.<br /><br />Requesting an audience with Rice, he sets up his own plea deal. Let him go free and no one will be hurt. But as long as he stays in prison, those he holds responsible for letting a guilty man go free will pay the price and justice, in his mind, will be served. Seeing as how he is behind bars, Rice finds his threat hard to take seriously. Until people involved in the original case begin to be murdered.<br /><br />And here is where the true twist in the film begins. How is Shelton orchestrating the murders from a prison cell where he has no contact with the outside world? Who can his accomplice be in carrying out his vendetta against a legal system that short changed him when it came to justice in the deaths of his wife and daughter?<br /><br />The cat and mouse game between Shelton and Rice makes for fascinating viewing as pieces of the puzzle are dropped in place while the body count rises. People are taken out by numerous means while Rice survives, held in place to be the last victim. And when a meeting with a member of the clandestine sector (think CIA) lets Rice know that Shelton was the go to guy when it came to methods of killing people, Rice races against time to find out the answers before he and his family are killed.<br /><br />Like all good mysteries, the clues are placed for all to see but its how you interpret them and solve them as a viewer that makes this movie a delight. By the end of the film, you realize you were given these clues throughout, given the chance to solve the puzzle on your own. If you got them right.<br /><br />Foxx does his usual great job as the beleaguered DA who wants to find justice for all but has gotten caught up in a system that is imperfect where criminals go free or do less time to result in convictions. Butler does a great job as a man determined to expose the system for what it is and find his own justice along the way.<br /><br />The movie takes a hard look at the justice system as we witness the battle between these two characters. And both are sympathetic in their own way. Foxx because he was forced to accept less in order to hold his record and Butler, who may be killing people, but as a man forced to watch his family killed before his own eyes only to see the killer walk away. A portion of you wants to root for his side but at the same time you realize his version of justice is a tad turned upsidedown.<br /><br />This movie will hold your attention from start to finish. And the conclusion will surprise even the most jaded moviegoer. If you're looking for a good movie, look no further than LAW ABIDING CITIZEN.clusion will surprise even the most jaded moviegoer. If you're looking for a good movie, look no further than LAW ABIDING CITIZEN.
0385528752|4.0|The Heath brothers proved in their first book that they are good at storytelling, as well as laying out a memorable framework.     For Switch, they took some of the ways that Gladwell laid out the Tipping Point and then added various clinics and memorable stories throughout. Less narrative than Gladwell, but more flow and art than any other business book out there. And Gladwell never did a great job of helping us think through the application. That's somewhere where the Heath brothers excel.    If you are searching for a framework to think through change efforts (whether personal or for an organization) this is a book to read. Well referenced and well thought out.     Why not 5 stars? Because I wanted you to read the review - and then go buy the book. It may not be what you want, but for me, it was the perfect book with a clear solution at the right time. I really wish I could find something wrong with it.    -Christopher
B0018AK9RA|4.0|In order to get into this album by these veterans of Metal, you have to do 2 things in my opinion.  A) Read up or watch a documentary on Nostradamus and B) forget that you are listening to a Priest album.  The story of Nostradamus is very interesting and it helps to know what the lyrics are referring to.  As to my second suggestion...  just forget about finding your standard Priest metal on this album. My point being, you can still like a band's work if it is very different from their other albums.     This album is very keyboard heavy -  although there are several songs with good \\"catchy\\" guitar riffs. It is STILL a guitar album.. not to worry. But the keyboards help paint this \\"mystical vibe\\"  about the life of Nostradamus and are quite catchy in spots. Probably, if any of the band members shine it's Halfords vocal performance and the unique drum beats that are used.  What I think adds to the album as well is that before some of the long songs, there is a 1 or 2 minute song that slows things down and \\"leads\\" you into the next song. This is also part of the whole \\"concept\\" idea.  Generally speaking, Disc 1 is overall the better of the 2 and worth the money just by itself.  Ironically, the die-hard Priest fans are probably not going to buy it/like it, and yet someone who probably WOULD like this non-standard metal album won't buy it because ... it's JUDAS PRIEST.  This is unfortunate... and probably true because it's been out almost 2 years and has yet to even go gold according the RIAA.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|Great music!!! If you're a John Mayer fan you will find yourself liking every song. But PLEASE BE AWARE if you are planning to download the MP3 version of this CD, that on the MP3 ALBUM the song \\"Say\\" is not included! So Amazon is basically forcing you to pay an extra $1.29 to download the 13th song. THAT SUCKS!!! Nice way to rip off your customers, Amazon!
B001PPGAIA|2.0|I was soooo looking forward to seeing this movie and was so dissapointed in it. The plot isn't the best, acting was good but not great and it was way too long for what it was...would recommend another movie.
B000000WCA|3.0|The Spice Girls broke up years ago. I like the song, \\"2 become 1,\\" and \\"Wannabe.\\" Apart from the girls' musical style which is fun, light-heartedness, and soft. Don't expect something deep in this compact disc. This collection of songs were nothing more for a young audience. You want something deep and meaningful, it's not here. It's light and maybe too light and fun to listen too. You could play this disc at parties for dancing. The Spice Girls had their fifteen minutes of fame and made a lot of money for themselves. Their careers have split in their lives. This disc is fine but don't expect much.
B002VUFKG6|2.0|If you think Elizabeth is going to take you on another fun adventure than I don't recommend this book.  It is self indulgent and just seems to go on and on.  It seemed like following a long string of obbssesive thoughts.
B002WCLG3O|5.0|I can't give this any fewer than 5 stars in good conscience, because it's absolutely stunning, but for those who aren't familiar with Japanese animation you should know that the acting is abysmal (as it usually is when something gets only a half apt dub). The stories are great fun (nothing earth shattering) and it's a blast to watch... if you can get over the terrible, terrible, terrible, horrible, bad, no good English dub that is (your 8 year old brother could voice all of the characters, and it would only be marginally worse). The animation is stellar though, a real work of art, and will almost certainly distract you from the flaws.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I thought this movie was hilarious, great relationship between Bullock and Reynolds and Betty White was fantasic. Great date movie.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This set of the seasons 1,2,3 is amazing. You can watch the episodes in original format and/or enhanced high def.  The enhanced scenes are great, planets look cool with more detail.If you are a more tried and true trekkie, watch as original.  The extras are awesome. Unaired stuff, animated stuff, commentary.. Much more than I thought after some earlier reviews. I wondered if was worth getting on Blu-Ray,  Definetly, I am glad glad to have gotten it. Do recommend.
B002WCLG3O|5.0|This was a great take on the Halo Universe, and an awesome way to explore it a bit more.  There are several types of anime in here; some of which I like better than others.  That said, I rushed out and bought this the first day it came out (today), and I've watched the episodes on Halo Waypoint.  This makes my review 10 times more qualified than those of people giving negative reviews simply because they don't like the IDEA of what Halo Legends is.  Negative reviews of a concept have no place in a product review.
B000O3QQ9M|5.0|Received this album just in time 2 days before christmas and sellers were so nice and always responded to emails on time.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|Really wasn't impressed. Not a great plot, creative but not enticing. Acting was great but it was just odd. Wouldn't recommend buying it. Rent it if you really want to see it.
0451529065|5.0|When it comes to subjects like biology and medicine, I am an absolute moron. I only barely avoided failing the one and only biology class I ever took, thanks to an absurd amount of extra-credit outside reading assignments and a science fair project that I still don't understand. I can never remember if DNA is made out of chromosomes or the other way around. Same with proteins and amino acids. I'm not a generally stupid person, but I do recognize my limits: biological matters are opaque to me.    It was with the hope of redeeming myself that I read \\"The Origin of Species\\". I felt that, if I could read and somewhat comprehend probably the most influential and controversial book ever written on biology, then I might once again be able to present myself in modern society without wearing a veil.    \\"The Origin of Species\\" sold out its entire first printing on the day of publication in 1859, largely because of its expected controversial contents. Darwin had written and spoken on such subjects for years, so the public anticipated some pretty scandalous stuff. The book is still considered controversial for several reasons. First, the theory that it presents appears to contradict the Biblical account of creation. (I say \\"appears\\" because it doesn't really. Anyone who genuinely believes in a strictly literal interpretation of Genesis, as opposed to a metaphorical interpretation, must necessarily also believe that Jesus actually was a door, a shepherd, a vine, a light, and a loaf of bread, which rather diminishes his or her credibility.) Second, it seems to contradict common sense ideas of inheritance: how can the offspring of a horse be anything but another horse? Third, it's kind of icky: we're essentially the same kind of things as slugs and worms: e[...] Fourth, it brings up uncomfortable ethical issues: if we're essentially the same kind of thing as the contents of a Happy Meal, how do we justify being the eaters and not the eatees? Finally, it's hard to comprehend that it's all true, in much the same way that it's hard to comprehend that we are all really blizzards of protons, neutrons, and electrons.    The book is very different from any science book I've ever read. Darwin is not lecturing from the podium of an auditorium. He's your learned friend sitting in the easy chair next to yours, probably in front of a cheerful fire after a nice dinner, telling you about some really interesting things he's seen and ideas he's had. Much of it is written in first person, which is very refreshing and personal.    It's clear that Darwin is multiple kinds of a genius. He's a lucid writer, with concise and telling expressions: he never uses two words if there's a single better one. He's also a gifted experimenter. He refers in many places to decades of clever experiments he's done with pigeons, bees, ants, grass, flowers, and other organisms, and you get the definite impression that these are only the tip of the iceberg of his accomplishments. Besides his deliberate experiments, he's also an amazing observational naturalist. He alludes to many things that he himself has witnessed, not only on his famous voyage around South America, but also on trips around England and Europe. In addition, he's an exhaustive and thorough researcher. The first part of the book is a review of everything (and I mean everything) written to that point on the subject. It's obvious that he's read everything available on the topic. Finally, he is an active correspondent with everyone doing related work or research at the time. He quotes the research and observations of numerous others, from some of the most famous scientists of his time to ordinary farmers who raise crops and animals for a living.    He begins by discussing the variations possible among members of the same species that are easily observable and are obviously deliberate, namely among domesticated animals and plants. This makes it clear that significant differences within a species are possible during only a few generations. This is what he calls \\"selection\\": deliberately choosing animals and plants for definite features, and encouraging these features.    He then expands his view to look at variation within nature, outside domestication. This allows him to bring up \\"natural selection\\": the conditions of nature favoring certain features over others. Organisms with good features are more likely to survive and reproduce. Organisms with bad features are unlikely to reproduce, and may become extinct.    Darwin packs a lot into his writing. His sentences are fireworks. Practically every one explodes off the page as a condensation of vast amounts of detailed research, or the statement of an amazing observation or theory. He consistently refers to this book as a \\"sketch,\\" because he feels that he is not presenting all the detail he could on each point. But this is a sketch in the sense that Michelangelo's David is a rock. There is a vast and astonishing amount of detail in this book. Indeed, for me to say that I have \\"read\\" this book is not accurate. To truly appreciate this book, you would have to read one of his blockbuster sentences, then go off and contemplate its significance for hours, days, or weeks. In that sense, I have really only skimmed this book.    This is not dry theory, by any means. The wealth of practical examples he offers is amazing. I have to repeat one bit of reasoning about how the population of cats in an area affects how many flowers there are. Ready? The more cats there are, the fewer mice there are. Since mice gnaw on beehives and bother the bees, the fewer the mice, the more active the bees can be in the area. The more active the bees, the more pollen they can spread. And the more pollen they spread, the more flowers bloom. So, the more cats, the more flowers. Is that great?    Moron that I am in biology, I was surprised to find that there were things I know that Darwin didn't. He didn't know about Mendel's laws of inheritance, for example. Truth be told, I don't remember what these are, but I know that there are such laws, and Darwin didn't. I often found myself wishing that I could tell him about Mendel, DNA, radioactive dating of geological strata, mass extinctions, continental drift, and other topics.     One consequence of this for me, the biology moron, is that this book is pitched at just the right level to not lose me. He talks about animals and plants, things that even I can relate to. He doesn't - because he can't - delve into the biochemical stuff that always loses me. His writing is always concrete.    Having established his theory, and the usefulness of this theory in explaining the variety we observe in nature, Darwin brings up the difficulties of his own theory. This is the mark of the true scientist, as opposed to the partisan promoter. He recognizes that there are difficulties, and doesn't sweep them under the rug. Among the problems he discusses are the lack of fossils of in-between forms, how sterile insects can pass on their features, how complex organs (like eyes) come about, where complicated instinctive behaviors come from, and how similar species get distributed globally. In what I've read elsewhere, I've never seen a criticism of his theory that Darwin himself did not anticipate and address here.     Here's something interesting. I didn't notice the word \\"evolution\\" anywhere, for which I am grateful. I think that \\"evolution\\" is a terrible label for his theory of descent by natural selection. \\"Evolution\\" implies that something - some thing - is changing, which is not true. No animal changes into another animal. No dinosaur changes into a bird, no wolf changes into a Pekingese, no monkey changes into a human. The word \\"evolution\\" gives the wrong connotation entirely.    In the end, the book is absolutely convincing. The wealth of examples that Darwin presents, and the clarity and thoroughness of his discussion of his ideas, is compelling and persuasive. It's hard to imagine someone reading this book and saying, \\"Yeah, but.\\" I am tempted to sum up by saying that a person either accepts the theory of natural selection or they have not read this book. And I now have that nifty cat story to tell at cocktail parties.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Why are so many rap albums so long? I mean, Kanye got his big break as a producer when he did a few songs on The Blueprint. How did he look at that album, which has thirteen tracks consisting of fifteen three to five minute songs, and decide that the formula could be improved with several tracks of generally weak comedy and undeveloped half-songs and a coda where he rambles about his early career for eight minutes? He mostly makes up for it with the music, but the filler drags it down from a potentially great album to merely a very good one. What Kanye lacks in pure technical prowess he makes up for with some amazing production, genuinely catchy hooks, the occasional stroke-of-genius line, and an ability to get a lot of good talent working together on a song. Not every guest appearance works out, but enough do to make it a pretty fun and diverse ride throughout.    There are a few clunkers here and there, but most of the songs have at least a few good things going for them, and the album as a whole is just plain entertaining, not quite as much on the pure musical level of more dedicated emcees, but as an auditory experience. Even a track like \\"The New Workout Plan\\" which has almost nothing going for it on paper manages to be mostly listenable thanks to the bells and whistles. A bit gimmicky maybe, but there are a lot of different ways to enjoy music. The other singles are all consistently fun, with \\"Jesus Walks\\" being one of the few songs by any artist to consistently give me chills and \\"Through the Wire\\" being at the least an interesting experiment, and a successful one at that. Most of the songs that aren't singles could pass for such, and while it's my standard practice to enjoy music by listening to whole albums through, The College Dropout is definitely one of the most iPodable I've heard. The anti-education stance a lot of the lyrics take is frankly bewildering, but for the most part I'm sold on an artist I've been quietly admiring from afar for a few years now.
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn is a suspenseful and riveting conclusion of The Twilight Saga.  I would never have expected the situation the characters were in.  I definitely enjoyed getting Jacob's view of things in the first half.  And the resolution for his character was great.  It would be fun to see some more Twilight Saga books.  I understand that Stephanie Meyer is not ready to be in the vampire world for a while.  But I hope she revisits the Cullens...It would be so exciting to read some more of their life stories.
B0029ZA3H4|1.0|I so wanted to like this book, I mean to love this book.  I carried this book around prior to, during, and after Thanksgiving!  I know my family was like whats the deal w/the book.  When something moves me, inspires me, or just rattles something on the inside, I won't shut-up about it.  I started from the beginning only to find this book very boring from what I can remember.  All the talk in the start about wine was way over my head, predicting a dreadful finish.  So what happens when you're searching for that oomph, when expectations are set so high?  You skip to the middle and then to the end!  I picked this book up too many times, but the inspiration wasn't in this book b/c I cant remember one thing accept for over-exhausting his love for wine (if its important, puts $ in my pocket, and knowledge in my head, then I will not forget).  Maybe this book was written for the norm or the ordinary, since so many rave about it, but I know there is not a single product that everyone will like.  Guess this makes me the exception w/a few other ppl.  Gary... I did remember something... you respond to all of your emails as well as the reviews posted on here.  But you don't have to leave me a response apologizing that it did not satisfy my needs, I was on a mission to find my passion and your book happened to be part of the journey.  When I decide to write a book about every infatuation I have since I cant pick one, I will thank all of my supporters and contributors to the process. Gary, I thank you in advance for acknowledging \\"all\\" reviews constructive or not and I wish you more success on your journey!
B0002C4JE4|5.0|It's hard not to feel your muscles relax listening to this \\"greatest hits\\" CD.  James Taylor's voice is so well matched to his music, it's like the epitome of the easy listening genre.  It's great to have all this excellent music collected onto a single inexpensive album, too!
1594488843|4.0|There's a lot of hand wringing about what will happen to the entire economy if the financial sector is reined in:   * Will \\"under paid\\" (therefore presumably under qualified) bankers screw up the economy?   * Will all the good financiers move to hedge funds, leaving our big banks in the hands of a bunch of brain-dead drones willing to work for a mere 25x their average company worker's wage?   * Is limiting banker compensation the last nail in capitalism's coffin?     In DRIVE, Mr Pink says Motivation 1.0 centered around survival. Sometimes survival meant stealing a meal or a spouse but eventually the human species figured out that cooperation was a less painful, more humane way to conduct ourselves, and Motivation 2.0 came into being. Motivation 2.0 centered around punishment and reward and \\"it is so deeply embedded in our lives that most of us scarcely recognize that it exists.\\"     \\"Despite its greater sophistication and higher aspirations, Motivation 2.0 still wasn't exactly ennobling. It suggested that, in the end, human beings aren't much different from horses -- that the way to get us moving in the right direction is by dangling a crunchier carrot or wielding a sharper stick. But what this operating system lacked in enlightenment, it made up for in effectiveness. It worked well, extremely well. Until it didn't.\\"     The Seven Deadly Flaws of Carrots and Sticks: 1. They can extinguish intrinsic motivation 2. They can diminish performance 3. They can crush creativity 4. They can crowd out good behavior 5. They can encourage cheating, shortcuts, and unethical behavior 6. They can become addictive 7. They can foster short-term thinking This is not to say that carrots and sticks are always bad. DRIVE has a chapter on circumstances where punishment and rewards work very well, thank you very much.     But we're headed full gallop into Motivation 3.0, which recognizes that while people are at times profit maximizers (and therefore extrinsically driven), we are also \\"purpose maximizers,\\" which means we're motivated intrinsically as well. Mr Pink quotes Bruno Frey, an economist at the University of Zurich says \\"Intrinsic motivation is of great importance for all economic activities. It is inconceivable that people are motivated solely or even mainly by external incentives.\\" DRIVE lists several highly successful business people who are driven by intrinsics to achieve and even asks us to ponder whether the intrinsically-motivated Warren Buffett and Oprah Winfrey are any less economically successful than Jeff Skilling and Donald Trump (whom most would agree are Motivation 2.0 poster boys).

B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!! I finished it in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down!!
0553593544|5.0|I started reading this book after watching the movies, and i have to admit i was pretty disappointed that the movie was NOTHING like the book. But the book is actually the best of the two! The novel will keep you on the edge of your seat all night as you read it with its great plot line. It doesn't have a lot of action in it like the movie but more of a psychologocal warfare thing to it. And the best part of it is that is the MOST ABSOLUTE PERFECT ending the novel could ever have!!!
B001PR0YDU|5.0|When this film came out, I had zero interest in seeing it.  I figured I would just wait and give it a rental on Netflix.  I am somewhat of a \\"Carol\\" buff and  I like to see different versions.  Besides....Jim Carrey as Scrooge?  Give me a break!  But after reading the reviews I thought I'd give it a try.  However, I went into the theater with my mind pretty much made up that I would hate it.    Boy was I wrong.    I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem.  Jim Carrey is no Alastair Sim (but then...who is?) but I could tell Carrey studied Sim and brought a little of Sim's portrayal into his own.  The animation and voice acting were very well done.  This film is also as faithful to the book as any version I've seen.  I liked how they showed Marley's hair agitated as if by hot air (per the book) and the fiddler at Fezziwig's party plunging his face into the punch bowl before resuming his playing (also in the book...and I've never seen this in a film before).  Another thing I enjoyed was the fiddler playing \\"Sir Roger DeCoverly\\".  I like this tune...it is in the book...and I expect it to be in any filmed version.  Silly...but that's just me.    I only have two negative comments...I thought the pace was a little too slow at the beginning, and that ridiculous unnecessary and over-long \\"chase\\" scene (with a miniature Scrooge).  That did not belong in the movie in any way, shape or form.    The 1951 version with Alastair Sim is still the \\"gold standard\\" in \\"Christmas Carol\\" films.  But this one ranks #2 on my list.  I can't wait for it to be released on blu-ray, where it will take its rightful place in my holiday video lineup.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I love every song on this disc. Sade is not afraid to sing about the pain of love, and on this disc she really went way out there. It's interesting to read the two star reviews. People are scared to even hear the truth in songs these days. We are so cought up in technology that we are loosing our simple understanding of human feeling and emotion. These are not songs of desperation, but, rather, they are about hanging in there and believing in love. This is a beautiful set. And, how many people have written songs about the beauty of fatherhood (even in a failed relationship)? That's unheard of. Sade is a heavy hitter. To the two star folk, don't be scared. Come back when you get the courage. You'll be fine.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Take this series for what it is. It's cheesy and campy. It's not intelligent literature by any means, but it is a nice breezy page turner.
0060920084|4.0|This book is a gem, which I found after enjoying Bryson's A Walk in the Woods.  His humor is indeed often sophomoric, but he spreads it around evenly on himself as well as others, and taken in the right spirit, he is truly funny.  Mostly I enjoyed reading along with a U.S. map in hand, learning about towns and sites I may never visit.  I wish he would travel the U.S. again and write an updated version.  I would love to read it!
