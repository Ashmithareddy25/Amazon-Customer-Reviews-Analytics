B00B99KJR0|5.0|A quality Match 3 type game similar to Call of Atlantis or Bejeweled with great graphics sure to please the literary or historically minded or even steampunks with its homage to Jules Verne.  Gameplay is restful yet stimulates the mind, and you can play it for a short clip or an extended time.  The difficulty level escalates with the introduction of additional game elements as you advance.  This was a great FAOTD when I was fortunate enough to acquire it!
B002RI9S2Y|4.0|This is a fantastic book that my nine year old son read and re-read many times. The whole family enjoyed the book. My only negative comment is that the publishers evidently didn't proofread the kindle edition and there are a number of small spelling and formatting errors. None are so bad that you can't read the book, but I as a little disappointed that the kindle version was put out with so little attention to detail.
B005N09L5C|4.0|Interesting topic, I read the book. Very true topic. This is a serious movie that outlines where we are going if we do not wake up.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|Cannot believe I missed seeing this when it originally was on TV...great cast avant guard...incredible writing-love it...a must see for almost everyone
B00358ESI4|5.0|Actually depicts how poorly lead, (top brass & politicians) we were in the 60's. Wait that is the same today for politicians.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I've been looking for something like this for a while, so glad I stumbled across this. At first I had a few problems, I didn't realize that when setting intervals you can change the default Repeat Every setting to From or Before Start. A quick message to the developer cleared that up, now I use my app daily. My only quibbles: 1) there is a setting that allows you to mute system sounds (phone ringing, texts, etc.). This doesn't work for me, they still come through so I have to mute my phone beforehand. 2) I wish the volume of the bells was set regardless of the Media Volume on my Droid. But as I say, quibbles about one of my favorite all time apps.
B005C8ENI0|2.0|I could not watch it, my IQ got in the way. The first few minutes are not offensive, only silly. Today's college student will love it.
B0052REUW0|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have read in recent years. It is thorough and convincing. Pinker has put together a true tour-de-force that will make it a classic for years to come.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are pretty good, a little glitchy but not bad. I like the chores, and setting the tasks to earn money and other rewards is fun. The competitions are challenging, but it might be nice to be able to watch the horse actually jump instead of having to watch when to click the button to jump.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Entertaining.  Light hearted, something you can watch with the family.  Modern family movie and the &#34;good&#34; character puts the &#34;mean&#34; characters in place with quick words and her wit.  Something to just sit back and enjoy.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Usually I have 3 alarm clocks, in different locations in my room, (Yesss it's that bad) now I have my kindle close to my pillow and I'm up n ready to go, I have it set so I must open my kindle an manually shut off.. works great..
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The Silver Linings Playbook: A Novel is different from the movie (which I preferred) in pacing and organization, but still highly enjoyable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So awesome. I can't get over how awesome it is I hope 0.7.0 comes out soon . Just so awesome
B008D37J6O|5.0|I tried several free video players, and this was the first one that would actually recognize and play the videos I uploaded from my computer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best seiries iv watched in long time if not the best ever .Watched all three seasons In about a week
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|The game works great, but my Facebook account will not synchronize with the app on my kindle fire hd tablet. I still love this game.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great read with suspense around every corner. My favorite Stephen King book of all time by far. The past harmonies
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|wow. this game is epic. its like a league of legends except for a kindle. plus its free so u should definitely get it if u like MOBAs great game all around but needs a some more players.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was AWESOME! It was one of the best books I've ever read. My favorite parts were when Alex and Katie/Erin were together and the cute moments they had together. Something I wanted to know that wasn't in the book was if Alex and Katie ever had children besides Kristen and Josh and what their wedding was like. But other than that the book was incredible and Nicholas Sparks did a wonderful job and I can't wait to read more of his books! :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book keeps you guessing from start to finish.  This is the first book I've read by Gillian Flynn and I will be looking forward to reading more of her work.  Her attention to detail and smooth writing style made for a rivoting mystery novel.
B00BJA2VFW|1.0|The beginning of the game went well, once I got to about the 16th or 17th level, the game would crash at about halfway through.  Tried restarting the game, restarted the tablet but it still keeps on crashing at this level so I can't go any further.  Am trying to reinstall the game and am hoping that is will fix the problem.  If it doesn't then it's not worth it.
B001GCZN12|3.0|I got the Within Temptation albums after seeing so many great reviews, but I am terribly dissappointed. Yes, the singer has a good voice, a high range and vibrato, but it gets grating and irritating after the same song after song; the orchestrations are good; but the albums flow repetitively from composition to the next, with very little variation, other than the lyrics; the band show no distinctive characteristics, no display of talent, musician or showmanship. I prefer to stick with Kamelot, Symphony X and Dream Theater. Get one album and if you like it, all of them will sound very similarly.
B00BF11STU|5.0|There is a scene where a couple of CIA operatives are watching TV, and Obama is speaking -- I'm sure you've seen the clips -- and Obama says something like, \\"America doesn't torture people.\\"  Both of the operatives stare at the TV for an extended moment, look away, and then continue talking.  And I've heard that quite a few critics wrote something like, \\"This movie left it up for the viewer to make a judgement about this scene.\\"<br /><br />Wrong.  The operatives had a look of complete dismissal, as they should have had, which is certainly making a statement.  If you believe that the US doesn't torture to get information, then I have some oceanfront real estate to sell you in Iowa.  Every country tortures to some degree, and the US is not surely immune from it.  And there are certainly some cases where it is justified.  (If you use some simple thought experiments, and you use logic, you should quickly agree.)<br /><br />But is this why Kathryn Bigelow was not nominated for best direction in this film, when either the actors were simply outstanding or she deserved to win?  (I haven't seen the film where Ben Affleck won, but she definitely should have been nominated.)  But with regards to the acting, while watching you will really feel like a fly-on-the-wall spectator, hanging by unseen and listening in on extraordinary but still everyday discussions.  Just like the film \\"United 93\\" -- a film that I highly recommend watching if you haven't already -- there are almost no huge-name actors here but actors who act naturally.  That is a refreshing change, and that requires excellent direction.  It is probably easy to direct when actors overact, but requires extreme restraint to let them live in the moment.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain is awesome here, and you get the feeling that she is Ms. Bigelow's alter ego.  (I wouldn't doubt that Ms. Bigelow probably wanted to play the part herself if she could.)  Many films come out nowadays where you get this \\"strong female lead,\\" butyou know it's often just for political correctness reasons.  Not here.  Ms. Chastain kicks you-know-what and takes names, and she uses those names to find her way to Bin Laden.  She wants to kill him seemingly more than anyone on the planet, and she will not be denied.  But she plays it perfectly at the beginning, having the brains but not quite the stomach for it all, and it seems that she just learns to tolerate some things as time goes along to get her target.<br /><br />So you screwed up again by not nominating Ms. Bigelow for an Oscar, Academy?  What say you?  I say, \\"Phooey!\\"  And I also say, \\"Big recommendation on this edge-of-your-seat film.\\"
0765325950|4.0|I was pleased with the direction Jordan chose for this ending (According to Sanderson).  It was deep; smart.  A brilliant end that I've been eager to reach for 20 years.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I like to watch movies about midgets and my old favorite was Willow starring the unequaled John Travolta. This midget movie was even better than that midget movie except it did not have John Travolta in it although it does have Professor Dumbledore as the old magician friend. f you like midgets or Harry Potter this is the movie for you.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I purchased this book because of the movie (which I didn't see), but was interested in.  What a surprise to find out what I  missed.  This is really a great read.  I would advise not starting it at night because you may not put it down and go to sleep.  The plot truly does thicken as you progress.  Enjoy!!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The product was great and the price was great! I actually got money back because I preordered it and the price went down the day it was released!
B003UESJF6|4.0|It was escapism at it's best.<br />When you want to ignore the world and it's problems this is a cute story to watch.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Found this movie to be a total bore. Three of us were watching and my two mates fell asleep during the 1st 15 minutes! Don't understand how it could receive an Oscar.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book...well written with lots of suspense. It is so much more than a 'love story'. I would highly recommend it.
B004RL9T50|5.0|Truly a G rated movie that's got some humor for kids and adults, a la Cars, etc.<br /><br />If you don't pick out who does the voices you'll be surprised when you get to the credits... :-)
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|One of the more entertaining games I have played.  Not the hardest by any stretch...but it was fun...and there should be more like it!  A little pricy at 2.99...but I am satisfied nonetheless.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Very interesting story...a bit long but it gets you thinking especially at the end. The photography is amazing and so lifelike - just wonder how much animation.
B00A77II0U|5.0|The only problem with this game is that it ends.  Absolutely a great HOG game, and I would highly recommend it.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This type of movie is becoming so typical of Hollywood large-budget films: Lots of money spent on digital effects that look great, but the script is so awful, with so many loose ends, unexplained motives and unlikely (and hokey) twists and turns they become tedious and irritating. Great digital scenery cannot make up for one of the worst scripts I have even had the misfortune to experience.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|This was just cheesy, and the game play lacked imagination.  Not my favorite...and I don't feel it is worth the money.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 or 2.4:1<br />Length: 3 hours, 11 minutes<br />Audio: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br /><br />I think I watched the Extended Version, although I am not sure, because it is not clear which one is being selected.<br /><br />The audio was excellent - lot's of surround sound and sub-woofer bass.<br />The video quality was also excellent.<br /><br />It dawned on me while watching this why the 1976 version hasn't been released on Blu-Ray.  It is because of 9/11 and the World Trade Center towers in the movie.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I try to download it but it says it failed to and that I have to try to download it from the cloud again but a tried a lot and it still doesn't work!!!!! very mad. don't know if it works on yours but it doesn't work on mine
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is free and is so very accurate.  I can plan my BBQ sessions by it.  I'd recommend it.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|When the famous American Explorer team of Lewis and Clark went up the Missouri River to explore the Louisiana Purchase, part of their job was to inform the Indian Tribes that they were now under the jurisdiction of the United States and these tribes should cease to make war on each other.  The old chiefs, diplomatic and calm as most older men are agreed, but often replied that tribal leadership was based on valor in war. Without war, they reasoned how would they select new leaders?<br /><br />Fight Club explores this theme.  Men are often at their best when they are in conflict, and for a great many men, the modern world is one of cubicles, shopping malls, and feminine nagging.<br /><br />Enter the Fight Club's un-named Narrator (Edward Norton).  He works in a dead-end, morally bankrupt, and emasculating job, his natural masculine aggression is channeled into an empty consumerism.  In this mode, his moral yearnings are satisfied by \\"fair trade\\" marketing gimmicks so enjoyed by the upwardly mobile.  This spiritual rut leads to insomnia.<br /><br />The vague, soul-less wandering of the Narrator is emphasized by the location of the movie-although not named it is Wilmington, Delaware.  More often than not, Wilmington is the final destination of all one's credit card payments.  Wilmington is a city where dollars flow to glittering corporate banking headquarters skyscrapers surrounded by a dull rust belt state on the Atlantic Coast.  A drive through central Delaware on US 13 is to take a tour of abandoned houses and crumbling infrastructure.  Delaware also lacks the moral force of Puritan New England and the noble, romantic dash of Dixie.<br /><br />In an effort to combat his sleeplessness, he starts attending support groups.  After visiting Remaining Men Together, a group for men who've lost their testicles to cancer, he has a breakthrough and he is able to sleep and keep in his rut.  What stops him is when he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a wildcat of a woman who is likewise unfulfilled in a primal way.  His insomnia returns.<br /><br />On a business trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and the pair eventually move in together to an abandoned Urban Prairie type of house and create a club where men can fight and thereby re-claim their manhood.  The club grows into a spiritual movement centered around wreaking the soul-less corporate, consumerism that they find so oppressive.  The climax of the movie is a mind-bending plot twist with a denouement that reconciles the narrator's relationship with both Tyler Durden and Marla Singer.<br /><br />Through the movie there is a dark sexual expression that is of the un-reproductive varieties which add to the barren feel of the culture being raged against.  There are several references to dildos and homosexual tension is woven throughout the relationship between Tyler Durden and the Narrator.  Indeed, the story is brought to climax, the narrator supposes, by sexual jealousies.<br /><br />This movie has inspired a great many men to re-evaluate their comfortable existence and there are blogs and internet postings that bemoan the fact that you can't hunt deer in the shadow of the abandoned Sears Tower.  These men in many ways miss the point.  The United States has been at war for more than a decade, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with fighting.  There are also many immoral causes that the corporate/Beltway Political elites carry out that can be brought to account.  In this regard the movie should be seen as an inspiring call to arms rather than mere complaining.an who is likewise unfulfilled in a primal way.

B009FZFONO|4.0|3rd Season just as good as the first. As Zombie threat becomes a tired plot catalyst, new story line moves in and is exciting. Old characters return &#34;not as zombies, either&#34;.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I hope the author writes more.  NASA leaves one of its members behind, not deliberatly, and he has to survive until he can be picked up.  I don't know if the science is really accurate, but, it's fiction and a good story.  If you're planning on going to Mars, maybe you should read this story before packing your bags.  This is a fun read, I think kids of all ages will love it.  Techies and trekies might also love it.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|It's flippin awesome when it works.... but sometimes it just won't load the streams... I know it's not my connection because I can watch it on my house computer on the same internet and can stream other things, but sometimes streaming on it just won't work.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I love the back and forth time sequence and how she pulls the details of the story together.  I am looking forward to reading more Kate Morton novels.
B006L0A5P8|5.0|You know you should have a different password for every account and it shouldn't be your birthday or your dog's name but who could remember all those passwords?  Onepassword solves that problem and password reader brings the solution to your tablet.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|It's great seeing the characters grow in this season, especially seeing Don Draper's character change with his new wife. :)
B008Q08PIK|5.0|Great movie filmed in Rome 60 years ago.<br /><br />Enjoy the settings and the acting from the lead actors and the supporting actors.
1401322425|5.0|This is really an awesome book; despite the fact i live in Colombia (South america) i found it very usefull, but most of all, it is a beutiful book
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This was the best of the series and did not disappoint.  I really enjoyed it despite the length. Well done.
B00008G8LM|4.0|I bought this for my grandkids.  It's funny and suitable for kids 7 and under.  I would recommend for family entertainment.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|The gameplay is much like any other match three, however, the story is one of my favorites. Always enjoyed this story.
B00821OX98|5.0|Can't wait for the next season.  good story lines, keeps you watching and a believable overall story.  keep it coming.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the series from the very first one, and look forward to the second season.  I hope they can maintain the quality.
034580404X|5.0|Loved the series, wish there were more! More by this author I mean. Not sure anyone else would peek my interest like EL James!
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|I have never been very good at any game - physical as well as virtual - that requires &#34;eye - hand&#34; coordination. Maybe if my parents had taught me to throw and catch/hit/kick a ball when I was little, I might be better at it. This game also might work better on a larger screen, but my Kindle Fire is what I have and what I use, and if I can not get the hang of the motions needed to play a game, I lose interest and I delete the game. Graphics are nice, but it is like an old time video game without much variation in the levels.
B00AFEY354|5.0|OK, it's got two things. One, Hermione (Emma Watson) is managing to get past her child actor years better than anyone else in Harry Potter and Two, they deal with teenage life and attendant misery without any of the usual cliches.  Watch it.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|I deleted this game after only two minutes of play. Too many ads, slow moving, and I did not like how the length of the games were set. I also object to the name of the game - the developers could have been more sensitive in naming this game.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Such a great show! We couldn't stop watching it.  The show feels like real life and the characters are great!
6304711891|4.0|I've always love the job that Sean Connery does in his movies.  I wish he was in more movies than he is.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is my 2nd copy that I have purchased and just watched the movie for the second time.  I can relate to the story, haveing been a wallflower most of my life.  The story is sad in a way...but the issue which damaged him is confronted so he can grow and overcome it.  Finding the right friends is a good healthy thing!  I still hang out in the &#34;land of misfit toys lol&#34;
B00BETX5PS|1.0|dull and lifeless - - not like the bonds of old where you had a great villain who wanted to take over the world - - this was a revenge flick and a great big &#34;who cares&#34;.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|We have a hundred calculators around the house; somewhere. On, our computers, our cell phones, in the drawers; calculators everywhere. But, where are they when you need one? I got this app for the wife's Kindle Fire on a lark. It is so neat, the kids decided to get it for their own Kindle. Big button calculator - it works just like, well, a calculator! So cool!
B001S49AQW|5.0|Wonderfully<br /> entertaining; I laughed aloud all through the book.  The vocabulary is priceless. You see London in all its proverbial gaiety during the Recency period.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|WW2 has spawned a huge number of books. This book is beyond unique, it is thought provoking and entertaining. It provides a truly remarkable view inside the Luftwaffe during that awful time. It also tells a story that will hook you and not let go until the final pages.
B00BLDD3A4|5.0|Dave is so talented, and this is a must have to put in your collection.  Not just if you love the Foo's, and thier sound, but its a good listening album.  I really wish there were more than 11 tracks.  It's such a  joy to know that there are artists that are keeping the rock genre going.  This has such a rich sound, I picture this mp3 just coming off an lp record, like from years ago.  The songs are done with different artists, some might not appeal to all, but the collaboration is awsome.  Very good listening, I can appreciate the sound they created in the studio, they did thier craft justice because I think it is a good rock album.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|always fun to play no matter what I play it on<br />The levels also provide some degree of a challenge sometimes which is good
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Loved the album<br />would recommend this album to anyone who loves tghis type of music<br />hpe she comes out with more classic albums
B00632HWOG|4.0|Great app for Android devices. It was easy to install and use. Makes it easy to stay connected with Yahoo Mail.
B008JDAC7G|1.0|I love this game on my Android phone, but the Kindle version sucks.  Plays differently and far less options than the Android version.  If you want to try this game, do so on your phone.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Easy to install and easy to use. Convenient way to print from your mobile device. I use it all the time.
0316077046|2.0|Not a book for adults, it's best for adolescents or those who have just graduated from high school in my opinion.
B00BLDD3A4|4.0|I'm impressed with the overall musicality on this piece as it showcases very different artists.Some of the songs are long on instrumentals at the end and tend to sound like a bunch of different instruments just playing with no real course as well as some vocals that just don't fit the song.I liked listening to the music but at times it sounded like it was thrown together.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|My favorite keyboard app for android. it blows the stock android keyboard away, I've been using it for years. I have tried a few other keyboards and keep coming back to this 1.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I watched this with my 9yr old son he at first wasn't interested he continued to watch it and fell In with it I am not disappointed
0763619612|5.0|My children love this book. My five year old had to read it three or four times a day when it first arrived. It's an inspiring story.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is a heart-pounding thriller which kept getting better with each page turned.  Author, Nelson DeMille, is the best I have read in this genre
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Loved this movie.  It is now in my comedy classics.  Great story and great characters.  Add funny British humor and you have a win.
B00BK3MSME|4.0|Here's a review I never thought I'd write. I have disliked Ms. Peyroux's singing in the past. Her mannered, whiny, wannabe-Billie Holiday style and sloppy delivery turned me off completely. Her reputation as a \\"jazz\\" singer has baffled me from the start. Sarah Vaughan was a jazz singer. The young phenom Cyrille Aimee is a jazz singer.  Ms. Peyroux attempts to negotiate jazz-like material with all the panache of a bar of soap. And although her choice of songs is fairly eclectic, her execution of even simple songs is sometimes just plain terrible.  I'm thinking, for instance, of her version of the Beatles' \\"Martha My Dear.\\"<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I heard THE BLUE ROOM and really enjoyed it. Unlike her past lackluster performances, Madeleine seems to really relate to these songs. I have to applaud her choices here, because she's picked some of the best material in classic country and western. Bye Bye Love, You Don't Know Me and I Can't Stop Loving You are three of my favorite songs from that genre and she does great work with them. Her throaty alto voice complements the material. I can even forgive the occasional pitchiness. That's because there's feeling, a sense of swing and even rapture to be found. Even Bird On The Wire, the Leonard Cohen song that I usually associate with the magnificent Judy Collins, is given a new and different lease on life. The terrific arrangements support her very well too. Born to Lose comes to mind.  Wow, it's beautiful.<br /><br />I don't believe it's necessary to have a great voice to be a great singer, but you have to know what you can sing and what you can't. In the past, I felt that Ms. Peyroux was done in by songs that transcended her ability to sing them. In addition, there seemed to be a cerebral attachment to the material, but not an emotional one, which made listening to her alienating on a lot of levels.  But this CD highlights Ms. Peyroux's emotional soul.<br /><br />If she continues to sing straightforward, simple, melodic, torchy, bluesy, country ballads she may have a new fan in me. Time will tell. But in any event, I will continue to enjoy the lovely Blue Room.
B00BVYQ832|5.0|First of all, the show is great. I was starting to get a little bored with the Governer character and his form of dictatorship. However, he is now a psycho and I'm looking forward to him being killed off the show!<br /><br />For those of you having problems watching the show...get off your butt...SIMPLY BUY, BUILD, REPLACE, OR UPDATE YOUR LOUSY COMPUTER. ALSO, QUIT BEING A TIGHT-ASS AND GO AHEAD AND PAY A LITTLE EXTRA FOR BETTER INTERNET SERVICE! Once you do that, you will be joining the ranks of elite Amazon show watchers.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|I had a lot of fun playing this game. Graphics are great and I enjoyed the characters and their different jobs. However, I really lost interest at the end with all of the grinding that you have to do. I beat the end boss, but can't motivate myself to get to a high enough level for the Iron Giant or to even try out all of the jobs/classes. Originally I had planned to get every single job to 99, but grinding is so not fun.<br /><br />But overall, very good game to play the first time through!!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is a great rendition of a Marine in combat.  E.B. Sledge gives a very honest portrayal of his experiences.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I really love this show.  The characters are a little psycho at times which makes it all the more interesting.  And you never know what strange thing they may have to investigate.  Makes me cringe and laugh.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|A fabulous, fun experience! As we expect from Aardman, a laugh a minute, very clever, very funny and very entertaining!
B003M6FGTE|4.0|Some of the story lines are a little much for me.  But I love the singing.  I love hearing all the songs done in show choir format.  Yes I am a chorus nerd.
0062200909|5.0|Highly recommended to all Tolkien and Peter Jackson fans! A total 'behind the scenes' revelation of the intricacies of the film's production. An absolute joy and wonderful keepsake.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|If you have the original kindle fire install android cyanogenmod or aokp on it and it becomes pretty much a nexus 7.<br />If you're not too tech savvy, find someone!<br />Then download the friggin kindle app after.<br /><br />The kindle fire HD is great and all but goddammit this Amazon ecosystem overlay is complete garbage.<br /><br />I'm thinking of downgrading but it was a gift from my dad so I shouldn't but if he was a programmer in any sense he would agree.<br /><br />I guess I'll just wait it out until someone makes a full running version. Currently it's still on alpha...
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Well, what can I say about Breaking Bad that hasn't already been said. I think it's simply the best production that's ever been made for television...EVER. I'm just one of the thousands (maybe millions) of HUGE fans of this program.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|THIS IS A VERY GOOD AND ENTERTAINING MOVIE. THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST VERY  DELIGHTIFUL TO WATCH. AND I REALLY LIKED IT...
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I can write this review because I have been watching it on Showtime. I didn't hesitate to pre-order this when I saw it would be available. I really could watch it over and over because that's how OUTSTANDING I think The Eagles are ! The amount of sheer talent involved is just remarkable and it is really interesting to me to see how they all began and continued to get better and better and how they re-connected after 14 years. I am truly glad that they did too !! I have always been a huge fan and if at all possible, an even bigger fan now. If you are an Eagles fan, you will not be disappointed in this ! I just wish they would do another album !!! I play the \\"Long Road out of Eden\\" in my car all the time.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|One of the best written thrillers on air right now. Characters are deep and intriguing, villains are always fun to figure out and watch unravel. I will say season 6-7 got a little predictable but the introduction of a secondary master plot in season 8 is beginning to intrigue me. Also, if you like this type of show I would recommend the Following with Kevin Bacon. So far so good, has the potential to be amazing, or it can turn off the hokey. We will have to wait for the writers to vet themselves out.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|A great interweaving of many tales.Beautiful symbolism and leitmotif draw these stories together in a cohesive whole that makes for great reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games, the first installment in an eponymous trilogy, is an enjoyable read. Written for and marketed to young adults (i.e. teens), this book can also be enjoyed by adults looking for a quick, engrossing narrative. Susanne Collins has done an admirable job of fleshing out all the main characters and created a world  rich in detail and believability. Perhaps the highest praise that can be said for a first installment of a series is that it makes you want to immediately read the next installment, and in this regard The Hunger Games utterly succeeds. Five stars, highly recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Most games move faster.  I find that I must wait to have coins replenished.  I would not reccomend this gam.
0062082353|5.0|Written in the military style of talking. A page turner, couldn't put it down.  A definite must read for everyone.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|Pretty simple matching game.  Have seen others that are just as good.  Tries to tie in with the book but is really just a puzzle game.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|Works as advertised and actually surpasses the 30 foot range quite easily.  I have forgotten that I had my phone in my pocket and walked out of my office and around the house, downstairs into the basement and upstairs to my bedroom and the thing kept on receiving.  And probably best of all, some expensive docking equipment I have now has a new lease on life after I move away from iPhone 4.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is both heart-warming and gut-wrenching. It was more than I expected. It's one of the few books I've ever been compelled to read multiple times.
B00999DFP0|5.0|This is my husband's favorite show.  The disc arrived in perfect condition and we have been re-enjoying them as a family.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|So many books, so many pages, and yet nothing has really happened yet. I have been reading for weeks and weeks in hopes of some conclusion. Very frustrated. Pointless.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Bought after seeing on Ben's Bargains.  Find it very challenging and not boring to play.  Would be a bit easier to use with easily accessible instructions.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was a really good book.  It makes you realize how hard life is for handicapped people but they still have a sense of humor, normal emotions & need love.  It really touched my heart.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Enjoyable read and written well. Will bring up good topics of discussion for my book club. Should have inspired me but didn't.
B0074VA2T2|1.0|Won't open,  I have a very very unhappy toddler which is the opposite of what I was going for when I downloaded this app
B001KU4P6Y|5.0|Great album front to back, can't believe that I just heard of these guys now. Going to download more tracks
0446580848|3.0|I am an avid fan of De Mille books but was disappointed in this one. Why do you require so many words before submittal so here are a few more?
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Ah!!! ITS MARRIED WITH CHILDREN!!! ENOUGH SAID....EXCELLENT PRICE FOR THIS CLASSIC TREASURE!!!!<br />IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, YOU SHOULD!!! IF YOU DON'T OWN IT, YOU SHOULD!!!
B009NX409M|4.0|I love and Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep, but found it difficult to picture them as a couple, which influenced my view of this picture.  It was an enjoyable movie, light in substance and predictable.
B000002IAS|5.0|Getting back to the type of collaberations that made early rock so great, this album is a live take on the tour in England with Eric Clapton.  Everyone is in top form and the music shows it.  The addition of Dave Mason only makes it better.  Great music, great album.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I find myself drawn into this one, very intertaining. Now it's time for me to do some work for the day, haha.
B00APAENUI|4.0|A good story and essential to the development of the series but not Weber at the top of his game.  However, Grayson comes into its own, particularly Benjamin IX, so the basis is created for the future of Grayson as a full partner of Manitcore.
076790592X|3.0|It's a nice but sad story. It makes you think about what is really important in life and how people confront death. The book shows us how afraid we are of leaving this world because we know we haven't been able to live intensely.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|This book shows why David Weber is the star of Sci-Fi & Fantasy that he is.  Gets it right fromt he first page and never misses a beat.  Pacing is outstanding and the character development lays the ground work for the whole series.  Simply outstanding.
B00008QSA5|5.0|Had forgotten about this one but Joe Bonamassa recommended it one Saturday morning on his facebook page so I gave it a listen.<br />Outstanding!
B000001E3V|5.0|Why is Eric Clapton at the top of the list of great guitar players?  This set showcases the answer in a sweeping tour de force at the old Fillmore East.  In those days Second Avenue below Union Square was an adventure but the Fillmore made the trip worthwhile.  Playing two shows a night, Clapton simply soars after his liberation from Cream.  He is just getting comfortable with the idea of being the lead singer and it shows, but the guitar work is magical.  Even Clapton admits that some of what he did in these shows is beyond his current abilities, but the chance to hear what early Clapton at the absolute top of his game sounded like is priceless.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I don't think I would have read this if not for Amazon recommending it. It is a great story with great characters. You won't go wrong with this one!
B00571F26Y|5.0|i recoment this product i cut my carbs 22 day ago and i feel very good i lost 10  pounds most of them on my belly
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I thought the movie closely followed the book with very little deviations. Perhaps the most glaring: the person who gave the Mockingjay pin to Katniss and Katniss's prep team, who have very minor roles here. I won't summarize the movie since there are some really good ones here but would like to address the actors who portrayed the characters. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as Katniss, as is Liam Hemsworth as Gale. At first, I wasn't sure Woody Harrelson fit the part of Haymitch but he won me over. As did Josh Hutcherson, who seemed too small for Peeta, but he does a great job in this role. There couldn't have been a better person to play Cinna than Lennie Kravitz as well as Donald Sutherland as President Snow - he's the very person I envisioned while reading the book. Excellent acting, a suspenseful, fast-moving plot, and great special effects.<br /><br />I've watched the movie several times and enjoy it each time. I'm looking forward to the next two in this trilogy.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I chose five stars because, this is probably one of the best games I have ever played and I've played many on the internet and my Kindle. Beautiful graphics, the game is not simple but isn't hard. I'm halfway through and the only draw back I can say is, I know it's not going to be long enough.... (hate finishing a great game!) If you like HO games this ones for you... have a blast!!!<br />The game is well worth the $2.99. I normally gravitate toward Big Fish games, but if G5 comes out with more like this one I WILL be<br />buying!!
B00933JL0A|5.0|Like the sim series.this game is a great way to pass time while all your sims in the regular game are busy do long tasks such as work..
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I bought the instant video instead of the bluray and dvd because I use my xbox and kindle hd to watch most movies. The picture quality is grainy, even after I downloaded it to my devices. The movie is amazing, and it would be GREAT if I could actually see it - but I can't.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Ang Lee did an amazing job of bringing to life Yann Martel's Novel of a young Indian boy's adventures and survival in the Pacific Ocean.  The CGI was beautiful and blended well with the imaginative story line.  The cinematography was gorgeous.  A wonderful tale for the whole family.  Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi Patel, did a great job despite being snubbed by the Academy Awards.  At least Ang Lee won.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Kids turned it off in the middle of the movie and told me it was no good.  Not worth watching.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Afleck did an amazing job of capturing not only the events of the time but creating an incredible movie depiction of a suspenseful true life drama.  I would highly recommend.
B005YZX32I|5.0|this is a must for everyone that wants to have a baic knowledge of the human body functions, it is essential
B007REV4YI|5.0|Best Bond movie, so far!! I probably watched 100 times! I highly recommend, this movie is a must have!!!!! Thanks!
B000B589JI|1.0|I was really disappointed in this, i tested it out immediately when i opened it, it was a perfect companion for my firestash keyring, but within 24 hours all the fluid evaporated......i don't know if maybe i am missing the \\"O\\" ring inside to help seal it, but the one that came in it was WAY too big, and useless.... =( very sad, i was really looking for to this to add to my cool collection of useful key chains!<br /><br />=
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Great songs, after all is a Jimi Hendrix CD, if you love his music this CD is a must have for your collection!!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I recently started reading Lee Child's Jack Reacher  books.  I hove not read them in order and have not been disappointed or found problems in not following the publishing time line.  I have also not seen the movie.<br />This story keeps you on the edge of a cliff almost from the start.  The twists and turns of the plot begin immediately and never disappoint during the story.  All classic Jack Reacher with problem solving via brute strength and intense research.  You can read other reviews to glimpse the story line but my suggestion is this is a great place to start learning about Jack.
034580404X|3.0|But the beginning is so far interesting, which is lame to say, since I haven't gotten through the book yet!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love to read it as I am waiting on appointments etc.Reguardless of how people feel it is very up lifting and good for a moral builder.What kind of country would you have without morals.It has to start somewhere.Great little app with a big message.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was the BEST season! I couldn't wait to watch each episode and see what would happen. The season final was just great! Highly recommend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've been buying the episodes as they release on Amazon since I don't have cable. I'm anxiously awaiting the next episode. So many twists and turns and the characters are fantastic. Who doesn't like to bash zombies also!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. I really have become addicted to taking care of my horse Buffy. I would recommend this game to anyone who has a good time with horses.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|This was a strange season due to Matthew leaving, but I still love the series and will buy them as long as they go on.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This is fun but it seems too easy - no challenges.  I would like a bit more pictures to choose from, maybe locations (not more cats please).
0805017445|5.0|I remember reading this book as a child. I enjoyed it so much. It's so special to me to be able to share this book with my kids. It's great for teaching while having fun learning colors, but also a wonderful chance to bond with your child over the magic that exists in children's books. I 100% reccomend this book for all little ones.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it so much the ending was so sweet I love this book so much it was the awesomeness ever
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|After nearly 'devouring' Seasons I & II, I couldn't wait for season III to arrive! It did not disappoint!! I can enjoy watching any episode multiple times, and find something new each time. This series has been beautifully done in every way!!! Love, love, love it! Over the top with enthusiasm? Maybe, and justifiably so. If you are vascillating to purchase, don't. You will find many hours of enjoyment in each season! Can't wait for Season IV!!!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I do a lot of eBay ing on my kindle and my smart phone and haven't had any troubles on either device
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Magical, page turner, with a love story!  Definitely a great read.  Highly recommended.  You do not have to be into &#34;magic&#34; to enjoy this book.
1616550414|5.0|Full colour art concepts, the timeline for the entire legend, this is a must-have for any Legend of Zelda fan. Definitely pick this one up, it's great.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I'm so glad I bought this movie! It was intense, but in a good way! Now I know exactly why Ben Affleck won!!!<br />I would recommend this movie to everybody!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It awesome that I was so close to get one 1,000 coins for my first time also it is fun because you get to play with your friends and earn coins,but I don't have a Facebook to get friends to play with me.
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg!!!!!!!!!!u have to get this game<br />you will love it and you absolutely have to get u will love it so much
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|If you like ELO and Jeff Lynne this is an album you must have. I never grow weary of listening to it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Every week has me waiting in anticipation for the next wpisode. This show is very well written. It's been a long time since I've seen anything as entertaining as this. I don't pay for cable because of all the garbage on TV, so I have to pay per episode on Amazon, but it's totally worth it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the one tv show that we would actually pay (a small amount of) money to see. The characters are interesting and the plots are generally hilarious.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great for those horse lovers out there I have not really ever loved horses but this is a great game. It has good graphics never blurry . You can compete in competitions and take care of your horse like give treats to them. Competing in the competitions is awesome . I give this game a 4 because it does a  fairly long time to regenerate energy
B009K0P10K|5.0|Hats off to the writers who keep growing the plot and characters. And the actors for pulling it off. Recommended.
B0058W74UY|2.0|cannont get to work on my kindle fire hd as i was told it would so my opinon is not compleatly valid
1619691825|5.0|out standing novel, Corey at his best, history lesson was quite enlightening. There is as in all DeMille's book lots of fact and blended fiction. A really great one this time.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|dosent seem to work with the kindle fire as i was led to belive so  my opinion isent really valid
B007EECSFA|3.0|While I have very much enjoyed other Kate Morton books, I found this to be quite tiresome......which was a great help since I tend to read when I go to bed and, in this instance, falling asleep was no problem.  As others have noted, the mobility of the plot does pick up about halfway through the book.  Unfortunately, by that time I was already tired of the characters and the story line.  I did finish the book, reluctantly, and am glad I did, but, overall, I did not feel this was Morton's best work.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This show is ALWAYS funny, from start to finish!!  Highly recommended!!!<br />I need to write nine more words, thus this sentence.
B006ISJQBC|5.0|London Boulevard received only middling reviews, but I found it to be smart, funny, clever, and hugely enjoyable. Colin Farrell, who seems to make weak films in American production, chooses far better films when working overseas (In Bruges, for example) and London Boulevard is no exception. This is a brilliant film, and the blu-ray is of superb quality. This is well worth the low purchase price.
B000ID1J40|5.0|I rented this through Amazon Instant Video recently because I wanted to watch it with my daughter. I wasn't sure it would \\"stand the test of time and memory\\", but I'm pleased to say it passed the test with flying colors. I've always been a Redford fan, which was why I saw the movie in the first place when it came out. The movie blends drama and suspense with the right dose of humor to make the movie flow well.<br /><br />I remember when seeing it the first time I was afraid it would with the weight of so many \\"big\\" names being in the same production. Not so with this cast of stars, and they do all manage to shine here in these performances.<br /><br />Fact remains, it's still a great movie. Some of the tech may be dated, but that didn't give me pause or detract from enjoyment. I wish there were more movies like this one.
1595827684|5.0|A disclaimer; I've never played any of the Mass Effect games, I'm just a fan of really well-done art books, and this certainly is one. Major characters are highlighted, not only their final designs but many explored variations that never made it into the final game as well. There's a section on the different worlds featured in each game, and small pieces on some of the gear. The book is predominantly character-centric, which appealed to me, and arranged by game, with a large chapter devoted to each specific game. Fans of the game who also enjoy art and design would find this book indispensable; as I said, I was impressed enough by the art and the quality of this book to buy it with no prior knowledge of the video game series. A stunning book, almost a steal at Amazon's price.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the first and the third books in the series. (The second not so much) I thought the characters were consistent throughout the series. Katniss' decision on the speakers platform was delicious!
B0083V2VW8|5.0|You haven't seen Quadrophenia until you've seen this version. Criterion as usual does a stellar job on the transfer -- the film never looked this sharp and clean, even with the film grain from the source material. The music leaps from the speakers, and the visuals are stunning. The extras are enjoyable, a documentary on the Mods and some interviews, my favorite of which was a very brief one with Sting. This is the ultimate version of Quadrophenia, and well worth the investment for any fan.
1609611543|4.0|This book makes a great deal of sense.  The science behind it seems sound.  I was not aware of how wheat has changed over the last 50 years through cross breeding and genetic enhancement.  Nor was I aware that these new versions have NOT been tested on humans.
B000JMKNV0|2.0|From the beginning, I thought the book was going to be good. The more I read, the more I wondered and<br />the ending was very disturbing.  I wish I hadn't read it.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I did enjoy the book and couldn't put it down because I wanted to obviously know how the author wrapped up the series. I was a little disappointed by the ending. He had so much detail throughout the series that I thought the ending was too buttoned up too quickly. That's the only reason it's not 5 stars for me. I miss the characters now that I'm done with the series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|For Christmas 2011 I was given a copy of Wool and received the omnibus for Christmas 2012. Best gifts ever.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I found the first book very difficult to get started. It took me 4 attempts to get through the first 75 pages and get hooked. This book I couldn't wait to read after I finished the first one. I simply couldn't put it down. I am very happy I didn't read it when the third book wasn't out yet. The ending wasn't a &#34;book&#34; ending. It completely left you hanging as if you need to page turn for the next chapter. I couldn't believe that's how they ended it. Well, it sure did make me pay my next $9.99 for the next book in the trilogy! I guess for the publisher that ending works! If you enjoyed the first book, you will enjoy this one too.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love it more every time I read it...only two more weeks and we get to here from Travis!!!!!! Can't wait come on already April 2nd
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love Supernatural even though it jumped the shark awhile ago. This is a great season so far and I look forward to finishing it up. I can't wait to see what happens to Sam and Dean.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have horses and find this fun wag to pass time any I do a lot of that lol I
B0043WHRWA|5.0|This show just gets better. From Castle's home situation with his Mother and daughter, the interaction in the police station with Beckett's team, to the suspects in the murders, the dialog is excellent with lots of humor referencing everything X-Files to Yoda.<br />If you liked Season 1 and 2 you will enjoy the 3rd season ride as the actress playing Nikki Heat, for the movie, comes to observe Beckett.
B002DCPQL6|4.0|I had loved Rihannas previous album &#34;A Girl Like Me&#34; and when i origionally bought this album, it was the standard 13 track album..way before reloaded came out etc. I had seen this and wanted it because i loved the orgional album and wanted to have the remix disc. I was not disappointed. The bonus disc just makes the album that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Rihanna gets better by the album in my opinion and i actually recommend this version to the Reloaded versions because this is the origional deluxe edition and the Reloaded versions only have 3 extra songs (Which are probably my least favourite songs anyway) and if you get the &#34;Deluxe Reloaded&#34; you just get a DVD with it &#34;previewing&#34; highlights of her GGGB tour.<br />So whether you want the standard album or whatever, i recommend this album. This is the album that really put Rihanna on the map for me. One of her best albums out of the 7 shes currently done.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie, I would recomend it to anyone. Absolutely loved it! Great Movie. Should have more like it. Thanks alot.
B00AMLFJT4|5.0|This album is just brilliant! I have not played anything else but this album for the last month because im so addicted to it & love it that much!<br /><br />Bruno Mars is one of the few generally talented artists of the modern era in my opinion. (music nowadays is autotuned and just someone singing over a dance beat most of the time). With Bruno, comes a whole other story. He has so many different styles and genres on this album, which is one of the things i love about the album. Theres a bit of pop, 50s style, 60s, 80s, reggae...very broad...AND HE CAN ACTUALLY SING, write, produce, play the instruments..VERY TALENTED! :)<br /><br />I also love that he has used the \\"old\\" way of recording which is recoding his tracks with live instruments etc and not with computers. this just makes the album sound fresh and that more real.<br /><br />The only bad thing i would say of this album is it is only 35 minutes long. I need more Bruno! Enter \\"Unorthodox Jukebox Target Deluxe Edition\\" This edition (exclusive to Target) has 5 bonus tracks:<br />1 new song, 2 demos (of Gorilla & Young Girls. basically acousticy as this is Bruno and a guitar. Alot of things are stripped away in the demo versions), 2 remixes. These bonus tracks really give you an insight to the process Bruno went through making this album and just makes it that much better!<br /><br />Most modern music is what i say \\"for the moment\\" meaning that they are good for that first couple years they are out and then they just fade away. However unlike most modern music and like the classics that are from the early 90s/ 80s and before, this album is timeless. I know ill be listening to this album is years to come. Bruno really has got me \\"Locked out of Heaven\\" with this!<br /><br />All i can say is GO GET THE ALBUM!! You will NOT be disappointed!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie, I would recomend it to anyone. Absolutely loved it! Great Movie. Should have more like it. Thanks alot.
B006B9F6CQ|5.0|So ive been a lifelong fan of Britney since day one. I had pervously seen her &#34;The Circus starring Britney Spears&#34; tour back in 2009 and knew i had to go see her again!<br />I went to this tour 3 times in the space of 4-5 days. Twice in London, once in Birmingham and can i just say i LOVED it the more i went to see it! i didnt get bored which is what you would expect seeing the same show that short in time over again.<br />Once the tour had finished, i hoped that Britney would release it on DVD (Whch i also think she should have done for the Circus tour as a Circus is a show in itself!) and to my delight, she did!<br /><br />This DVD is amazing because i get to experience the show over and over again and what makes it even better is that you get a BONUS CD OF REMIXES!<br />So if you want to watch this tour, or relive it, then GET THIS DVD!!
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Great movie, I would recomend it to anyone. Absolutely loved it! Great Movie. Should have more like it. Thanks alot.
B00B19F3PG|2.0|While this movie added a twist to the whole possession thing, it really wasn't all that great.  Even though the \\"original\\" looks dated, it's still pretty creepy.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie, I would recomend it to anyone. Absolutely loved it! Great Movie. Should have more like it. Thanks alot.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I don't usually like sitcoms but I  love this one.  The ensemble cast is a great fit with Jim Parsons as  the odd man spectacularly out.  Leonard's hopeless crush on Penny takes me back to junior high and the quarterback of the football team who was completely out of reach.  I watched Johnny Galecki grow  up on Roseanne and liked him from his first appearance on the show.  There is enough science in the show to demonstrate their brilliance and passion for their work and enough childlike behavior (everyone has at least one Star Trek uniform and a comic book collection} to put them firmly in nerdland.  After a stressful day, watch an episode or two of The Big Bang Theory and expect to be entertained.
B0086DBE62|5.0|Great movie, I would recomend it to anyone. Absolutely loved it! Great Movie. Should have more like it. Thanks alot.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|The plot is weak, the acting is fair, it takes till the end of season 2 to get interesting... If you have time and don't know what to do, and have nothing else to watch... Then this is perfect...
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I feel like I have won something. This set is incerdible. NOT to mention that you get a digital copy of the movies which is downloadable on i-tunes!  SAY WHAT???  It's pretty sweet.  I love these movies and this set is a must if you do too.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|Great Lego Ninjago.  Both of my kids loved it.  They always enjoyed having Lego items to play with all the time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like everything about this app.  great graphics. great pictures. plus the weather is always up to date. the 10 day forecasts are more up to date than the Tv weather news people.

B009AMALGM|5.0|I bought this dvd for my daughter who loves all the Paranoromal movies.  I never watched any of them and after a weekend of being snowed in we had a Paranormal Activity marathon Saturday!  While I know this is the fourth of the sequels and most going that far are really, really bad, this one actually was really pretty good.  It kept the whole creepiness factor going strong and the scares were pretty good.  For the fan of these movies, its a good one (better than 2 IMO).  A must have for the PA fan.

0062267787|5.0|Hana<br /><br />The first novella Hana goes back to the summer before Hana was cured. We experience moments not told in Delirium and even a few moments that were from Hana's point of view. Although this is considered Delirium #.5 I personally found it beneficial to read after Requiem. Otherwise the surprise in Requiem would have been spoiled.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />We see how Hana's feelings developed regarding Lena and Alex.<br />There's a glimpse of Hana not only partying but her experiencing fear of getting the disease.<br />We have empathy for Hana as she covers up her \\"devil's kiss.\\"<br />Cons:<br /><br />I'm not a fan of rehashing scenes that we've already read. However with that being said, I did feel Oliver did it well.<br />Story: 5/5<br /><br />Annabel<br /><br />The story of Annabel offers the reader both a glimpse of before she was cured and her time in the crypts just before her escape. Eleven years in the crypts, the reader gets barely a glimpse but it's enough to see how she possibly managed to survive. What the story lacks isn't more depth (we get plenty of that) but answers on after her escape and her time as a rebel. Annabel is shorter in length than Hana, and the story of Annabel could have used the additional pages to tie up more questions instead of such an abrupt end.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />We learn of the environment where Annabel (Lena's mother) grew up. How society was changing.<br />Annabel's first encounter with Conrad and how he became one of her recommended pairings.<br />Conrad's passing and him remembering her leather jacket.<br />The awful conditions of the crypts and what it was like to live there.<br />How she planned her escape and waited until Thomas gave her directions.<br />The cure hasn't worked for Annabel and she feels something for Lena while she's pregnant with her and also worrying about her daughter as Rachel (her other daughter) has already been cured. She has hope for Lena.<br />Cons:<br /><br />For a novella the story feels short, abruptly ended. I'd have preferred to read about Annabel and how she survived outside of the crypts. It was great reading about her escape but seeing her on the run without shoes, no food after being hosed down and bruised it felt like it ended before the story had time to begin.<br />Not enough scenes of Lena and Annabel together. It would have been nice to see another moment of their time when Lena was young.<br />Story: 4/5<br /><br />Raven<br /><br />The novella Raven offers a strong glimpse at a a character we've met in both Pandemonium and Requiem. We've always wondered about Raven, who she is, where she comes from and how she came to be the tough leader that she is with the rebels. The story of Raven offers a little insight into her character.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Tacks gets his name after previously been called \\"Thief.\\"<br />Glimpse into Raven's home life, where she came from and how she came to be who she is.<br />Raven surprises us at the end with not the news but how she obtained the information.<br />Blue as a child and how \\"Thief\\" protected her.<br />Raven trusting \\"Thief\\" and again trusting \\"Lena.\\"<br />Tack and Raven, how they came to be.<br />Cons:<br /><br />The news at the very end of the story we learn, isn't mentioned again, including in Requiem when we see Raven.<br />Story: 5/5the story feels short, abruptly ended.

B006LSZECO|2.0|This is one of those books where I feel like I would like to get the time back, that it took to read.  I will try another Gillian Flynn  book one of these days as it wasn't the writing style but the story-line that felt like a waste of my time.  I do wonder if she hates men-a theme I am not interested in reading.  Just my 2 cents.

0316044695|5.0|This book was recommended by a Marine and I bought it for my husband on that recommendation.<br />It got a rave review from Hubby who loved the style of writing and the gripping story.  I won't read<br />it, because I don't care for war stories, but I know he really liked it a lot.
055357342X|3.0|I find it difficult to write a review of this book that isn't rife with spoilers for those who haven't read it yet. I'm not so concerned about spoiling the events of earlier books in the series, but I find that it's hard to talk about the portions of this book that affected me the most without giving away major plot points. So I'm going to divide this review into two parts: the part I'll cross-post to Amazon, BN and Goodreads, and the part I'm going to post only here and hide behind a cut so that folks looking at their Friends Page on LJ won't be spoiled if they don't want to be.<br /><br />Overall, I was satisfied with the third installment of A Song of Ice and Fire, but I also felt like it dragged in places. Martin has done a lot of world-building down to the most minute details, and so of course he wants to share them with us. There are times for this reader, though, where several pages of descriptions of banners and sigils becomes overwhelming and drags the whole story down. This isn't a problem I find unique to my reading of George RR Martin; I had the same problem with The Lord of the Rings. I love the world Martin has given us, but I struggle with details I know I'm not going to remember three pages from now. As the cast grows and the story moves in wider arcs, I hope Martin will cut down a bit on the detail in order to make sure the plot keeps moving and not have the story stagnate. Because of this personal qualm, I'm giving this book three stars, which is \\"average\\" on a five star scale. The stronger plot and characterization moments were unfortunately balanced out by those long pages of banners, sigils and introductions of retinues with characters so minor they don't even count as fourth- or fifth-string.<br /><br />I am intrigued enough by where the book left off to continue with the series, although I'll take a bit of a reading break before diving into book four. Right now, at least, I feel like the pace has not slowed to unreadable (to me) levels despite the points where the story feels padded by details. Unlike, say, Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time, where it seems it takes 1000 pages to track characters' movements over a mere handful of days with little of major import happening (my gripe with the middle books of that series), Martin has several major plot events occur in this book, and he moves his characters around with purpose (well, mostly; it still feels like Arya's path has been especially padded and drawn out to get her to where she's ultimately going). We already know from previous books that Martin is not afraid to kill characters and destroy fortresses to advance his story, and there's plenty of that to go around in this book, leaving the reader with a pretty solid sense of uncertainty even when you think you know where the plot is going.<br /><br />So, final non-spoilery comment: I still think the first book is the strongest in the series and would rate Storm of Swords the weakest of the first three but still overall enjoyable.<br /><br />The portion of my review that contains spoilers can be found at [...]...e the story feels padded by details.

B009VIZDLI|5.0|What a delightful discovery! A book you will want to share, to read aloud to a friend, to discuss and just enjoy. The lovely understated irony and charming relationships all described with the searing almost childish perception of a narrator who seems completely incapable of dishonesty. Light hearted and charming, not too much to frighten or unnerve, you are in good hands both those of the author and his hero.

B00BIQU1K4|5.0|This CD is not for everyone.  I read a review that described it as \\"not the sort of music that holds your hand and walks you safely toward the chorus\\", which I think hits the nail on the head, and is precisely why I like it so much.  There are very few artists in 2013 that are committed to making music in this genre...Steven Wilson does it better than anybody.<br /><br />The musicianship on the album is top-notch.  I particularly like the sax and flutes, and the use of mellotron throughout the album....very early Genesis-esque.  A few highlights for me are \\"The Watchmaker\\", which takes a while to build but once it does, the melodies are hauntingly beautiful.  The guitar solo on the 2nd half of \\"Drive Home\\" is genius.  \\"The Pin Drop\\" is a perfectly arranged prog song, and the lyrics send chills down my spine.  And of course \\"Luminol\\" is wonderfully constructed and frankly, just rocks!  (You won't find a composition like this on any standard rock album.)<br /><br />I'm not sure I would call this a masterpiece (as many reviewers have stated), but for anyone that appreciates progressive rock, this is a very very worthwhile album to add to your collection!<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Wilson!

0062014536|4.0|Requiem is the third book in the Delirium series by Lauren Oliver and I must say, I was impressed. I was expecting the third book to fall short and not deliver like the other two did. This one was told with alternating point of views, from Lena and from Hana. Hana, as we all remember ( I do hope you read the previous books) was \\"cured\\" and she is marrying the soon to be Mayor. Lena is figuring out how to deal with her feelings for Julian as well as Alex, who we saw at the end of the second book, was still alive.<br /><br />I loved having Hana's part in there and there were times that I enjoyed hers more than Lena's because it was just a whole different aspect of things and scenery. You got to see how it was to be cured and how she felt void of many feelings. However, it appeared that her cure didn't work 100% and she really impressed me in the end.<br />The resistance was in full swing and they surely pulled a big plan out even though there was quite a bit of bloodshed that I had to tear up about. The book was just as good as the other two and it was all I could have hoped for. The writing never lacked and the imagery was spot on.<br /><br />I have to ask though, I haven't gone to look just yet but, this isn't the last book is it? If it is then I am not very fond of the ending as it is very open and not concluded but, if it isn't then I can't wait to see what is going to happen to Lena. I mean, it can't really end like that, right?
B0041T4ML4|4.0|I really enjoyed the direction he took on this book,very unexpected. I have read several of Bacigalupi's books and look forward to more

B00B23O96A|4.0|Most reviewers seem to have missed the point about this album. Firstly the relaxed cover photo and album title; they are meant to be self-deprecating, EC is making fun of a jokey reference to himself by David Bowie, he no longer needs to take himself seriously, let alone be seen as a guitar hero. This leads to the second point, namely the familiar complaints about the lack of screaming guitar solos. Well as EC would say \\"been there done that.\\" The whole point is that he doesn't survive on his reputation alone, he's been a guitar hero-if one exists outside of Hendrix-and it was time to move on, al la Miles. Hence his exploration of other musical genres, reggae, accoustic ballads, country, r 'n' b, fusion, and the need to develop his songwriting and vocab abilities.<br /><br />Although he hasn't written any new material on the album, it is a strong and confident adoption of songs fron several different genres, reggae, r 'n' b, country, jazz standards, blues and soul, and EC handles them all with aplomb.<br /><br />The highlights include the two reggae numbers, Taj Mahal's \\"Further on Down the Road\\" and Peter Tosh's \\"Till Your Well Rund Dry.\\" EC definitely has a feel for the genre. The former has a loose soulful guitar solo that builds and some nice harmonica fills, from Taj Mahal, no less. The latter starts slow sould ballad style before swiftly evolving into a reggae shuffle with an economical and apposite guitar solo. Either of these could replace \\"I Got the Sheriff\\" in the live set were it for the fact that EC still gets a buzz from playing the song.<br /><br />J.J. Cale's bright and breezy \\"Angel\\" features guitar from both and shows how much they complement rather than duplicate each other.<br /><br />Gary Moore's \\"Still Got the Blues for You\\" is a refined and restrained tribute to the man whose whole guitar concept was based around EC's playing on \\"John Mayall's Blues Breakers featuring Eric Clapton.\\" Strings are to the fore in the manner of BB King's \\"The ThrillHas Gone\\" and Fleetwood Mac's \\"Need Your Love So Bad.\\" It is followed by some relaxed and memorable guitar work.<br /><br />The standards are tastefully handled: \\"The Folks Who Live on the Hill\\" is a dignified and moving rendering, \\"All of Me\\" and \\"Our Love is Here To Stay are strong performances, there's no descent into schmaltz here, a la Rod Stewart. Paul McCartney distinguishes the former with his solid double bass playing and there is some delicate piano playing on the Gershwin classic.<br /><br />\\"Gotta Get Over\\" has a stinging riff and brings to mind the Dominoes phase of EC's career. It's a driving song that he threatens to cut loose on. Greg Leisz's pedal steel and Doyle Bramhall's wha-wha are to the fore.<br /><br />I'm not a great fan of country, but \\"Born to Lose\\" has some memorable dobro work, as does Leadbelly's \\"Goodnight Irene.\\" (Passable for a singsong at the local pub but it's a little out of place here.<br /><br />Otis Redding's \\"Your One and Only Man\\" is also given the low down reggae shuffle treatment underpinned by low key guitar.<br />Doyle Bramhall's second co-authored song \\"Every Little Thing\\" turns into another danceable reggae number with pedal steel guitar and EC's guitat climbing into the melody. and vocal debuts from EC's three daughters.<br /><br />Unpretentious but hugely enjoyable to listen to, it's a memorable album of songs that have had a special signicance to him.

B003WTE886|4.0|What can you say about one of the biggest stars on the planet? I can't believe it took me so long to buy it!
B009MF56GC|3.0|I love The Expendables.  In my opinion, that movie was the perfect throwback to the 80s/90s/2000s action films, with just enough action, humor, and drama, from those decades, and just enough stars to make the movie enjoyable.  Updated 80s action with the sensibilities of today (cameos and Easter eggs, for example).  Naturally, when I heard about a sequel, with even more action, and even more retro stars, I was excited.<br /><br />The first big change was that Sylvester Stallone was stepping down from the director's chair.  This actually does not play in favor for the film.  Stallone brought a certain love, a passion, in the first film that the second one tries to but doesn't grab.  He literally put blood, sweat, and tears into The Expendables, and it showed with the 60+ year old performing his own stunts, and nitpicking all of the pre and post production components.  So much so, in fact, that a Director's Cut exists for the first film (that isn't as good as what was originally released, but still).  This time out, the producers decided to hire a well-known action director, Simon West, to handle production duties, leaving Stallone to lead the cast, but still handle writing duties.  Writing aside (which we'll get to in a second), West is not a bad director by any means.  The action is big, and he handles the many personalities very well.  The passion just isn't there as Stallone had with film #1.<br /><br />Writing duties, as mentioned before, fell back to Stallone.  This is both good and bad.  Good, in that the original writer of the screenplay from the first film is continuing the stories for the sequel.  Bad, because Stallone thought it a good idea to include entirely too many winks to previous conquests of each of the film's big stars.  One liners work in these movies, but in excess, the movie becomes campy and too laughable, something a huge action film should not be.  Arnold's \\"I'm back\\" and \\"I'll be back\\" are here (as well as a mention of him being \\"terminated\\"), Bruce's Die Hard \\"Yippee kai-yay\\", and even a Chuck Norris Fact all make it into the film.  I get that he's trying to throwback the film to the good ol' days, but, getting serious for a minute, the minimal use of retro action humor and mere teases of the past in the first film were enough to remind fans of those old school action films.  Too much is overkill.  The one liner, action star dialogue highlight belongs to Stallone though, who proclaims: \\"That's how we deal with death. We keep it light, until it's time to go dark. Then we go pitch black.\\"  Just enough of ridiculous humor and macho bravado to make me crack a smile.<br /><br />There are action stars aplenty on display, with the cast of the first film (minus Mickey Rourke) all back.  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis get bigger roles, action icons Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme get added to the fray, and we also get some young names in Liam Hemsworth and Yu Nan.  Stallone and Jason Statham get the most to do, like the first film.  Dolph Lundgren gets a bit more to do, but the writing of his character doesn't necessarily mean that is a good idea.  Do we really believe that his character, Gunnar, is as goofy as he is portrayed on screen?  Most disappointing is the extended cameo that Jet Li gets, only popping up in the first 10-15 minutes, and then dropping out.  Not only does this not really make sense, but it also doesn't fully utilize one of the film's main characters and members of the mercenary group, and a martial arts mastermind, in the process.  Some guys are a little rusty too, as Chuck Norris' big introduction is merely an extended wink-wink and pat on the back for the 70 year old action star.  Arnold's first big role after his Governor-ship in California shows the wear on his tires, as he is obviously trying too hard to read his lines, and his timing is off in nearly every scene he's in.  New cast member Hemsworth is an interesting character that doesn't get as much room to breathe.It's nice to see a female join the men in the action scenes, but Yu Nan is reduced to hitting on old man Stallone by the end of the movie.  I also would have liked to see Randy Couture get more to do.  His buddy-buddy scenes with Terry Crews work, and the humor works for Crews, who gets to flex his comedic muscles (sometimes a bit too much).  Jean-Claude's villain, aptly named Jean Vilain, is cool, and fitting for the film's large cast set against him.  His 2nd-in-command, played by the always entertaining Scott Adkins, also gets a villain role, proving that the casting director is paying attention to the newer, and direct-to-DVD action stars as well.<br /><br />The movie is not terrible by any stretch, it just needs some work.  The opening action scene is great (especially the Jet Li kitchen utensils martial arts fight), as is the final airport battle, where we get everyone fighting against Van Damme's group of bad guys.  We get shots of Stallone firing weapons with Arnold and Bruce, Chuck Norris popping up shooting a villain while he lays inside an airport security x-ray machine, and one-on-one fights between Statham and Adkins (which is underrated and brief, they are both great here), and of course, the mano e mano between Stallone and Van Damme (which simultaneously shows their age, despite them having enough left in the tank to deliver another solid match-up).  The action lives up to expectations.  My complaints come in to the added effects, as a lot of the sets look like they were produced on a sound-stage (they were), and the blood effects added in post-production looks cheesy and cheap.  Aren't these guys famous for movies using blood squibs?  And how come the cussing has to be downplayed so much?  Some of the best lines of those classic action movies allow anything to be said, without giving a F about anything.<br /><br />The extras on the Blu-Ray release are similar to the ones found on the first film's home release.  There are documentaries and making offeatures.  Deleted scenes and gag reels show some footage that was left on the production floor:  some good (extended fight scenes for Couture, Crews, Lundgren, and Nan), and some bad (professional tennis player, Novak Djokovic, fights villains in the airport with a tennis racket... seriously).  There's digital copies available in the package too.<br /><br />All in all, the movie works, but goes a little overboard in it's final delivery.  Less is more, as proven by the unfairly underrated first movie.  The humor works, but when it's toned down, and allowed to breath more than being force-fed down the viewer's throat by aging action stars.  Let the film be filmed as R-rated from the beginning, and give fans what they want without going too far into the CGI department on the action scenes.  Less is more, especially for a movie that has as many action stars as this one.  I just hope The Expendables 3 takes the good from the first 2 movies, and shaves off the fat.
B0037QGS0K|4.0|Amanda Seyfried is one of the few actresses I have met in person, from her days on &#34;Veronica Mars&#34;. I liked her immediately, and now I try to collect all her movies and TV appearances I can. This is also a very watchable movie.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|An important message concerning those who may want to escape the current materialistic culture of today.  Beautiful scenery.  Interesting character studies.  Excellent acting.
B0053O8ARI|5.0|This is one of the funniest new sit-coms to come along in a long time - the whole cast works so well together you have to laugh!
B005GSY23M|5.0|I could not get &#34;Night Call&#34; on itunes without buying the whole album,<br />so I thought , what the heck.  Turns out the whole album is great!<br />Its got a lot of instrumentals titled by the scenes in the movie, like &#34;the beach&#34;,<br />&#34;he broke his hip&#34;, etc.  Also &#34;the deluxe version&#34; referring to Standard Gabriel and<br />referencing their conversation about her husband &#34;Standard&#34;.  Its worth it.<br />I really like the variety.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read this book before and it's amazing every time I read it. This is a great book. LOVE IT!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This game is one of the better games that I have found that are styled the way this one is. The story line is great and the levels are just difficult enough to make you not want to put down the game. I love that the game is based on a wonderful book. I would recommend this game to anyone!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Im not finished yet w/ book three. I am a big fan of the HBO series. So, I just had to get the books. After reading 1&2 I know just how wonderfully the hbo series has done it justice.sure their are things left out. However, I recomend reading the books to enhance the series.
B004ZGM76A|3.0|I had a DLP projector hooked up to my PS3 for watching bluerays.  I mainly bought this movie to watch some action on an 11 ft screen.  The movie came on time and as described.  If you haven't seen Sucker Punch I'd say it's worth watching maybe more than once or with friends.  It definitely wasn't what I was expecting after having had watched the trailers.  The first dream sequence in at the temple in the mountains is far by the best.  Worth watching once for sure.
0061122416|5.0|From the intro I knew this would be a great book. Perfect for someone trying to live out their full potential.
B004XQO90E|5.0|Movie showed up very promptly and as described.  This film plays to the stranger on a train dilemma with the additional mystery of who is the protagonist as well as who destroys the train.  Great movie.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app works great for me, can download and view mail very quickly.  Very happy I was able to make use of it.
B001YYQ9SS|3.0|The movie came on time and as described.  I would also say this movie is fairly hard to follow.  Having said that I have also played all of the game titles involved with Final Fantasy VII.  If you haven't this won't make any sense to you at all.  You might be able to get away with reading the plot lines on Wikipedia for FFVII, FFVII:DOC, and FFVII:CC.  Do not buy this without having some backstory, you'll have a bad time.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|no trouble installing it on my kindle fire. just started playing it a couple of days ago and already hooked.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Enjoyed learning about the prsidentsafter they left office and particularly about how they got along with one another (sharing advice as wells tasks) in contrast to their rivalries before elected to office. I would recommend it to anyone interested in politics and government.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|Great film; I use it when teaching a unit on the Holocaust with my students. Appropriate for middle-school on up.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I have used this app on both desktop and android and would rate it as &#34;functional, but nothing to write home about. Had to remove it from my phone, but that was because of RAM problems, not the app itself. It does have a few cool &#34;sister&#34; apps that are separate apps working in conjunction w/ it, but the app itself is about what you would expect. May very well work better on the Kindle hardware, but I don't see the point in purchasing a tablet when I have a smart phone, a laptop, and 2 desktops already. I personally prefer Adobe Digital Editions and the Nook apps (Barnes & Noble), but mostly just because I am more familiar, having used them both first, and I actually would rather have a paper book than any of them. If you need a decent reader app, this one is just as good as the next, so go ahead and try it out, just make sure to comparison shop.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|This is by far the release of The Terminator I have been waiting for. I held out on the previous blu ray release because I didn't hear anything good about the transfer quality. This movie has never looked or sounded this good. I know some people are upset over the fact that the original mono track isn't intact, but I love what's here. I believe these special features were put out with a previous release, however my dvd release didn't have them so I'm really enjoying those too. A nice interview with James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as some nice behind the scenes &#34;making of&#34; stuff. I couldn't be happier!
B005V2S7FW|3.0|I have been using the Lastpass free desktop app for almost a year now and love it. It's easy to install, easy to use, and well worth the little bit of time spent on loading it and setting it up. Having used it for that long, I wouldn't have a computer w/out it now! That's why their Android app surprised me so much. It downloaded and installed rather easily and connects w/ all the info in my computer browsers as well as my Lastpass home page, which was cool. However, I could not show a clear cut reason to have this on my phone, because you really can't tell whether it's running and protecting your phone or not. The desktop/laptop browser version is much more user friendly than the phone app, so imagine my surprise to find out that, although the PC browser version is free, the Android version comes as a trial app that you must pay for after the trial period is over. The Lastpass product in general is well worth having, but I couldn't find myself a reason to part w/ the money to keep the smart phone version. My advice would be to try it yourself and determine if it's worth keeping to you.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I just started playing this game. Love the game. But this particular edition so far, has been to simple. I like it when they make you think a little. No thinking involved. Maybe as the game progresses it will get tougher.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Very very good. The only book after GOT that has kept me not wanting to put it down and keeping me intrigued.<br />There are a few slow chapters but over all Kvothe keeps the readers interest high and you can't wait to see what he's up to next.
B001EA4M7M|5.0|I love this version, the simplicity of the production fits well with the time period of the story.  The actors all do a great job. This version is true to the book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great fun for all the family it can be quite addictive too. My youngest son loves the game especially moving everything around, would recommend this
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|What an enthralling game! I would like to say its relaxing but it gets pretty tense at times! Starting as a tiny mote in a big pond, the fight for survival gets harder and harder each level. The visuals are amazing and i would listen to the music alone if i could.<br />I got this game as a free app, can not believe how lucky i got!<br />I thought my 7 year old would not be able to handle it, but boy was i wrong! He quickly learned how to zoom around and the rules of the cosmos. Id like to think he is learning patience as well since this game is not something you can rush through.
6304119046|5.0|hands down one of the best films ever, really have to sit down and pay attention, i know how black and white movies can get boring
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I expected a teaser for a free app. But  i was not enticed to buy the full game after what i saw.<br />The game is very specific about which levels must be played in a certain order to find the needed items to move on. I found myself constantly backtracking. it was very one at a time.<br />I know my kindle screen is smaller, but quite a few items were not discernable no matter what you were looking at. I would use a clue or hint to find some last item and shocked since i would NEVER have seen what it showed it.<br />The mystery was kind of fun but all in all i was not enticed into buying the full version, nor would i want to try another of the seeking games they offered since im pretty sure its just a different flavor of the same thing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a really good book. Liked the story, I think it was well written. Made me think about true love.
B001HN694K|5.0|To say that this is a lavish production seems like a gross understatement. Pure eye candy from start to finish. And a terrific job from the actors, considering that most of the time they were working with green screen, green props, green suits, green everything! Don't expect this film to be a retelling of the cartoon. This one definitely breaks new ground in terms of plotting, and succeeds pretty well to boot.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Rarely does the movie equal the book, but the direction and cinematography were simply amazing.  Thrilling and thought provoking as well.  Be aware that there are graphic and disturbing scenes involving animals.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|I live in Pennsylvania, so this movie strikes rather close to home. It is of course non-stop action, with enough backstory for the two main characters to keep them interesting. The unfortunate thing about such movies as this that depend on keeping the audience on the edge of their seats is that there's really nothing to watch it twice for. You already know how it ends. Hence, I would recommend renting rather than buying this film.
B004SBX112|5.0|I have this on My IPad and my Ipod Also. I play it just about every day on one or more of my devices.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe is great series. I have really enjoyed it. So much reality stuff on these days, it hard to see a really good series.<br />Also after all the other stuff you don't want to watch, its too late to watch the good stuff.  Thanks to Amazon Instant Video and Prime, otherwise I would have never watched it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have this program on my Ipod and Ipad and play it just about evry day on one of my Devices.
B003L77GRO|5.0|You can never go wrong with Dexter because Dexter never disappoints.  The intensity, the acting the plot, the suspense...What more can I say but awesome!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Great album by Maroon 5. A lot of different themed songs yet all tied together nicely. I Love the songs.
0345457692|4.0|Altered Carbon is science fiction to leave civility itself.  It is an espionage thriller about virtually a police investigator.  He is an introspective, concerned person who travels through space and himself.  A fascinating narrative of various descriptions that captures many places and people, Altered Carbon is an exciting, imaginative experience.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it. it shows how much work you have to put in to a horse. and how much time it takes with a horse
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is very addicting just wish that there was a way to get peanuts..<br />Love the graphics. Don't regret getting this game just wish there were other ways of earning peanuts.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I enjoy solitaire and the game was ok -- but I definately did not like the adds that were shown between the games.  There was possibly a way to turn the adds off, but it wasn't worth the trouble.  I canceled the game.
B003K15IF8|2.0|This is not a new book and obviously is a book many have read and enjoyed.  I can only say one thing:  depressing.  There was not one high point in the entire book.  Once I start a book, I always finish.  Perhaps this is reality but I can get that by reading the newspaper.  A commentary on a very sad, pathetic group of people.  I wanted to do something to make any one of them even smile!  I just can't recommend this unless you truly enjoy depressing books.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|This movie was a mystery, thriller and suspense with great twists. Denzel was amazing, along with the story line that flowed smoothly.
B001NLKT60|5.0|It took me longer than most people I know to read this &#34;Girl&#34; trilogy and I'm not sure what took me so long.  Like &#34;Dragon Tatoo&#34;, the story is unpredictable.  As soon as you think nothing more can happen, it does!  The characters continue to develop and I found that I got to know them even better by the end of the book.  I did have to read this book a bit more carefully than I might have others because the plot did get a bit involved.  The only problem I have with this and Larsson's other books is the Scandanavian places, names.  They don't exactly roll off my tongue and they can be a distraction.  But that is the very least.<br /><br />I would recommend this book completely but only after you read &#34;The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo&#34;.  Reading this &#34;Fire&#34; first would not do it justice especially along character lines.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well acted, well written, and though you would expect predictability, I found it to be full of twists and turns.  Great villians, and wonderful people of honor and conscience.  I highly recommend watching from Season 1.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is very adective please try this game you will like it thanks for the game you can see the game you can see the game you can see the game you can see the game
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I don't have the game but it looks fun it should be free all I have big time gangster but that is better.then big time gangster
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this story was amazing ,but I thought the first was the best book in the whole series and can't wait to see the movie the way that she explains the part with her kids it makes me want to cry
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Restaurant Story is a great game.  Not only do you get the opportunity to buy and sell delicious food, you also get to decorate, design and achieve goals.  It's a game for all ages. I'm very much a grown adult and simply love this game. I buy gems weekly. I'm in my Restaurant pretty much all day. Please feel free to add me.  PrincessInc

B006OCM0G0|5.0|Most people say that this app requires money or has ads, but it doesn't. You have the option to use money. But the game is super fun even without the gems that cost money. But I haven't seen one ad. If you need a neighbor, my name us crazyei8hts4. Have fun
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|sam and dean winchester ! i love it! and the best actors ever jared and jensen really step into the shoes of their character!  , expect for the demonic-psychic-supernatural part, it iis amazing to see how those brothers are fighting to save their family THING!!!!!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Definitely a page turner...can be redundant at times but there's a lot of build up in each chapter leading up to the conclusion.  Keeps you guessing every chapter.
B0023S50DO|3.0|It was entertaining, but I am glad I didn't see it at the theater, not worth the money there. Not bad.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Just love watching these guys. Great twists through out the show! And their lines are so good; some times they are hilarious.

0316228532|4.0|there were lots of unexpected moments in this book.  a lot of back and forth storytelling between characters. i had much higher hopes for this book in the beginning but by the time i turned the last page i was happy i read the book. The farther you get in the book the better it is by the time i turned the last page i was sad to see the end.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|And you don't get more lost than Rodriguez, the Detroit bard whose brief early-70s career never went anywhere. But this CD (it was a record then) is strong throughout, with several tracks that should have been on AOR rotation for the past 45 years but have not been. &#34;Sugar Man&#34; is the best of the lot, but &#34;Forget It&#34;, &#34;Inner City Blues&#34;, &#34;I Wonder&#34; and &#34;RIch Folks Hoax&#34; are all pretty good too. Like you (probably) I saw the documentary &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; and was intrigued, but the CD really underscores the story in a big way. This disc has been on heavy rotation in my own sound system since I got it on Amazon (I also have the second CD, &#34;Coming from Reality&#34; - can't say it gives me the same pleasure that this one does.)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I want sure what to expect in this book + found it to be a good solid read. At times I had a hard time putting it down. Very disturbing in parts yet the author handled difficult subject matter with care. Definitely would recommend!
B002WV5A9G|1.0|I was curious to see this based on the news that JJ Abrams (Felicity/Lost) was going to direct the next Star Wars movie. I was angry by the time the first sequence was over. If you want every bad comic book cliche glued together by lens flares, then kill yourself. How? Just take a sip every time a superfluous lens flare obscures the lack of character development on the screen. It doesn't even have to be an alcoholic beverage, Felicity Bitch relies so heavily on this Kai's Power Tools-era visual schlock that a sip of water for every lens flare gimmick would cause your stomach to burst by the second act.
B009K6DKTS|4.0|An excellent book from Nassim again. After Fooled by Randomness and Black Swan, this book gives practical insights how to tackel problems generated by Randomness and Black Swan events. Nassim's conversationalist writing style makes the book fun read without twisting the mind too much although the concepts presented in the book are both technical as well universal.

B0064MGU98|4.0|So many network shows are just a vehicle for hack actors with movie good looks in fashionable clothes. The story is just a showcase for them in different outfits and settings, with see-through thin writing that is little more than a narrative fig leaf and can barely even keep the plot together. This has increasingly been the state of network TV since the advent of cheap-to-make reality TV and premium-quality cable shows. You get used to watching TV with half your brain off, wincing at the particularly clumsy spots, or not watching at all, because let's face it: missing an episode or five makes no difference.<br /><br />Then one day you encounter The Good Wife, a network show cut from entirely different cloth. The quality of the writing is high and consistent, to the point that you find yourself being drawn into the story; the characters are real and don't reverse themselves inexplicably just to create &#34;drama&#34;; the situations are relevant and pertinent to real contemporary life, not some farcical pastiche of whatever is in the headlines that week that checks some ill-conceived box for &#34;current.&#34; It's like a throwback to a bygone era of quality scripted television, except that it has evolved and speaks in the language, issues, and narrative tropes of the (actual) current day.<br /><br />So you go back and find its previous seasons on Amazon digital, and say, &#34;Eh, why not? Even if it's kind of messy and still finding its feet in the first season it can't be any worse than what other shows consider their A-game.&#34; And what a surprise when from the pilot it emerges whole, coherent, compelling. The story threads are expertly well-balanced, and the actors' performances are right on the mark. What a find!<br /><br />So why four stars rather than five? I reserve five stars for stuff that changes the face of its medium, like The Wire or Mad Men. Maybe it's not fair to compare cable shows that have basically no thematic or language restrictions, againsta network show that does. So if I was rating it against other network shows only, I'd give it five stars. Highly recommended.
0786838655|5.0|This was dictated to me by my 10 year old son after he read this book (in one day...because he couldn't put it down): \\"This is about a boy, Percy, who lives in the modern world who was supposed to be the son of a mortal woman and of Poseidon, the god of the sea.  Hades and Zeus separately both try to kill him, and the boy has to go to the underworld in an attempt to capture the master lightening bolt of Zeus.  I learned that sometimes even strength has to bow to wisdom.  This is perfect for children around my age (10) who love to read books full of adventure.\\"

B0070Y46UY|4.0|I saw the leader for the movie, and had to read the book first.  Now I no longer need to go to that movie! The author painted wonderful pictures, showed great humor in places, and philosophized with the best.  I wondered how he would keep the interest up with the plot he devised, but he did, and I read it in a very short period of time, not because I dashed through it, but because I couldn't put it down!
B0015DROBO|5.0|This well-written book is a page turner.  The mystery and intrigue kept me up at night, thinking I would just read to the end of the chapter, then just start the next...
073933705X|2.0|I am using this in my classroom and I am disappointed in the product because it skips often and the students are missing a few words oreven a whole sentence while listening to the cd of the story.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I can't put into words how moving this story is for me. I want more the second I leave that world. I want to know the details of the characters and their families....what happened during the 20 years...this for me is why reading is better than watching a movie. In the movie all you see is what the makers see...in this or any well written book you get to team up with the writer, mingle your imaginations together from anywhere, hundreds even thousands of miles apart with no knowledge of each other you create the sights, sounds tastes and smells of what their mind created. MS Collins what an amazing place you and I created. Thank you for sharing this story with the world.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Excellent graphics and effects, using all the technology available today to make the movie interesting and keeping you on the edge of your seat!  Noomi RaPace did an excellent job!

I am 56 and absolutely adored this book!<br />These are written for a teenage crowd, but they are for everyone.<br />All three books are such a treat.<br />So well written.<br />Many sequels are disappointing, but this one leaves you wanting more, more, more.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I really enjoyed this book at first - I couldn't put it down.  When I got to the 3rd part of the book I started to realize how it was going to end.  I was so disappointed with the ending.  I would not waste my time reading it...

0143122010|5.0|Book report: The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, by Steven Pinker<br /><br />This book makes the unbelievable claim that violence has declined in the world and that we are, in fact, living in the least violent time in human history. What?! Is he crazy? Come on, pal! Watch the news for an hour - with school shootings and terrorists and serial killers and abusive boyfriends - and then tell me what you think!<br /><br />And that's actually one of the issues he talks about. What we see on the news is the unusual, the uncommon, the unlikely. If you look at the statistics - and believe me, he looks at the statistics - by practically every measure of violence, there is a steady downward trend in time. A couple hundred years ago, you were 30 times as likely to be murdered - yeah, murdered - as you are today.<br /><br />One of the very interesting things he does is to talk about some of the kinds of violence that used to be very common, but that we almost never see any more. Flogging. Public executions. Dueling. Slavery. Debtors' prison. Human sacrifice. Torture. Witch burning. Infanticide. Vivisection. Corporal punishment. Bear-baiting. Cat burning. All of these kinds of violence and more that used to be everyday occurrences have just gone away.<br /><br />He also talks about violence on the large scale: wars and genocides. I know what you're thinking: World War 2 and the Holocaust. Strangely, these aren't the worst human catastrophes that have ever happened in history, and especially not if you go by the world population at the time of occurrence. It turns out that the occurrence of wars follows what is mathematically called a power law: the worse the war, the more unlikely it is. This is good news: it means that terrible wars like WW1 and WW2 are extremely unlikely. Also, it turns out that there is no evidence that war is periodic. This is also good news. For a long time, people thought that wars every generation or so were inevitable, to blow off steam or something. That's not true. World War 3, originally scheduled for 1964, never happened, and still hasn't.<br /><br />This is both a hard book to read, and an easy book to read. It's hard to read because it's very long (832 pages in paperback), and because it necessarily has a lot of discussion of violence of all kinds. I had to put it aside at various points because it got to be too much to take in. On the other hand, it's easy to read because the bottom line is a collection of good news, plus he's a terrific writer, very clever and witty and laugh-out-loud funny in spots. And he goes into many different aspects - psychological, religious, historical, medical, political, literary, statistical, military, philosophical, cultural, scientific - of the subject. There's something for everybody here.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting parts of the book are the reasons WHY all this violence has been going down. One major reason is the transition thousands of years ago from hunting societies to village/town/city societies: people have to act much better to each other in such close situations. Another reason is the rise of competent governments and police forces: if governments do their job with any kind of fairness, people also tend to treat each other better.<br /><br />But perhaps the most fascinating reason, and the largest contributor to all the most recent decreases in violence, has to do with methods of communication, starting with the invention of the printing press around 1500. By making it possible for people to read about - and experience at second-hand - the lives and challenges of other people, even fictional people, such communication helps us to sympathize with others, and makes violence repugnant to us. One example is the effect that Uncle Tom's Cabin had on slavery in the US, for example.<br /><br />This process continues, and increases, with each new form of communication that comes along. With the telegraph, people could get news from distantplaces very quickly, and feel concern about disasters affecting people half a world away. Same with radio and movies beginning in the 20s and 30s. TV, starting in the 50s and 60s, has been an immense influence. It's one thing to hear about racial intolerance or war in a detached way: it's something else to see fire hoses turned on peaceful demonstrators or soldiers being shot at live on TV. The Internet has accelerated this even further. We now receive, instantaneously, news from everywhere on earth. As we do, violence in any form becomes less and less tolerable.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that, the more people are aware of violence or injustice, the more they are against it. People mostly identify with the victims of violence and injustice, rarely with the perpetrators. It seems like this is some fundamental part of the way humans are wired, part of our brains. If so, it's certainly a hopeful fact, and may be what ultimately saves us from doing ourselves in.<br /><br />I can't help but pass along some of the interesting facts he points out. For example, terrorism against civilians has NEVER achieved its stated goals. Never. Not once. So, whatever terrorists are getting out of what they do, it's not success.<br /><br />Here's another: Why is eating peas with your knife against etiquette? Well, hundreds of years ago, everyone carried daggers. Not surprisingly, there were lots of knife fights, stabbings, and murders by dagger. Shakespeare is full of them. Then a book of etiquette came out that suggested that hosts should provide knives at the dinner table, and guests should leave their daggers home. It became uncouth to do anything with a knife except cut food. Knifings and murders plummeted. (Turns out daggers DO kill people.)<br /><br />And another: We have an innate brain mechanism for self-control. But it can become fatigued if we need to exercise it too much. Like, a day of using self-control at work can leave us grouchy at night. But we can also practice self-control in order to increase our capacity.<br /><br />And this: American counties that lie along coasts or waterways are more liberal.<br /><br />And this final gem: No two countries with a McDonald's have ever gone to war.<br /><br />Astonishingly, this book helps us to answer some of the Big Questions in life. For example, is the world getting better, worse, or staying the same? Well, as far as violence goes, it's getting better all the time.<br /><br />How about: are people inherently good, evil, or neutral? If you think of the human mind as a machine, we all definitely have the circuitry to do evil to our fellow humans in the \\"right\\" circumstances. However, we also have the circuitry to appreciate the suffering of our fellow humans, as well as to forgive wrongs in order to end cycles of revenge. I think the combination of the two goods outweighs the one evil.<br /><br />Finally, are we done yet? No. Clearly, there is still violence in the world, from the suffering of one person to the suffering of millions. But the good news is that the evidence shows that we really can make a difference in reducing violence. It's not something we have to simply endure forever.<br /><br />Reading this book was good for me, because it helps me to put what I see in the world in perspective. When I hear about the terrible things that people do to each other, I still feel horror and sympathy, but I don't have to think that it's evidence that the world is getting worse. I know it isn't.

B008EQGKII|5.0|I built this with an I7 and 16gigs of memory. It can hold 2 hard drives inside and a laptop sized usb optical drive. the front opens with 2 doors that expose the drive on the top and the bottom has 2 usb 2 ports and a mic, headphone i/o. the power button is also on the front and always available without the opening of the doors. I built this easily and it is really a nice design. I like how the top easily slides off and you can have easy access. I bout two usb 3 drive cases and put my old hard drives in them...One plugged in Hot ok, when I plugged the 2nd one in...the board died....beware...thee ports are suppose to be secure...but?? I dont know if the case electronics for the drive is bad at this point or I had a defective main board...but tomorrow I get to try again to reload my windows 7 onto the new shuttle computer on a c drive that I had to reformat...as win 7 saw that there was a different mother board...I hope I dont have to deal with issues of licensing my win 7 to this replacement case and board...shuttle makes an even smaller case than this one....it appears to be the smallest I3,5,7 cases and board to be found.<br /><br />UPDATE; I have had this up and running for several months now and it runs quiet and fairly cool for the 65 watt processor that I am running. You can also use the 45 watt with even less heat. But mine runs cooler than a laptop.<br />When I got the replacement machine, I had no problems with Win 7 64bit loading but did have to wipe the c drive clean and start from scratch. I would buy another and feel the first issue was with the cheap external drive case I used for my old smaller hard drives that was a USB 3 type interface. I think next time I would use the lowest wattage consumption I7 processor that burns about 45 watts. This company may also have a new similar variation of this case available by now July 2013, but I have not checked...it was slated to have just some different port i/o arrangements. Also, on the main board there are some extra I/O headers and micro card slots. I was going to use one of these for a fire wire 1394 out that is available, for some recording hardware I have but it would have been a bit of work to get the attached cord receptacle out from the inside of the case and I did not want to modify the case if I had some trouble and had to return the machine.

B00BEZTMFY|1.0|As an aficionado of the book, (I have read it 7 times over the years) I feel the book is lost in this jumble of &#34;hollywood fill&#34;.  The original story line is not accurately followed and plenty of hollywood fantasy &#34;fill&#34; is added to stretch the movie to its current length.  As a result it has become a &#34;kiddie movie&#34; instead of the much darker but child friendly book.  As you watch the scene with the 3 trolls ask youself &#34;doesn't this remind me of the Three Stooges&#34;? One troll even sounds like Curly Joe.  As a result, instead of the menacing trolls of the book you get a comedy routine. And by the way, the dwarves &#34;never fought the trolls in the book, they were captured and bagged by them.&#34; The mountain goblin encounter is completely animated adding to the cartoon feel of the whole film.  &#34;Radagast the Brown&#34; is not even a part of the original book and is just another corny attempt at comedy that has been added to stretch the movie to feature length, and indeed, the original story into 3 movies when it could have easily been done in one, three hour film.  Regarding any &#34;extended version&#34; I will pass, as it is bound to offer more hollywood nonsense. Its a real shame that Peter Jackson sold out for the money that 3 below average films would generate verses just one great film. So if you don't read books and only watch movies then this film is for you. If you do read and have read the book then this movie will be a disappoinment, since good old Pete has trashed the original book.  At least Jackson did a great job on the Lord of the Rings.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|It could have been a little longer and with a more interesting plot in the making of PSYCHO....... surely Hitch had more to offer than &#34;Good Evening&#34; it is purely for fans of Hitch and those historically bound to film history<br />FOUR STARS BECAUSE Anthony Hopkins IS FANTASTIC
B009FZFONO|5.0|The HD quality is great off Amazon.  Watching videos off of Amazon is overall pretty good, but it does freeze now and then.  Even with the high speed connection I have.<br /><br />This show is very well written and creates a lot of tension that is great to follow.  It is also very thought provoking.  Very interesting to think about how people would actual react if faced with an &#34;end of the world&#34; scenario.  Amazing that people pry on each other when faced with such a dire situation like the &#34;walkers&#34;.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It was working perfectly when I had downloaded it on my kindle fire, but now the game crashes whenever i try and open the app..
B000ICRKLM|4.0|The show is good overall.  If you've watched SG1 this will fit in nicely.  5 seasons was probably right, but too bad they probably couldn't end it the way they wanted it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Don't always enjoy books by Baldacci but this one really kept my interest. I would recommend it as a great read.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I had seen the movie first. Working on the premise that books are always better than the movie, and I loved the movie, I was disappointed in the book . It was just ok. Looking back, had I not seen the movie, I still think the book would have been just ok. That's goodness for screen writers
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|I was very disappointed in this movie I thought it would have been better. But who am I I wish I had rented it first before I bought iy.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I absolutely love this show and it was so nice to be able to watch episode after episode with no commercials! I am so glad that I ordered this DVD collection of the whole season! BUT, I have to say that the quality of the DVD's were a little disappointing. It was crisp and sharp but the DVD'd would skip and freeze at some points and it was very upsetting. The second time I watched the DVD's they froze up so badly that I could not even continue to watch them and these were supposed to be brand new!! Not sure what the problem is but I was not happy!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The acting was very good but the story was even better.  I love a show that has some twist at the end.

B00BESLHEA|4.0|If you liked the goriness and action of Kill Bill and feel like watching some classic &#34;really-absurd-absolutely-no-way-you-could-ever-pull-that-off-in-real-life kunfu/karate/generic asian martial arts moves&#34; then watch this. No, the plot isn't deep or even really worth mentioning. The plot and everything else takes a background stance. It's all about the Cliches and the ridiculous gravity/reality defying martial arts, and the gore. People knocking other people's heads off with a single karate kick- check. People getting their throats ripped out literally- check. Cliches- oh boy: Chinese and Cowboys- check, black man who was a slave- of course he was a slave, wrongly accused- yep, you killed/took X from me so now I want revenge- check, second in command betrays leader- check, the black widow, defeated but then reaches inside to find inner strength and empower your true Chi-................ duh. In fact I don't think there is a single thing in this movie that ISN'T a cliche, but in a good way. And the hair. The ridiculous rock star hair- oh yes! All in all a fun ridiculous, violent Kung Fu romp.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome storyline. Make me want to learn hoe to use the sword! Down with the GOVERNOR! Kill him then burn him!

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Easy to see why this movie earned as many awards as it did. The acting was mostly believable, worth watching.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Easy to read and enjoyable.  The only problem I have is the whole Eagles theme...I'm a Cowboys fan!  haha.  Other than that, this is a great book.

Its faster than a dual core i5 but you don't notice the difference until multiple apps are running concurrently in their own windows.  Not the fastest but it's a great processor at the current price point.  Windows rates it a 7.6 out of 7.9.  I would buy another one.

0486237664|5.0|I'm a relief printmaker, and I bought this book intending to use it a basic resource for inspiration. The pictures are sometimes limited in their use, especially if you intend to use them as they are. However, if you use them with some imagination, and redraw them, etc, they can be invaluable--not everyone has access to giraffes, or dogs, or cats, or bats, or birds, or whales. To use this book with imagination is the key. It  is a resource.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The third season continues to be intriguing, well scripted and great acting.  Of course love the whole feel of the show and watching the costumes slowly change as time moves on into the 1920's.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I'd like a movie of this story released on a yearly basis, at least until the actors match my imagination.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a well written, well casted and well costumed show.  The writers bring you right into Downton Abby as if you were there. You feel a part of it.  The Abbey itself is beautiful and beautifully appointed.  The detail is extraordinary.  I think this series gives you more than a glimpse into the lives of both gentry and the servants. It is always so interesting to see the heirarchy in the servants area and how strict they are.
B000V63C4Y|4.0|I love the sound of the sixties, did'nt know Stan Getz had something in common w / Antonio Carlos Jobim. I was iooking at the jacketcover of a twist of Jobim, and and Antonio metioned some good thoughts about Stan Getz and His style of music.

B008JIFJ4W|5.0|can't beat the price! I love Passion Pit! Sometime I just download songs and albums that I want because they are so expensive to buy and I really hate to rip off some of my favorite artists this way, but with this price, I don't mind! Its a win-win situation!
076115728X|5.0|This book is a great way to help teach young children that it is okay to make mistakes and also use it as an opportunity to turn it into something creative and beautiful!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|DVDs arrived safely and thoroughly enjoying them.  Great set for my collection.  Fun to rewatch and catch new things you missed first time around.
0763619612|5.0|I love this author!  Peter Reynolds has a great way of writing stories about art that help encourage children's creativity and love of art.  It is a great way to foster a love of creating art in young children.  Peter Reynolds also helps to teach children through his stories to have confidence in their ability to create.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder should be read by all children. ....and adults. Mr Tishman is a role model for all administrators. Highly recommend.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It's ok ,very extensive and lots of words I didn't know about. Thank you for making this book because it has been a good idea that you came u with this book.
B00B7G3NFU|1.0|The Sessions started out chronicling a funny personable guy who happened to be quadriplegic.  It turned creepy when Helen Hunt hired on as his sex surrogate.  Went downhill fast.<br />A waste of $3.99.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|DAvid Mitchell is clever, original and a beautiful writer<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a challenge<br /><br />I read it before and after I saw the film
B00B04NJI0|1.0|I agree with everyone here - artsy grad school crap.  F, O , L, P . . . Actually, A -through Z was just dumb.  Not one piece of horror was in this movie.  This movie was trying to be too artsy and missed any point of horror in the movie.  I'm glad they were short because I could not sit through several of these segments, if there were any longer.  To be honest, I can't remember the last time anyone made a good horror movie.  I should have known better since this is essentially a foreign film.
0670026182|4.0|I like the spirit of the book and the receipes look yummy and easy to replicate.<br />The edition coould however be improved, chosen font type, color and size make it difficult to read in the kitchen... (i don't wear glasses)
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I play this game all the time and it is great.  They keep adding new boards an new themes with each release.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Highly recommended. I will certainly read it over again when all of the books are out. Great work of fiction.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Loved it came out with update<br /><br />Need to buy the only only real app<br />Asome  game<br />$$=)<br /><br />Asome for my kids
B00AHXIC50|5.0|this is a great album.  This music feels more grown up than his pervious music, although those songs were good also.
B001KR9AP8|5.0|I got this due to the deal and that i liked a couple of songs on it but after listening to the whole album i was extremely pleased and happy with it and that i got it.  i would tell anybody to get it if they like her music ! i have been playing it over and over it doesn't get me tired of hearing it either...
B008WHQZJI|5.0|gret music that feels more like eary PSB.  This album has a lot of the same tones and feels of the early stuff....
0525952926|3.0|The history is interesting, but it is a subplot when it should take centerstage.  Much like the first book in this Trilogy, Follet spends too much time on romance and too little time substance and detail.  Even worse his characters and their relationships are simply reincarnations of the first novel.  I would like to see Follet return to more detailed history like he displayed in Pillars.  All that being said, it is entertaining enough if your expectations aren't to high.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|The animation, sound and characters were all great - even if the ending and story arc were a little too predictable. A very enjoyable film nonetheless.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Dave Grohl tells a love story about the place where platinum records where made: a dirty, seemingly forgotten complex of buildings in the Valley called Sound City. For people of a certain age, when records are named that were made here, it's a veritable who's who to the soundtrack of your life. And, unfortunately, a sign of the times. Rock!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Got hooked on Reacher novels & stayed that way - always looking forward to the next one. Exciting, interesting & very readable.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Show is as good if not better with the Digital remastered versions, as any current show today. Stories were great, you can watch them many times without ever hating them.
B00AEBB8NI|5.0|Keeps you wondering all the way to the end. I have told my friends to make sure they get this movie.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The previous version of the kindle app on my phone worked like a charm. This new version does not receive  the books I purchase and I cant even send them to my phone from my account management.
1419702238|5.0|I bought this book for my grandson.  He loves the Wimpy Kid books.  I decided to go with a used book and I was not disappointed.  The price was great and the book was in almost new condition.  I received it within the time frame that I was promised, so everything was good.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of my favorite books!  I love the way Garth uses the dogs point of view.  I just couldn't put it down.  I have recommended this to everyone I know that loves dogs..and even those just looking for something good to read.  I even got it on audio so I could listen to is on my commute!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cant add anything to whats already been said a thousand times....the best show on TV. I hope there are many more seasons.
B004MMFBQU|1.0|I was very excited to offer this cute kitchen to my 3-year old for her birthday - total bummer! The stove top was bent quite a bit and after only 2 screws, nothing ligned up. I was afraid of breaking it and just returned that cheap particle board toy. Totally disappointed, absolutely not worth the price!!!<br />It is very said because the design is one of the cutest ones I like from what's out there but the quality, forget about it! Get the Ikea kitchen! It is less chic, but made out of durable birch wood, has more doors, is way more functional and adapted for little children who usually play roughly and is bigger. I see still a 7-year old play with it! Really, don't bother with this one! I would have given it ZERO stars, but amazon doesn't offer that option!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a book from the &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34; series by Flynn. I am slowly wading through this authors collection and the &#34;Rapp&#34; novels are excellent.
B00BN4URSW|4.0|The story line was different and both Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox did excellent acting.You can always count on good acting from those 2.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book although Katniss isn't my favorite character, this is an amazing trilogy! You will be surprised when you read this book!<br />(^.^)/
B00B2064IY|4.0|If you want Jimi at his best listen to his live stuff. This is nice because some of it new studio stuff, but nothing major. If you collect Hendrix's music this should be added to it.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|Ok movie, follows the standard formula.  The kids liked it but certainly not their favorite.  Worth a rental at least.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|For all you people that have problems with disappearing credits and skill points and what not, it is because your internet connection is not up to par with what the server expected. I suggest people that have credit and skill point disappearances to quit and return to home screen(with your stats and everything) every 2~3 match's. Your credits and skill points will most likely stay.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Game this is an amazing experience I love how you can counteracts with your Facebook friends. Never did I thinkitnwouldnbe songood
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|I like that fact that it was a silence film but it did seem so, while when watched, excellent excellent
B009Z5975A|5.0|This is a review for the Bluray disk. For anyone who loved any of these movies, the quality of the transfer is almost perfect. You have an occasional scene that is not that great but even the original film look crappy at that same point. So worth it. I mly really wanted Goonies and Gremlins 1, think of part 2 as a bonus. My son liked 2 better so glad I got this 3 movie set.
B000056TKD|4.0|I love the music, but why they decided to combine these two unrelated pieces of music I don't know.  Also, I had an LP of the Holst with this same cover art, and I loved looking at it and reading the liner notes while the music played.  This CD is not as good.  Off-setting the art they way they did, especially on a small CD cover, detracted from the appeal.  And though I like &#34;Thus Spaketh Zarastrutha&#34; too, I wouldn't have bought a CD of it by itself.  But the Holst is lovely and the recording is great.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|Love Ben as a Director but this movie is overrated. I loved the Town and am looking forward to more great movies from Him. But my advise wait for this one on Netflix or Amazon Prime IV. The movie is done well, it's just boring at times. Its the type of movie that is worth watching when there is nothing else on TV.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|A real classic.  My kids loved it, especially the nine year old.  The video was in great shape, played perfectly, and arrived promptly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app. I love horses and I have always wanted one and now I have on a virtual one this game is awesome
B000MR1V22|5.0|In you're into indie films at all, this is a must see! Steve Carell is in an unusual role and gives an amazing performance.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|The movie had a lot more cussing in it. I think that it could have been just as funny without the liberal us of the F word. Wouldn't recommed for teens.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|This may well be my favorite Bon Jovi album in a long time.. Whats left of me fits my life to a t..
B003EI2EH2|3.0|Tim Ferris is a good writer. I might recommend this book based solely on its entertainment value. However, if you are looking to become superhuman be forewarned, this book is far from a magic bullet. Ferris has some great bio-hacking tips that will undoubtedly help you in your goals, but will also help you feel the need to spend enormous amounts of money. I got the book and was excited to read the section on quick muscle gain. There is some great advice that is easy to follow, and I have lost weight and gained strength by modifying my diet and exercise routine, but my results are nowhere near Ferris's fantastic claims for the simple reason that I don't have the thousands of dollars necessary to buy the special equipment and huge amounts of food necessary to follow his advice to the letter.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are rich, get out your checkbook, buy everything he tells you and follow his advice. Then let me know how it worked for you. If you're like me and have very limited resources, you can read the book for fun and probably see some positive results, just don't be disappointed when you find yourself unable to even attempt most of what he asks you to do.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|First two seasons were good - third is great.  Better writting, better graphics, better story.  You feel for the characters - some make it and some don't - but thats what is expected of a show that keeps you guessing.
B004EPZ034|5.0|I have the other 2 and this one is a MAJOR hit!!! I loved it and there's just something about chipmunks singing popular music with those chipmunk voices :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I knew it would be really sad, it is about children with cancer after all, but it's also beautiful.
1609611543|5.0|I always loved bread but after reading this book I may never eat it again. I am just starting the journey to losing my &#34;Wheat Belly&#34;. I hope I can stick with it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS Season 10 starts off with a blast (pun intended). My favorite episode so far has been &#34;Canary.&#34; Where the old schoolers pull one over on the second most wanted cyber terrorist. Video and sound quality are excellent from Amazon, and with computer problems lately, It's been really nice to be able to catch up on one of my favorite shows using my Kindle. Amazon streaming works so much better than CBS.com.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|Akinator is a sore loser.  I stumpted Akinator twice and both times I could not enter my person to register my win.  Other than that, it is a fun game.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|One of the best rock n roll albums ever produced by an American band. Six more words. Six more words.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connolley's books are always entertaining.  I just wish my device allowed me to pass ir on to other people who I know would love it.
B006R1T40I|3.0|There's nothing on here that's going to make it onto my iPod. Sorry, Bonnie. BTW, do you need any groupies?
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Very heart warming movie for anyone who has had a dog and they passed away. I cried through the movie, in fact even my hubby had tears in his eyes.<br />We owned an Akita just like Hachi and it was so true to what the breed is all about.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Love, love, love this version.  So beautifully done and acted.  I was very moved watching this film.  One to enjoy.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Excellent read if you enjoy reading about people of Character. Causes you to reflect on life, relationship and faith. Enjoy!
B005VPRFSY|4.0|Lego Star Wars was a toy my son lost in a house fire. He bought this using gift cards. He loves it. Product was shipped quickly, arriving before promised date.
B000PY6BBI|4.0|Great movie.  Quality was not really what we're used to, and it is an older movie.  But nevertheless, it was a great movie.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Sparks never fails to entrance.  love to see this made into a movie.  Such tender emotions for a man to express.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is so amazing. I can't even describe what I felt. It's like, seeing the world from a different point of view. Charlie reminds me of me sometimes. It's quite surprising to see the maturity of this novel. It shows things that actually happen in high school, not the sugarcoated crap other authors do.  I cannot believe how much I cried. I don't cry in books. This is a first. It deserves 5 stars.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Clements succeeds in drawing the reader into the mind of Tom as he experiences both everyday life and exciting adventure --
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the Hunger Games so much. They are my favorite books. This book I will have to say be the best out of the three. The plot is amazing. I actually cried at the end. I have read this book 5 times and each time I ball my eyes out. Suzanne Collins please, I beg of you, write another hunger games book. An idea would to maybe write about other games from the victors point  of view. We all love you with all of our hearts! I just want to let you know that you have so much talent. I have also read the Overlander cronicals and I have to let you know that all of your writing is worshipped. I love you with all my heart and soul and hope you write more!<br /><br />Love, your biggest fan from Indiana
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I enjoy the set very much<br />the set gives me the complete set which I have been looking for thanks
B00650SSDU|5.0|I have seen this movie several times! It is a funny romantic comedy! If you like these kinds of movie, u will like this one!!
B003TTMFCK|5.0|I watch episode after episode and can never get enough of this show. I feel like I personally know these people.I just hope they keep on producing more seasons. Wonderfully written scripts. I give this a totally thumbs up review.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have to read the book before I see the movie. The book was awesome. Mr. Sparks has gotten to me with all his books and this one is no exception. It was wonderful and I recommend it highly.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This series became even more interesting for me when I saw that one of the writers is Kurt Sutter.  I watch &#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34; and could see a hint of his work here.  Excellent!  I didn't see it when it was on TV, and am so glad I found it now.  This makes for great winter marathon viewing.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Often when a movie is made of a really great book something is missed.  Not so  with this one.  It's a great movie, and be ready for the ending.
1451650728|1.0|Based on all of the glowing reviews, I bought all 3 \\"Cold Equations\\" books by this unknown author.<br /><br />I read half of the first one and was so repulsed by the pompous writing style, that I packed all of the books up and returned them to Amazon for a refund.<br /><br />Will never read anything by this author again.<br /><br />If you liked them, good for you.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|The action begins slowly but it continues and continues and when you get to the climax you want to yell and say &#34;wait, that old b------ shouldn't get his way.  Great book...Great movie...great ending.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I didn't read the book, but both my wife and daughter who did marveled at how what they had pictured in their minds as reading jumped on to the screen.<br /><br />I was amazed at how a story so tragic at its heart could be turned into such an amazing viewing (and reading I'm told) experience.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed this show, although I wouldn't recommend it for young children as it was intense in some scenes.  It really opened up the dialog between us after the movie was over on what the theme of the movie really was in each of our own's opinions. The scenes were beautifully done and the acting was superb.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I purchased this case when I upgraded my Kindle to the new Paperwhite model.<br /><br />My primary concern with Kindle accessories, since I carry the Kindle with me everywhere and since I have problems with my wrists, is always the weight. I chose this case because I had positive experience with other Belkin cases, and knew that their cases are generally the lightest available.<br /><br />This case is no exception. My Kindle Paperwhite, even in its case, is still lighter than the Kindle 3 I used to work with.<br /><br />I haven't yet put it to the test by dropping my Kindle or similar incidents, since obviously I won't be doing that deliberately just to find out. I am a little concerned at the soft sides of the case, and worry that it may not protect my Kindle as well as the previous Belkin cases I have used - but I could be entirely wrong, because the sides, while not rigid, are well-padded.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Always helps me sleep and calm down. I have never had a better app that uses dream auras and meditation auras.
B009K0P10K|4.0|This is a fun, active drama that keeps you guessing from one week to the next. I like that the story line keeps on task and just gets more interesting.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Heard a lot about the series so I wanted to see what it was about. Loved it! Will watch rest of the seasons.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Usually surfing movies don't interest me very much.  We watched this one just because nothing else looked better, and were pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The story is about a mentoring relationship between an older surfer played by Gerard Butler and a younger one.  The story is good and holds your interest, but the photography and surfing scenes are really spectacular.<br /><br />I like films that have beautiful outdoor scenes and this one has it all - mountains, giant waves, and surf.<br /><br />Overall it held my attention and was enjoyable.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book gets very detailed in history,sometimes to much<br />so.  It does a good job of explaining the characters and then bringing them all together. Great details of how people think.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.  Seldom do modern films manage to create truly suspenseful situations, but this one does.  The cast is strong and the acting is good.<br /><br />Due to the Oscars this film is now very well known and very popular, as indeed it should be.  Even more interesting is the fact that the story line is based on real people and real events.  At the end of the film there are photographs of the actual people who lived the real-life version.  As it happens the actors are pretty close matches.<br /><br />The film also shows a bit about global politics and the relationship between the U.S. government, Canada, and Great Britain.  The Canadian officials are shown as courageous and willing to take risks.<br /><br />The film also shows the Iranian propaganda machine at its best (or worst) when it denied that the U.S. Embassy personnel were diplomats and claimed them all to be spies.<br /><br />A solid real story with good acting and edge-of-the-seat suspense almost from the first minute.  Certainly the last half hour is about as scary as any movie ever has been.
B00992CF6W|5.0|when you make a world type in the seed blank jpgaming and when you ge there dig strait down from spawn and you will find 8 diamonds's!!! more to come!
B00BP4SJKI|3.0|This movie came out in like 81. I was born in 82 and I don't ever remember watching the movie so now that I have a 3 year old I took the chance. It's a very sexist movie and I won't rent/watch it again. I'm sure it's just a product of its time but Peter Pan is kinda mean to Wendy. He calls her ugly and won't even use her real name most of the time. She's just Girl to him. And the parts where he grabs Tinkerbells wings and spanks her butt to sprinkle fairy dust and when he laughs as his mermaid suitors beat Wendy up were the worst for me. I don't like the message it sends to little girls that if u like a boy and he's mean to u, just stick it out and maybe eventually he'll like u back.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hard to put it down, had to know what happens  next !!!! A great read. Will have to read the whole series!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Great CD!! Glad he finally came out with a new one! So so so so so so so so good!!
B002NPUCIA|5.0|Brian performing live is a wonderful experience. And this is the next best thing. A very lively performance of his best songs.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Unusual love story between a daughter, mother, lover, sister and how their storie intertwine.  Beautifully written, kept me reading into the wee hours.
B00003CXMG|1.0|The only thing more undeveloped than the kid are the characters.  Aside from Philip Seymour Hoffman, who infuses life into every role he plays, these people were as interesting and compelling as a sack of hair.  The mom teaches something about the collective unconscious in college and yet thinks rock and roll is dangerous and evil?  The word Incongruous comes to mind.  And why is the mom, who banned her daughter from listening to Simon and Garfunkel of all things, allowing her son to skip school and join the tour bus?  How does that make any sense?  And Kate Hudson?  Vacuous as always.  Has she run away from home?  What is she doing on this tour?  She's one step away from the cheerleading squad which is fifty steps too far from a typical bus groupie at age 16.<br /><br />The movie started by being cute - a young kid gets a shot to do what all young, aspiring journalists want to do; interview the bands.  After that first shot of cute, the entire movie tries to ride it out for 2 hours.  I made it through one.  The reason this scenario is interesting is because it's potentially dangerous.  The only dangerous aspect of this rock and roll adventure was its bold and unceasing boredom.  Conversations that went nowhere, drug use that never materialized, the whole rock and roll fantasy here is about as adrenalin worthy as a tumbleweed blowing across state lines.  Hanging out with a band is nearly every kid's dream but this dream is, at best, slightly more interesting than trigonometry homework, if only because he's on a bus.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|LOVE IT!!  Listen to it ALL the time!  Great music!  Love all of the songs  that you don't hear on the radio!  Carry On is the BEST!
B000HSKUBE|4.0|Enjoyable 20 y/o BBC production. Fun to compare it with Netflix' U.S. version. I find it easier to access closed captioning on either version through Netflix streaming rather than Amazon.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I got this app for my 5 year old cousin and she loved it.The only problem was that she didn't want to give me my kindle back EVER so we got it on my phone as well so that she could play while we were waiting for things (in line for anything or waiting for a table at a restaurant). Get this app!
B003Y5SWE4|5.0|A great doc on the inside of what it was like to be Elvis. The music alone is worth the trip/
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game... fun entertaing stuff like this.... its kewl bro anyone would like this game and its free!!!!! whew you be trippin! ;)
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Calengoo works perfectly on my new Kindle Fire 2nd generation. (I was unable to get the KF built-in calendar to sync to Google, even though it is advertised as having this capability). As soon as I entered my personal google calendar account info the KF it sync'ed up fine. Entering an event on the KF causes it to appear on the Google calendar, and vice versa. Calendar on the KF then is available offline, so you are not tied to a WiFi network to use it. Now it works just like my old Palm used to!<br /><br />You can sync it to multiple Google accounts. I added a second google calendar (my work calendar) which has a completely separate Google ID. Now they both sync to the KF, and I can turn visibility of either one on or off as needed. This is perfect - at work I can have my work calendar visible, at home just my home calendar. The only downside thus far is the tiny fonts used in the interface - I am experimenting with the font selection but they are quite tiny especially in month view when a lot of stuff is on the KF screen.<br /><br />For general use, I do find it easier to maintain the calendar on my desktop computer to Google, then allow it to sync. It is just easier for me to use the full size monitor and keyboard.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Love the series. This one was pretty exciting. Keep up the good work. Can't wait for the next one. Best.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|This was Heath Ledger's last movie and he was the best thing in it.  I saw it some years ago and thought it was terrific.  I bought this copy for a grandson who will love it.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I am hooked on the series. I have attempted to read the books several times but just could not get through them so I switched to audio book and video rental. I highly recommend this series
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I like this game But can they reduce the price for 900 gems to least 30.00? And I think they need to add more gem fishes Like for gold rush
B00AREIAI8|4.0|only played a few days but I like this game very much<br />I highly recommend this game to people who like horses or caring for animals
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I love Pride and Prejudice so I enjoy rereads which this book really is. All the events of the original and told and then retold constantly. The mystery isn't much of a one. James tries to put more flesh on the characters but they are on a severe diet. Lydia has become a flirt. Who would have guessed?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Again Nicolas Sparks doesn't disappoint.  I always love a good love story but this one had a really good twist at the end.  I didn't see it coming.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|This one of only a few remasters that I have truely liked. the recording is cleaned up without losing any of the original emotion of this album. It allows you to hear deeper into the layers that Pink Floyd is kown for
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I have it on my phone and kindle this game is so awesome love
B005COO1X6|1.0|I absolutely hated this book.  I have read Stephen King before but I did not like the style of this book.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|The choreography and dancing in this is unbelievable.  Great show!! I will definately recommend this movie to others and I know that I will be watching it again and probably purchasing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun for the kids and myself when I'm at work the kids never grow tiers of it neither do I [[ASIN:B00BJQKQH6 Real Racing 3 (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
1250000971|5.0|I've read all of Jeffery Archer books and this one didn't disappoint.  I love the style in which he writes to keep the intrigue going and can't wait to get to the conclusion. It only takes me a couple of days to read because I can't put the books he writes down.  Wonderful storyteller!
B0090YHSFC|3.0|my granddaughter had trouble not slicing the penquine, they speed up to fast for her, but she still does hours of trying to reach next level
B00BXF2S3S|5.0|NCIS had me hooked since the very first episode.  If I want to relax after a hard day at work NCIS is the thing that makes me relax.  The humor of the characters is what I look forward too, it is just so unique and NCIS has become part of my family entertainment.  I always look forward to every new episode. Without NCIS I would be lost.  It is a great show keep it coming:)
B00ANW33CM|5.0|i've gotten about all the mahjong u have and this one is by far the best, love the 3 D effects, it make u remember where u saw the other same item and on which cube. lots of fun
0307591549|3.0|Shawn Achor is awesome in person; however I think the book is redundant if you have seen him in person. It may be better to read the book BEFORE seeing him in person.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|this is really a fun one and u have to use your mind to figure out which is the right way to go so u can make it to the bed on the moon , even my 7 year old granddaughter thinks this is one of the better ones.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Every review I read said that this was a page-turner, a surprise a minute.  Not in my humble opinion.  The plot was formulaic at best.  The prose was completely uninspired.  You end up rooting for neither character, which makes the ending highly unsatisfying.  Avoid this book and all its hype.  If you must read this, don't spend the money and borrow the book from the public library.
B009C7JS14|5.0|get up in the morning and go to this app to see what the day looks like and what to wear and what will be needed for the day, umbrella, winter coat, gloves, snowboots etc. plus can check out weather in other cities where family lives
B004QO9ZVG|5.0|A  very good finish to the series thoroughly enjoyed it.  I think these and jo Nesbo are the best of the current series of scandinavian police novels
B0091QSNEE|5.0|my granddaughter loves anything to do with cooking or designing, love it , she has about everything u have for cooking and designing fingernails and hair
B0074VA2T2|5.0|very colorful and useful. thank you developers for making this app and thanks amazon for the giveaway. highly recommended for youngsters!
B0091QS88K|5.0|got the one without ads because she like it not interfering with her cooking, she is one of those who concentrates  when she does something even on her games
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Alright, this app got me.  I added it on a whim to my Kindle Tablet.  I thought, 'well, not sure what I want to do with an archaic star craft game with poor graphics and lots of text interaction'.  Then I played it, and was hooked. Exploring the universe, upgrading ships, purchasing new ones, following paths of pirating, raiding, merchanting, warrior, and getting involved with the politics of the various syndicates and factions is a fun time. Once you get good at ship to ship combat (and you're not afraid to alienate a few factions) you can lift their cargoes and enslave their occupants to good reward.  Keeping your crew happy and your ship repaired also help to occupy your time.  I was not expecting much, and so was very pleasantly surprised with the depth of this game.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This is a must have Christmas movie for any household collection, with or without kids! The movie idea is cleaver and fun.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|BOUGHT IT FOR A FRIEND THIS WAS ON HIS WISH LIST HE'S A GREAT GUY, I LOVE THIS MOVIE TO
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love this movie. The 3 disc collector's edition is worth having in any home, with or without kids! The graphics are amazing!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Wow! I Need more!!!!!!!!! Love all the seasons and look forward to more to come with the ninth and tenth season!
B008J34466|5.0|I'm a hard core Pink fan! I could not be happier with her new record! I love every song! A must have for any Pink fan!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Both my kids ages 19 yrs and 3 yrs love this game , as we are Star Wars fans this works out great!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is a fun addictive game.Once you start playing you cant stop and Children, Adults,and Teenagers all love it! So stop what your doing and go get this game and did I mention its FREE!
B000FC1PNE|4.0|Another of the series, which is really a romance epic about the Bridgerton family. They are all lovable and deserve the happiness they find, though some chose the long winding road to it.
0061998885|5.0|What I love most about the Kenzie Gennaro series is the contrast between the villains and the heroes. They all had difficult childhoods, all were abused in one way or another, but, as we see time and again, it's how they reacted to those experiences that determined their characters.  I think Lehane is fascinated by the concept of how we each play the hand we were dealt, and what could be more interesting? Also, as violent and dark as these stories can get, in the end, at least for me, the love and true friendship shine through the darkness, maybe not in every book, but in the series overall.  And Lehane has a great sense of humor too! I actually laughed out loud more times than I can count reading \\"Prayers For Rain\\". Having said all that, Lehane could write a telephone book and I would read it, just for the writing. I sure hope there are more of this series on the way.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app does as good as any weatherman when it comes to keeping you informed on the weather.  I had no porblem loading or using it to get the current weather or to plan for another day.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Going in knowing this is the final Christopher Nolan / Batman movie, I expected some tying up of loose ends. While the story as a whole worked well, I thought the end was just a bit contrived. special effects were top notch, and the acting on par with the rest of the series. It will be watched again, just maybe not as frequently as the other parts of the series.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Well written on an unbelievably horrifying topic. Everyone should read to get the grim picture about the North Korean labour camps' unimaginable horror and ruthlessness.
1401937519|3.0|Just havent fully accepted lack of Christain views. Miracles do happen ! I pray Mrs. Morianni will come to accept a Christain life as she faces other experiences in her life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Entertaining and fun. Helps me to relax after a long day. Wish I could earn more diamonds when competing though. Hoping to earn enough to eventually buy another horse sometime.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Tech support is needed when the game misfunctions and you get a message to reload and it is impossible to reload with removing it from device such as a kindle fire.  Then it states that no apps for this game per adroid.  Very unhappy with the lack of support
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Great book if you like period pieces - extremely well written.  If you enjoyed Pillars of The Earth you will love World Without End.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a well made show, even though sometimes the drama is a little forced, but the wide range of characters and scenarios don't let you dwell on one subgroup's circumstances for very long.  Maggie Smith is a hoot.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is one of our favorite romantic movies...so we've added it to our small collection and will enjoy watching it again.  The writing and casting is excellent and it's so fun to watch the various historical characters portrayed from different eras of the arts.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is my go-to game when I need a distraction during some boring times that don't require my brain to be focused on what's going on around me.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|My husband and I LOVE this movie, purchased it as a gift for my cousin who loved it also.  Great cast and fun story!
B00942X8PY|5.0|Excellent game, though I question the difficulty rating of some puzzles. There are some in Hard and Insane that have a 5min limit for gold but can be solved at first look in under 20 seconds, then there are some in medium that took me 2 minutes and had a gold time of under that.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved the book and also love this movie and purchased it as a gift for my cousin.  She had seen it, also loved it and seemed pleased to have a copy of her own to watch again.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|ChuChu Rocket was one of my favorite games for Dreamcast. Now I don't need to drag out the DC whenever I want to play it, because it's on my phone.
B003TOP7RK|5.0|I can now take all my movies and tv shows with me and can minimalize the items I have in my apartment.  I don't like clutter but I love my shows so having the option to get my favorites digitally is amazing.  I can watch on my computer or on the kindle.  and that is AWESOME!!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Seriously, GoT is one of the greatest things HBO has had a part in for a long time. We do not sow.
B0085W09ME|4.0|This is a great app to look for rates when your dates are flexible.  It's a good app to use when your dates are not flexible.  However, I noticed it does not seem include Southwest's rates.  I don't know if this is due to Skyscanner or Southwest.  But it does help to check in two places (Skyscanner/SW) instead of having to look at 5 or 6 sites.
B004RZGUBM|2.0|The content, of course, is priceless but it seems almost every page of this edition contains a scanning error of one sort or another - sometimes the wrong word altogether. Furthermore, when you try to check something in an earlier chapter, it takes you back to the start of the whole book (or the previous novel in the sequence!) instead of just back one chapter or two. At least, that was my experience. Is there a trick to this that I missed?
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|When this originally aired I really couldn't follow it.  Now that I have it on my Kindle, I am blown away.  Great season, very interesting.  AHS has renewed my faith in good TV.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love Johnny Lee Miller as Holmes, he is perfect and I am truly enjoying the new take on Sherlock. Don't get me wrong I enjoy the other series of the British Sherlock Holmes and it's take on the 'modern' Sherlock, but there is something about it taking place in NYC and having a female version of Watson. The chemistry between the two actors is tangible and at the risk of sounding redundant 'perfect'. I was hooked after the first episode and look forward to it every Thursday! Great new series.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I saw this in the theater and liked it a lot.  Seeing it again at home - being able to stop, rewind, etc., I like it even more.  I think Denzel's acting is superb (he SHOULD have won the Oscar) and the story evokes a hundred different emotions.  One of the best movies I've seen in the past ten years.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have purchased all the seasons of The Big Bang Theory for my mom for the past few Christmas'.  She is always extremely happy to find that she has a new season to rewatch.  She especially likes to read the little &#34;comment cards&#34; at the end of each episode since she isn't able to read them quick enough when the show comes on tv.  I am never disappointed when watching this show.  It is always so funny!  The package was delivered in a very reasonable time frame and was easy to track.  I have had no problems with any of the discs playing or anything!  Can't wait until season 6 comes out on DVD!  I'll definitely be purchasing that one as well.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|One of the best martial arts films in a long time. It has big name stars and good acting. Lots of action and special effects. A really good movie. I recommend it strongly. Enjoy.
1451613512|5.0|All very good books.  Easy read.  Told me many things I never knew.  Fantastic<br />People should be taught more History
0061801313|5.0|Package came brand new. It came on time and if you like the show Pretty Little Liars your going to like the books. Im planning on getting the second box set
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show,I love anything about zombies and this is one of the best shows I have ever seen. I have the first two seasons and have been buying all the new episodes on amazon cause I can't wait for the season to come out on DVD cause its that good. Overall best show I have ever seen!!!
0307346617|5.0|Recommend this book.  Received it within the time stated and it is a great read.  Also recommend checking out the zombie survival guide!
B00B10HAO2|5.0|I am someone that needs the background, or the why. This movie gave me the story behind the man. I really enjoyed it for that reason.
1400049628|5.0|With this book I can now survive a zombie apocalypse.  Thank you for the insight and words of wisdom to survive and destroy the undead.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|This is a great series and I enjoy watching it over again after many years. There was however, a duplicate disc and I received a partial return for it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is okay. Same model as tons of others out there so not impressive creatively. I would have given it 5 if it didn't have the same pay to play stuff as all the others.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Exactly what it says on the tin: A FREE calculator app. Straightforward GUI makes it intuitive to use; if you know how to use a real calculator, you can use this one. Also important to me is its lack of bloated &quot;features&quot; or intrusive advertising.
B00BMVTTJ4|3.0|I kept getting a massage content error!<br /><br />I do not know what to do and I do not want to see this movie on my computer.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought this to connect a Cisco console cable to a Lenovo T-420 running Win7-64 bit.<br /><br />Installation was fast, no reboot required. Installed SW, Plugged in to USB, attached console cable and TeraTerm'd via COM4.<br /><br />As far as I can tell--the price can't be beat!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was surprised how the last chapter ends!!<br /><br />Anyways a very nice novel!<br /><br />I will look forward for season # 4
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I love my Plantronics Bluetooth. It sits on my ear pretty much all day everyday. These replacement eartips seem to be of better quality than the originals. The little foam cover kept coming off of the originals after about a week of wear. I've had one of the replacements on for over a month and it is still intact. Most of that from the original was my fault from sliding it in and out of my pocket in places where I didn't want it on my ear. I still do that with the replacement and again it is still intact after a month.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Enjoyed it, made me smile when I wasn`t in the best mood. Liked most all the songs, a couple were just ok, but it was worth buying regardless
B0044XV3QY|5.0|The product arrived ahead of schedule and in excellent condition. In my opinion, this is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|As always there are some songs you love, and the rest you like better and better after you hear them a few times.
0385742886|1.0|If you liked The Maze Runner series, don't Expect to learn anything from reading this book. There are pages after pages of wasted words, dealing with silly chase scenes that you know The characters will survive however you still have to sit through silly story. We learn almost nothing of the world prior to the creation of the maze, No mention of wicked and no mention of anything that gives you a feel for what happened.  I would've loved to of seen the creation of the maze in the conversation about it but there's not even a hint to the story regarding it. Don't waste your time with this book
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I totally enjoyed the series.  I had never watched the show before, so after hearing everyone rave about it, I decided to see what it was all about. It was so entertaining to watch since the only thing on TV lately is violence.  I can't wait for the next season to start!
B003FBMS4W|5.0|The Duke at his best. If you like old westerns, you will like this movie. It is a hard look at two men who will never quit searching for a young girl taken during an Indian raid
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Very good book. Took a little bit to get into but once I did it was worth it. Fast paced, if implausible, but good twists and turns. A little predictable near the end. Would definately recommend.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I play lots of logic and puzzle based on my phone and Kindle Fire, but many of these game require a fine point on my phone with the limited screen area.  This stylus solved my problems.  Way cheaper than the expensive stylus from the phone manufacturer that was meant to work only with my model phone.  The three tip sizes allows me to pick the best one for the job and not have to carry multiple parts or styli around with me.  Especially helpful with larger nonogram puzzles.
B00AHDXTIK|3.0|This cable would be perfect if it was compatible with my case. The opening on my case would not allow me to plug the cable in to charge it.  I tried trimming the rubber on the charging cord but apparently damaged it in doing so and now it won't charge. I took the risk so it is my fault; I didn't have much other option since I had tossed the packaging already.<br /><br />Aside from it not working with my case, the cable is low gauge (thick) and seems well-built.  I'd buy this cable again, multiple in fact, if it worked with my case.<br /><br />Griffin - if you're listening, you can easily make this work with cases.  Please do it. Let me know if you do and I'll come back for more.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|A slight improvement over the snails pace of season one (was required to set up all the back story).  Answers some questions but leaves a whole lot more for the future.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great novel by Nicholas Sparks.  I had predicted the general premise, but not the details.  This is the first book that I have read on a kindle and I became so engrossed in it, that I found myself unconsciously reaching to turn the page as if it were a hard copy.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Definitely worth seeing, and I'm glad I did.  That being said, I would not rank it as high as &#34;Magnolia&#34; or &#34;There Will Be Blood.&#34;
B00A7L00XE|4.0|Not bad, it has a great stripped down feel, with a couple well written tunes.  I've always enjoyed the simple acoustic stuff Harper has done over the years, and having just him and harmonica is pretty sharp.  May not have a lot of extremely memorable Harper songs that will stick in your head forever, but still a great modern blues record, worth checking out.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Best book ever I think that this book is really good and that I can't wait till the house of Hades
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Story takes place in Southport, NC (a real town).  Good setting for this true-to-life drama.  Very suspenseful and romantic novel.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I've read a lot of books relating stories of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but this one is one of the best.  I'd rate this as one of my top three along with &#34;No Easy Day&#34; and &#34;Lone Survivor.&#34;  I'd recommend it to anyone.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Use to be easy to read. Update really ducks. don't waste your time! wish I could reverse the update. I will search for a better app.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|its a great series and the quality of the blue ray is sweeet. worth every penny for this series believe me
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I loved the whole series! I wish that they would put it on local stations as a rerun. I would watch them again!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My son and I really like to play this.....it's relaxing and gives me something to do when I am sitting.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Great movie, color HD was great.  I thought it had a great story line. Love seeing the Tiger actions with Pi
B006AN78XS|5.0|Even if you are not a Woody Allen fan you still can enjoy this movie. The opening scene  shows the city of Paris along with music that is so beautiful it sometimes makes me want to cry. This is pure fantasy but the characters are true to life.  If you like to watch movies for entertainment, to escape reality and yet that have substance and a deeper meaning then you should enjoy this.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show keeps delivering unexpected twists all season long (and through season 2 as well).  Here's hoping they don't cancel it!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Replacement works great.  I like it alot and appreciate Amazone having it in stock.  I recomend it to everyone needing it.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Use for photo editing and for critiquing my collectibles booth.<br />Now feel very confident to use in taking photos and editing<br />them for use on web listings too. Thanks for this app!
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Looking for something good to start watching on AmazonPrime, I kept seeing this on their list. So I finally jumped in. By the middle of the first season, I was so hooked on this show that I had to force myself NOT to watch it. I love Anna Torv. Love that she's not the typical cookie cutter actress. John Noble is fabulous! I've never been a Joshua Jackson fan, and he does get on my nerves a bit as Peter Bishop - but I guess that's the character. So, if he's supposed to be annoying, he does a great job at it.  I love that the show keeps getting quirkier and quirkier.  Glad I have a few more seasons to watch.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Thrilling, kept me guessing to the end was as good as the book, it was very well done and I loved it
B009H442DG|3.0|I got it for my husband, I haven't heard it. I don't understand why I have to write more words.
B00A757EFW|5.0|If u remember this game from back in the day than u will enjoy playing it again take my word u will have fun
B004U52VPS|3.0|well is a toy, if you are fan of angry birds, you gonna like it,<br />made it with good material, also you can't  beat the price,<br /> my son love it, i would recommend to my friends and any one else.
B005K17RU0|5.0|If u like to know what  it's  doing outside than u will probably like this I think it's interesting and fun
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Kızıma hediye almıştım. Kitap hoşuna gitti ve benzer kitaplar daha aldık. Tavsiye ederim. İngilizce kitap alabilmek bu sayede çok kolay.
B0026WNGBA|4.0|ChiRunning is a novel concept, not incredibly invasive to most runners i imagine. well-written - shills a bit hard for accompanying dvd but cannot blame that.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|With all the hype I was really expecting more. The visuals were great, but I was expecting more from the story itself.
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|I almost feel foolish posting anything remotely negative about this album, as being a big Zeppelin fan, any opportunity to hear/see them perform is one that I cherish. Still, there are some minor flaws, but nothing to steer anyone away from what I feel is a solid performance captured on the discs.<br /><br />As others have noted, the first thing that pops out is the key changes made in order to facilitate Plant’s vocal range.  Easy to get used to-not a problem for me.  While Plant’s voice remains strong, his energy is up/down, and some numbers suffer for it (this shouldn’t surprise Zeppelin fans, as Plant had been the one member who was reluctant about the reunion).  At times it sounds like he not quite up for the gig.  Sadly, “Stairway To Heaven,” is the main causality on this score.  A very plodding performance.  There is also a rushed feeling at times; as is if they were trying to get as many songs in as possible in the time allotted for the gig.<br /><br />On the plus side, Page’s playing is still strong; his guitar sound has a bit more overdrive than Page circa 1974.  And as an ensemble they still show they are capable of some magic with Jason Bonham now in his dad’s chair. “No Quarter,” is a highlight on this score, with John Paul Jones adding some nice jazz voicing to the keyboard parts (you kind wish he would have stretched out even more).<br /><br />To borrow from the “Sound Opinion” boys, this is a “buy it” record on all levels: great bang for the buck, solid performance, and an essential document of arguably the most important band post-1970.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|This really motivated me to be the master of my craft and learn everything about the technical aspects of my field. Technical mastery is key.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I have been using this little sweeper for about one year and I use it everyday.  I have been very satisfied with the performance of the little guy and for the price I paid for it has been worth it.  Now in the past week I have the problem of the battery not holding a charge and I do believe that is my own fault.  I have left the battery in the charger for many hours beyond the 8 max they recommend and I am sure I killed the battery.  So I am going to order this $16.00 replacement sweeper and throw out the old one.  I bought the original in Ross for 19.99 so the replacement is cheaper to buy then a battery.  Well that's my story .
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this game. Find it helps to pass the time. I find myself playing it all the time. Great for grand kids to keep them quiet when on long drives not waiting in line. They love the fact that more than one player can enjoy together.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|The development of the characters catches you up in the story and has you anticipating and eagerly awaiting the next episode.
1476733953|5.0|I haven't slept good, I look like a zombie, and I'm left wanting more.<br /><br />Buy this book, read this book, tell your friends. The characters are engaging and draw you in to a setting that has you constantly asking questions and trying to find out more.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Such a great movie! We watched it (two 58 yr old grandparents) with our 5 year old, 9 year old and 11 year old grandsons.  We ALL loved it!! We had one small discussion about having bad dreams when my 5 year old grandson said HE had bad dreams too, after watching Pitch change the adorable unicorn dream to a pretty scary black stallion! At that point I said I'd give him the Dreamcatcher that hangs in his room at my house to take home, between the really good feelings you get from the movie and the dreamcatcher, he's bad dream free since!  Each character was so well thought out, so many small details that made it a complete experience, the best Movie I've seen lately!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nichols Sparks books in general, and Safe Haven did not disappoint. I like that the book dives a little bit into the mind of an abuser to add another level of depth to the story.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This film production on societies many diffirent addictions is a wealth of altruistic perspective to the maladies.  Viewing these conditions without the glorifying spotlight shares the pain.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved this book as a teen and the director did a great job of keeping true to the book! Emma Watson was radiant in the movie and the casting in general was excellent.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Very good novel. It has many reflexions to go over and over again...<br />Very simple writing and very entertaining.I recommend it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a great series to watch.  The characters and actors are fabulous and refreshing. The locations and cinematography are breathtaking.  I love how everything is consistent with the time period of this series.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Beautiful cinematography with a thought provoking plot.  A movie I will watch more than once!  Well worth the movie purchase investment.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Simply put... I am Not Impressed.... I would not waste the time and effort required.  Keep searching for an alternate product.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I can now see my business page and my personal page on my mobile devices with ease.....<br />Thank you<br />Nancy
B004EF65QA|5.0|Very well done!!<br />Never stops being interesting, never dull.<br />Watched the ending over and over again.<br />Doesn't hurt that Richard is very easy on the eyes!!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I found it a bit confusing at first , but after working with it for a bit, found I could go back and forth from journal to calendar with ease...Makes life a bit simpler...
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|it was an awesome game at first but then I didn't play for a few days and then I went back on and it wiped all of my progress I'm furious
B001I189MQ|5.0|I loved every part of this movie, from beginning to end, The Joker was an excellent villain, and extremely well played. He was absolutely great!  Harvey Dent came across as terrific, and a very likeable character!  There were so many twist's and turn's in this movie that I was on the edge of my seat during the whole thing! I got to see a more personal side of Batman, his emotions, and how much he actually cares about people, and of course some interesting gadgets. I would also like to add, I thought the character behind Lt. Gordon  was very inspiring and clever. All in all this is a terrific movie, I would highly recommend it to everyone, However there are some horrific scenes that might not be suitable for children, But I leave that up to your discretion. An Excellent Movie, I can't wait to watch it again, over and over.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|my kids love it! makes monsters seem less scary. plus I love adam sandler. we may have to purchase the dvd so we can take anywhere.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|se tarda poco en entender como funciona y me resulta muy &uacute;til para anotar futuras compras.<br />Lo uso a menudo.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I saw the movie and loved it . Thought it was the best Bond movie ever. Couldn't wait to get the DVD. My husband agreed with me that it was great!
0307352153|5.0|I've always felt bad about being a quiet person. So when I stumbled upon \\"Quiet\\", I immediately decided that I needed to read it. And boy am I glad I did. Susan Cain tells various stories of some of the most successful business people, politicians, and actors who just happen to be introverts. A must read for anyone who prefers a quiet night at home, rather than a busy weekend in Vegas.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|Watched this movie with my 23yr old son one evening after having him over for dinner. It was surprisingly cute, well told and, came with a message to not judge people by their appearance.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Truly, one of the BEST movies ever, despite knowing how it ends in real-life history. The story depicts the intensity of foreign crisis along with the skill and urgency required to extricate hostages in such a hostile political environment.<br /><br />To Mr. Ben Affleck: Please, continue to bring us more. Well chosen, and well done, sir! Thank you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I don't know how anyone could rate this one star. This is probably the best site, now app, ever created. If people are wondering why it keeps foreclosing on them its most likely because you are not big on patience and hit all the buttons at the same time. This is one of the most fun apps ever.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I gave this book 5stars because I appreciated the way it was written. The author took great care in conveying details of Adam's life and of those around him. I actually felt emotions that I have never felt before, while reading a book....or watching a movie for that matter. It truly affected me, in a positive way. The man  (Adam Brown) was a true American ....a warrior, and I wish I could have had the pleasure of knowing him.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  The animation and detail is fantastic.  I am an adult & the movie kept my attention through the whole time.  I would recommend it for everyone kids & adults.

0786958731|5.0|A great gift for the R.A. Salvatore enthusiast. It's a D&D game, without the hard core, all time consuming, element. If you like the D&D game but don't have time to commit to a long campaign, this is a great alternative.

B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is a pretty cool game. It feels like an actual city too. Although, it is a good game it could be better if the whole investment cards thing was a lot easier to understand. I've been on this game for quite a while and still have no idea what the cards. Also, how come it wont let you build stuff when it says\\" you don't have enough investment points\\" or something like that when it doesn't even say how many you need and it doesn't go down. Well, I hope you guys take me review seriously because I know there's a lot of people in the world who vet so frustrated over things like this.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This is great, you choose your workout, or just do the whole thing and it just goes from one to another with a smooth even flow, not a bunch of un-needed instructions or talk, just an easy to follow video of what to do and how long to do it. I get my quick workout done where ever I am and move on with my day without getting out a bunch of stuff, if I have to stop in the middle, I just stop it, grab my kindle and move on. Simple, easy, love it.
B002CSC5EC|4.0|I have not had a chance to view this as of yet. Why do I need to make more comments than I already have? I don't understand?
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The visuals were awesome, though I imagine it would have been even better in 3D.<br /><br />And the ending left me puzzled and caused me to think about it for a day or two before I realized what was meant when the author was told to &#34;talk to Pi and you will find God&#34;.<br /><br />Very entertaining and thought provoking
B003W5C0VW|5.0|This is a very good show and I am very happy to have this DVD. I don't understand why further comments are required.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|The story is about what you'd expect from a direct-to-video release, but those of us who were fans of the game(s) will be happy just to return to the setting and meet these characters again.<br /><br />The graphics unfortunately are only slightly better than the DVD. Either they didn't re-render from the source files or the source files were not really made for this resolution. Given that this was a direct-to-video project, I'm guessing the latter, not that I know.
B00B10HAO2|5.0|Great acting, great cast, great story! Wonderful adaptation of the book.  Recommend reading of the book too for interpersonal look at the real director, Alfred Hitchcock.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I am addicted to this app!! it has great graphics and is very entertaining. I love how you can personalize the reserve however you like!  but I think the mystical creatures such as the unicorn or loch ness monster should go. overall great app:)

B004S3MB2U|5.0|No need for any other calculator, does everything. Love it. Would recommend it to anyone looking for an all purpose calculstor.
B000VSYDRM|5.0|Don't let the nay-sayers get ahold of you. Watch this movie. It contains such truth about humanity and our obsessions, faults, foibles, glory and ghastliness that if it seems confusing to you then I would venture to state that you may have an unexamined, or unlived, life. Exploring our olfactory sense, on film no less, would seem a daunting task but it is handled here excellently. All of our senses have spectrums of sensations. Those who put together pictures for our eyes, tastes for our tongues, fabrics for our skin, music for our ears and, as in this movie, scents for our noses attempt to be experienced in the contrasts that each of these senses can utilize. How are we to know sweetness without knowing the sour? The light without the dark? This exploration of the hidden realms of the world of scent is an amazing achievement. Stay with it and you will not be disappointed. The ending is unforgettable.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|This movie can be watched again and again; always some new view, nuance, that you miss the other times. Real acting, dialogue, and the cinematograhy is unbelieveable.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|My main reason for giving it only 4 stars was because it was a bit too long. Other than that I thought it was very good. It seems that so many of the movies are getting too long. Long doesn't make better.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The BBC Dr. Who series is fantastic & this Doctor was short-lived, transforming into another body at the end of the season.  The adventures he had in Season 1 were entertaining, funny & held interest well.  His need for a companion to share his journeys brought us Rose & developed them into a great duo.  I feel the episodes in Season 1 were well done, had interesting problems to resolve & interesting creatures galore.  Great acting!  I highly recommend this series.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Not only is this a lot of fun, but it rarely feels &quot;pay to play&quot;. Progressing without spending a cent is steady and linear. And no performance issues!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|After seeing the trailer, didn't think I'd be able to sit through the entire movie. Really engaging movie and glad I gave it a chance. Highly recommend.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't watch any of the D. Abbey series before the 3rd season was out, because I don't watch much TV.<br />So I watched season 3 before seeing 1 & 2, but enjoyed them all, I like this era of history and England.

B007IK44CK|2.0|It held my intrest enough to finish watching the movie. Would I watch it again or the next one if one does come out? No.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|I purchased it to show it to the class I teach on the Sociology of Sport at Lees-McRae College in Banner Elk, NC.  I use it in the &#34;politics and sports&#34; unit, and it is especially effective as a story about sport in another country, so there are relevant cross-cultural and historical values as well.  As an illustration of the influence of sports on national unity and identity, it just can't be surpassed.  And I was of course especially delighted at the Amazon price--I wish more curricular materials were as accessible!

B009KS4XRO|1.0|If you try to play more than one Bingo game at a time, the games get too small. Plus the numbers being called roll out to fast for multiple games. It seems like the same numbers are being called out each time I play this game. Never have won. It's coming out of the Kindle, not worth it.

If you are a series buff, please note, you may get irritated with those inconsistencies.<br /><br />For the rest of us, this is top notch Clancy. I like to read each book in it's own world. On it's own, it stands. Decent action, good page turning velocity. Gives great food for thought on nation states and enemies. This book can provide you with conversation starters galore.<br /><br />Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon - any weekend.

B00B5HQKNI|2.0|If you are looking for something fresh and original, something that you have not seen 100 times before in other movies, something that has respect for the viewer, and something that makes sense -- then DO NOT watch this movie. The only good aspect of this film is the cinematography. Everything else is simply terrible.
B001EAWME2|1.0|I love Black Christmas, and it was thrilled to find that Critical Mass had given it a HD makeover. Or so the press materials claimed. I prefer grain to noise reduction, so I am very forgiving when it comes to the picture, but this is really pushing it. The picture is soft, and above all, straight up fuzzy. As if that wasn't enough, there is an audio sync issue that renders the proceedings on par with the worst foreign release dubbing.<br /><br />On the upside: the little doc \\"The 12 Days of Black Christmas\\" is pretty interesting, and the Q&A with Saxon, Clark, and Zittrer is a fun bit.<br /><br />Overall, this is a shame, especially considering the stature of Black Christmas and how treasured it is by fans. I do not, at all, recommend this release. Hang tight until someone pries it out of the hands of Critical Mass and gives it a true deluxe treatment.<br /><br />Until then, stick to your DVD, which looks and sounds better than this shameful disc.

B008JGSM6G|3.0|Occasionally one of the &#34;flows&#34; won't flow between two different colored points even though a clear path is showing.  No danger of becoming addicted to this game although it is good for occasions when you just want to kill a few minutes.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover has now held up great after well over a year's use of tossing it around my room, in and out of various bags, or traveling around the globe.  I like the design as well as it has kept my Kindle Fire in excellent condition.  I do not have a screen protector on my Kindle Fire and this has not proved to be an issue as this cover works great.  I also like the pocket inside to stick notes etc.  The only thing I wish it did have was a latch or snap or something to close it/keep it closed (although to be honest, without these things it keeps the case very slim and non-bulky and makes it so it can easily fit wherever I put it).

B00ALCBU4M|1.0|Literally guys running around announcing \\"I hate Germans\\".<br /><br />This movie is perpetuates a lot of unrealistic history, bad stereo types, and hatred.

B00BSW6F26|4.0|This is a point and click adventure game that I played on a 2nd Generation Kindle.  The game downloaded fast and there were no glitches or freeze-ups.  There were also no hidden object scenes or arcade sequences.<br /><br />On the negative side, even with my brightness set almost all the way up, it was sometimes difficult or impossible to see objects you needed to pick up.  I was reduced to randomly clicking over entire scenes.  Every now and then something would pop into my inventory, but I never saw it coming.  Oh, and one more thing about game inventory:  Game Developers!  Please, please label inventory items.  Yes, YOU know what it is, but it isn't always apparent to players.  One item looked like a cup or ladle, but it wasn't. (I won't spoil anyone by saying what it was.)  I had to guess what other things were too.  One important clue near the end of the game should have been simple, but it was hard to decipher and I read it wrong for quite a while.<br /><br />The puzzles themselves aren't that hard if you attentively look around for clues.  My biggest complaint is that the game ended very abruptly, and turned out to be way shorter than I expected.  But, it was worth what I spent for it, which was $1.29.  I notice that since Magic Frame has changed to One Connection Media, the prices have increased.  $1.99 is too much for this game.
0756405890|4.0|I got tipped off to this book from a friend with similar tastes, and when I added it to my Goodreads shelf, I noticed quite a few of my friends rated it very highly as well - including some folks who I know don't usually read fantasy novels.<br /><br />I think that speaks to one of the book's strengths - building a compelling fantasy universe that has broad appeal. Kvothe's story of struggle and growth from a tragedy, hitting rock bottom and finally attaining his dream, but having it not be what he'd hoped - that's something everyone can relate to. There is magic, and there are strange creatures, but they almost exist outside the story. The real tale is Kvothe's quest.<br /><br />I found the main character confident, capable, and even cocky at points - but somehow Rothfuss managed to leave an overall impression in my mind as humble. Perhaps it was how he handles what Kvothe calls his most important relationship - the stuttering romance with Denna. After reading the book, I felt like the author may have overstated this, but I'm withholding judgement until I read the rest of the books in the series. Kvothe has lots of different relationships with lots of different people, but this one with Denna (aside from perhaps Auria), is what drives him to act in the way he acts for the key scenes in the book.<br /><br />This leads me to what I felt was a big weakness for the book - this didn't work 100% for me as a standalone book. I realize it is part of a series, but I didn't feel any sort of solid resolution at the end of it. It felt like there were scenes missing after the last page (which I'm sure will be contained in the 2nd book) and the last two hundred pages felt unfocused.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br />The introduction of the sweet eating draccus felt like a hasty plot addition. Rather than providing meaningful progress along his hunt for the Chandrian, a creature that hasn't been mentioned in the entire book is introduced, and perhaps forms (arguably) the climax of the book. After this, there are mini climaxes, with Ambrose, the University, Bast and Chronicler. All these combined led to me feeling the final pages of the book were the weakest.<br /><br />I also wasn't a fan of the structure. I had to struggle past the first 50 pages of introducing Chronicler before we got to the meat of Kvothe's tale, which is one giant flashback. Again, as a series, this storyline may be compelling, but it nothing but get in the way in this first book. However, the book contained 500 pages that I thoroughly enjoyed, so I will definitely be reading the 2nd and 3rd edition in the series.

0062080237|1.0|Until I'd read this book, Gaiman fell into the same category as Dr. Who - something I'd never experienced, but was well beloved by many, many, MANY people. I won't say I went in with high expectations - I went in with no expectations, I find that's the best way to go about trying something unfamiliar.<br /><br />With American Gods, I couldn't get into it. I'll probably be crucified for saying this, but the whole thing read like something that might come out of an undergrad college writing class. Where the author has always entertained dreams of writing something, you know, something really, really good - but ultimately never has that work peer reviewed or looked at by an editor. The characters of an ex-con, grifter, mystic women, villains who ALL are evil because they don't care (and they do what they want) - it's all so...stock.<br /><br />I could not get into Shadow as a main character. It's not until the very, very end of the book where he takes an active role in anything. For the bulk of the book, he's along for the ride. And I guess I should care for him, he's certainly been down on his luck. But I just don't. He's given up on life and merely blows wherever Wednesday tells him to, and I didn't find that interesting in the slightest.<br /><br />The concept of new vs. old gods was slightly intriguing, which is why I landed on this book in Gaiman's catalog, but after experiencing it, he didn't do it justice. The mythology of the old gods and articulation of the new gods is scattershot, which seems like was his intent, but it prevented me from getting into the conflict.<br /><br />One book does not an author make, and I'll likely give him another shot. For someone trying Gaiman on for size, I wouldn't recommend this particular book.
B0009353IW|5.0|Terrific instrumentals and vocals, great tunes and production values.  Read the liner notes twice before listening to the CD, enjoyed the experience more because of it.  Explores the same LA of the 1940's/1950's found in James Ellroy's books.

I do not mind repeating a scene a few times to advance but I do not want to spend hours on the same scene.
B008AUGEFC|3.0|Cloud Atlas was an uneven book for me. On the one hand, I thought the structure was brilliant. Loved how he told an interconnecting story across time, spanning 19th century slavers all the way to post-apocalyptic Hawaii and then going all the way back. I thought this technique of bookending the narrative lent itself well to telling stories within a larger story.<br /><br />Some of these stories, I loved. Essentially, the middle 4 stories in the book worked for me. Hawaii, Korea, Cavendish and Seaboard are all fantastic, containing intertwining themes about politics, consumerism and family. And the characters really are kindred souls drifting across time, as the book jacket suggests.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the two \\"bookends,\\" or the first and second story are dull and seem completely disconnected from the rest of the book, save for a cursory connection. (A discovered book, a penpal across the ocean.) I found myself so bored for the first 140 or so pages that I contemplated giving up. Then, when the book had delighted me and I hit those storylines again, I withheld judgement, hoping I'd appreciate the 2nd half of each of these stories given the context of the middle. I didn't. The opening and the ending left me with a general sour taste in my mouth, even though I liked the middle bits.<br /><br />Mitchell does do a phenomenal job mastering different voices and genres. The beginning feels very much like a tale from the old masters (Robinson Crusoe, etc.), while the end dips into solid sci-fi territory with dystopian themes. But even that can't save the dullness or how flat the first and last 150 pages of the book feels. I'm interested to watch the movie now, to see how they pulled it off. Like the book, I could see it being brilliant, but I could also see it being a failure.

0316056898|5.0|The role of comedienne is unenviable based on principle, simply because most people don't want to believe that a woman could be as funny as a man. In the history of modern comedy, there have only been a few actresses who cross over to full-blown 'funny lady.' The most obvious one is Lucille Ball. Her only living equivalent is Tina Fey. Fey's doubling as a brilliant writer as well as performer has given her an edge Ball never had, as she is able to exploit femininity in ways no male writer could ever do for an actress. (How many times have you heard \\"men don't understand women\\"? It's true.) Dieting, menstruation, sexism, boobs, nothing, literally nothing, is off limits for Fey, and all for the medium's benefit. BOSSYPANTS is an entertaining, at times moving, autobiography that serves as an all-purpose guide to life and surviving the entertainment industry, regardless of whether you have a vagina or not. For the curmudgeons: the world isn't ending tomorrow, and yesterday wasn't so wonderful! I tore through this book after finally coming to terms with the fact that I'd never see a new episode of 30 ROCK again, and all I can say is, anything Fey has up her sleeve will always be of interest.

0765325950|5.0|I started reading Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series back in the seventh grade. I'm thirty-two now, with the final book just released and on my \\"read\\" shelf. I'm not the only one who can claim this - fans of this series are legion, and with fourteen books that often clock in at a thousand pages or more - folks have spent a lot of time with this series.<br /><br />Folks have also been waiting a long time for this series to end. Part of me thought there was no way Jordan or Sanderson could end this in a satisfying way. Part of me hoped it would, after Sanderson took over after Jordan's death and erased all the frustration myself and a lot of fans felt with the series not going much of anywhere between books seven and eleven.<br /><br />Long story short, he pulled it off. Like the other two books Sanderson has penned, this one has its imperfections, but delivers in an epic way. Made all that much more impressive when you think about the scope of what Sanderson inherited. In fantasy fiction, this is Abrams inheriting Star Wars. The only thing more daunting I could imagine for an author in this context would be if a publisher decided to do a second trilogy set in Middle Earth.<br /><br />I'll hit the highlights and try to avoid spoilers as much as I can.<br /><br />For those wondering if this book would be all Last Battle, given the way Towers of Midnight ended - it is. There's one massive 190-page chapter entitled \\"The Last Battle,\\" but really, the whole book is the forces of Light against the forces of the Shadow. It's nearly all action, and you literally never come up for air after page 1. If the other thirteen books hadn't spent so much time on character development, backstory and world building, I'd say this was a flaw. But for the most part, it works. One thing I didn't like was how well things went for the side of the Light in the first half of the book. It definitely becomes an even fight, but for much of the initial scenes, everything felt way too tidy.<br /><br />This final struggle is depicted from all angles. There's no fighting or conflicts that happen \\"off-screen.\\" Sanderson's structure in this book is to jump from character to character, going wherever the action is, showing us exactly what we need to see and moving on. There are no Mat chapters or Rand chapters, each one holds four or five perspectives. Every major character has a role to play in this book. The two characters I had a problem with Sanderson's interpretation of are a little easier to stomach, Mat and Suian. Mat still feels off to me, and Suian only has a handful of sections from her perspective, but on the whole he seems to have figured them out, which was lacking in his other books.<br /><br />The one criticism I would have is that the book suffers from the old cliché of characters not doing what makes sense for the sake of drama. See Demandred calling for Rand's head through an entire battle instead of laying waste to soldiers. See Androl standing right next to one of the Forsaken leading the Shadow's army and doing nothing so he can go after Mazrim Taim instead. See Demandred refusing to use the Power or accepting help from his lackeys when he crosses swords with would be foes. Once or twice would be forgivable, but it happens a lot in this book.<br /><br />I couldn't imagine anyone reading the first thirteen books and not picking this one up. But if you're one of the folks who quit after an entire book went by without the appearance of their favorite character, or stopped reading after a volume ended with more Forsaken alive than it had started with, and are wondering whether or not it's worth diving back in now that it's over - I'd definitely recommend doing so. I think you'll find the last three and the final book are mostly everything you hoped it'd be.
B00870Z05U|5.0|The story continues with the Phantom and Christine to its final conclusion. Although the music is not as powerful as the Phantom, it is still great. The whole production is very captivating and colorful. I could see that the ending had to be this way as it works out fine. ( if you didn't read the insrciption on Christine's grave stone in the Phantom.) It certainly is worth the price (I bought it for 14.99)and if you want to see the rest of the story.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Hugh Laurie does an Amazing job with this music!  SO interpretive! Don't know what I was expecting, but this is just absolutely one of the best interpretations of New Orleans Jazz that I have heard in a long time!  Living in New Orleans for several years, I have heard so much New Orleans jazz and this is exciting and just plain Great Music! You NEED to own this Album!  Make sure you get it and add it to your Jazz Library!
0451196716|4.0|Good book, but too much like a McCarthy book that I read prior to this.  Fun to read, like all of King's books.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have enjoyed each movie and especially the last two of &#34;Breaking Dawn&#34; Part 1 and later Part 2.  I have purchased each DVD as a keep sake for my video library.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|only one complaint: had problems with many freeze-ups on the bonus game and just couldn't finish. too bad!  the clown was indeed scary.
1476733953|4.0|Wool is the kind of book I can more or less devour - particularly because this book has a strong beginning, I can see why there was demand for the Howey to keep the story going after releasing the first novella/short story in the Omnibus.<br /><br />I think the book's strength is how quickly Howey is able to get you invested in the characters. No spoilers, but I thought the author took a couple of huge risks in the first two sections of Wool, but he pulled it off while managing to lead into the main character's arc deftly.<br /><br />This intense character development almost masks the strength of his world building, which is top-notch. At no point did this post-apocalyptic universe, contained within a subterranean concrete silo, feel contrived or unrealistic. The concept hangs together tightly, and small details are revealed over time, never too much or too little, and everything is in service of the characters and the plot.<br /><br />Once you arrive in sections 4 and 5, I did find the book weakened a bit, as he shifted from keeping each section focused on a single character to a multi-character point of view. The story seemed to lose a little bit of its focus and \\"oomph\\" at that point, but overall I still loved this post-apocalyptic slice of what could very easily be a much, much larger universe of fiction with loads of new stories waiting to be told, should Howey be so inspired.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to sci-fi fans or post-apocalyptic fiction fans, and I'd even try and foist it upon my non-genre readers too. I think it does that good a job of rising above its genre.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris was a wholesome kid who grew into a fine Warrior.<br />While his writing style may have been simple, the stories, depictions and pictures he painted of the war in Iraq were amazing/disturbing/hilarious all at the same time.<br /><br />American Sniper was a book I always wanted to read,<br />unfortunately I did not pick it up until Chris's untimely death early last month.<br /><br />Book is a must-read for anyone interested in the SEAL Teams.<br /><br />Douglas
B000TEUSJK|2.0|dvd froze part way through it looks like it might have been copied from a camera picture fuzzy and s<br />distorted
014241722X|5.0|Another Grisham page turner.  Have read all of his books and never disappointed in his legal knowledge and easy reading.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My major cable company that rhymes with Lime Former Table had this on demand for $4.99 for 24 hours.  Went on Amazon Instant and got it in HD for 3.99 for 48 hours!  Stupid cable company.  That being said, this was a wonderful cute movie that lacks what I hate in some kids movies today...dripping sarcasm.  It is sweet, entertaining, and great for all ages.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.  What a great message it has, that it's OK to be different.
B0031RSBS2|5.0|I've read all Jack Reacher books and they never fail to please me.  He is getting a little more technical now i.e. times, distances, etc., but nevertheless I love his character.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|this is a &#34;ditto&#34; of the 1st. season comment...but with this added......What a mean thing to do by not giving us more and more so that we can visit this delightful &#34;Masterpiece&#34; of entertainment each and every week!..Maybe every other week if the producers read this note?<br />What a wonderfjul cast of &#34;characters&#34; from the wry looks of Maggie Smith, to the gentleness of Hugh Bonneville.  Anna and Mr. Bates are heart warming. O'Brien and Thomas, as dastardly a pair of mean spirited plotters as you will ever see. So much more in the growing family of &#34;Crawley&#34;. oh, and Mr. Carson...you gotta see him to believe!
B004AGI2L4|5.0|Superb account of the legendary Roman 9th Legion in Britain. The breathtaking ending shots will knock your sandals off !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've always wanted a horse and I almost feel like I have one. Get this app it's sooooo worth it!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|i really like this app especially when traveling. you never know when you will need to free yourself from unwelcome noises.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|As good as it gets. This is the closest I can get to being there. I missed the show while here in town and this is my way to seeing it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|this is one great show. Cant wait till season 3 starts. More shows should be this good. thanks for getting me this quick.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Enjoyed it very much, having withdrawals already. Darn good story telling. Even without seeing the cover, I would know who wrote this, so very King!
B00319KS7C|5.0|One of his finest characters. Matt is unrecognizable as a hunk. This movie is such an adventure, such a freak-out, that it must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Also featured is that loser that ruined Star Trek with the Deep Space Nine Debacle, ol' what's his name. He's good here, though.<br /><br />1. if you don't like Matt Damon, see this and allow him to redeem himself as an amazing character actor.<br />2. if you Do like Matt Damon, see this and prepare to be AWED.<br /><br />You gotta see it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Both my Wife and I enjoy the app.  The competition between us to get more horses and nicer tack provides great banter.  The opportunity to give gifts and to aid each other is fun to enjoy altogether
B00328R21C|5.0|I bought this for my 6 years old son. he put it together rather easily and fast. its a nice vehicle has a secret compartment. The characters are why i really wanted to buy this set. its a good amount of people:) love the r-2 and the c-3 !!<br /> a great buy!
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|No good want to return it. i was completely disapointed in this cd. i hope this was just a clitch in their work.
B002RHGYOA|4.0|Great sequel going straight to the final one now! Great fast paced action could not put it down have to go and read the finale!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Big Bang is my favorite series ever & season 6 does not disappoint either.  I love having the episodes available to watch any time I need a laugh & to relax!!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Enjoyable and fun but sometimes enemies will be invisible and unable to attack forcing you to lose. Lots of levels and overall a fun game
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Amazing, absolutely amazing. So many twists and turns you will never stop guessing. Complex book that leaves you always wanting to read more. Can't wait to start book 2
B00913DPW2|4.0|I enjoyed this game, but was frustrated a few times trying to figure puzzles out. In most Big Fish games, you are at least told what the objectiveof the game is, this one you had to figure them all out yourself. Okay for most, got stuck on a few. I liked the puzzle piece search, and the coin and moth search included. I did use the walk through when I was stuck for days to figure out what I missed. I plan on going through the game again, I'd like to know what I missed at the end that left me with a gold crucifix in my stash!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss and Brandon Sanderson have given a much needed shot to fantasy story telling, no cookie cutter stories while still holding true to the genre.
0802473156|5.0|This is by far the best book my husband and I have read. It has helped us do a complete 180 degree turn in our marriage for the better. We were on the verge of seperation and decided to give this book a shot, figured we we were done anyways. We have both made huge changes in showing eachother love in their language, even though it hasn't been easy. It works. My husband who did NOT want to read it has now decided this will be a wedding present for any wedding we go to. We each read 1 chapter a day and then spent a long time discussing it. If you and your spouse are in trouble, please please please-don't give up! Read this book!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It offers the protection I was looking for, looks nice and is easy to use hand held or standing alone.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was very well written. The relationships in the book were real and interesting. As a sad book goes there is a lot of humor
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|Bought the digital copy of this for Amazon instant video, the quality is total s***. Looks like it was filmed on a cellphone in the cinema.
0064400557|5.0|Needed for my childs school. Its a classic book and an easy read. She is very pleased. Nothing bad to say.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book!  An easy read that holds your attention.  Not to much tiresome detail, but enough to paint a picture.  In the end you almost feel you knew the characters.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Has everything you want in television show... plus fairytales =)<br />Ginnifer Goodwin, Jennifer Morrison and Lana Parilla are amazing actresses
1400052181|5.0|I absolutely love this book it's a great read can't stop talking about I would recommend it to anyone.. Again a great read
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loving the suspense and the action. Can't wait for the next show. Hopefully the governor will get his just Deserts in the end.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This was a great addition to the James Bond series.  As a movie collector, it is a welcome addition to 50 years of Bond!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Loved it. Absolutely loved it. The imagery was amazing, the writing was great. Some parts I felt like they stretched thin, there was a lot of running for their lives and screaming in this movie, also known as filler.<br /><br />I wish the movie ended with a more satisfied ending but it is the book broken up into three parts to they could make more money. Still it was good and I loved every minute of it. I'm happy to add it to our permanent collection of DVD's.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|great for cleaning out old files and games you don't play anymore..worked great on my Kindle Fire! Still have some learning to do with the app but will be keeping this one!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Well acted.  Well scripted.  Beautifully shot. What is not to love?  This show was a find for me as I knew nothing about it going in having seen no ads or trailers.  I am not sure if this is a to be one shot or the plan is for multiple seasons.  Hoping for the latter.  Considering the landscape it would be refreshing.
B006LSZECO|2.0|well written so I'm giving it two starts instead of one, but characters were horrible, unlikable, no redeeming qualities.  storyline keeps you reading but worst ending ever. Hated this book.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I pretty much enjoyed everything about this movie EXCEPT Russell Crowe. I do not see how anyone can justify his casting. He simply cannot sing. He is off key just about every time he opens his mouth, and his Javert does not come across as particularly strong to my mind. Just listen to the strength when Phillip Quast sings the role. Granted, not everyone can sing like him, but the role requires a MUCH stronger voice.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman was fine, but his voice did waiver at times. The real strength lies in the supporting performances, particularly Anne Hathaway and my personal favorite, Samantha Barks as Eponine.<br /><br />The movie opens up the story into the streets of Paris at the time, and even borrows elements from the novel that were not in the stage performance, such as how Eponine REALLY gets shot.<br /><br />All in all, a great movie experience with one major exception.
0807014273|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It has so much substance and meaning.  It is eye opening and teaches you great lessons in life.
B0041T7FS6|5.0|I'm one of the biggest Chic nuts on the planet and I have to say  this box set rocks! Hope Nile has a volume 2 in the works.
B00821OX98|4.0|I found the first season to be very good.  I am moving on to watch season 2.  I am hoping the writing and acting quality remains the same.
0061120073|5.0|This is another character study of a young woman in the poorest area of Brooklyn.  It is funny,  and touching,  and real.  Because it is REAL, and based on relationship, it is contemporary to anyone's situation.
B00AFOS6QG|4.0|I have been a fan for some time.  I am enjoying this very much!!  Nick is such a bad boy!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Kept me on the edge the whole time.  Absolutely a page turner.  Lee Child is one hell of a writer.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I love history and while this is not always factual, is amazing to watch. Beautiful scenery, gowns and rooms abound and the little things that make it believable.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I bought this a few weeks ago and have played 79 of 100 levels.  It is fun and can be very challenging.  It is a good time passer!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead. Best tv series ever. We never miss an episode. We always down load on to the kindle fire the next day.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|see the other review for downtown abbey season 3.  can't wait for season 4.  it could be the &#34;movie night&#34; for the week!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great entertainment, writing and acting are top notch,This show is very smart. It's funny, dramatic,The characters are engaging.The episodes just get better and better as more of each character's back-story comes out.
B003Y7PM5E|3.0|We love the record (music) but as it came with scratches on it and a mislabeled covered, we were a bit disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the egg hunt!! I almost have the chicken board! I listen to my Pandora app and play this!!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I saw both Zero Dark Thirty and Seal Team Six. The latter dealt more with the seal team, some information about the process leading up to the mission and was presented more as a docudrama. Zero Dark Thirty filled me in on more actual analyst, facilitator information, some of which was different then that which was in Seal Team Six. After watching both I still felt like a hole was left in regards to the TRUE events, as both were a bit different. Towards the end of Zero, the information seemed to be more in line with the Seal Team movie information. I enjoyed both accounts/movies for different reasons. After watching Zero a second time, I appreciated the drama, non spoken movements and acting. Definitely a movie to watch a second time for full benefit!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's cute for kids to play with, but gets boring very quickly for anyone over 10 years old. But it's free, so it's worth a try!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The commercial reviews say it's about rivalries and jealosies and such and nothing could be further from the truth.  It's a character study of many different people all at the same time---like life is.  The characters are multi-dimensional unlike most of the silly predictable rot that is mass manufactured for today's audiences.  There have been a couple silly things--like &#34;Patrick&#34; coming back from the dead then disappearing again,  and  the convenient death of Matthew's intended, but for the most part the story is gripping.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great entertainment, writing and acting are top notch,This show is very smart. It's funny, dramatic,The characters are engaging.The episodes just get better and better as more of each character's back-story comes out.
B001VNB54A|5.0|After Band of Brothers it came up to expectations.  The horror of war and the effects on the soldiers well documented.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Now I can bring minecraft with me! But It dose update slower then minecraft on a pc or computer or Windows. But overall this is a good app. I recommend this for other's. So I'm giving it five stars.
B004PIOYIW|4.0|The integration between 70's attitudes and 18 century life is amusing and interesting. I like it, but it is not for the fidgety or action addicts.
B0055OG2BC|4.0|I remember seeing this in the theater - and Herb Alpert and the TJB were about as hot as it got then. I bought this to &#34;complete&#34; my collection of James Bond movies on blu-ray. Product references for those who remember &#34;Contac tiny time pills&#34;, etc.,  are even funnier now than they were then. Unfortunately, a lot of the humor seems to be lost on younger generations. Maybe it's time for a new Bond spoof! Still loving it, though.
1594744769|5.0|This was an unusual book.  It was different from others I have read.  I would recommend it to others.<br />I bought  it because I viewed it on Amazon.
B0063M22QO|5.0|My wife is addicted!  She cannot stop playing the game though even she admits she is not very good at it.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|If you can forgive all the historical inaccuracies, most of the film is good. The car chase at the end is a joke
B003TTH4IU|5.0|This series catches you with it's characters (and their big egos).  The medicine is fun, but fantasy.  In the real world there is a lot of waiting, but on this show, they diagnose, MRI and do brain surgery between lunch and dinner.  Wow!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is lots of fun. I have been playing constantly since i got it. Don't need real money either!
B006HL9G10|1.0|For me it doesn't do what i thought it would do.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong.<br />I definetely would like something like this
B000HC2LI0|4.0|The show is awesome! One of the best shows ever, I think. I love the way that the discs come. The only problem I had is the the front cover of the box separated from the rest of the box. We just had to use some glue & now it's fine. Good value for all we got.
B005COO1X6|5.0|My wife's favorite author.  He is still the best.  The book was another great book in a long line of excellent books.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Style of filming makes this a hard film to watch and thus follow (and seven more words are required by Amamzon)
B002RV01QI|5.0|This is the CD you want playing while you're driving on a trip although I've enjoyed it even while I'm reading a book. Such easy listening music!
B00B10CT7A|3.0|Pretty interesting movie about surfing. The acting isn't anything to brag about, but it's not horrible either. There are some interesting tidbits of oceanic fact shared as a young man pursues his dream. Finding a good coach to help train for surfing &#34;maverick&#34; waves, the student becomes the teacher in the end. He set his goal; he trained and prepared hard, aiming higher than he thought he could go; and in the end he surfs the waves of his dream.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I ordered this for my husband's birthday as he is a huge Zeppelin fan.  It arrived right when expected and he was very happy with it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I enjoyed watching this film with my teen-age daughter.  Yes, there are some references to drugs and sex, but nothing so offensive that it cannot be acceptable to a yournger viewer.  They may not even understand all the references.  Most of the humor was geared to a younger audience so while my daughter totally loved this movie I was just meh.  Musically it was very well done.  I would watch it again.
B00005JNQA|5.0|Have seen at least 5x.Not very popular but great. Great actors.So happy about the pice too.You have to watch. wow.
B0032KPE0G|5.0|Classic British comedy film with feelgood factor - can watch over and over - bit like Sliding doors with Gwyneth paltrow
B00005K3OT|5.0|Chocolate & Johnny Depp - doesn't get much better that. DVD received on time so I can watch many times over.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|There are so many sources of information out there that it becomes overwhelming when trying to determine what's legitimately good advice and what's garbage.  This book is an incredibly well-explained narrative as to why your body responds the way it does to different stimuli.  I've been training for more than 10 years and thought I knew enough to effectively define my own workout routines and nutrition plans without specific direction as to what to do and how to do it.  While I found that a number of the author's points were things I considered myself to be familiar with, I was amazed at how many ruts I had fallen subject to because of \\"tribal-knowledge\\" passed down from friends and trainers.<br /><br />This book will take 100% of the guesswork and trial-and-error out of exercising.  I'm confident that if I had this knowledge from the get-go, I would be leaps and bounds ahead of where I am now.  If you've got the desire to change your body and plan to embark down that path, trust me when I tell you that this book is an essential resource.  Its greatest benefit is that it will prevent you from making crucial mistakes in and out of the gym.  The bottom line is that this information will keep you from wasting your time and getting frustrated.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After long search for a comfortable, convenient gaming mouse I found this one and gave it a try. I love it. The mouse fits into my hand perfectly and to my surprise the button placements are so well done I have not once accidentally pressed them. Very smooth and precise this mouse is well worth the money. The light of the anchor logo can be changed to many colors to suit whatever color you want. I highly recommend this product.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I didn't think they could possibly make a better movie, but they may have!  My family totally enjoyed watching this movie.  i am so glad I bought it, and didn't rent.  We will be watching it again!
B00827OWO8|5.0|Not for the kids in the family. Great. Diamond in the ruff. Love it. Would highly recommend.Chris Meloni is in it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season Three keeps you on the edge of your seat!  I cannot wait to see what happens next!  Story is highly engaging, the fear is real, and the characters keep you guessing.  A Must SEE!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|An interesting documentary about a man who makes wonderful music but never got famous here in the U.S.  In So. Africa his music caught on big time, but they never saw him perform and no one paid him royalties.  Now we all get a chance.  Don't miss this heartwarming story about a hard working, good soul of a man.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I thought this was very entertaining with a new story idea. The cast was great and the story kept moving without pause. Definitely worth a watch.
B00081U7HC|5.0|This movie is the best and my favorite movie of all time. No matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old. I recommend to anyone who loves and wishes they had that fairytale.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I have been an avid fan of Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson for many years.  While his solo work has struck me as more esoteric, and I have preferred Porcupine tree in general, this recording blew me away!  It hits you in the face with astounding bass and continues to amaze.  The flute is a wonderful, unexpected addition.  Thank you for reviving my faith in new music!  I had started to think it was all downhill now.......
B00BWJARHO|2.0|This version of The Hobbit was indeed An Unexpected Journey, it had so little relationship to Tolkien's original story.  More like the producers and/or director decided their movie had to have a more direct plot tie-in to the previously released Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The original Hobbit story wasn't a patch on the Lord of the Rings, but it was certainly a lot better than this cobbled together film.  Orcs, indeed!
B006CEKZ4Y|4.0|If you are reading this, you probably already know the movie well. Therefore I confine my review to the discs contained in this set.<br /><br />The presentation of the movie is clear and artefact free although I have seen a better print and indeed transfer on the UK Bluray. Contrast appears to be off on my set up (which features an Oppo 103EU Multi Region BD player and a Samsung DLP Projector throwing a 14 foot 16:9 picture with this movie pillar boxed to 4:3 within.)<br /><br />Sound is clear and the extras from early DVD releases make a reappearance although the amount of supplemental material is by no means exhaustive.<br /><br />If you are buying the movie on Blu-ray for the first time and would like an attractive commemorative package then this will be adequate - certainly its a step up from previous home video releases in lesser formats. I still believe that one day a better attempt at transfer will correct the bright, contrasty picture, but until then enjoy a wonderful movie that is not only interesting but a mastercalss in movie making 101.<br /><br />The packaging is very attractive.<br /><br />There is a three disc version available that adds an Orson Welles Bio pic that may be a more definitive - albeit more expensive - route to owning the movie.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Pitch Perfect has a great storyline and is laugh out loud funny. I have watched it many times and always find this movie hysterical.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I guess this just isn't my type of movie.  The cinematography was beautiful but I was disappointed with the end of the movie.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|If you're someone that has to carve some time out of your busy schedule to read, then do so with this book!  It's a love story--a bit weepy and romantic, but not traditional.  the author is British.  I hadn't heard of her, but now will read everything of hers that I can find.  I love British Chick Lit, and this one absolutely lived up to my high expectations.  The characters of Lou and Will have stayed with me in the weeks since I've read this book and they will for quite some time!  I escaped into their lives and enjoyed my stay.  I wish I could catch up with Louisa now and see how she's doing.<br /><br />Plan a vacation for yourself, or call im sick to stay in bed and read....this book is worth it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is really a good series, the story lines are captivating, and you can not wait to see the next episode. We watched the whole 1st season on a Saturday staying up til 4:00 am. Since we have watched season 2 and 3.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time and it is still going strong. Glad it was renewed next year!
B006GLN3WY|4.0|Great but only eight episodes which was a bit surprising.  Love this series, which I'm sure appeals way more to women than men.
B001ERMYCA|5.0|While not as good as their debut album Hybrid Theory, this is a solid follow up effort. Good album. y
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|Very Creative Story<br /><br />I enjoyed the journey to Everville.<br />I thought it was very easy to read and a creative story.<br />I enjoyed the characters in the story and the creatures of the lands of Everville and beyond.<br />It reminded me of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as it was creative and exciting in a world beyond ours.<br /><br />It was packed with action but I would have enjoyed more details on the club games and even the battles. They were exciting, I just desired more detail because it left me wanting to know more about the games, the flying creatures, and a description of Them.<br />I loved the imagery as the author described the scenes of the lands in Everville, the lands surrounding Everville, the campus, and the creatures.  Excellent job! The author's words easily painted pictures in my mind.<br /><br />I feel this book will be a great read for anyone who enjoys fantasy. I look forward to the next book in the series. I am sure it will satisfy some of my desires for more detail as the series unfolds. I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Charles Johnson Author of<br />[[ASIN:B009D767BM Love Poems and More From the Heart and Soul of Man]]

B002WY65VU|5.0|THIS WAS WHAT HE WANTED AND SO WE THOUGHT IF HE WANTS IT HE SHOULD HAVE IT.  AND SO NOW HE DOES.  WE HOPE HE LIKES IT.
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House is simply fantastic!  It's hard to believe this is the authors first novel.  With the turn of each page it engrosses you further and further until you cannot put the book down.  Very exciting and fast paced till the very end.  I highly recommend this book!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I purchased this just prior to Chris Kyle's senseless murder. Which I suppose, &#34;encouraged&#34; me to begin reading it immediately instead of finishing another. I am amazed by what a hero Chris Kyle really was. As down to earth as they come but ferociously loyal to his country, his team and his family. As I read into the book, I realize what a loss his death is, not just for those that knew him up close but for us all. Great book. Get it.
B004QMRHHW|5.0|Nothing not to like about this album. I haven't listen to much of this band, do I will now. Its like dethklok but better.
B002NT3B52|5.0|After all these years of dog companionship I found I was misinformed about so many of my beliefs. I love the scientific discussions and writing style that makes this so readable. When I adopt my next canine friend I will have new ways to train based on something more than my instincts.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|but I find it to be a bit quirky.  My 4 year old has a bit of a challenge playing it and I don't like that you have option to purchase things...you don't have to, but makes the game hang up every so often.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Downloaded this album for my daughter onto her MP3 player -- fairly painless process.  The good news is that Amazon will store all my downloaded albums in their cloud, so if she loses her player, I will be able to recover her contents without further expense.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|Lots of Exorcist plotline reworked with some elements from the classic Pandora's Box tale. This time a dybbuk — a malicious spirit in Jewish folklore (also spelled dibbuk) is the culprit. This movie is more of a combination of concepts from other tales nicely woven into a similar tale. There is a bunch of strings left loose and several WTF moments, but overall enjoyable. If you like your scary mixed with some religion, this might be your cup of kool-aid.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|new to temple run but I am addicted to this game great for hand and eye coordination great a lot of fun
B009ME47H2|2.0|The microphone does not receive sound adequately if one is more than 2 feet away from the Kindle Fire HD.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|In-depth discussions of the histories of all the players in the drama surrounding Lincoln's Cabinet. Insights from the cultural realities for each of them, plus some interesting references from citizens of the South and discussions about slavery.
B00APDABX8|5.0|The characters were very sympathetic and the pace was good. The story was very engaging and I didn't want it to end!
0345803485|3.0|It is an ordinary story  of a girl enjoying her dates with a rather eccentric tycoon which finally ends in a nightmare for her.  It may interest people who would like to read sex acts in minute details with no secretsbarred. Take off the sex in the story you can summarise the entire story in a couple of pages. Nevertheless one must give credit to the author for  her ability to express everything so lucidly.  I would not advise anyone to read this except for curiosity to see what is in it.
B0085157B8|1.0|I like breasts as much as the next guy, but geez, this is a movie that could have appealed to a larger audience if they were less obvious. My wife liked the other Piranha movies but this one she turned off after 5 minutes. You don't have to scream boobies boobies boobies all the time. It's enough to show them without pointing at them, zooming in on them and shaking them at the camera. They already have &#34;Girls Gone Wild&#34; so making &#34;Girls Gone Wild with some animated Piranhas&#34; was redundant. Never got to see Ving Rhames. BTW, when you have Ving Rhames, Clu Gallagher, David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd and Gary Busey, WHY put Danielle Panabaker & Katrina Bowden as the &#34;stars&#34;?
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Star Trek is one of the best series of all time especially next generation Captain Picard is the Man watch it and you'll fall in love
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|For people like me who grew up with the old simplistic version of Oregon Trail, this game to me is the adult version.  Fun play.  You need to devote time to build your town.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|One word to describe this series is &#34;fun.&#34;  It's like a wonderful ride that takes you up and down with lots of curves and spins.  And in my opinion, one of the most important ingredients is a satisfying ending, which Gossip Girl truly has.
B000ICZD5M|3.0|Then watch this.  It's got some corny 80's quirks but it's not too bad.  If you enjoy the books you can probably find some enjoyment here.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Saw this movie with my teenage daughters, but its really a comedy for the entire family.  Ended up just buying it and we've watched it many times together.  GREAT acting, funny writing and it never gets old!
1449433251|5.0|my 34 year old son requested the set for his birthday!  we have many paperback copies but it was worth splurging to get them as hard backs and as a set.
B008220D7S|5.0|I LOL from the first three minutes into the movie all the way through. Went with \\"the girls\\" one afternoon and it was a fun movie to see. I can't wait for the DVD!!
B009K6DKTS|1.0|So much vanity crammed into one book.  The hype surrounding this guy is unjustified.  Personal anecdote blended with self agrandizement.  Had to stop reading at 50%.  see guardian review.
0061997811|5.0|This book is incredible. Lots of concept art and behind the scenes information. It came with a few things (I just opened it and I already found a yule ball ticket and the map.) 10/10 would buy again.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well written easy read.  I enjoyed the history lesson.  Another reason to always thank a veteran and our people whom are serving now.  I truly am thankful for their sacrifices.  God bless
0446585041|2.0|I still haven't finished this book and I've been trying for weeks now.  It reads more like she's right in front of you....except she's not....so it gets lost in translation.
0547564651|5.0|Very well researched and written. Not enough is written that goes against the popular stream of thought and of that small amount, much is a mindless rant. This book stands out for the quality of its ideas and their presentation. One of my top ten books of the year; one that has changed my thinking.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I now see why the show does so well in the ratings every week. I am now a fan and will have to catch with the rest.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book and the movie but the book was so so so so so so so so much better
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|The opening credits were beautiful and true to the Bond tradition.  I love Adele, and her haunting Skyfall song just fit perfectly.  Daniel Craig was great again as Bond, although we got a little tired of them beating the &#34;old dogs&#34; theme.  Yes, he's older.  Can he still perform?  That seemed to be the central taunt of the movie, and it did get a bit tiresome.  Also (spoiler), I expected more of a story with the love interest; as her life ended abruptly, there was no more story.  That was disappointing.  Overall, I would recommend this to a friend.  A very enjoyable date movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book took a while to get used to the way it was written.  Back and forth between two points of view was hard to get used to.  There were some good story lines and had mystery and some good plots....but the end had me lacking.  I think if it ended better I would have enjoyed it more.  Well...on to the the next filler book until I find something I really like.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Very strong book but well written.  Couldn't put it down.  It has some very strong scenes that are not for the weak of heart and I had a hard time at some points, but it is an excellent book, totally different from the general.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|A story of young adolescence, this is a quirky and funny movie with a great cast! Well worth the time and money!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Fun read - like a Percy Jackson for adults.  Characters are very likeable, quirky, and extreme and often made me think, &#34;what if.&#34;
B00571F26Y|4.0|Easy to read and understand. Easy &#34;how-to&#34; on getting started and what to expect.  Great recipes as well. Looking forward to being wheat-free.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Not sure what it was about this book that made me like it as much as I did, but I found myself recommending it to friends and family.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|To much travel log to little story<br />I swore off after Up Country but got bit again.<br />Used to be one of my favorites.
B002RKRGQ2|5.0|P.G. Wodehouse at his best.  A good laugh, excellent read and real literature!! I totally recommend this book as a must for the home library.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|You have to go to a website to get directions on how to use the stuff which is kind of lame.  The directions were good, but didn't really give me a good indication of how much I should use.  I used 75% of the tube.  To much?  To little?  I don't know, but my machine has been running great ever since I put it on.  Great for those buyers who have an overheating computer and/or are replacing a fan.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|Works great. Have had several friends purchase as a result of trying mine.<br />A little chubby but that is the charm.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|Charming, unpredictable, with a complex plot that keeps you wondering what will happen. Among my favorite movies. - Author Claudia Newcorn
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|My 6 y/o son really enjoyed this movie. Lots of action to keep him interested - he doesn't like movies where there is a lot of character talking and nothing else happening. From an adult perspective, the storyline is intriguing in that these guardians are out there to protect children from fear. There were several scenes where the characters discuss the importance of protecting the children because they are the future and no one wants to live in a future filled with fear.  This was a movie I would recommend and watch again.
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading this series since it first started being published, and it's been quite a journey. With the death of the original author, Robert Jordan, I was saddened and dismayed - and initially resolved to the idea of never seeing the conclusion of what is probably one of the greatest fantasy series of our time. Seeing a new author brought in to complete the series made me nervous - I was predisposed to dislike anything not crafted by Jordan's own hands (even if the manuscript had largely already been written).<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson does a wonderful job bringing Jordan's work to life, and, in an incredibly successful way, maintaining the essential palette of the characters without attempting to &#34;be&#34; Jordan. In the final two books (where this is the latter of two), Sanderson does masterful work - you can feel the craftsmanship throughout.<br /><br />This is a long and fairly sophisticated series - but well worth the read. Probably a best fit for mid-teen readers through young adults. If you like epic fantasy, you won't be disappointed.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|This is not for the weak of heart, but it really gave me an completely different insight to the story of Biafra and Nigeria.  And it is very well written, good narrative.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Acting, Production Values, Set design ...  all around excellent!  Gives an amazing glimpse of historical England. I highly recommend this series.
B0087GZ8YW|2.0|Just not up to his former quality and too simplistic a plot--hope future books will be an improvement or not write at all
B008476HBM|5.0|I love Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy! I especially love how Austen explains what becomes of our silly characters after their engagement, for some reason the movies and miniseries always leave those parts out.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|This isn't a guy movie by any stretch, but for some reason (and not the obvious one of the attractive female lead) I liked this movie a lot more than my wife did. She felt it dragged and she was frankly turned off by the subject matter. I thought it was moving, but yes, I thought it dragged some at times as well. I'm glad I rented it, though. I'd give it 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4).
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I'm not one to leave reviews, but I feel the need for this book. I loved the first two books and bought this one the day it came out. I finished it before that day was over and was severely disappointed. While the writing and story telling and what not were as expected, then ending was lame. I was unbelievably let down and rather sorry that I had spent money on such a horrible ending. I would definitely buy and read the first two books, but skip this one and envision whatever sort of ending you like. Anything imagined would be better than the way Requiem ended the story.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|What an amazing story, such a humble man, how can you not like the guy. Musically at the time he was phenomenal, escapes me how come he did not make it big in the USA. Good on the guys from South Africa for search for Sugar Man. I grew up listening to Rodriguez in SA.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|A Wonderful show. loved it, it was really a great sh ow and I recommend it as a family show.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|As I said before  its unbelievable simplistic plot with the most superficial characters is a sad ending(at least it should be) of a great story teller-should quite while he is ahead or really work at it based on his great talent
B001ENS0BI|5.0|I watched this show when it came out a few years ago over the 4 years it was on and it was great. It was totally different to watch the entire series again back to back. This show is one of the BEST to come out of FOX.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Well, I guess he finally had to have a let down. I can barely read 30 pages at a time of this dull uneventful novel. I'm only reading it so I won't be lost when I get to book 5.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read all three books back to back and gotta say... what a fun read!  Although I personally liked the 1st two books a wee bit better, Suzanne Collins did a great job wrapping up the stories (although I must admit I was ready for more).
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|As a huge fan of Peter Jackson's LOTR films, I had mixed thoughts going into \\"The Hobbit.\\" The novel simply is not the stuff for a movie trilogy. With almost universal condemnation of Jackson's high speed filming efforts, I was expecting \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" to be as bad as George Lucas' revisiting the Star Wars Universe in \\"The Phantom Menace.\\"<br /><br />So do we have Bilbo Binks here? Not quite. The high speed filming works on the landscapes but simply doesn't work on the actors. Fake feet and prosthetic noses look like too much like fake feet and prosthetic noses when all is said and done. The plot does seem a bit stretched out. Even with some new scenes setting the stage for the LOTR movies, I can see two films here but not three.<br /><br />The cast is solid. Martin Freeman is fine as Bilbo. Ian McKellan slides back nicely into the role of Gandalf. Richard Armitage is solid as Thorin Oakenshield. Cameos of characters from the original trilogy--Ian Holm, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee and Elijah Woods--are excellent. Andy Serkins once again amazes as Gollum in the high point of the movie. A host of dwarves get their moments but the only one who truly gets fleshed out is Balin, excellently played by Ken Stott.<br /><br />It's certainly fun to revisit old friends like Gandalf and Elrond. With so many familiar locations--the Shire, Rivendell, even what appears to be Weathertop--fans of the original films should enjoy this movie even if it does not match the magic of the LOTR films. Still, while there are some fun action scenes at the end, the movie drags a little too much to be great and the high speed filming is often distracting. If not a great film though, there`s enough in \\"An Unexpected Journey\\" to recommend it.
B000059T5O|5.0|I listened to my daughters for a long time before I had to have my own. I just wish I knew what the lyrics mean.
B001EC2IV2|5.0|it is a very great movie filled with a great cast of stars maybe one of arnolds best just buy
B005HSL626|5.0|app is very easy to use for my 5 year old son and he has tons of fun playing it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Book three is the best of the first 3 books. It's a thrill ride from the first page til the last.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; I couldn't imagine where S. Collins would take the story.  &#34;Catching Fire&#34; definitely does not disappoint.  The world she creates just jumps off the page.  Can't wait to see the movie adaptation.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|On paper, Justin Timberlake trying a more soulful sound in \\"20/20 Experience\\" should be a disaster--but he pulls it off pretty well here. Granted, Timberlake has a well regarded team behind him including Timbaland but this is a solid album despite being a little on the long side. \\"Pusher Love Girl,\\" \\"Suit and Tie\\" (Jay-Z pops up on this song), and \\"Mirrors\\" are all excellent. Some of the songs-- \\"Don't Hold the Wall\\" and \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\"--go a little long but the music changes up a bit which helps keep the listener's interest.  I was expecting the album to be more syrupy pop. Instead, it has a classic R/B feel that might disappoint some of his fans but suits Timberlake fairly well. Seven minute songs generally aren't the norm today but somehow Timberlake pulls it off more often than not. All together a fairly solid album as Timberlake offers a revised take on blue eyed soul.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It was great.  I watched the entire series in one day.<br />Now i plan to watcher series three.<br />thank you
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a great game. Got it when it was faotd. I'm so glad I gave it a try.  It 's a great game. The graphics are great. The storyline keeps you wanting to play more. A very good match 3 game that is good fun. Good work Playrix.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game.  It is so addicting.  When you start playing you don't want to quit.  My husband and I play it together.  Quality time together.
159420411X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book about predictions. It's loaded with statistics in a way that most people can understand. It's also well written and filled with engaging anecdotes in so many areas: the economy, sports, weather, earthquake predictions, chess, and the war on terrorism. There were times in the second half of the book that pieces went on a little long, or seemed overly repetitive. That's the one reason I am giving this only four stars. The good stuff is really good, and it was very entertaining as well as informative. It's a 4.5 star read to me.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|This book was great! Barely put it down once I got started. Definately one of my fave nicholas sparks novels!
B00BKTFABE|5.0|This app works great simple to operate and navigate its several features that enhance your picture taking experience. Beats the OEM app that comes preinstalled.<br />The pictures look really nice.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Ben has produced a gem, proving his getting snubbed at the Oscars. Very enjoyable to watch.<br />Exciting and well acted out
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this CD, did't like the selection of songs at all. This was not an entertaining CD for me.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|It's a long movie. Almost 3 hours. it starts slowly and takes a little while to develop. There is a lot of back story to explain. Your patience will be rewarded, though.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This is a must have in anyone's movie collection. I am so glad I was able to get it at such a great price.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|Jack Frost was wonderful. The Santa need some work. But over all it was a good movie. Thank you for your time.
B001QFZADA|5.0|I never thought that I would be able to figure out what is going on in my life... Thank you
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Before I felt very unhappy, but now I see a new pathway to life. I now am transformed, and I will be forever grateful.
B00000K2UX|5.0|I sent this to my daughter in NC and she loved it!!!  She had never had the CD so i surprised her as a &#34;just because I love you&#34; gift, she was so surprised!
1577311523|5.0|Reading this book for the second time, and I am getting it! Maybe 5 years ago I couldn't connect with it, but now I can't get enough!<br />This is the greatest aid in helping me 'awaken' and stay present. Byron Katie 'Loving what is' is also a great combination in assisting me. And Don Miguel Ruiz \\"the Voice of Knowledge\\" was important stepping stone in my 'getting it'.<br />Happy Awakening!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am so excited that this wholesome show  is popular with all generations.  Beware!  It is addicting.  Can't wait for Season 4 to start.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|NO one beats the first two James Bonds ( Sean C. and Roger Moore.) It was a nice movie to watch.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is truly an inspiration to be able to look deep inside yourself to find the love that you were meant to have!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Zombie movie with an outstanding story line.  You cannot get enough!!!  This is wonderful for the mind.  Did I say I Love It!!!!!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This movie was the bomb.  The quality and the price were great as well.  I am looking forward to enjoying the movie many times over
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Great movie!  Highly recommend, in fact I've been recommending this movie to everyone.  The movie is funny, not sad in the least.  I already watched it again!
B0035YTG30|4.0|Nice film.. black and white films are way different from today's colored film.. really enjoyed watching it second time.. Both Gregory Pack and Audrey Hepburn were good in their roles
B000TETKA8|5.0|Scary Monsters is a tour de force.  Like many Bowie fans, I skipped over this one when it was released and only recently picked it up.  I was delighted.  The depth and strength of his catalogue is simply amazing.  And he is still doing it with The Next Day.  Brilliant.  Another album from Bowie's later period that is worth the time and attention - Heathen.
B004X2M9VY|4.0|I'm enjoying watching this with my family. The show is well written, with plenty of plot twists and story arcs that are unexpected. Sometimes is seems like there is no sense to it, and then in the end the writers pull a rabbit out of the hat and it all comes together.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This chapter of the series had me reading through the night. Much better than A feast for crows. However I feel lost. Prepare to be left with as many unanswered questions as to when you started.
B000P5FH3K|5.0|One of Grisham's best and a awsome movie based on the book  Great cast and exposes really what the health insurance industry is all about.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is really good and it is free !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (: everyone should buy this it is so real life like
B0053EOFHW|5.0|Neil Burger does a terrific job directing Limitless and Bradley Cooper owns the lead role. Limitless took it lumps from the cinema snobs but I theorize that that was more due to ripple from Inception in 2010 and Bradley Cooper overload between 2010-2011 with A-Team, Hangover 2 and Limitless all hitting within a 12 month span.  Limitless is an excellent movie with a cool story.  Most defiantly worth adding to any movie collection.
1400069289|5.0|I had seen this book in my dealers' stops and had considered reading it based upon its title.  An associate gave me a copy, as it had been a read he found to be helpful; thus the decision was made as to this being one of the business books I would read this year.  A better choice could not have been made.  The only regret I had in reading this book now is that I did not read it when I first became aware of it.<br /> Mr. Duhigg, an award winning, investigative journalist, does his profession proud in this deeply researched, clearly written, easily accessed book dealing with how deeply one's life is directed by habit.  His research indicates that a habit, once formed, will influence one's life for the rest of one's life.  Even if other behaviors are created to \\"correct\\" a habit, the original behavior will remain \\"dormant\\" and can be renewed if the old routine is renewed.  Habits are created when one has a \\"cue\\" to enact a behavior, a \\"routine\\" is developed leading to a \\"reward;\\" when the reward is strong enough, or has been experienced for a sufficient duration, a \\"craving\\" for the reward is created.  The \\"craving\\" becomes the default for the enacting of the routine, to the point where the individual can (will) follow the \\"habit\\" without being aware of having taken any action or of how to stop the action if awareness is made.<br />The only way to change a habitual behavior is to change the \\"routine\\" step of the habit - the \\"cue\\" and \\"reward\\" remain the same (therefore the \\"craving\\" will be satisfied) but the behavior has changed. The author suggests, and he is meticulous in siting supportive research, that the effect of habits in communities and culture are entrenched in the same manner as they are in individuals and the change in routine is central to altering the habit.<br /> Lest the reader is lured into the illusion that this book offers easy ways to change habitual behavior, Mr. Duhigg is quick to point out (and repeats often) that changing such ingrained activity requires a desire and deep commitment to change.  Any change will not happen quickly and the new routine must be practiced consistently and frequently or the old \\"pathways\\" will reassert themselves.  The author uses Alcoholics Anonymous, the Coach Tony Dungy in his tenure with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Indianapolis Colts, Rick Warren (founder & pastor of Saddleback Community Church) and the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's (to name but a few) as illustrations of how habits of culture and society can change and to show how long that transformation can take before it is \\"ingrained.\\"<br /> I have found myself using much of the information offered in this book in my work.  Hearing the frustration in the voices of individuals and couples who are acting in ways that are harmful, yet seeming to have no idea how they continue to behave in ways that are, at least, unproductive can be heart breaking.  Listening with the understanding of how \\"habits work,\\" I can offer new ideas in helping them to develop a plan for change.  This empowerment is worth the investment of time to read this book.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is such a great show!  A good mix of SciFi, humor, and creepy aliens to be the best show.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Again, I like Matt Damon and these series of movies.  I would never buy or watch the fourth Bourne movie because it doesn't have Matt Damon in it.  Thats just wrong....
B00000DWHG|5.0|Every time our four dogs hear the theme song from CSI:LasVegas they jump up and start \\"singing\\" along.  They throw their heads back and howl with the music without our even prompting them.  I surely didn't know that dogs could recognize a particular  song out of all of the noise that bombards them, but they do!!!!  We bought the disc for them!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app/game for the young and old. I use this to entertain the youngins, and don't mind playing along with them!
B00005JN0T|5.0|A great rockum-sockum robot movie. It is another Smith movie, and he certainly knows how to pick 'em.<br />Great cast.
B007R6X9IK|5.0|If you are a fan of Dave Gahan, I highly recommend this CD! His lyrics are excellent and his voice is amazing!!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Excellent show! On the edge of my seat just waiting for the next shocker with each episode. Awesome! Love it! Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good &#34;I can't believe that just happened&#34; type of show.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|I like Matt Damon in this movie.  I am never crazy about #2 movies, but this was handled in a way that makes you want to watch it.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|It was fantastic!!! in all ways!! I played Lord of the Rings online game and it was just like the game followed the map so I knew where we were at all times, can hardly wait for the other two.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is AWESOME I love it. I'm not a artist but I can give a sentence that would give them the hint that it's that word. Like say the word is Kool. . . My sentence would be I love K___ aid. I totally say GET IT GET IT GET IT BUY IF BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000YMFCS4|5.0|One of the BEST love story. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are the best young couple ever. Romantic, sexy, lovable and truly wonderful. I watch it every couple of months.
B0095P29EG|3.0|Not a great movie but entertaining and relaxing when you don't want to think about anything until the next morning.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Wish they had included the part from the book where AFTER Pi has secretly become a practicing Hindu AND a Muslim AND a Catholic, he is surprised by simultaneous &#34;pastoral&#34; visits from a pandit, an imam, and a priest - each of whom had assumed that Pi's devotion to deity was exclusively orthodox within their own parochial systems.
B00942X8PY|4.0|This game definitely challenges your problem solving ability. If your looking to keep your mind sharp and thinking outside the box give this a shot.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Having arthritic fingers, this solved my problem with texting.  I love the way it allows me to text quickly without mistakes.
B007QDNKQA|2.0|We like Mark Wahlberg and Danny Glover, but found this to be a depressing movie.  No redeeming qualities for us.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game for challenging your mind! It passes time easily when you wish to relax and gear down from the mundane. Absolutely love all the angry bird games
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check weather each morning before preparing for my day. I find it invaluable. Would be lost without it. Great.
B0016OLC5Q|3.0|A friend of mine recommended this movie to me after I've mentioned that I like adventure movies. I probably should have also mentioned that I like them with happy ending. This movie was more on a depressing side and thought me that happiness can only be real if shared with someone... loaded food for thought here, I know. So, if you into more of a drama, you might like it. Honestly, I enjoyed 47 Hours much more!
B00846WWVM|5.0|My 8 year old and 6 year old love this game. It a great way to help them learn to problem solve!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Our book club read this book last month and the opinion was split.  Some loved it and others hated it.  I was so upset at the ending, I wanted to destroy the book.  The characters are lunatics and so are the individuals that read it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|A few weaker episodes, but overall still a strong series in season 3.<br />The building to the season final is being drawn out a bit.<br />Still it keeps you interested.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Great app, but I would definitely spend the money for paid version. Does so many calculations and love that it does conversions as well. Pick this one up.!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Take it from someone that listens to and owns everything from Alternative to Zydeco... this CD is the ISH!  EVERY SONG!  EVERY SONG IS THE BOMB.  Slow, mid-tempo and club bangers... he has it covered.  You have to give credit where credit is due!  As we say here in my south... \\"he done kilt it!  he done kilt it DEAD!\\"  \\"That's all I have to say about that\\"!
B003OUXECE|3.0|Started off with a lot of promise but tried to do too much at the end.  Still enjoyed it though.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. It was not what I expected and the ending has left me wanting more. Not much more you could ask for.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|I like the plots but the Jack Reacher character is too predictable for me...he always gets the girl, he never loses a fight, he stays in these small towns where something bad is going on. I get the nomad life and adventure, but I'm bored with knowing that he's in a new place where there is evil and some woman, with whom he will eventually be intimate, will help him solve the mystery. I've only read four novels in the series (not in sequential order), and I think I'm done hoping for more intrigue.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|well written and researched. poses many intriguing questions. unlike most books of this sort, also offers answers to the questions.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I like Stephen King anyway and The Long Walk was a good read. Started reading it and could not put down.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I downloaded this because the weather channel updated their app and I can not stand the lay out of the new app.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I Think this game is well worth having. It is fun to play and easy as well. I would highly recommend it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|THIS FILM WAS EXCELLENT.AN ORIGINAL STORY WHICH WAS EXCITING FROM BEGINNING TO END, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM.  BEN AFFLECK IS AN EXCELLENT DIRECTOR,
B00B99KJR0|1.0|App won't install on my Kindle Fire. I have restarted twice and attempted install multiple times. disappointed,  I was looking forward to trying out this game.
B00296A4F4|5.0|My children watched all seasons probably 3 times over.  Great dance/music drama with a light touch of social issues for young viewers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so good that no game bets it and you should buy survivor craft to it is like mind craft but cheaper.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What is there to say about this show that hasn't already been said....truly top of the line entertainment...the quality cast. scripts,<br />historical set and fashions, and moved on at a good pace. Priced too high for renting or buying at this time but will look to<br />purchase down the road.  British television has the best writer and shows..I should add BBC to my viewing channels...Wake<br />up american writers, we need better quality shows.
B007EECSFA|5.0|It kept me interested from start to finish with a tale going between current time and 1940's. Loved the end!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is addicting! I have been playing this game non-stop since I got it. I haven't had any issues with this game on my Kindle. Love this game! It is even better than most 3 match games because there is a story to follow too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the story line and where it's going. I like how some of the lesser important characters are coming into their own as time goes by. I love me some good zombie killing. haha!
B00018D44U|5.0|I love Nora Jones's singing. She has a real bluesy style and plays several instruments. She also has a great band.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|With Science FIction you never know what is going to happen next. It is quite gross at times, but I really enjoyed the story line and the characters.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|This was the second time I read it. It was even better than I remembered.Its now in the library. Thanks
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I dont have any issues with this connector.  The connector holds to the magsafe connector securely.  It beats buying a power adapter.
B0092ZEIN4|5.0|I bought this for lunch at work, i had purchesed a Google/Asus Nexus 7 and had been playing around with emulators when i decided i needed a controller for Mario Cart 64 and various other games from childhood. I charged it once, and it lasted probably a month or so with average use.<br /><br />The controller is rather small, but when you get used to it, it's okay.<br /><br />The app it is supposed to come with has a tendancy to &#34;break&#34; it, what i mean is, it prevents the controller from connecting to the tablet (I don't know if this just happens for the Nexus or other devices). If you do install it, you will have to completly wipe your device. So just connect it.... without the app and it should be fine.<br /><br />Now i won't deduct points for this but, for my nintendo 64 emulator, i can't set the C- buttons anywhere, which prevents me from playing some games. As far as Super Nintendo/NES games, it works great. As soon as you get the flow of the controller down, it's really nice.<br /><br />Plus when everyone sees what you're playing, they all want to join in :D<br /><br />Am going to buy another one in the future for 2 player, should have got one before PAX East 2013 to help while waiting in line. But oh well.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Totally hooked on this series. I just started watching from the pilot a couple of weeks ago and am almost caught up to the current episodes.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game. It's the good ol game from the pc. Pauses when you exit. Stable. Works good on my Uscell Note2.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The cast, the acting, the scenery, the costumes are all fantastic! I had never heard of Downton until this year it has been nice to watch all at once.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Truly enjoyed the series...can't wait to see the next season. My favorite character is Tyrion Lanister who seems to possess a lot more honor than the whole of his family.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I like both this unit and the X-Y microphone configuration it uses. Sound quality is crisp and clean. Also good for recording entire rooms.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Works well.  I have to write 14 more words, so I am writing them, not because I want to. There
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. It has all the things I require for a fun game. It has the hidden objects and the tasks outside of hidden objects. It keeps a steady stream of quests to keep me interested.
1612191290|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in the last few years and it has been very stimulating for our book club.<br /><br />Well laid out, challenging, accessible, and truly a superb find for those that like to have their perspective challenged by one of today's top thinkers.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Good story, but quite violent. It disturbes me that this is marked to young adults. It was recommended to me by someone who works with 12 year old girls and I just can't wrap my brain around why a young woman would be so into this book.
B0053FANQS|4.0|My wife had someone stole this movie. She really likes the series so I bought it again and it was fairly priced
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My son is a big Angry Birds fan and this kept him busy during my grocery shopping runs so it's a keeper!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|This show is very entertaining but would be so much better if it were on a premium channel. It can be edgy or poignant at times but is limited by its prime time constraints.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|this book is one of a kind i love the charecters and there is no languege ! which suprises me it is verry detailed and a apropriat read i recomend ages 11& up a realy gripping series i hope you like it and i encourage you to read it with parent permission enjoy:)
B0083Z614S|5.0|Thank you it is exactly as I wanted and was recommended from another friend. Shipping fast. Thanks again for your entry.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|A hungry shark who eats people as they scream? Why didn't I think of this?! I downloaded this as an option for a long flight. I spent 3 solid hours playing. And I still want more! The graphics are great, playability is easy, and it keeps getting harder so you don't get bored.
B000OVLBEO|4.0|The original always a classic. I would recommend this movie to your customers. I bought it once before it it was stolen so I had to replace it
B0000DKKY4|5.0|I've been a fan of Cat Stevens for decades but there were cuts on here I hadn't heard before. As always, immaculate performance on every tune.
1579128149|5.0|I have never seen the Table of Elements like this before.  This book is so beautiful, I can't say enough about it.  I leave it on my coffee table and everyone who picks it up and opens the book is quickly amazed at the gorgeous photographs for each element, and the short description on the sidebars.  My son is also a Chemistry student in high school and this book is a very nice reference with real pictures of how each element is in their raw form as well as what it may be used for.  We loved the book so much that we bought the deck of cards too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is not the type of story I would normally go for.  Books with such a premise can so easily become melo-dramatic, cliche, and just plain depressing.  So it's a tribute to Green's writing that he can take what could have been a cheesy &#34;A Walk To Remember 2&#34; and instead create a lovely and engaging story that had me both laughing and crying in spite of myself.  Absolutely recommend.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Could not put it down, had to know what would happen next can't wait to see book three on HBO.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|What a surprise!  I never knew where this was going. Lots of twists and turns.  The destination descriptions were an added bonus.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|Great story, be careful what you wish for you just might get it. Excellent movie and has truth to life lessons as well
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Everyone was talking about this and I was stuck at home with a sick child so I downloaded this series.  The quality is excellent and the series is sooooo addicting!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This is a great movie...with a realistic depiction of alcoholism and treatment...Denzel gives an Oscar worthy performance.  Goodman is hysterical as the drug dealer, and very realistic as well!!!  Lots of attention to the little details that make this a fuller picture of real life experiences instead of just dialogue telling you what is going on....highly recommended...
6305696071|5.0|Been wanting this movie for a long time.  I watch it over and over again.  Excellent condition.  Well worth the money.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very enjoyable...So nice to watch a whole season at my leisure. The story is awesome, the acting great and the characters are well done. All in all a very good series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was easy to get involved in this series. The acting is great and the storyline keeps you coming back.<br />It is almost like a soap opera set in the early 1900s England.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|This band is an excellent find. Anyone customers wondering whether or not it's worth buying it, the answer is yes
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Sweet and more than usual for the long-term effects of this technology and new release of the greatest fallacies in life faithful to all of my dreams.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|This movie seem to miss the boat at reproducing the book in this movie adaptation.  It started out as a convoluted mess that couldn't seem to make up it mind in direction in either the story or how the story was told.  It seem to borrow from elements of other movies to tell its story when it could have just stuck to the book version and told a better tale.  It did seem to right its way a bit about halfway through the movie and start telling a story that you wanted to see but by then it was too late and I was already lost and disinterested.  The movie lacked an emotional tug and had too many stretches of inconsequential scenes and I thought was way too long.  Unfortunately this is a movie of what could have been instead of what it turned out to be.  Full of promise but unfortunately was a broken one.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Recommend this chick flick.  Sandra Bullock does a wonderful job with emotion and connection with viewers.  Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Love the writing style and characters and the story was great. Almost believable for real life. Can't wait to read the next two.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Loved this book. It gets down into gritty details of a young girl's life, which are disturbing, but then it lifts you up and out of yourself. Wonderful. :)
B004EPYZQC|4.0|great movie just trying to get my wife's collection in order. I would recommend other customers buying it. good find
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Great free alarm, but does have a &#34;bug&#34; in it.  Sometimes it does not go off.  Also, very easy to hit stop vs. snooze.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|Highly recommended!  While very unrealistic, this show provides great entertainment and keeps the viewer guessing until the end.  I thoroughly enjoyed the season.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I so enjoyed watching this series.  I immediately purchased season 3 upon finishing season 3, it was so good.  I am recommending it to all my friends.
B00607EWYC|3.0|Read this for Book Club.<br />I had a hard time staying focused at times.  I am not sure I would recommend it to others.  Will be discussing it at meeting today, so am interested to see how others percieved it.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Love it! I watch it almost every day!!!! Fat Amy is my favorite! It's the new Mean Girls. So quotable and hilarious!
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|This movie is an excellent choice. It combines robots with fighters and makes for an excellent dramatic sequence one after another
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My finance owns his own company so I wind up going on business outings with him a lot only to find myself bored when it gets down to the technecalities of everything. But since Ive gotten my Kindle Fire this is one of the few real free games Ive found that can keep me entertained for hours on end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story & costumes..  Not my usual fare, but great vewing...  Don't peek And wait for the end...  Good stuff
0385349947|5.0|As the author of \\"Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy\\" about the incomparable Michael Jackson, I sometimes feel like I've \\"come through the fire!\\"  During my career, which has included a variety of jobs in education and psychology, I have dealt with controversy and conflict on a regular basis.  When you \\"lean in,\\" as this author explains in a compelling manner, it's not always pretty!<br />The time is right for a national discourse on the topics that Ms. Sandberg covers in this thought-provoking and inspirational book.  Women can learn the behaviors that she encourages in order to advance their careers and maximize their contributions.  I recommend this book to all ages of women... and to men, too.  Even for those who have retired or are nearing the end of their professional career, the recommendations in this book can be used to mentor younger women, who can actively implement them.  Everyone will benefit.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is the worst you should a least get the jack pot some times not the 1billion times. Njjjhhhggggggggvgggvvgggggg g gt Yggdrasil. Ggtvvvgv. Vggg.  Bgyh.  B.  Bub.  Hy bbuikhgttbbyv this game sucks
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|GOOD, BUT THIS PICTURE DID NOT NEED TO HAVE THE NAKED PARTS IN THIS PICTURE, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OUR VALUES......  THIS DOES NOT MAKE A  EXCELLENT MOVIE....... THANKS
B001FSDOZO|5.0|One of my favorite albums and WWE uses a lot of of their songs. This cd is worth the money.
B000PMG16U|5.0|The disc's play good, no problems with them. As far as the movies go, they are pretty good though I think the old ones are better. The third movie is pretty good though.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|The Bee Gees are fantastic,love there songs,but unfortunitly Barry is the only one left,so sad The new generation willo never know how wonderful they were.
B004NOH9LC|1.0|This is one of the worst films I have EVER seen!!! I have been checking the minute bar every 3 mins to see if its almost over yet and minimizing the screen to check my email and facebook constantly, for some relief from this garbage.  Absolutely aweful movie
B0006L0LOS|5.0|Great,Great,Great.The movie was great and the time I received it was all so great.  I had to have the movie I know I'm late ordering it but it was a great movie.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|ARGO HAS MY VOTE FOR THIS PICTURE.....  RECOMMEND THIS ALWAYS TO ADULTS, NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER 17 YRS BECAUSE TOO MUCH DIRTY LANGUAGE/......
B0071WQ7WU|4.0|This album is almost brand new and if you love the band then you will love this album, buy it today
B001UJIMM8|5.0|A must have for any Megadeth Fan with a Turntable (or just a collector). Sound quality at its finest. One of their greatest albums with songs including Into the Lungs of Hell, Set the World Afire and In My Darkest Hour... you must have this.<br /><br />Packaging comes exactly identical to that one of PEACE SELLS... BUT WHO'S BUYING? and RUST IN PEACE, except for the artwork, everything is exactly the same; It includes a box-sized card with the lyrics and pictures of the record band, and the disc in its white, protective sleeve. Although one thing I don't like, placing the discs back in the box is a hell of a job, each time you take it out and put it back in you risk damaging the box, that's why over the years they deteriorate a lot.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|it has been fun for the kids to play this game.  The little pets are so cute and do lots of fun stuff.
B004XISI4A|5.0|This series keeps getting bettter and better. I ca not wait for the next book to come uout. Keep them coming George.
B001974DG0|5.0|As  an avid Koontz reader, I can say with absolute certainty that this is his masterpiece. I have read probably 80% of his work, and none of them have come close to the joy of reading Watchers. Read this book, you will NOT be disappointed!
B00190OHD6|5.0|I gave this movie the highest rating you had . I absolutly love this movie its funny its sad its every thing you could want in a good movie I truly wish they would make second movie. No matter how many times I watch it I never get tired of it
B0076L9W9Q|4.0|Lizzy is the lead singer of this band she not only can sing but she is bad as hell and sexy
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|It was too short and I couldn't even try out more than a couple things. The demo ends after the first day and I was just disappointed. :/
B008TMA1LY|4.0|the game has a lot to do.  It is alot of fun and the graphics are terrific for little girls
0802798225|3.0|Whew! I really worked Google translate with this one!<br /><br />Still ... I am on the fence not certain which side to climb down on.<br /><br />The book was real, I'll give it that, but I just didn't get the connection I was looking for. It was devoid of most emotions or at least devoided, (not sure if it's a real word) , me of most emotions.<br /><br />The conversations between Brittany and her parents were, flat, non-emotional and very surreal if you ask me. I never once saw a family. If that was the aim, it was brilliantly executed!<br /><br />So ... the Spanish ... hmmm .... that was a love hate relationship. I loved learning bits of Spanish, but it got annoying at times when it was a full on sentence and I have to type it out in Google translate. I understand the element it adds to the book and while it is truly appreciated, it was also truly frustrating. But it's charms won me over, so I think I'd love to do it again because to get a good story and get a language lesson in one sitting is rare indeed!<br /><br />I think the story line was a nice twist from your usual high school stories, and it was Alex's side of the story that I looked forward to the most. He kept me on my toes and if you really asked me, brought out most of the emotions that I felt in this book (which were few).<br /><br />Brittany ... Brittany ... I'm with Isa on this one, it is definitely possible to dislike her character, but then on the other hand you just can't. I was annoyed and pissed with her decisions a lot of the times. I feel as though she is very naive and her naivety is what got *spoiler alert* Paco killed.<br /><br />The supporting characters, had their times, but I believe that if Sierra and Doug were completely excluded and Paco and Carmen given more parts, it would make one spicy book!<br />I am also really sorry that * spoiler alert* Isa and Paco didn't get a chance to even get their own story ... because I believe they out of every one else in this book deserved a sequel all for them!<br /><br />The end of the book, I felt was really rushed and the timeline for the epilogue was just ridiculous! Made even more so by the fact that it wasn't even about Alejandro (I like his given name) :) and Brittany.<br /><br />However, it wasn't as enticing as previous reviews led me to believe, but it surely caught and kept my attention though. Especially with all the Spanish all up in there!<br /><br />Not so certain if I would continue the series, but I have an open mind and think that if you don't mind a real story, with a few bumps on the way, then it's a comfortable read.ll for them!<br /><br />The end of the book, I felt was really rushed and the timeline for the epilogue was just ridiculous!

B0042U94UQ|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie before the kids were allowed to.  What fun.  A few story lines all intertwined, and the most adorable creatures helping the male lead character.
0553801473|5.0|I love this series of books.  I really enjoy reading them.  If you like midevil/fantasy then you'll love this series.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Read this book! Ignore reviews that call it boring or a departure from the series. There is a lot going on and if you skip ahead to \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" you will find holes in the story. I enjoyed this book as much as the other four. A fantastic journey full of plots and twists, just as any fan of the series would expect.
B00969PR18|4.0|I hate having to use my computer for it all and memorize all the routes, so It's nice that my kindle can do stuff like this! Sweet app!
B005YDLJ76|5.0|Live at Roseland more than met my expectations, Beyonce does concert dvds frequently and they're always huge and ambitious. Roseland feels intimate, it feels smaller and therefore more emotional, and Beyonce taking you through the phases of her career and life (with the later knowledge that she was pregnant and the time of filming) makes it even more special.<br /><br />But for real, the rendition of 1+1 on top of the piano alone makes this DVD worth it.
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|i loved this book i would recommend this book to everyone that i know i could not stop reading this book good job .
B009K0P10K|5.0|I gave Season 2 of Revenge a 5-star rating because it was just as creative and exciting as Season 1.  I mentioned in my review of Season 1 that there is something for everyone in this series and that continues to be true.  Fictional spies, loving couples, blackmailers, family members, babies, and very wealthy and very poor business owners make up quite a story with a perfect cast of characters. Much better than Dallas or Dynasty ever were (although they were very good as well)!<br /><br />Can't wait for Season 3!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|producto de alta calidad quedo totalmente satisfecho con el recomiendo al vendedor 100% confiable despacho a tiempo todo perfectamente bien
B0017TYPIG|5.0|Just your basic Blu-ray disc, but of a classic movie. If you love the movie then you need it on Blu-Ray NOW!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is splenderiferous ·*·  The bunny man is a nice touch, too.<br />. . . . . . .
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|The album grows on you.  Each listen i am liking it more and more.  It was mellower than I expected.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great first person game and is even better when you have a controller to connect to the device you are playing it in so get if you don't have it it is worth the money and it is constantly on sale from $6.99 to $0.99 you<br /> can't beat that no one can thanks fir this game Gameloft.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|It's funny, heartwarming, and provides a message of forgiveness. Matthew Broderick at his cutest. Literally my favorite Michelle Pfeiffer movie. And the soundtrack is amaze balls.
