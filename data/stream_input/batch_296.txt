B00000HYXB|5.0|As I write this, I'm listening to Curse of Feanor, my FAVORITE song on Nightfall. You MUST buy Nightfall In Middle-earth! It has great music and lyrics & the guitar & drumming- oh, the DRUMMING!!- are amazing!!<br /><br /> I give Nightfall in M-E a 11/10! People who've read the Silmarillon should get this too- while someone is asking why one track is just a weird yell (Lammoth), you'll know...<br /> BUY IT!!! Or at least burn it, or get MP3s of it! YOU MUST LISTEN TO THE MUSIC!!
0671027573|5.0|This was honestly one of the funniest, sexiest, most-fun-to-read books that I've read in years.  Sam is so hot, and Janie is funny, smart, attractive, and cool.  They have some really amazing sex (to be expected of Howard), but what's cool about them is that they seemed so much like real people as opposed to typical romance-genre heros/heroines.  The chemistry was just right--amazing and hard to put down.  I've read it probably 12 times, and it's suspenseful, fun, and hot each time.  only thing is that it's slightly unrealistic (deranged serial killer knocks off 2 and a half out of 4 of the main characters) but still, a classic.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie was probobly one of  the best movies i have ever seen it was action packed and definitly had a couple of twists and turns where you didn't know what was going to happen. i would definitly recomend this movie to anybody who liked harry potter or the lord of the rings.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is a great adventure/love story.  Even if you're not into comic books, like me, or even into the whole superhero thing, you'll like this movie.
630542845X|1.0|I thought this movie was very boring, I could harldy sit through it. It was practically painful (but I at least wanted to finish). The plot is pretty stupid. The guy gets hit by lighting and he becomes different from everyone else. The story drags on and on and on until the end which also stunk. Over all the movie stunk but it did have a great message. The message is to not judge people on thier apperance and that nobody is, can, or ever will be normal.<br />There, now after reading the message there is no point in watching the movie - lol. Go do something that you'll actually be glad you spent time doing. Just don't watch this movie or worse, buy it - lol
B000084T18|5.0|How can you not know who 50 Cent is?  50 Cent has done something that hasn't been done in a while.  A COMPLETE DEEBO of the Industry.  Strategy or fate?  A little of both.  His controversial How To Rob garnered much attention.  Then consequently he was shot multiple times and survived through it all. (there's your street cred).  By this time, the bootleg of his supposes debut 'Power Of The Dollar' was hot on the streets and the internet.  Quickly following that, 50 gets dropped from a deal.  Later on he releases Guess Who's Back and again has the streets talking.  By this time his beef with Ja Rule & Murder Inc. is in full effect.  Somehow Eminem gets tapes of 50 Cent and they begin chitter chatter.  Then in an almost assassin like fashion 50 releases THREE mixtapes to the street featuring his crew G-Unit (50 Cent Is The Future, No Mercy No Fear, God's Plan).  Uh oh...now he has the streets on lock...only one more step.  50 Cent signs to Shady Records, features on the biggest hip hop movie soundtrack at the time (8 Mile) and releases his first single entitled \\"Wanksta\\" and grabs the media by the throat.  By the time everyones singing on Wanksta, Dr. Dre produces the hit \\"IN Tha Club\\", an instant club anthem, and has everybody EAGERLY anticipating the album.  The album soon follows and sells nearly 900, 000 copies the first week...topping Snoop Dogg's debut album record for most copies sold in the first week.  Hook, Line, sinker.<br />Now about a month after the initial hype I have come to see this album as a modern classic.  It doesn't hold a candle to universal hip hop classics such as Doggystyle, Illmatic, or SouthernPlayalisticCadillacMuzik.  But the reason it's a classic is because 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Tryin has/ will change the game.  And any album that can do that has to be considered a classic.  There are so many standouts on this album....\\"Back Down\\", What Up Gangsta, Many Men, In Da Club, Heat, High All The Time, 21 Questions....the whole album is bumpin.  There's no filler and I can definitely play this joint over and over straight through.  Hotness.  The beats are top notch, the lyrics are tight, the flows are on point (even with the slur; but keep in mind he was shot in the jaw/mouth area), the guests don't bog down the album...Overall just a great album.<br />Just trust me on this one...this cd is definitely a must have.  50 Cent is something special.  I don't know what it is but whatever it is 50 Cent definitely has it.  If he can stay alive...he will do many great things in hip hop.  Let's just hope his talent and controversial lyrics don't lead to another talent being lost.  5 stars!
B000002VCB|4.0|The Alan Parsons Project take a look at the female gender with their 1979 album, appropriately titled \\"Eve.\\" Although not one of the group's more popular albums, it's a very strong Project album all the same. It's catchy, melodic, well-written by Alan Parsons & Eric Woolfson, with sharp musical performances all around, great orchestrations by Andrew Powell, and fine vocals by such singers as Lenny Zakatek and Chris Rainbow. And what Project album would be complete without an excellent instrumental or two? \\"Lucifer\\" is a classic piece (and it's still used on many TV sports programs to this day), and \\"Secret Garden\\" is bouncy & spacious.However, \\"Eve\\" has always been a controversial album, as some female listeners think that some of the songs are degrading to women. This is totally not true. Songs like \\"You Lie Down With Dogs,\\" \\"I'd Rather Be A Man,\\" and \\"Winding Me Up\\" are not about ALL women in general---goodness, no. The male character of these songs is only singing about *one particular woman* that he's had a personal falling out with, and that's all. Some may find it hard to believe, but men can get hurt in broken relationships, too, which is all these particular songs are saying.Furthermore, lest we forget, \\"Eve\\" contains a couple of positive songs sung by women: the self-powering \\"Don't Hold Back,\\" and the lovely album-closer, \\"If I Could Change Your Mind.\\" Clare Torry & Leslie Duncan, who both were featured on the classic Pink Floyd album, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" (which Parsons engineered), sing these songs very nicely, and I highly doubt that they would've taken part if they thought the album was sexist in any way. Nevermind the silly controversy: \\"Eve\\" is a fine entry in the Alan Parsons Project's catalog. Definitely pick it up.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've been listening to music other than classical for 5 years, and for 5 years I've had the same three favorite bands:  REM, Tori Amos, and Bad Religion.  These three kept me going through high school, and have quite a bit to do with me being at Stanford today.  <br />Prior to hearing this album, Evanescence had joined them (the Jan 21 show in Palo Alto and their first album, Origin, were both GREAT).  But...after hearing this, Evanescence is my favorite band.  I think that says a lot.  <br />Amy's voice is unreal.  There are echoes of Tori (&quot;Hello&quot;) and Alanis (&quot;Taking Over Me&quot;) in it, but it's different...more ethereal than either in some places and more concrete in others.  There's a place in &quot;Whisper&quot; where it sounds like it almost becomes a violin.  Amazing...<br />The songwriting and production are equally good.  The attention to detail on all the tracks (getting each beat, each entrance exactly right) is reminiscent of Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory...I can't find a track on this disc that wouldn't make a good single.  A violinist since the age of 3 (hey Amy &amp; Ben...need a violinist?), I have to admire the arrangements of &quot;My Immortal,&quot; &quot;My Last Breath,&quot; and especially &quot;Whisper.&quot;  <br />In short, the music on this disc is like nothing I've ever heard before.  My hope that this is where nurock, modern rock, and dark rock will head over the next few years is second only to my hope that Evanescence's next albums will be as good.
B000002UB3|5.0|I've held off on reviewing this or any Beatles album for the longest time because I had quite simply stopped listening to them. I love this band to death but every time I would put on a CD or a tape of the Beatles, each song would take me back to another time and another place and bring about a nostalgia attack. Quite simply, I'd be blubbering like a baby and be depressed for days at a time. <BR>But I was finally able to listen to \\"Abbey Road\\" from A to B. Here's my take on each song and what it means to me. <br />\\"Come Together\\" - is perhaps the most popular and well-known track on this album. It is undeniably catchy and has been covered by countless artists. I skip this track now because I've heard it to death.<br />\\"Something\\" -  Harrison wrote this absolutely beautiful and touching number for his wife (before she ran off with Eric Clapton) and it is, in my very humble opinion, the most wonderful love song ever written. <br />\\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" - I used to love this song when I was a kid. I still do. It is too catchy and it'll be stuck in your head forever. <br />\\"Oh Darling\\" - Paul Mcartney's best vocal ever. You can FEEL the angst in his voice as he pleads \\"Oh daaaaaaaaarling, please believe me...\\"<br />\\"Octopus's Garden\\" - Only the Beatles could take such a stupid song and make you want to sing it all day long. <br />\\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" - Lennon gets deep with this aching plea for a mother figure's love and affection. This isn't the catchiest song but is it ever intense! Led Zep could have recorded this during their \\"Physical Graffiti\\" weirdo phase. <br />\\"Here Comes the Sun\\" - The B side kicks off with this little number. I LOVE this song because I was able to play most of the parts on guitar and I SUCKED at trying to play guitar. <br />\\"Because\\" - Trippy.<br />\\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" - I still can't get this song out of my head after 15 years. <br />\\"Sun King\\" - Alright, I never really liked this very short song. Well, I like the \\"Everybody's happy\\" part. <br />\\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" - This is where the songs start to segue into each other. The mustard song, about a jerk, flows nicely into the very brief \\"Polythene Pam\\" and then the absolutely gorgeous \\"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\\" and then the haunting but brief \\"Golden Slumbers\\", which flows into the chanting \\"Carry That Weight\\", and the appropriately titled and somber \\"End\\"...<br />But we're not done yet. The last \\"track\\" is an irreverent tribute to the Queen, \\"Her Majesty\\". <br />Are you convinced yet? If you are just getting into the Beatles, don't get that BS \\"1\\" album. Get this one instead!
B00008HCCF|5.0|What a fantastic disc. An hour-long concert in the House of Blues, a pretty small venue, showcases Norah Jones and the ability of her and her band to stretch out slightly on songs that appeared in compact form on her debut CD. This band, working with fairly subdued material with loads of depth, hints that they understand how to jam and create excitement that you may have thought impossible from such material. The band is impeccable but there are influences that seem to point to the Grateful Dead in some of their stretches, or, various Blue Note-signed bands of the past. You can hear every note from every instrument without any mistake. The show leaves the listener wanting more. <br />I only wish Norah had exploded into the mainstream with about 5 albums under her belt - it's going to be painful waiting for her catologue to build. Meanwhile, if you have any suspicion that you like her music, you should get this. She is only going to get even better with time. And I'm hoping that the stretching out showcased here continues even further in that direction.
B000002UB6|4.0|And it's still a great album. Looking at the reviews of Beatles albums, the only people that really seem to dislike them are either ignorant or trying to get some attention by bashing them. Well I am going to review \\"Let It Be\\", the worst Beatles album, honestly and objectively.<br />\\"Two Of Us\\"/\\"Dig A Pony\\" - I really dislike these songs. I think they are the worst tracks they recorded but...<br />\\"Across The Universe\\" is perhaps one of their best songs ever. I used to get drunk and play this song over and over and over again. A lot of people don't like this but I absolutely love this song. Nothing's gonna change my world...<br />\\"I Me Mine\\" - Ugh. Quite whining, Paul. It's still a surprisingly catchy song. Me like it. <br />\\"Dig It\\" - This isn't really a song. It's more like an irreverent vignette.<br />\\"Let It Be\\" - The most beautiful song ever recorded. If they played this at church, I'd be a pew warmer, for sure. \\"Let It Be\\" is so perfect. Everything comes together, the vocals, the organ, the drums picking up halfway through the song. <br />\\"Maggie Mae\\" - Another irreverent little song. I didn't really get into this. It's kinda folksy. <br />\\"I've Got A Feeling\\" - Ohhhhh yeah. Much better. This song packs a punch. <br />\\"One After 909\\" - Didn't get into it.<br />\\"The Long And Winding Road\\" - A song for anybody who's ever had an uphill struggle. This song, \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" really save this album from mediocrity. I am adding a star for each of these songs. So far, three...<br />\\"For You Blue\\" - Bleh.<br />\\"Get Back\\" - Ahhhh yes! Another star. This song is just so funky, catchy and yes, funny. I love how these guys still kept their sense of humor. <br />So 4 stars, just for those four tracks I praised. And yes, it is worth getting the CD just for those songs. <br />This is no \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" but it is a Beatles album, officially their second to last (even though it was released after \\"Abbey Road\\") and it's still better than most of the garbageout there today. There will never be a band like the Beatles ever again.

B000058983|2.0|I've tried to give this album the benefit of the doubt several times but i just can't. The firt two songs are good, but the rest of the album suffers from too much lyrical input and inconsistent tempo changes. The band leader Arthur Lee puts too many words in every song, describing every aspect of how he is feeling and what is going on in the song and blah blah blah. None of the songs, except for the first two, are memorable, and sound generally the same. I know that this is not ment to be a pop album in the standard 60's sense, but does every song have to be long and drawn out drivel about how bad the world is. And to those who slam artists such as the Beach Boys, and my favorite, The Beatles for sounding too sunny at times, at least they knew a good beat. Why is it that a lot of people think that to be a true masterpiece, an album has to be dark and disturbing.  Arthur Lee is a long way from Lennon/McCarteny, who in my mind were the greatest composers of pop music ever (and I only use the word pop to distinguish from classical/piano driven compositions). In fact, Arthur Lee is a long way from a lot of 60's musicians as far as arranging and composing songs go. In closing, if you are looking for one of the greatest albums of all time, look somewhere else, far away from this album, if you are looking for an ok album to buy for your secret santa at work, than this might be the one for you.
B00005JLSC|5.0|and entertainment is plentiful, but there just aren't enough stars for the marvelous, \\"Chicago\\".<br />Just as poet Carl Sandburg immortalized the raw power and audacity of the city in his poem nearly 100 years ago (\\"Chicago, by Sandburg, 1914), so do the creators of the film version of Chicago...Fosse for his brilliance years ago, and a production team who bring it burning incandescent to the big screen.  Chicago takes you on a musical experience that makes 2001's lesser film, \\"Moulin Rouge\\", pale by comparison.<br />Direction is strong by newcomer Rob Marshall, who \\"wows\\" us with the film's energy.  Sets, camerawork, editing, visualization and pace are superb.  Captured for this film, (as in so many others where the music stands completely on its own) are the talents of music director Danny Elfman.  A genius at musical transition, Elfman lets the score soar, while mixing new life into its vocals, even with lesser singing talents such as Gere and Zellwegger.  The cast was well prepared vocally, and the choreography blinds you.  Lights, camera angles, sets and costumes blend into the showcase rather than eclipse it.<br />Star talent is plentiful -- there is too much for one film!  Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly and Catherine Zeta-Jones (as vixen, Velma) play to type strongly and vocalize beautifully.  Zeta Jones is a marvelous dancer, and her beauty quite takes your breath away.  This is Richard Gere's best performance (by far!) of a long and somewhat \\"wooden\\" career.  Glinting, slick, manipulative -- he's truly the \\"puppeteer\\" of the script.  His courtroom tapdance, the \\"Cell Block Tango\\" and Latifah's bawdy solo, \\"When You're Good to Mama\\" are the highlights of the show, for me.<br />We even get glimpses of greatness in minor roles with virtual cameos by stage and screen stars Christine Baranski, Colm Feore, Taye Diggs and viperous Lucy Liu.  But NOTHING quite prepares you for Zellwegger.  There's a palpable charisma about her onscreen; the sort of light from within that Monroe had, and, indeed her solo, \\"Roxie Hart\\" is reminiscent of Monroe.  We've loved Renee when \\"he had her at hello\\", she showed us her flair for black comedy as \\"Nurse Betty\\", and her talent for romantic farce as Bridget, but she sets the screen on fire in this film.  She's equally at home with anger, awe, naivete, chutzpah and misery in \\"Chicago\\".  The camera loves her, polishes her, allows her to outvamp Zeta-Jones in the closing act.  She may not win an Oscar, because the competition is so fierce, but she will ever be associated with a brilliant film turn as Roxie.<br />\\"Chicago\\" is, without a doubt, the best film of the year, and potentially the best musical ever brought to the big screen.

B000002UAO|5.0|Let me start off by saying that if you hate sixties music, you probably won't like this, but for those of you who like it and/or are relatively new to it, this album will blow you away. It is of course another milestone in the history of music. McCarteney starts it off with &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, which is the kind of song that makes you want to get up and dance, and is one of my favorites. Norwegian Wood is the kind of song that Lennon effortlessly makes a hit. You Won't See me is another fine tune. Then with Nowhere Man, you see a different kind of song, not one about love at all, which most critics and experts say was the first Lennon/McCarteney song not about love, though I contend that Help! was the first to do so, just a few months earlier on the album of the same name. The middle part of this album continues to be outstanding, though What Goes On is a little dated, but then we get to &quot;In My Life&quot;, which many people have called Lennons' greatest song, which I don't argue with. It is such a beautiful song that became sort of his personal epitaph after he died, and is the best song on the album, which is saying a lot. Rubber Soul finishes with 3 great songs, including the George Harrison song &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;, Which I love because it has a Byrds-ish feel, and I am a huge fan of the Byrds. All in all, a great great album by the greatest band of all time, no offense to any others. Also, note that the music on Revolver directly evolved from this album, which has traces of Revolver all over it.

6305014140|5.0|This movie is a must have. There is alot of extreme violence and nudity but it adds to the depth of the film. You get really attached to the characters and the story.

1567404103|5.0|This is the sixth book in the Harry Bosch series and I have listened to or read all of the preceding ones.  Angels Flight, I believe, is one of the best.  It involves many tangents and subplots that give the book depth. Many characters also appear in previous books so I recommend reading them in order. In addition, Dick Hill, the reader of the series, is excellent.  I listened to the end of the book while on a long drive.  My passenger, who had missed the first 70% of the book (other than my brief summary) was enthralled by it, and commented on Hill's quality performance.  Although the Bosch series is described as in the \\"hard boiled\\" genre, I don't think this is an adequate description -- I find Harry Bosch much more complex and believable than lead detectives in similar series.  Good listening and I'm glad I have a couple Bosch books remaining.
0064407667|1.0|Heading: The Bad Beginning<BR>              By: Lemony Snicket<BR>              Review by: D. Ji<BR>   Period: 1<BR> Their misfortune began one day at Briny Beach. The three Baudelaire lived with their parents in an enormous mansion at the heart of a dirty and busy city. The three were usually given permission to go to the beach. Violet, the eldest, liked to skip rocks. Like most 14 year olds, she was right-handed so the rocks skipped farther. She had a knack for inventing things, Klaus, the middle child, and the only boy, liked to read books and examine creatures in tide pools. His parents have a large library and Klaus would usually stay there and read. Sunny was the youngest and she like to bite things. She was an infant, and very small for her age. She had four very sharp teeth. So Mr. Poe, the Baudelaire's broker, came over to them, told them that there was a terrible, and there were no survivors. He took them to his house until he could find a guardian to take care of them. Mrs. Poe bought clothes to let them wear during their stay. Mr. Poe found a relative to take care of him. His name was Count Olaf. He was an actor. They arrived at Olaf's house in no time. The Baudelaires were disgusted with Olaf's appearance. Nevertheless, they were forced to stay with him. His house was dull looking. However, they started to like the neighbor. She was very friendly and also a judge. Olaf gave them one bed to sleep in. <BR> The next day, Olaf woke them up very early and told them to make dinner for his troupe for they are going to be there at his house. Violet desperately tried to tell Olaf that they couldn't cook, but he ignored her and left. They decided to ask the judge for help. She had a library, which she was willingly to let the Baudelaires use. They decided to make pasta called puttanesca. She then agreed to take them to the market to buy the food. Thirty minutes later, the Baudelaire was finished with their shopping. After that, it was cooking and cooking. At around 8:00pm, Olaf arrived. He was displeased for he wanted roast beef. He sent them to bed. Olaf decided to plot a scheme to steal the Baudelaire fortune. He was going to have a play about two people getting married. He was trying to marry Violet. The Baudelaire knew something was wrong so they decided to find out what Olaf up to. They found out that he was going to marry Violet. They started to read the books about marriage and found out it was perfectly legal for Olaf to marry Violet. One of Olaf's henchmen took Sunny because Klaus and Violet found out the plan. This forced them to do the act. However, after the scene was over, Olaf was tricked. Violet has to sign the docs with her right arm but she didn't so it isn't legal. Olaf was exposed and he ran over when there was a blackout. Now The Baudelaires have to stay with another relative.<BR> I like this book because it was very exciting and funny. Olaf is funny in a way, but evil at the same time. He must be one desperate man to marry Violet to get the fortune, and when Violet, Klaus, and Sunny beat Olaf at his own game, that just made me laugh. Olaf can never succeed in his plan, because his plans aren't foolproof. A 14, 12, and 3 year old, can crack and find out the meaning of the plan. I feel sad for him. If his mother saw him, she would probably be so humiliated. It is exciting because Violet invented a ghetto grappling hook and braved almost 40 feet of climbing to try to get her sister out.<BR> My favorite part of the story was when Violet made a grappling hook and used it to rescue her sister. It was so brave of her to do so. I wish I had the courage to do that so encase of an emergency during a mountain climb. Although she never made it to the top, it was still a great and heroic adventure that Violet will probably remember forever. I feel like the book a just read was a movie because it had so much action. I cant wait to read to second book.
B00000F5J5|5.0|The first of Godfrey Reggio's finally finished trilogy, Koyaanisqatsi, is a visually-stunning non-narrative film depicting a life and world out of balance.  Koyaanisqatsi is a Hopi word meaning one of five things:  \\"crazy life, life in turmoil, life disintegrating, life out of balance, and a state of life that calls for another way of living.\\"  After watching this film, one will definitely see all five definitions painfully applicable.<br />Basically, the first fifteen to twenty minutes of the film has some wonderful shots of the desert, waterfalls, geologic formations, clouds billowing so close it's as if one's inside them, and aerial photography that makes one appreciate the landscape.<br />The rest of the movie then shows the human side.  Caterpillar tractors lay out pipes, dotting the landscape with a network of electric towers, resembling wire framework travesties of men, power plants billowing steam and smoke smack in the middle of the desert, atomic tests in the desert, nuclear plants... abominations invading the environment.  Rivers have been stopped by dams.  And the military testing in the desert does nothing more than pollute the ground and air with explosions.<br />Switch over to the big city and the 12 lane highways, with its network of overpasses, byways, merging lanes, cars moving bumper to bumper, passing each other.  Then we see the decrepit slums, abandoned projects, which are then blown up, slowly sinking to the ground in clouds of dust.<br />The time-lapse photography of people milling in line for subway tickets, eating, bowling, playing video games, etc. shows the city as the organism, streets, entrances and exits as blood vessels, humans as the blood cells.  The night scenes of traffic, with white and red dashes zipping is very telling, as is the cycle of traffic going, stopping, going, stopping at each signal light.  Later on, the speed of the film goes quicker, to demonstrate the quickening rate and insanity of human consumption, waste, and stress.  Is this really worth living for, I ask you?<br />There are some images that are analogous.  An aerial view of the concrete jungle, at what we've created, is replaced by an infrared satellite photo, then a closeup of a computer chip, showing the inputs going into multiplexers and demultiplexers, coming out as outputs.  It shows how mechanized we have become compared to the more serene, less chaotic ways of nature, going in one way, going out through another.  Another is a shot of sausages being cranked out, followed by people moving up escalators.  Notice the similarity?<br />The most telling shots of the thousands of people in New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco is that they don't look very happy at all, but for them, it's what they know, what they are, part of this mechanized, corporate world.<br />The translation of Hopi prophecies sung in the movie follow the conclusion, and they are sobering and chilling:  \\"If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster.\\"  \\"Near the Day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth through the sky.\\"  \\"A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans.\\"<br />Philip Glass's score, which alternates from frenetic synthesizers during the time-lapse footage and elegiac sobriety in the slo-mo shots, adds to this one-of-a-kind movie.  However, this is best seen on the big screen for maximum impact.tress.  Is this really worth living for, I ask you?<br />There are some images that are analogous.

Notice the similarity?<br />The most telling shots of the thousands of people in New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco is that they don't look very happy at all, but for them, it's what they know, what they are, part of this mechanized, corporate world.<br />The translation of Hopi prophecies sung in the movie follow the conclusion, and they are sobering and chilling:  \\"If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster.\\"  \\"Near the Day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth through the sky.\\"  \\"A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans.\\"<br />Philip Glass's score, which alternates from frenetic synthesizers during the time-lapse footage and elegiac sobriety in the slo-mo shots, adds to this one-of-a-kind movie.  However, this is best seen on the big screen for maximum impact.
0790730960|5.0|Its been written that the Batman name deserved better, but who's too say? All I know is that this film is a wonderful valentine to flights of fancy capable only in childhood, before society has denuded us, leaving only,by and large, sterile minds incapable of concieving of the majestic, and intolerant of the absurd(to be met with \\"Superior and correct\\" condescension, as is proper). Comic fans dismiss this outright, as do most critics (most of them would do well to choke on their venomous bon mots, I think. The world would not morn), not to mention the esteemed (though not by me) Sydney Lumet, but is it truly fair? My opinon-Nay, I have only the most vile, unprintable obscenities as a response to those who [degrade] it on the basis of plot holes. I wish soul-destroying attrocities on the silly, self righteous comic fans who snarl at the thought of their beloved comic idols being translated to the screen with even minor changes. This film is to me beautiful in scope, beautiful in design, beautiful in every catergory. The acting is not \\"oscar-worthy\\"(most oscar winners nowadays don't truly receive awards based on merit, but politics. How else to explain Julia Roberts snagging one?);instead it is \\"just right\\" for the material. Its a surreal fantasy, juvenile yes, but the best things in life are experienced in youth, not when one is closer to the grave than to the cradle. I see the penguins with torpedos march towards Gotham Plaze,-I think \\"Wonderful\\"! The meek secretary who's suddenly a skilled gymnast? \\"Fantastic\\"! I like classic films as much as any worthless snob, but my feelings toward these old gems, however strong, are still muted in comparison to what the Burton Batman pictures ingnite in me. They show a world of infinite promise, where every corner, hides a surprise(not unlike an O.Henry tale). One perfectly complimented by Danny Elfman's score. <BR> The music is a delicacy to my ears as a ripe cherry cut from a soaked bush after a spring rain would be to my tongue. Its tonal varations are fascinating to follow, from its dizzying heights in the opening credits, to its ominous lows in the Penguin's sewer lair(the excellent use of a choir still makes my spirits soar)this is one piece of film music which is not dependent on the movie. It lives, it breathes as few musical masterpieces do in this business, where everyone and his...brother gets a shot to rewrite your work with his tired hand that would better serve the world severed.<BR> Fools have written that Dardevil is the movie Batman should've been. While I cannot deny Daredevil's many good qualities, that movie is like one of the Burton Batmans, yet mercilessly stripped of its unique touches. I prefer seening the Penguin spitting out his monocle (Burton's subtle way of giving the finger to comic purists), to a thousand scenes of Matt Murdock taking vicodin to ease his pain. Realism simply pales before the grandoise, because its so easy to pull off. Make people bleed, make them have conflict, make them speak in halting sentences full of \\"erms,\\" and \\"uh's\\", make them take pain pills. That's not hard. An original idea though, try that one on for size.
B000006MS3|5.0|While 'The Dreaming' pushes Kate's quirky side to entirely new levels, this isn't the weird demented album that people often refer to it as: If you've ever listened to a Mr Bungle album (the definitely of insanity put to music), 'The Dreaming' is almost placid in comparison.<br />That being said this IS definitely a seriously twisted pop album. Improving upon the lush, dense sound scapes that 'Never For Ever', her previous album set the blueprint for, this is musically dense, packed with weird instruments, synth flourishes and odd sound effects, music genres meet and collide and the lyrics range a whole spectrum from Bank Robberies to the plight of the Aborigines to the futility of knowledge. It is however, an immaculately produced album, the sound scapes are so smoothed over that it isn't so much a disturbing album as a very left-of-field album.<br />Every track stands up strongly in its own right, yet never steals from the album as a whole. 'Sat In Your Lap' is a fast paced, intense track built around a frenetic percussive rhythm section. 'There Goes A Tenner' is probably the catchiest track on this album, somehow it manages to combine ska with racy 20s music hall without sounding ridiculous. `Night Of The Swallow' and `Suspended in Gaffa' weave in Celtic folk whilst `Leave it Open' starts of tense (I love the way she manipulates her voice on this track) before boiling over into something sounding like an insane demonic opera. Admittedly, the title track and `Get Out Of My House' are VERY VERY weird, incredibly scary and push modern pop to new unexplored boundaries.<br />Definitely not for everyone, `The Dreaming' startles many at first but rewards repeated listening. Nothing out there sounds quite like it, at the same time many of the reviews claiming this to be weird, jarring and scary are a bit misleading. Although `Get Out Of My House' is utterly terrifying, `The Dreaming' boasts too much pop sensibility and productive flair to sound scary. `Extremely eccentric' sums it up much better.
B000067DNC|5.0|The show is very good and the DVD picture quality is too.  You might want to not send the sound through your surround sound/5.1 system though if it's easy not to.  I go from about level 38 for convesations to 18 for guns and explosions.  Otherwise, it's either to quite to hear what they are saying or to loud during action. Also the MGM lion roars REAL loud when you put in the disk.  Thought it was just something wrong in my sound system, but a friend's wife mentioned it somewhere and got a bunch of replies saying they thought it was just them too.  Both Season One and Season Two are like this.  Still going to get the other seasons when they come out though.
B000006NPY|5.0|I do not hesitate in saying that 'Adore' is by far one of the most underrated and underappreaciated albums I have ever encountered. And i do not hesitate in saying that 'Adore' just might be my favorite pumpkin album. There is no doubt that it is quite the deviation from anything the band had done in the past. I've often heard complaints that, while this album is good, it isn't 'good' for the smashing pumpkins, that it simply doesn't sound enough like them. But riddle me this...what do the pumpkins REALLY sound like? Afterall, each album they've released has its own distinctive sound, each one sounding very different in many ways from each of the others. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the smashing pumpkins are one of my favorite bands ever. They are diverse in their range of sound and unafraid to explore and experiment with new musical terrain. 'Adore' is certainly an excellent example of this. Even if the music on this album isn't your style, I'd venture to believe that any true, appreciative music fan would at least be able to discern the true quality of this album. <br />Beautiful really is too weak a word to describe this album.<br />Stunning, perhaps, is more appropriate.
0441003257|2.0|A very ill advised descision by the authors to include such done to death concepts as from the point of view of angels in the modern world. That's why I hated the RPG \\"In Nomine.\\"<br />About the only main attempt at humor would \\"Ha Ha look at these supposedly celestial beings, and they're holding up ordinary jobs, ha ha ha. How twisted is that?\\"<br />If you want to see a funny parody of the apocalypse, check out the website: Apocamon the Final Judgement. It's no where near complete, but its free and its illistrated, and it's far more amusing.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt is so bleak, so sincere, that there is no middle ground for the audience; either you *understand* it at some very deep, very painful level, or you don't understand it at all.<br />Of course, Alice In Chains were that sort of band altogether, but Dirt is perhaps the most adamantly miserable statement ever committed to recordable media. No review that simply talks about lyrics, chords, riffs or minor keys can adequately describe what goes on inside Dirt. Indeed, it is the totality of the experience, the truth of the expression, that is so devastating.<br />For anyone who has ever dealt with substance abuse and/or suffered from severe mental illness along the lines of bipolar disorder or borderline disorders, Dirt is also one of the most beautiful albums ever written. It will make you cry. But watch out... because if you are so affected and you approach the album nonchalantly, it may also make you do other things...<br />Definitely a must-own for any serious music fan.
B00003CXBK|5.0|It is difficult for me to select a favorite Miyazaki movie because I happen to be fond of all of them, but if I were to choose, PRINCESS MONONOKE would definitely be one lucky candidate. This aesthetically breathtaking, multi-layered epic about the legendary clash between man and beast set in a forest-covered world became Japan's hugest box office grossing movie ever upon its 1997 release. Taking the whole movie into account, it's really not hard to understand why. Not just a depiction of what happens when hatred gets out of hand and/or when nature is threatened, this is a lavishly animated spectacle as well as a compelling exercise of portraying its characters neither as perfect heroes or deplorable villains, but flawed, believable people displaying tangible emotions.<br /><br />The film's action begins when a courageous and compassionate Emishi prince, Ashi-taka, becomes infected with a deadly curse after killing a demon attacking his village. In the hopes of finding a cure, Ashi-taka sets off toward the West astride his faithful elk, Yakul, and finds himself caught in the midst of a war. On one side is a proud clan of human commanded by the ruthless Lady Eboshi, who is clearing the forest mainly for the sake of her own people (a group of outcasts which consist of lepers and brothel girls). On the other side are the Animal Gods of the forest who want to destroy the humans and protect their natural environment, led by the intimidating wolf matriarch Moro. Her human cub, Princess Mononoke herself, aka San, harbors a grudge against all humans and desires to kill them all (namely Eboshi)... or die trying. When Ashi-taka rescues her, however, she finds herself developing feelings for him that she's never felt before--are *all* humans truly evil, or is there at least one who can be trusted?<br /><br />Families who have been spoiled by Disney movies may probably have a hard time determining who is \\"good\\" or who is \\"evil\\", but as mentioned, this is not Miyazaki's intention. His movie is meant to display the flaws of human beings and their inability to understand how their own inner demons and/or consummation of another world can bring about deadly consequences. The only character in the movie that comes close to being a villain is a squat monk known as Jigo, who wants the head of the mystical Forest Spirit in exchange for riches. But even then, Jigo has his own motives; he is not so much evil as much as he is just \\"trying to get by\\".<br /><br />It is probably a little daring to say that out of Miyazaki's films, this is probably his most \\"adult\\" film to date, for it contains more violence than most of his other work. For example, in one scene, Ashi-taka, possessed by the curse on his arm, tries to stop samurai from attacking innocent people, and in doing so slashes off one man's arms, and later, another's head with two arrows. Horrifying and disturbing as the sight is (as well as some occasional blood spurts), such moments are included only to show its devastating effects. Some Japanese animated features tend to go overboard in depicting such gory sequences; in the case of PRINCESS MONONOKE, however, the violence never overpowers the meaning of the story, and is actually done in a way that is neither gratuitous nor squeamish. Even so, this is a movie that is arguably best appreciated by older viewers rather than youngsters.<br /><br />For those who love to watch Studio Ghibli productions for their state-of-the-art production values, PRINCESS MONONOKE will do little to disappoint you in this area. Every frame is painted with imaginative visuals and exquisite detail that I have rarely seen matched in other animated films. Not only are the forests lush and magical but the creatures who inhabit it are difficult to forget, especially the cute little Tree Spirits who appear and disappear at will as well as the Great Forest Spirit himself--a tall, human-faced deer whose every steps make plants grow. At night he becomes the Nightwalker, a ghostly specter that towers over the trees. This is one of the many spectacular moments of wonder that, if anything, warrant the purchase of this movie--in addition, of course, to the compelling, multi-faceted characters and equally sweeping storyline.<br /><br />PRINCESS MONONOKE was picked up for distribution by Miramax several years ago, and while everyone loves to fault them for the many mistakes they made in handling this movie (such as giving it only a non-existent marketing campaign), I'm sure there are those who will argue that Disney's English tracks for Miyazaki's movies are some of the best around, and this is no exception. Acclaimed writer Neil Gaiman's adaptation is not only faithful to Miyazaki's original screenplay (changing around only a few things here and there for comprehension purposes for audiences unfamiliar with its Japanese customs), but also just about every word of dialogue seems to avoid the somewhat clunky, odd-sounding lines that some dubs can sometimes suffer from. The English voice cast chosen to speak his script consists of various famous stars; these include Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Gillian Anderson, and Jada Pinkett-Smith. All provide solid vocal performances; some folks have issues with Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo and Claire Danes as San, but IMO both are every bit as good as the aforementioned actors.<br /><br />The DVD presentation of this movie is phenomenal; the visual clarity is spectacular, and the English, Japanese, and French audio tracks are all reference-quality.  On the other hand, the minimal extras are a bit of a sour note. All that's included are a theatrical trailer (where Miyazaki and MONONOKE are both mispronounced) and a skimpy featurette featuring comments from the principal members of the voice cast as well as ADR director, Jack Fletcher (Gaiman appears briefly). Hopefully Disney will one day revisit this masterpiece and give it the luscious two-disc treatment it deserves.walker, a ghostly specter that towers over the trees.

B00006J3WH|4.0|This episode of BtVS was definitely a masterpiece and it owed some of that success to the music. Music more amazing for being primarily written by a man with basically no classical music education.<br />What I enjoyed most was actually the liner notes, which include an hysterically funny anectdote about the conception and creation of the episode by Joss Whedon, the creator of the series and writer of much of the music contained.<br />The CD also includes music by Christophe Beck, composer of most of the instrumental score heard in the series, from several previous episodes.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This overwhelmingly gorgeous animated feature from Hayao Miyazaki begins when an unhappy young girl, Chihiro, is moving with her parents to a new town.  Along the way, the family is drawn to a mysterious tunnel which leads to an exotic new world.  Spotting delicious-looking food on the table of an old restaurant, Chihiro's parents gobble it down gluttonously--and are transformed into squealing pigs.  A distraught Chihiro discovers that this new world is actually a haven for spirits and creatures and panics.  Then an enigmatic youth, Haku, informs her that she must take a job at the central bath house in order to break the curse on her parents.  But the bath house's greedy enchantress, the cackling witch Yubaba, isn't going to make things easy for her.  Fortunately, with the help of a spider-like boiler man, Kamaji, and a tough, yet secretly softhearted maiden named Lin, Chihiro might find the key to save her parents from becoming bacon.<br /><br />What is truly unique about SPIRITED AWAY is its acquisition of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film in 2002.  It was a triumph that no one could have anticipated.  Hayao Miyazaki's films have been well-known for many years in Japan and by a small underground band of fans, but up until that time, not one animated feature made in Japan has achieved such an honorary award.  It's a wonder, too, because the film, despite receiving enthusiastic reviews from almost every critic across the board, was only playing in select theaters.  Yet acclaim was so strong that its success took everyone (including Disney, who nonetheless translated and released SPIRITED AWAY theatrically) by surprise.  Consequently, America is now receiving more exposure to Miyazaki's works through brand-new, professional translations from Disney.  If it weren't for SPIRITED AWAY's success, these films (owned by Disney for several years) probably never would have seen the light of day in America.<br /><br />That said, I feel that SPIRITED AWAY gets more ballyhooing and hype than it really deserves.  Don't get me wrong, I like the film and it certainly deserves the Oscar it won (not to mention my highest rating), but SPIRITED AWAY is NOT the \\"mother of all Japanese animation\\", nor is it the \\"only Miyazaki movie worth watching.\\"  The reason I say this is because Miyazaki has made so many other wonderful movies in his lifetime that I feel it is unfair to single out one of his works as a standard for all animation.  Especially when there are other animated features which are every bit as worthy of the \\"masterpiece\\" status.<br /><br />Personal gripes aside, SPIRITED AWAY is worth watching for many reasons.  The animated atmosphere that Miyazaki creates literally springs to life with imagination and beauty--watching this movie is almost like watching Japanese art paintings moving.  The spirits who inhabit the world are a bizarre, yet appealing bunch--including a shadowy, white-masked specter called No Face, who reacts to how people treat him.  In addition to which there are lots of bravura sequences which really showcase how beautiful hand-drawn animation can be--my favorite of which is a surreal train journey across a pond of water.<br /><br />If Chihiro is sometimes a bit too whiney, then her supporting cast of co-stars provide for some interesting character development.  Haku, for example, appears to be calm and kind for the most part, but we soon learn that this is only one facet of his character--yet Chihiro seems to believe, no matter what anyone tells her, that Haku is indeed a good soul.  Likewise, Lin acts gruff and somewhat mean to Chihiro when they first meet, but she eventually comes to look after Chihiro like a parent.  Interestingly, while Yubaba may be greedy and selfish, she's not a one-dimensional villainess; one senses that she secretly admires Chihiro's determination yet won't admit it to herself.  Her twin sister, Zeniba, is the total opposite; she lives a simple, pleasant life in a humble cottage yet is totally content with her way of living--although it is hard to tell that at first because she initially appears vowing vengeance on Haku.  Characters as interesting as this has always been a trait of Miyazaki's productions, and arguably what ultimately gives SPIRITED AWAY its heart rather than its jawdroppingly gorgeous visuals... although the film's occasional shades of symbolism are a definite plus as well.<br /><br />It is also interesting to note that for the English language production of the movie, PIXAR guru John Lasseter oversaw the casting of the voices and the scripting.  His efforts, as well as director Kirk Wise and script writers Cindy and Donald Hewitt, are very commendable and pay off handsomely.  Of the voices Suzanne Pleshette stands out above the rest with her bang-on performance as Yubaba and Zeniba, and is well supported by Susan Egan (Lin), Jason Marsden (Haku), and David Ogden Stiers (Kamaji).<br /><br />However, I have two issues with the dub--the first of which is Daveigh Chase's voicing of the lead, Chihiro.  While she does an absolutely excellent job with her acting, her sometimes shrill screeching is a bit off-putting.  The second of these issues is another personal gripe; some folks act as though this is the only dub of the Disney-Ghibli English tracks that is worth watching and that the rest are inferior.  This is unjust; each of the Disney-Ghibli dubs have been special and different in their own way and to single one out over any of them just doesn't make sense.  As such, SPIRITED AWAY is not the ultimate Disney-Ghibli dub; it's yet another top-class dub.<br /><br />Disney's DVD release presents the movie in a stunning transfer as well as the English and Japanese audio tracks in 5.1 Surround Sound.  And, for a change, there are more extras; although one of them is tedious (an intro with John Lasseter), the others, (especially the Nippon TV special), are fabulous.<br /><br />All in all, while sometimes overhyped to an extreme these days, SPIRITED AWAY nonetheless qualifies as yet another Miyazaki treat.r way of living--although it is hard to tell that at first because she initially appears vowing vengeance on Haku.

B000003S0D|4.0|This is an odd album in King Crimson's body of work. Like its precursor `In the Wake of Poseidon', it is a transitory album, that bridges the gap between Crimson's first two touring incarnations. There is a specific kind of jazzy flavour unique to `Lizard' among King Crimson's albums, and `Lizard' also boasts a one-off guest appearance by Jon Anderson, lead vocalist of Yes.<br />The fraught circumstances surrounding the recording of `Lizard' have been documented by Sid Smith, in his excellent biography `In the Court of King Crimson'. There was particular animosity between guitarist Robert Fripp and vocalist/bassist Gordon Haskell, and both Fripp and Haskell have poured scorn on the album in subsequent years. The album is also disliked by a large proportion of King Crimson fandom - although a vocal minority do praise the album's virtues, and I'm glad to see that so many of the album's supporters have posted favourable reviews below.<br />Despite `Lizard's oddities, and the circumstances in which it was recorded, the album is a fascinating blend of styles and structures. This 30th anniversary remaster does particular justice to the album's merits, and it's high time it had a better reputation. Opening number `Cirkus' is particularly strong, with a brilliant combination of menacing mellotron and dextrous acoustic guitar. In fact, Fripp's acoustic playing throughout the whole album is a revelation, and it's a pity that he stopped using acoustic guitar on King Crimson albums shortly after this one was released.<br />The next three songs - `Indoor Games', `Happy Family' (about the break-up of the Beatles) and `Lady of the Dancing Water' (a sequel of sorts to `Cadence and Cascade' from `In the Wake of Poseidon') - have their interesting moments, but are not especially good. Haskell's vocals, which work well on the sinister `Cirkus', sound a little awkward on these other tracks. Still, his raucous laughter between `Indoor Games' and `Happy Family' is a joyful thing to hear.<br />Then there's the title track of `Lizard', which is essentially King Crimson doing the `70s prog band fill an entire side of an LP with one epic track' thing, just as Yes did with `Close to the Edge', Emerson, Lake and Palmer did with `Tarkus', and Pink Floyd did with `Echoes' on `Meddle'. Is it pretentious? Very much so. Is it good? It's magnificent.<br />Jon Anderson's guest vocal on opening section `Prince Rupert Awakes' is beautiful, and if the chorus sounds a bit too happy-clappy-hippy, with its cheesy melody and handclaps, we can forgive it for that. Instrumental section `Bolero' is beautifully arranged and performed, with Robin Miller's oboe a particular highlight. Bizarrely, the main theme of `Bolero' sounds identical to a musical theme used in Watership Down, the 1978 animated film about talking rabbits. Another interesting bit of trivia is that an alternative version of `Bolero' exists - when Fripp included the piece in the 1991 King Crimson box set `Frame by Frame', he had Crimson bassist Tony Levin re-record Gordon Haskell's parts.<br />The next section, `The Battle of Glass Tears', is wonderfully effective, with its ominous introduction, understated vocal by Haskell, and then an unrelenting sonic attack by all of the musicians playing together, showcasing the versatile drumming of Andy McCulloch (later of Greenslade). `The Battle of Glass Tears' concludes with an atmospheric electric guitar outro by Fripp, and then the final section of `Lizard', `Big Top', is a whirlwind of chaotic circus noises that ends the album on a playful note.<br />Whatever its flaws, `Lizard' is a wonderfully inventive King Crimson album containing many interesting musical ideas, and curious listeners should definitely give it a chance. As we all know, Crimson went on to do many weird and wonderful things after `Lizard', and are still going strong today. But the other happy story is that Gordon Haskell, who languished in relative obscurity as a solo artist for years after `Lizard', eventually found fame when his recent single `How Wonderful You Are' became a surprise hit.
B0000640S1|4.0|First Blood is an extremely important film but perhaps not for the chest-thuming nationalism that somewhat spoils its compelling climax. First Blood taps more importantly into themes of homosexuality and masculinity. The nature of Rambo's relationship with the old war \\"buddy\\" he seeks in Small town, USA is never fully explained, his rage at not finding him never entirely clarified. The viewer is invited to empathise with Rambo's cause, not because we can relate to him, but because he is rhe ideal attractive yet vulnerable male. Given that the target audience of this film is young men it is entirely reasonable to suggest that an exploration of homosexuality is a deliberate sub-theme. For those in doubt it is worth considering Stallone himself in this and the subsequent Rambo films. Long haired and muscles bulging, it is not hard to imagine what the decidedly phallic weapon he holds at the ready represents.<br />I whole-heartedly recommend this film to evey young man, it is one of our favourites at my local YMCA.
B000003S09|5.0|The brilliance of this, King Crimson's 1969 debut album, is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing, because the album still stands as one of the greatest progressive recordings ever released, and began a musical odyssey that saw King Crimson continue to innovate for over 30 years. A curse, because nostalgia for this album has prevented people from appreciating the different musical directions taken by subsequent incarnations of King Crimson - people want to hear `In the Court of the Crimson King' all over again. But you can't repeat the magic by copying the past - you have to keep moving forward. And if this album is noteworthy, it's because it expresses a willingness to innovative that continues to this day.<br />Opening number `21st Century Schizoid Man', probably King Crimson's best-known track, is a furious assault on the senses, incorporating strong jazz influences but also anticipating the advent of heavy metal. Greg Lake's processed vocals and Peter Sinfield's sinister lyrics fit perfectly with the virtuoso musicianship. Robert Fripp - who went on to become one of the world's most interesting guitarists, and is the only original member of King Crimson still in the band today - plays a superb solo here, demonstrating that he had the chops from the outset.<br />Mellow follow-up `I Talk to the Wind' is a beautifully arranged song with flutes and melodious vocals, marred only by some embarrassing lyrics by Peter Sinfield. The album's third song, the apocalyptic `Epitaph', is its highlight, featuring the best vocal performance of Greg Lake's entire career. Michael Giles' playing on these two songs is incredibly precise and intricate, confirming him as one of the world's most underrated drummers (if you're impressed by his drumming here, his solo album `Progress' is also highly recommended).<br />`Moonchild' is a beautiful song, which may be familiar to some listeners from its use in Vincent Gallo's film `Buffalo 66' (in the film, Christina Ricci does a tap danceto it). The quiet, instrumental section that follows the song proper is loathed by many, who hit skip on their CD players when it comes on, but this part of the album actually repays patient listening, and is an interesting forerunner to Crimson's later experiments with radical improvisation. The album's closing track `The Court of the Crimson King' is wonderfully bombastic and evocative, with the band's trademark mellotron giving the song a wonderful sound.<br />With this 30th anniversary remaster, the album has never sounded better. The drums in particular, which sound wonderfully crisp, have benefited from the remastering.<br />What else is there to say about this album? Its writing and recording has been exhaustively documented, in Sid Smith's excellent biography `In the Court of King Crimson'. You can buy two albums by King Crimson precursor Giles, Giles and Fripp - `The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp' and `The Brondesbury Tapes' - which document how the Crimson style was first developed. And you can buy a live album by this original line-up of King Crimson, `Epitaph', that shows how impressive these pieces were when played in concert.<br />`In the Court of the Crimson King' has also had an interesting afterlife. In the 1990s, original King Crimson member Ian McDonald and later King Crimson vocalist John Wetton toured with ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett, and included `I Talk to the Wind' and `The Court of the Crimson King' in their setlist (these renditions are available on Hackett's live album `The Tokyo Tapes'). More recently, Michael Giles and Ian McDonald formed a new group, the 21st Century Schizoid Band, which performs King Crimson repertoire including `I Talk to the Wind', `The Court of the Crimson King' and `Epitaph'.<br />But while all of this is a testament to the brilliance and enduring popularity of `In the Court of the Crimson King', the album's true legacy is actually to be found elsewhere - namely, in King Crimson's latest album`The Power to Believe'. It's hard to imagine two albums that sound more different from one another than `In the Court of the Crimson King' and `The Power to Believe', but what the two have in common is an unmistakable and admirable pioneering spirit.<br />While it is unfortunate that King Crimson's debut album overshadows the band's later work, the album still contains within it the secret of Crimson's enduring popularity: a rigorously innovative approach towards music. Or, as Robert Fripp is fond of putting it, `King Crimson is a way of doing things'.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is by far the best CD I've heard in a long time, and long overdue.  I think its great they're getting so popular with having a female singer in a rock band format.  Amy's vocals are mesmerizing and the guitarist actually plays SOLOS....wow.  :-)<BR>Been awhile since rock songs have had those.  I'd urge everyone to go out and get this CD as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed at all.  If you like what you hear, you may also want to pick up a copy of a CD called 5:30 Saturday Morning by Lennon.  She's really great and the music is also rock...maybe a little heavier than Evanescence but I think most people will like it alot.  I think its about time a band like them have broken into popular radio, and hopefully its only a matter of time before similar bands do as well.
0380789019|5.0|Neil Gaiman takes a to a world of incredible imagination with his book Neverwhere. I am blown away by his concepts and character ideas. I completely fell in love with characters such as the marquis de carbas and hunter. The evil characters are so well put together that you find yourself gripping the pages when you read their names. I was completely taken away by this book and its concept and story. I think neil gaiman must be a real genius to think of the things and write the story he did. Amazing.
B000089RVX|1.0|I think this has got to be the most self involved, self important [stuff] I've ever heard. Is there ever going to be and end to the self pity music scene? I won't waste time going through each song because they're pretty much all the same. I wish I could at least say the musicianship is good, but I can't. So if you like your cheese with a whole lot of moody whine than this is the band for you! But I would get the most out of your listen because I have a feeling this is the first and last we will hear of this...

B00008DDSA|5.0|People may say that Secretary is all about sadomasochism, but, its more about it's characters, than what they do. Yes, Secretary takes a look a sodomasochism in a new kind of light; No one is dressed in leather; You don't feel like it ought to be called \\"The Rubber Ball\\"; They are just people... with needs- it's about what's normal about them, rather than what may be considered deviant that makes it worthwile.<BR>The characters are played extremely well. Lee Halloway, and Mr. E. Edward Gray are phenominal. They have an irristable dynamic.<BR>Were I to categorize this, I would have to place it with the romantic comedies.<BR>This is something I would feel okay seeing with my mom, but, not my kids. The scenes are not too terribly graphic, overall, but some are questionable, and inappropriate for youngsters.
B00007K02F|3.0|I am not giving it a lot of stars, but I think this DVD is gorgeous. I love the story. I love the acting.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This was Bogart's greatest dramatic role, in a movie based on the novel by the \\"mysterious\\" B. Traven. The entire cast, but especially Bogart and Walter Huston, turned in the best performances of their careers.Why this isn't on DVD yet is totally beyond me...
B00003CXXM|3.0|Indie director Doug Liman promised a different, intelligent variation on the Hollywood spy thriller with this remake of The Bourne Identity, and he does deliver: the film is low-keyed, the characters' behavior reasonably naturalistic, the action human-scaled. There's no bracing stupidity on display here.<br />Unfortunately, while this approach dodges typical action bombast, it also manages to avoid much in the way of excitement. Moment to moment, the film is elegantly directed; individual action scenes impress, as does the naturalistic acting, and there are scenes of reasonable suspense. <br />But despite this, most of the film feels vaguely dull. There's just not enough story here. In the interests of style and believability, the filmmakers have stripped their tale so lean that there's not much reason to care what happens their characters, or down the backstretch even why Bourne and his CIA handlers behave as they do. <br />The Bourne Identity is extremely well-crafted, and probably the best film that could have been made from this script, but for all its cool, the end result is tepid. For a better stab at an intelligent, humanistic spy film, try Tony Scott's Spy Game.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The plot is not very original, and the technical quality of the is not that impressive. But the way the movie is made is absolutely incredible and so very unpredictible, and doesn't give away much of the details of the actions of who (in the end) seems to be the &quot;bad guy&quot;. I have seen it about a dozen times, and I keep seeing passages i haven't seen before, therefor I simply have to rate this as the ultimate masterpiece.
B000089RVX|5.0|On any other nu-metal album, Evanescence's first single, &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; would have been far and away the star track.  It is a testament to the quality of &quot;Fallen,&quot; then, that the same song is eclipsed by nearly every other track on the album.<br />It is perhaps misleading to even use the phrase &quot;any other nu-metal album,&quot; since that implies that Evanescence is a nu-metal band.  They are most certainly not.  In fact, &quot;Fallen&quot; makes it quickly obvious that Evanescence will not be constrained by the genre boundaries most other bands fall prey to.  The band has an amazing knack for stylistic variety, going from sounding reminiscent of Linkin Park in &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; to hinting at some meld of Portishead and Enya in &quot;My Immortal,&quot; and back again, and everywhere in between.<br />The only constant is the unwaivering strength and beauty in the voice of sad angel Amy Lee.  While &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; hints at the power and drama of Lee's voice, it takes songs like &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet&quot; to truly demonstrate the breadth and impact she is capable of.<br />The amazing talent of Evanescence extends even into its lyrics, which are always intelligent, never patronizing, and from time to time even poetic.  Combined with Ms. Lee's soaring vocals, the lyrics make &quot;Fallen&quot; into an incredibly moving experience.<br />If anything bad can be said of Evanescence, it is that they are probably too talented for their own good.  In a market awash in derivative, manufactured emo-punk and nu-metal (the boy bands of the twenty-first century), where the absolute pinnacle of talent is Linkin Park and System of a Down, Evanescence may be too unique for the mass audience to swallow.  Nonetheless, &quot;Fallen&quot; is the most refreshing and diverse album I've heard in years, and I hope Evanescence is here to stay.

B00006LSM3|5.0|I have always been a Harrison fan, but like alot of other Harrison fans, could not be passionate about alot of his later work.  The first time I listened to \\"Brainwashed\\" it did nothing to reignite my passion.  The next few times I heard it, I starting remembering why I liked Harrison, so much, all those years ago.  I would not expect anyone but a Harrison fan to like this CD so much.  \\"Stuck inside a Cloud\\" is the song to start with.  \\"Marwa Blues\\" is a hauntingly beautiful instrumental, and in my opinion the best song on the CD, and possibly Harrison's best song ever.  Those two songs alone, make the CD his best work ever.<br />     \\"Vatican Blues\\" is clearly Clapton.  The lyrics in \\"Pisces Fish\\" are interesting to say the least, and of course there is the hint of Indian music throughout the CD.  \\"Never get Over You\\" is a nicely syncronized song with touching singing and guitar playing.<br />      The best part of the CD is the guitar playing.  If you listen to \\"Marwa Blues,\\" and it doesn't make you sad that Mr. Harrison is gone, you were not a Harrison fan to begin with.

0767830555|5.0|The ending of Taxi Driver has generated a lot of controversy and confusion because most people tend to assume that it's a simple continuation of the narrative of the film.  In critical studies, however, the possibility is often raised that the end (after the  the shoot-out scene to the end of the movie) is no less than Bickle's dying delirious imagination.  I want to set forth the case that this is so.<br /><br />First, at the end of the shoot-out scene, Bickle rolls his eyes backwards in the classic movie signature of death.  Just before, of course, he put his blood-dripping finger up to his temple and mimed blowing his own brains out (after having failed with the empty real guns).  Bickle is suicidal, dying, and will not recover.<br /><br />Second, after this scene the camera pans across various news clippings on the wall of Bickle's room; these clippings describe him as a &#34;hero&#34; that saved a young girl.  Also we hear the voice-over of Iris' parents saying that Bickle would always be welcome in their home for saving Iris.  But think about real life crimes for a moment.  When newspapers report about a man that goes on a shooting spree in a run-down part of town, do they really ever report them as &#34;heroes&#34;?  Even if Bickle could explain to them why he did this (Iris' dad says he was in a coma after the shoot-out), would anyone really take a person like this at their word?  And would Iris' parents really want to allow a murderous man a place at their table?  What we have here is Bickle's fantasy about how he _wants_ the press and Iris' folks to interpret his actions, not a realistic view of how the world generally views such actions.<br /><br />Third (along the same lines as #2), it's hard to imagine Bickle's buddies at the cabstand glossing over his rampage and treating him like old times.  Really, if a co-worker of mine were involved in so violent an incident, I would probably not hang out with him so blithely.  This is Travis imaginging that things are &#34;back to normal&#34; after getting out of the hospital -- a fantasy of peace.<br /><br />Fourth, Bickle happens to find Betsy in his cab soon after returning to work.  How fortuitous in a city of millions!  But their conversation shows that she now respects him, considers him a hero like the newspapers and Iris' parents.  Again, extremely unlikely -- especially given their history.  In real life if she heard about the rampage (or recognized him trying to kill Palentine), that would only tend to confirm her earlier opinion of him as a depraved person.  But here she also interprets his actions in the way he wants them to be interpreted (that he saved Iris from the human scum that were selling her) rather than how she probably would in real life.  (Also note that the photography of this scene always shows Betsy's face from his viewpoint, floating in a dreamlike way in his rear-view mirror.)<br /><br />Fifth, when Bickle drops Betsy off she seems uncertain, embarrased, and demure, and is obviously just on the verge of offering some kind of intimate apology.  Instead she asks how much is the fare.  He drives off without accepting a dime.  This is Bickle's triumph -- he wins their relationship battle by rejecting _her_, and by being confident, independent, and morally superior.  Typical subconscious inversion tactic.<br /><br />Sixth, as he drives off, Bickle sees himself in the car's rear-view mirror, then adjusts it to see if he can see Betsy.  As he does so, a violent wrench is given to the accompanying musical score.  Then we see no one in the mirror at all as the credits roll to Bernard Hermann's haunting love theme.  There's nothing in the mirror (except the rolling, ubiquitous city) because Travis is not there.  Its symbolic of his death -- like that of a vampire -- that the mirror doesn't show his reflection.  Travis is dead and we have just witnessed his last thoughts.<br /><br />Travis is only a hero in his own mind.  There is no hero in this movie.  Itdoes not have a happy ending.  Travis continues to justify his own behavior and viewpoint to the last, and grants himself a kind of sainthood -- beatified by the press, Iris' parents, and Betsy's acquiescence.<br /><br />The tragedy of the movie is deepend by this reading of its end.  To my mind, this also makes the movie more coherent, since it's main theme is the psychological isolation of Travis Bickle.  The end consumates his separateness.  Others will never connect to his vision of himself as a master (rather than a victim) of circumstance, a protector of innocence, a scourge of evildoers, an instrument of God's judgement.havior and viewpoint to the last, and grants himself a kind of sainthood -- beatified by the press, Iris' parents, and Betsy's acquiescence.

B000002U82|1.0|The best thing about the album was the cover.  Nice to know they actually took some time to write &quot;Money&quot; because the rest of the album sounds completely the same.  Fortunately, they got it right when they released WYWH.  If WYWH had DSOTM album cover, it would have been the biggest selling album of all-time.

We did not realize until Feb 2003 that they were a hit here in the U.S. and we were able to catch them on MTVs TRL and MAD TV.<BR>I purchased the CD for my wife(was my girlfriend) for Women's Day(March 8).

THe song selection is great for the most part, they even included deuces are wild from the beavis and butthead album. However, the version of walk this way with RUN-DMC which is a great song and basically revived their career absent from the album though it obviously should be on there.

B000002JS6|5.0|ac/dc is one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time. Back in Black helps to prove this point by helping to capture the band at its peak with such great songs as given the dog a bone, let me put my love into you, you shock me all night long, and of course, back in black. After 23 years in release, Back in Black still sounds as great as it did when it was first released.
B00008BXJG|5.0|\\"Highway To Hell\\", released in 1979 was lead singer Bonn Scott's last album with AC/DC due to his untimely death. The album was a landmark for AC/DC and included their first ever radio hit (in the U.S.) in \\"Highway To Hell\\". The album is a hard rock lover's dream, with big power chords, lead breaks and powerful vocals. The songs that standout on this release (which make up for more than half the album) are the title track \\"Highway To Hell\\", \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\", \\"Shot Down In Flames\\", \\"Get It Hot\\", \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\\", \\"Walk All Over You\\", and \\"Touch Too Much\\". This newly remastered cd which is now under the Epic label sounds much better than the older 1994 remastered version. The bottom end, mid-range and output level have all been increased dramatically. I've actually compared them and found this new release to be the superior of the two. The digipak that holds the cd is very attractive and includes a booklet with colorful photos, etc. If you enjoy groups such as Judas Priest, UFO, Def Leppard, Krokus, Scorpions, etc. than you'll won't be disappointed with \\"Highway To Hell\\".
B000002JS8|5.0|After listening to this album several times, i still can't get over it. It helps to solidify AC/DC as one of the greatest hard rock bands ever with songs like if you want blood and girl's got rhythem. The album still hasn't lost its age after all these years and never will.
B00005JLXC|3.0|In order to appreciate the comic book hero movie genre, a viewer must be able not only to suspend disbelief regarding the superpowers of the characters, but also to expect certain forgivable clichés.  For instance, we all know going into this that our hero will have a passion for vigilante justice inspired by some childhood tragedy involving the death of his parent(s).  He will necessarily have to keep his identity secret, thus the tight leatherette costume.  He will have superpowers that are triggered by some freak accident (Batman is the only exception that comes to mind), and the villains may as well.  There is always a reporter lurking, waiting to expose him and pop the story of a lifetime.  And according to all good postmodern comic book superhero bylaws, he must be dark and conflicted; no more squeaky-clean, cheery, optimistic Superman types, no sir!  Yes, I expected these clichés and more, and I was even prepared to embrace them.  I was not disappointed there.<br />Daredevil delivers the expected elements, no question.  There is plenty of action and excitement as he leaps across rooftops, takes swan dives straight down skyscrapers and generally kicks ... like an uber-blackbelt.   The art direction and special effects are of course cutting edge (I ask you, could Ben Affleck sign on to a movie with second-rate special effects?).  I was particularly impressed with the sequences in which we are treated to a glimpse of the world our blind hero lives in; a vision of figures and objects rendered by his sonar senses into a sort of topographical light/shadow pattern.  The film noir look of New York City at night completes the mood nicely.<br />Where Daredevil failed for me was in the conspicuous logical flaws popping up throughout the film.  For instance, it was quite a stretch to believe that a childhood accident involving biohazardous liquid spraying across his eyes could impart supersenses while at the same time blinding Mr. Murdock:  but how does that translateto supernatural strength and reflexes?  And how would that protect him from being pulverized when landing on a fire escape from a head dive 40 stories up?  There was no freak accident to explain how archrival Bullseye and girlfriend Elektra came up with similar roof-bounding, gravity-defying abilities, either.  In a movie specifically billed as adult-oriented fare, I found these and other plot holes to be downright insulting to my intelligence.<br />This film would certainly have been condemned straight to video if not for the casting coup of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner in the leads.  Still, their star qualities could not salvage a contrived plot, unbelievable martial arts moves (note to director:  this was not Crouching Tiger!) and corny dialog.  I for one hope that it doesn't finish Jennifer's budding career, or ruin Ben's.  That being said, at least it was entertaining enough to sit through at the matinee price.  <br />One star for the special effects, one for the stylish art direction and one for the casting.
6302648750|5.0|This is kind of a dark comedy about two women going through different struggles in life, and at one point hating eachother, and then becoming good friends. Madeline Ashton (meryl streep) is a singer/performer, and is friends -although in a fake way- with Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn), who is getting married to a doctor. Madeline steels this doctor away, and Helen becomes fat and mentally ill. Both women search for happiness in their lives in different ways, but both of them end up at the same place, Lisa's (Isabella Rosesellini), who changes their lives forever -and deaths- forever.<br />This movie is rated PG-13, and is suited for most of the family. There is no real violence, and very little bad language. A very funny movie, and one that will be watched many times over.
B000001FZK|5.0|This is how music should be.<br />I will never tire of Talk Talk's final album Laughing Stock. From their first album until The Colour of Spring (1986) Talk Talk very definitely held my attention. The Colour of Spring is one of the best albums of the 8o's, no questions asked. And then they released 1988's Spirit of Eden. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. A total departure from where 'Life's What You Make it' seemed to say they were heading. I love Colour of Spring, but Spirit of Eden is something else. The first three songs from that album are worth the price alone.<br />And then there is Laughing Stock. It takes off where Spirit of Eden began, and i have heard nothing like it since. I've heard some acts emulate it, or incorporate its textures (Cowboy Junkies, Portishead come to mind), but no one will ever come close to what Talk Talk achieved on Laughing Stock.<br />I remember listening to this album for the first time, and realised that this is how the music industry should always have been. Displaying great pieces of creativity with support and pride. yeah right, like you can expect that. And that this album got deleted immediately is no surprise. 6 songs in all, but this album is so beautiful it goes beyond words. It incorporates Delta Blues, Mingus jazz, psychedelia, orchestral bombast and subtlety all in 6 songs. I have never heard anything like it before or since, and I miss Talk Talk as a group ever since. But if this is how they chose to go out, I can only commend them for going out with a style that is rarely seen in the music business.<br />The main theme of Laughing Stock seems to be about Redemption. Anyone familiar with Christian doctrine regarding Revelations will know what Ascension Day may refer to. This whole album seems to wrestle with the divine and the human. The limitations we feel as humans to overcome our deepest fears and drives. From the beginning of Myrrhman through til Taphead, these ruminations are explored lyrically and musically. This whole album seems like the journey of a soul. The reason that 'New Grass' seems a light relief is not only a musical one. Whats explored in After The Flood and Taphead seems an allusion to the fable of Noah and his Ark. And that 'New Grass' seems to imply that Hope is found once again after a great deluge only adds to the imagery and sonic explorations of Laughing Stock.<br />Laughing Stock is a summers day. It is the dead of night. Its so many things from song to song that I have always seen this work as a goal to aim for. As a musician, composer, you owe it to yourself to find and buy this album. As a music listener or lover, you owe it to yourself to find and buy this album. The only other album I can think of that is such a one of a kind is Kate Bush's The Dreaming. You hear it, and realise there is nothing like it. Thats what its all about. Thats what it should always be.<br />Laughing Stock. One of the best albums of the 9o's, and by far one of the best albums ever released. I'd actually beg you to buy it.album seems like the journey of a soul.

B00006RJHG|5.0|Black Christmas is the essential must-have for horror movie fans. I didn't realize that this film basically started the whole genre, pre-dating much of the well-known horror &quot;There's a killer on the loose&quot; classics. This movie will get under your skin, primarily due to all those psychotic phone calls. After having watched it, I can easily say that no other film of this type has left such a creepy impression on me. I wouldn't watch this film at night before going to bed, nightmares would be a given. <BR>Mind you, if you need blood and guts a'plenty, slashin' to and fro, then this movie may not be the one for you. Still, the insane, madman psycho in this will make you want to sleep with the lights on for a few weeks and double lock your doors. The film moves along well, with not a high count of murders occurring that frequently either. But those crazy phone calls just keep on coming. All the more to set you on your very last nerve. You'll be very surprised by the ending, it left me with  just one question - what ever happened to Claude the cat??<BR>   The picture and sound quality is excellent on this DVD version and comes with a special features section. However, the documentary with two stars from the film gets a little too silly if you ask me. Also included is commentary from director Bob Clark and actor John Saxon, but it is pretty much a rehash of what's already been spoken of in the documentary.  <BR>This version is a bit pricey, so if you don't want to shell out the extra money, then buy the 25th Anniversary DVD - Black Christmas will not disappoint.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the logical next step after 1996's ÆNIMA. Or the spiritual. Who knows? Maybe I'm just guessing. ÆNIMA to me, is a great purging of everything that is false, foul, horrible that we can think about eachother, the world, this reality. That album covered everything dark that UNDERTOW began to explore, but with much more power and focus. You began to think (if you were unfamiliar with TOOL in general), that something very very bad happened to one or all of them at some time. And then you realise that thing might be called Life.<br />And though it took five years and legal hassles, TOOL's '4th' album 'LATERALUS' arrives. And it is my favourite of all of their releases. Usually bands have that second album jitters, that third album find yourself, fourth/fifth album repeat formula vibe to them. Not this band. This album is amazing. And after I saw them live at the Brixton Academy on the Lateralus tour, I never looked at TOOL the same way again.<br />Lateralus is an incredibly positive work. Lyrically it picks up where ÆNIMA would leave you. Either you wallow in the depths of it all, or you re-awaken searching for what is greater than that.<br />Lateralus is awakening. This album is so powerful and beautiful, it makes everything else out there (apart from Peter Gabriel's UP and George Harrison's BRAINWASHED to me) look lame. I remember both times I saw the Lateralus tour, by the time they played the first song, I had completely forgotten who the opening act was. There is nothing out on the current music scene quite like TOOL.<br />To explore all the things spoken of on Lateralus would take ages. A little bit of ÆNIMA is left on songs like The Grudge and Ticks and Leeches, but mostly these songs speak of the illusion of our reality, communication, and trying to break through rational barriers to see the unseen. Some complain the songs are too long. Me personally, would love to see an orchestral version of these songs! I can imagine what Ticks and Leeches would sound like with just a full orchestra. Absolutely powerful.<br />But most of all, it is the title track 'Lateralus' that keeps me saying this album is their best so far in an already very high standard of works. I can play this song over and over again, and never get tired of the mood it sets and its conclusion. Stunning.<br />And that visually, TOOL are as adept at bringing across their visions is a plus. It gives all of their work scope. The video for SCHISM works perfectly with the song, and that SCHISM actually has a musical 'finale' like in orchestral works always makes me smile. The video ties in with this as well, which then makes me chuckle.<br />TOOL is very much an inspiring and creatively forceful group of people.

B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie was incredible.  I was heartbroken to find that I was only able to see it the one time.  I consider myself lucky to have had a chance to see it however.  I firmly belive that it should be re-released on the big screen, and I would go see it again even if I owned it on DVD.<br />One of the first movies where I felt a connection with the actors, getting so pulled into the movie I found myself with a fist in the air cheering for the good guys!
B00000I2PG|5.0|This is something everyone should have in their collection. Without a doubt. Whether you like jazz, or metal, or funk. Whatever your tastes, they should include great music, and at least one album that Trevor Horn has produced :)<br />This album from start to finish is classic. With a capital C for the class part. Musically smart, lyrically clever (sometimes brilliant), and performed with alot of style, ABC's first full length album can sit on your stereo from start to finish.<br />To begin with, the songwriting is excellent. With or without Horn, Martin Fry and Mark White did know how to write good songs, melodically catchy and hook laden, with just enough smarts to separate it from the rest of the 80's pack of new Romantic / European disco bands. ABC's album survives trends and fashions just because the album is timeless. Its not mired in a dated 80's sound really. Keyboards and synths are in the background adding texture, String arrangements add the flourishes, and the bass guitar dominates the whole album.<br />I think my favourite song has always been DATE STAMP on this album. The obvious hits The Look of Love / Poison Arrow will always be what they are, great dance pop, and Many Happy Returns is always a joy to behold.<br />Just a great album to own, not in nostalgia, just because it is a great piece of work.
0790737345|4.0|I just finished watching this movie and I just had to write a review. I decided to watch this movie with some reservation.  I think Nicholas Cage is a fine actor but he looks just like my much despised ex. It didn't take too long for me to get past it though. He was so innocent and vulnerable, just like I imagine an angel to be. However, I just cannot buy Meg Ryan as a heart surgeon. But this is Hollywood after all, so I gave it a try. I'm glad I did.<br />This movie took me on an emotional ride. I don't often cry at movies (in fact, Tears of Endearment was on just before City of Angels and I was dry-eyed the whole three hours). But City of Angels... I cried. It was especially touching to see them in the bedroom, together but not quite together with the haunting &quot;In the Arms of the Angels&quot; playing in the background. God it gave me chills. And tears. I'm usually pretty good at predicting movies but I didn't see that ending coming, it hit me like a kick in the stomach. I hated that movie at that moment. I hated everything. I really wanted everything to be happily ever after. But then I realized.... shlocky happy endings are so empty. While I didn't like the ending, I had to respect it. If a movie can do all of that to me in just 2 hours, I have to say I recommend it.

B00004XPP0|5.0|The Special Editions make the best even better!Added scenes and crisper sound enhance viewing pleasures.George Lucas wanted to go back and add scenes they couldn't do before due to lack of time,money or because the technology wasn't there.Recent strides in digital technology make this possible.The 3 movies look and sound better than ever!It's a must-have for any &quot;Star Wars&quot;fan.I love the improves sound and picture quality and so will you!THIS is the best boxed set you can buy.
B00008IAMD|5.0|Cash strikes gold again with American IV.  This is a terrific album, and one of the finest of his career.  Sure, his voice is a bit weathered over the years but it still has the great character and deepness we've come to appreciate over the years.  The cover of Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Hurt&quot; practically made me cry the first time I heard it.  This is especially true after you see the video for it.  I think the best original on this album is the title track, which might just be the best song on the album.  On Johnny Cash Appreciation Day on March 14, I will be listening to this album quite a bit.
B000084T18|5.0|This is my favorite cd.And think about that knowing I have cds by 2pac,snoop dogg,and jay-z,which everyone seems to think are the best.Their music is really tight,but there are a few bad tracks on all their cds(except jigga's the blueprint).there are no bad tracks on here.i've listened to the whole album twice today while just sitting in my room and boobing my head.yall people who hate just cuz he has hits and the underground rappers you like don't need to listen to the album.how can you not sing along to in da club,wanksta,and many men?how can #9,#7,and dont push me not get your head bangin?buy the cd,man.its worth it.
B000066NW0|5.0|I thought that this CD had a little punk and a little pop all mixed together to create a unique sound called Avril Lavinge. This CD is the amazing debut from a great Canadian Newcomer named Avril Lavinge. She has created her own unique style and is 'anything but ordinary' Unwanted is a very punk rock sounding song with great sound where as 'Anything but ordinary is &quot;toned down a notch&quot; This CD is excellent and has great balance. I like it even though I am not a huge punk/pop fan... In fact I normally listen to country. One of my friends (against my will) made me listen to this CD and I unexpectedly loved it! I bought this CD and have loved it ever Since I definitely reccomend it To everyone!
B000002H2H|5.0|I'm a very big Metallica fan, and Ride the Lightning is one of the 4 Metallica CD's, and I have of course heard all of the songs off of all the others.  Ride the Lightning is definitely one of their best cd's.  If you don't own any Metallica cds, I would advise getting this one first. I think it just shows vintage Metallica work, a must have! In my opinion, the best tracks are &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, and &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot;.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this CD a long long time ago, before &quot;No Such Thing&quot; even hit the radio. The thing was on sale for 7 dollars, why not right. So after listening to it I felt that this guy has a ton of talent, and I was really wondering why more people haven't picked up his CD. Well I suggest that you all do, it is such a complete and beautifully done CD. It isn't a surprise he became such a success, songs like &quot;3x5&quot;, &quot;Love Song For No One&quot; &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; &quot;Great Indoors&quot; and &quot;St. Patricks Day&quot; are really worth buying the CD for. This is one of those Cds that goes great from start to finish.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD really showcases Christina Aguilera's UNDENIABLE talent.  Her voice soars on this album and the songs are deep and incredible.  It truly is worth checking out if you are a fan of r&amp;b, rock, rap, pop...and any other classification you can think of.  This album really encompasses them all.  This is the best album I've heard in a long time and I would reccomend it to anyone who can appreciate a beautiful voice w/ soul and strength.  Check it out today!
B00005YW4H|2.0|She has a beautiful voice, btu does nothing special with it or her material.  I know she's extremely popular, but so was Lawrence Welk.
6305508550|1.0|Let me stress to you that this movie IS NOT funny.  It may be one worst movies I've seen.  I couldn't even sit through it.  Don't even waste your time watching this movie, it will waste brain cells that could be used by something more interesting (like sniffing glue for example LOL...that is actually funnier than the movie gets) I suggest that if you haven't watched it spare yourself.
B0000065O1|5.0|Cindy, PLEASE make a new video just like this one!!  And bring this one back too please?  Now I'm terrified my copy will wear out and I won't be able to replace it.<br />I have owned this workout for years, and I recommend it to everyone.  I've used it when I was fit and when I was flabby, and I just scale it back when I need to.  It is interesting, totally non-annoying, super-effective, and Cindy is incredibly pleasant to spend an hour with.<br />It is very important to do the exercises properly, and to not keep going when you get too fatigued to do them right.  Having said that, I am *always* able to get a workout from this that makes me feel great and makes me feel like I made real progress.<br />This workout is entirely different from anything else I have, and I like it 1,000 times better than anything else I have.
B000067CPX|1.0|Been a fan since the beginning. Gave up on them when Frusciante left. Moved on to different music. Just came back and listened to Blood sugar Sex Magic (Their Opus) and wanted some more, so I bought this one. What the hell Frusciante is with them now. Result - A waste of 14 bucks. This is their worst, as well as one of the most boring albums I have. I'll probably never listen to it again.  What's wrong with it?  Most of it is ballads/rock anthems - all sung in exactly the same way. Anthony is singing everything the same on this album. The musicianship is lazy, vanilla, safe, and boring.  Blood Sugar Sex Magic is as good as these guys will ever get. They should have broken up after that and gone their separate ways. End on a really high note.  There is one good song on this album and it still isn't all that great. Can't stop...that has a tiny bit of old Chilis with a new twist. Everything else is radio fodder.  I want my money back.
B000022TSV|5.0|Francesco Rosi, in much the same manner as Franco Zefferelli, directed a stunning and dramatic film about a popular opera. As with Verdi's La Traviata, Carmen is one of those mainstream, instantly recognizable and popular operas that even people who do not have in-depth knowledge or appreciation of opera. Georges Bizet's opera was based on the novella by Prosper Merimee, about a seductive Gypsy named Carmen who lures an innocent Spanish soldier (Don Jose) to a life of crime. When Carmen falls for a bullfighter, (Escamillo) she jilts him, but he becomes so jealous that he stabs Carmen in a crime of passion.<br /> The powerful emotions, as well as sexy Spanish tunes, were all beautifully composed by Georges Bizet. The role of Carmen is a mezzo soprano role, but many sopranos have tried their hand at the alluring heroine- she is, quite frankly, opera's most liberal, independent and modernistic heroines. Maria Callas, Beverly Sills, Tatiana Troyanos, Grace Bumbry and Shirley Verret have most notably performed the roles successfully. In the Rosi film, shot on location in Seville and other parts of Spain, Carmen is portrayed by Julia Migenes Johnson. It has been said before, Julia Migenes Johnson, although Spanish herself, could not capture the true essece of Bizet's heroine. <br />Her voice is not suited for the feisty, sexy heroine and although she must have practiced considerably, she fails to become the fatal Carmen. Julia's voice is not pretty, not does it sound \\"French\\", or Spanish for that matter. Her only successful parts come at the end, in which she confronts Don Jose at the bullfight, dressed elegantly in red and meets her death at his hands. The very scene is symbolic. At the bullfight, Escamillo, Carmen's new lover, is fighting a bull, and just as he stabs the bull to its death, Don Jose stabs Carmen to her death. Carmen is herself as free and untamed as the bull, and only the domineering, jealous, crazed Don Jose could end her life and terminate that freedom.<br />Of all the performances in the film, Placido Domingo as Don Jose is the most gratifying. A true actor, Placido immerses himself in the character, becoming the romantic, jealous and dark soldier whose obscession for Carmen becomes a sort of madness. Placido Domingo is the modern Enrico Caruso. Few tenors have his dramatic potential combined with great rich tenor vocal qualities. Ruggero Raimondi is the baritone who portrays Escamillo, and he does it very successfully. A handsome, earthy man, he fits the role of the boastful, macho bullfighter that wins Carmen's attentions. Faith Esham sings the role of Micaela, a character in Bizet's opera but not in the Merimee novella. Micaela is the beautiful, sedate, modest Christian young woman whom Don Jose is engaged to marry, but the woman he abandons for the more exciting and seductive Carmen. The cinematography of the film is lush, realistic and symbolic. The musical score finely arranged and conducted. As a film, this opera makes for great drama. Music classes should even see this film for some kind of lesson plan. It is also one of Placido Domingo's greatest roles, some would say the greatest.
B00008IAMD|5.0|this is a great record, with great attention to musical and &quot;spirtual detail&quot;. it is one of the records i heard in a long while.. great cover to cover thanks!
8408038818|5.0|Una extraordinaria narracin, bien construida, con un enfoque &quot;cinematogrfico&quot;. Habla de muchas cosas. Del amor, de la separacin forzada de dos personajes centrales , Julian Carax y Penlope, y de como otros personajes, fascinados por la historia de Julin (notable escritor, aunque no reconocido) reconstruyen los pasos perdidos, en un ambiente de intriga cada vez mayor, con el paisaje gris de la Barcelona de postguerra como teln de fondo.

B000001ESJ|5.0|I saw a review on here where someone said Madrigal wan't \\"sincere\\" and their heart wasn't in it. Sorry pal but it's one of Rushs' best songs and definetly one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Xanadu is amazing especially for musicians who like a good round of Rush in their daily exercise. Every song on this album is good even if there are certain points where ya kinda cringe especially \\"Cinderalla Man\\". Hey it's a great song but the title of the song just gives me a weird image in my head that I can't seem to shake. Go buy it!<br />5 outta 5!!!
0316666343|5.0|Except for the Susie's description of her rape and murder, it's not a grisly book.  Sebold has done her research well, especially in how society helps people cope with the murder of a child/sibling.  You find yourself rooting for the younger sister and her junior high boyfriend to marry right out of college and for the boy Susie loved to make it with the arty girl that susie would have been close friends with.  You also find yourself hoping the cop would get smart and listen to Susie's dad.  And how do you help little Buck?  Four years old and your big Sis murdered?  Alice Sebold could easily become as great as Ridley Pearson and Susan Conant...
B00006690G|5.0|An excellent CD to have and listen where ever you go. Eminem is a fantastic rapper.<BR>I love all of his music, they are unique.<BR>I love the song:  Hailie's song because Eminem really speaks from his heart, i love him because he is the most sweetest father that anyone could ask for,Eminem is a fantastic father...<br />The song: Without Me will blow your mind away that you will love it from the start.The beat is amazin the eminem is awsome.<br />Sing for the moment- is a fantastic song also, the beat and the chorus, absoutley wonderful.<BR>The whole album is full of great songs, I truly recommened this album is great........<br />Eminem has to continue his excellent Job...
B000069AUI|3.0|Coldplay burst upon the scene a couple of years back with &quot;Parachutes&quot;. Yellow got a lot pf play, but I never liked its sappy lyrics and uninterestingly sweet melody. Most of their stuff seemed heavily influenced by Britpop such as Radioheads Bends phase and Oasis. But on their follow up, they really improved a lot.<br />While this album still isn't knock-your-socks-off amazing, its decent enough. It has one outstanding track, and several decent ones, and a bunch of filler with one or two annoying tracks.<br />&quot;Daylight&quot; really stands out as the best track. The swooping guitar, the cushion of bass and piano and the contrasting driving drums in the verses really lends a sense of drama to this song, while Martin's voice hovers monotonically over the whole thing. It sounds like the one song that they might have written stoned, so maybe they should get stoned more often.<br />&quot;Politik&quot;, &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;In My Place&quot; are decent enough, although &quot;In My Place can get annoying fast. &quot;The Scientist&quot; comes across as boring, like a number of the other songs.<br />With better consistency, and more melodic substance to some of these songs (by way of example, Politik enthralls for about 3 minutes, then runs dry as the key shifts and the song runs on empty for 2 more minutes), Coldplay could definitely come up with a very memorable album.<br />Also, on a side note, Martin appears to be an egotistical hog of the limelight. Seeing them live, Martin's antics on piano and mike basically took up the entire stage, while the rest of the band stood in place and played way in the background.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Back in 1974 when I was a young lad of 12, I first heard this gem in my sisters car.  But what really blew me away was later discovering the lp with headphones.  As far as tone goes, especially on the title track, and the outro guitar solo on TOO ROLLING STONED, he stands alone.  Nobody else out there quite sounds like Robin. There may be faster, better schooled players out there, but this is all about the vibe, tone and groove.  The live extras are a nice addition to the expanded cd.  I also recommend his BACK IT UP cd released in 1983.  It is sadly overlooked, and was the last release to feature longtime member James Dewar on vocals.
B000002IWQ|2.0|I remember anticipating this album when it came out I had heard \\"stick it out\\" and was counting the days. Finally THE ALBUM CAME AND!.......it was HORRIBLE!!<br />Basically I figured out in one listen that \\"animate\\", \\"stick it out\\", and \\"double agent\\" were about the only good things this album had to offer and NO I DON'T LIKE \\"hero\\" that song was awful.  I'm giving it two stars because the 3 songs I mentioned were so good that it saves this poor album from being a 1 star.<br />2 outta 5!
B00006F83Y|4.0|I LOVE this album, it's nothing new; it's just more commercial than their other albums due, largely, to the addition to Dave Grohl on drums. I was not disappointed in this album,it was as I expected. Not as good as their others but still worth a listen.If you're looking for a new sound, pick up Desert Sessions Volumes 7&amp;8. I warn you, though, if you are an MTV enthusiast, you WILL NOT like QOTSA or, mainly, Desert Sessions. Maybe you'd rather pick up a Korn cd or something else largely consumed by 12 year-olds.
0066214122|1.0|I had trouble getting through thi book, and I would agree that it seems to be written more like a screenplay than a typical Crichton novel.  I was very disappointed with this book, both because it was clearly written to be a movie, and it seemed to be Jurassic Park in a new environment - evil genetically enhanced creatures attacking humans who (shock) are trapped in an isolated compound.  The story was all too predictable and familiar to be entertaining.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Superman-The Movie soars because of Richard Donner, Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando, Geoffrey Unsworth, Roy Field, Zorin Perisic, and so many other brilliant players. There will never be a &quot;family&quot; like this one again who came together and created magic in filmmaking. This film is not about special effects. It's an actor's, director's, and cinematographer's film. The writing is unmatched (especially when you compare it to the other Superman films), and the performances are powerful, innocent, charming, and original. Christopher Reeve is THE reason for watching this movie. He was born to play the character. What made his performance so perfect (besides his good lucks, charm and acting talent) was that he purposely underplayed the characters, especially Superman. There will never be another Man of Steel, on film or in real life, like Chris.<BR>I was research consultant on the DVD restoration (see my name as the last credit in the documentaries), and what an honor and thrill it was to be involved in such a fun and exciting project. I was extremely pleased with the results. I saw the remaster projected in San Antonio in March 2001 and was blown away. It definitely looked and sounded superior to what I remember in 1978. I sent about 100 pounds of photos and promotional items to Warner Bros. for consideration in the documentaries/supplemental section of the DVD. A lot was used, however, a stills gallery was rejected because WB wanted to stay with a one disc, dual-sided DVD package. I decided to create the CapedWonder website to showcase the images that didn't make it on the DVD. Check it out sometime. <br />To all who made this wonderful film from March 1977 to October 1978, and to those who remastered it in 2000 and 2001...Thank You! I believe...<br />Jim Bowers<BR>CapedWonder
0971855110|5.0|I am so happy I have found this book. I had heard of a lot of people saying that they were flybabies and swearing by the flylady's methods, but never really gave it a second thought...I'm so happy that I came upon this book because it is saving me so much grief and stress. I feel like a new person since I have started my baby steps!<BR>The book is fun to read and easy to implement. I dont have to worry about speed cleaning anymore when surprise company is coming over.<BR>If you haven't read it or visited the website you are truly missing out! I highly recomment it.
B00006F83Y|4.0|I really enjoyed listening to this album. If you want to buy it just because you like &quot;No One Knows&quot; my advice is don't. If you're hooked on the radio waves and watching MTV you most likely hate this album. It's not ground-breaking, it's not innovative. It's just ANOTHER great album by Queens Of The Stone Age. Lanegan's and Homme's vocals are beautiful as always. Dave Grohl's drumming is probably his best ever recorded (in my opinion). Grohl has brought a lot of attention to this band. Attention I don't really feel comfortable about them having, because people will buy the album souly because Dave drummed on it. It sounds NOTHING like the Foo Fighters (and nothing like Kyuss). It's more 'radio-friendly' than any of their other stuff, but not too commercial or watered-down. I love this album, it's quickly becoming one of my top albums.
B00001OH7T|5.0|You're walking down the street, minding your own business. <BR>Suddenly, a lavender Cadillac pulls up alongside you. <BR>The tinted window rolls down and it's Soulboy Dave beckoning to you from his lepoardskin upholstery. <BR>You get in and minutes later you're in his bachelor pad, <BR>on his round waterbed and he's crooning...<BR>&quot;Can you hear me? Can you feel me inside?&quot;<BR>Yes David, I think I can...
B00005JLSC|5.0|Chicago is a musical from which other musicals should be molded!  Not since the Streisand and Andrews genre of musicals have I been so entertained.  The story of women wronged and taking revenge on countless men, at a time when women had barely gained the right to vote is easy to swallow under the careful spell cast by this powerful A-list ensemble of actors.<BR>The music, costumes and choreography nearly overshadow the exceptional acting.  But they also leave you wanting more, more, more!
B000002MP2|5.0|This is a great album if you are just getting into Green Day, with all of their overplayed hits and some really good songs like &quot;Sassafrass Roots&quot; and &quot;Coming Clean&quot;. This is just Green Day doing what they do best, making some of the catchiest music on the planet with some of the best lyrics i've heard in a while. So many bands owe Green Day a tremendous amount of graditude because they made this kind of music acceptable.
B00003CY0V|1.0|If I could give it zero stars, I would.  Every so often I run across a movie that is so lame that I regret wasting time to watch it, and this falls firmly into that category.  I would say that Deterrence, which I hated, was better than Swordfish.  There's no \\"meaning\\" to be found, there's no intriguing story to watch, there's nothing but weak cliche followed by trite cliche followed by predictable cliche, and so on.  Travolta did a great job of acting -- like Travolta.  Not too hard of a role to assume, I can act the same way all the time too.  Of the various cardboard characters in this weak film, his portrayal was the most distracting because it was so obviously Travolta.  Having a no-name actor play that part would have been better, at least it wouldn't have distracted from the character (not that there was much to distract from, of course).  I find it hard to believe that anyone would rate this more than one or two stars and give it glowing comments -- it's certainly not something I would ever recommend to someone else.
B000069HKH|2.0|Ever get the feeling this guy is trying to completely [copy] Bon Jovi?  Cuz I do.  The way Springsteen tries to play up his Jersey roots reeks of emulation of what Jovi was doing fifteen years ago, in the '80s.  Also, this guy's singing style is exactly like Jovi's, as is his pub-rock sound.  Little advice, Bruce: Leave the making of true Jersey hard rock to Metal Masters like Jovi.    <br />On a fair note, though, this guy has a John Cougar Mellencamp aura in his music that does resonate.  He writes good tunes for the workin' man, and that's something to be admired!!  Still, it's best to stick with more sincere rock that works: Jovi, Matchbox 20, and Sugar Ray.<br />See ya!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I have seen Metropolis four times on public domain prints with an irrelevant organ score, faded black and white film, scratchy sequences, etc. Seeing this new Kino version is a revelation! If you have never seen it, do yourself a favor and invest now. You won't believe your eyes or ears. The original, full orchestral score energizes the film tremendously. The crisp, wet scanned print will erase every memory you ever had of what this film looked like. The restored scenes will broaden your understanding of what the film was about. The extras are generous: documentaries, biographies, etc. This version restores Metropolis to what it is: a major achievement of silent film!

B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on the radio, I thought it was one of the most amazing songs I've heard in a long time. After listening to the cd, I can definiely say that the other 10 songs don't disappoint and are put together perfectly to produce very thoughtful, and melodic music. Amy Lee's haunting vocals blend extremely well with Ben Moody's riffs to take the listener on a musical journey you will never forget. My favorite songs include Bring Me To Life, Everybody's Fool, Going Under, and Tourniquet, but then again they're all great. If you wanna make a smart decision, buy this cd!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Ok, I wrote a review for this CD about two days after it came out. I think I gave it 4 stars. Over the months my opinion has changed. I listened to it non-stop for like three months and then, ofcourse new cds move in and it gets phased out. But a week or so ago Avril was resurected and is now playing again. <br />You know what? This is a great CD. It is exactly what it claimed to be. An 18 year old girl who writes her own stuff (ofcourse she gets some help from The Matrix-- she's 18. She's needs help sometimes), plays a little guitar and is a little punk. Ok, here is the point people jump on all the ... time. The punk issue. NOT PUNK ROCK!!! Everyone who can hear knows this is pop not punk. She never said she was punk. She said she was A punk...Like a brat, a troublemaker, a kid. Which I've heard from people who know her that this is true. <br />So just take this album for what it IS: a perfect pop record. It's not punk rock, it doesn't want to be. Get off this kids back man. ...
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I am a Metallica fan, but the first time that I heard the S&M CD, I didn't like it because it wasn't the pure sound of Metallica, you know, sometimes you try to be a \\"purist\\". A friend of mine gave it to me as a birthday present, well, a couple of months after that I bought this EXCELLENT DVD.<br />The sound in 5.1 is completely great, like being there, and the songs selection is great too.<br />I really recommend this DVD/VHS to anyone who likes, even a little, this great band. I promise that if you can't feel tuned with it at the beginning, you will love it in a very short time.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is great. There is not a bad song. Some arists say that they have a cd that you don't have to skip songs but this one is on that you can listen to all the way through, over and over. I love this CD.

B000055Y0X|5.0|Dr. Strangelove is a funny look at our society during the early cold war years. It is a reminder for those of us that remeber the Cuban missle crisis; and a history lesson for younger folks. You can at least learn to laugh at the bomb.
B000089RVX|5.0|I would have never have bought this cd or gave it a second look.   The only reason why I got it it because my friend downloaded a bootleg copy that had several places were the music company scratched the music.  The four songs I heard were incredible; what talent!  Amy Lee's voice is truely heavenly and hard at other times.  The interchange of crushing guitars, piano chords and dark chorus' are just well done.  This is not a band you would expect to be signed by a major label becuase they are NOT mainstream.<br />They have huge talent, their WHOLE cd is a must listen (normally I don't buy CDs cause I'm not going to pay for 2 mediocre songs with another 10 filler garbage tracks).  I'd pay to listen to any cd they put out if it is as good as this one.  MUST BUY!<br />Dark, moody CD that really shines even though it is dark.  Goto their website and read the lyrics....just incredible....great job.
B000089RVX|5.0|In an age where many newer bands run the same sound and rhetoric, reminding us that grunge really is dead, Evanescence is a breath of new life into the mainstream. With their major label debut, Fallen, they stand distinguished among the neo-punks and Creed [copies] that define today's pop rock.<br />Ben Moody sets the dark, savage tone of the album with grinding guitar riffs. Amy Lee balances the sensor shattery with her beautiful, yet haunting vocals. Together with the piano talents of David Hodges, drum work by Josh Freese, and bassist Francesco DiCosmo, Evanescence defy their name through their music.<br />The songs are pieces of tragic poetry, beautiful and chilling. They tell of pain, desperation, and loss, with a hint of inner strength and resolve. You may find yourself moved to tears through the longing words of My Immortal, or even relating Everybody's Fool to a previous relationship.<br />Moving onto a major label and making a mainstream release has not changed the tone of Evanescence one bit. In the end this may not bode well when it comes to radio play, but talent like this does not go unnoticed forever, nor does it burn out under the spotlight. This album is worth every penny and more, and worth your listen.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters, Inc. is an annimated movie about the 'monster and human worlds' with a happy ending.  It has two dvd's on the movie and one special features.  For the price it is it's a good buy.
1587990717|2.0|Let's ignore the author's obvious eagerness to show us how much smarter than everyone else around him he is, and how &quot;cool&quot; he is by being unconventional. The core ideas he attempts to present ARE important, but he does them a disservice by his scattershot explanations and disjointed examples. This wouldn't be so bad if he was presenting new ideas or theories, but he is mostly simply rehashing rather old thoughts. <br />To be more positive, here are some books that cover many of the same topics but in much clearer and more entertaining ways: &quot;Inevitable Illusions : How Mistakes of Reason Rule Our Minds&quot; by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, &quot;How to Lie with Statistics&quot; by D. Huff, and most anything by John Allen Paulos.
B000089RVX|5.0|This has to be the best music I have heard in a long long time. I can't stop listening to all the songs and I mean all the songs. If they stay on their present course, they'll hit super-stardom. A lot of bands start out ok but fall by the waste-side. Let's hope this does not happen to Evanescence!!!!
B000063DIH|3.0|Let me cut to the chase with this review and state right off the bat that this is not vintage maiden, this is a maiden lost in transition and coming to an end of an era.  All was not well in the Maiden camp, tensions were fray between Steve Harris  and Bruce Dickinson due to conflicting views in musical direction and new guitarist Janik Gers was getting flack for his off the wall style which was uncomplimentary with Dave Murray's.  Also metal was coming back down to earth following the glory days of the 1980s but all this was nothing as for the complete demise of Maiden in the early 90s could be summed up in two words - Adrian Smith. Smith was a key player in the songwriting department and his superior controlled and highly melodic style along with the telepathic understanding with life time friend Dave Murray was the soul of Maiden's sound.<br />Following the disastrous 'No prayer for the dying' there had to be some improvement and there was, but sadly very little. Things starting well with the flying opener 'be quick or be dead' great sound, heavy and great lyrics, good ol' anti-capitalist stuff.  It is here we are introduced to Bruce Dickinson's raspy, deeper vocals which are a clear indication maiden are going for more linear metal to take after their pinnacle metal/prog achievement 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son' which was a masterpiece. The second song 'From here to Eternity underlines Maidens new direction, flirting with the girls, bikes and leather metal styling, this song me be a semi-spoof but to the untrained eye it's just hair metal, something Maiden thankfully never were. This feel is incorporated over into 'fear is the key', 'wasting love', 'chains of misery', 'Judas be my guide' and 'weekend warrior' which are so utterly dreadful they get the prize for being the lowest of the low on any Maiden album. On these songs The melodies are straight forward and predictable, vocally and lyrically uninspiring and Janik's soloing as masturbatory at times, simply awful.<br />However if it wasn't for 3 outstanding all time Maiden classics which can be found on this album I would be e-mailing Amazon to put in a minus star rating option.  The songs 'Be quick or be Dead', 'Afraid to shoot Strangers' and the epic 'Fear of the Dark' make the album worthwhile. Based on the gulf war track 3 'Afraid to shoot stranger's is both musically and lyrically beautiful with a poetic feel in it's melody and energising explosion in the middle, basically war is put to music, and it's fantastically done. <BR>From here on in your sitting through some very average and at times awful music and your wondering what the hell is going on until 'Fear of the Dark' hits. Wow, what a song, a classic all time metal anthem rises from the dust of the album and packs one hell of a punch. From the epic opening lines to the immensely energetic explosion it grabs hold and doesn't let go, even Janik manages to pull of a blinder of a solo, feel, energy, killer riffs and a sing along chorus you cannot go wrong.<br />Overall this album is poor by Maiden standards and for me the made the wrong choice for regressing to a kind of Americanised biker hair metal theme. Also as we all know things went from bad to worse after this album although the story did have a happy ending with the reunion of Bruce and Adrian and the brilliant 'Brave new World' and they found the Maiden of old, forever may it prosper.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Just saw MONSTERS INC. for the first time, and although I wasn't looking forward to some of the cutsy schmaltz that sometimes overly pervades certain Disney films, the entrancing--and vivid--computer animation totally sucked me in, so much that I soon couldn't care less about whatever corny little story the screenwriters were trying to make me believe.  <br />However, a funny thing happened during my ongoing visual and aural animation: I actually started caring about the story, about the characters created only from photons and actors' voices--as well as from a screenplay that is completely inoffensive to little ears, yet also listenable to bigger ones. And the graphics--wow! At times I found myself forgetting that this wasn't live-action, especially during what I felt was the best scene, one that reminded me of a wicked inverted-rollercoaster ride. <br />Well, there you have it: a film that everyone from five and up can enjoy, for different aspects of it.  Aside from the wonderful visuals, of course we also get two of the best vocal acting performances in recent memory, from Billy Crystal and John Goodman. Yes, we also get some of those patented Disney/Pixar fake 'outtakes' during the closing credits (I know they're a bit corny by now, but they're still kind of cute).  With all of the extras on the DVD, I'd say it's a good buy--whether you have a kid or not.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
0440227534|5.0|This is a great fiction that catches our attention. The story should be appealing to both children and adults alike. The narrative style is fluent and very effective. It is gripping enough to be finished in one sitting.
B00008976Y|5.0|It goes to this film's infinite praise to state that the gripping plot is a mere by-product of Kielowski's aesthetic vision.  \\"Blue\\" is an impressionist painting in motion; a cinematic experience of objects and faces immersed in shadows and pulsating hues.  Seductively textured in this film is the title: blue is the faint glaze of a suit worn by a man at a funeral; blue are the bare walls in a deserted home; blue is the twilight reflected on a child's crystal lamp, and the scribbled notes on an unfinished composition; blue is the tattered facade behind a flute player out in the street. \\"Blue\\" is the portrait of a woman hardened by tragedy, but redeemed by music.  <br />Watch this film, and relish every image the draws you in. It's what people do when beholding a work of pure genius.
0553296981|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful. I wasn't \\"forced\\" to read it as some readers here said. It's a timeless classic and I recommend it to everyone who wants to have a glimpse of the Holocaust.<br />I read some negative reviews and for christ's sake, she was only 13! You can't expect her to be a Pulitzer-winner kind of writer. I think she was pretty smart for a girl in the 40s, in  the dawn of her puberty and also during such a hard time as the Holocaust and WWII. You can't compare teenagers today with teenagers in the 40s, that's plain stupid.<br />Try to put yourself on her shoes: imagine to be hiding from the Germans with the constant fear of being caught. She never left the Annex for 2 years, what do you expected her to do besides writing? I would probably do the same. She never thought her diary would become a book someday. Everything there is based on her thoughts and feelings. If you want something more serious, get some history textbook and read the boring and dull stuff you can read anywhere else.<br />I'm 21 years-old now and I read this book when I was 14 and I understand her urge to write her feelings on a diary. Most girls need this kind of comfort and to let our feelings out on paper. During late childhood till I was 18 I wrote everything I felt on a diary. Most girls did it and it's easier for us to understand why Anne started a diary.
B000068TPN|5.0|This realistic movie depicts the start of the Viet Nam war in human misery and bravery. As he did so well in THE PATRIOT, Mel Gibson performs marvelously as the American general (granted, he was no MacArthur, but who else was?) and gives an award-winning, heart-rending, authentic acting performance so sincere that his tears cause the moveiegoer to respond in kind.<BR>He may be from down under, but he makes a pretty good Southern gentleman turned soldier. There were a few funny incidents as when the women's group talk about going to the laundry in that small Georgia town.<BR>It breaks your heart when you see that yellow taxi's appearance; I almost had a heart attack when the general's wife looked out and saw it that last time.<BR>Don't miss this powerful movie; it will leave you with fulfillment and the knowledge we were denied when this event actually took place. More power to the Viet Nam vets!

B00004Z459|1.0|This is arguably the worst 'rock' cd that money can but.  The lyrics are shallow and meaninless and the guitar playing is awful.  They dont seem to have a bass player which is a must for any rock band.  Their singing is more pop than rock, which generally goes for the whole cd.  Stay away from  this cd.  Buy Wonder Whats Next by Chevelle.
B00005J4HH|4.0|I'm just gonna come out and say it:  This cd is OVER-ANALYZED.  While some of the lyrics are generally well-thought out, it's not a masterpiece in that sense by ANY means.  I mean, they do the job and on some of the songs, really are ingenious.  But to be continually compared to radiohead lyrically?  No sir, I think not.  So we hit the point of lyrics making or breaking an album.  Personally, I find good lyrics to be NOTHING without good music.  You could be telling me the most interesting thing ever, but a dull, monotone voice will put me right to sleep.  On the other side of the spectrum, you could be telling me pure non-sense, but a lively and energetic delivery will entertain me to no end.  Well, meet Muse.  Yes, the lyrics are lacking, but the music is fun and original.  I don't dare to call them a radiohead clone simply because they share a similar style and I hope you go into the &quot;battle&quot; giving them the benefit of the doubt.  Such mixed reviews, but honestly...such a great album.<br />4/5

B00006JL1Z|5.0|Having been a fan of Christine McVie since seeing Fleetwood Mac on the Bare Trees tour, I was really none too thrilled with all of the hoopla that surrounded the band when Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined the group in the late seventies. Being a progressive music snob at the time, I also could not relate to their lyrics either, so I almost turned a deaf ear to their music (the only reason that I had any later period Fleetwood Mac in my collection was to satisfy the tastes of several girlfriends). Now older, wiser, and more experienced in life, I picked up this jewel on a whim. The choice and order of songs are fantastic, and the remastering job is top notch. Comparing song titles with the original releases, this one is really all you need if you have no Fleetwood Mac at all in your collection. It has all of the songs from &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (with a better live version of I'm So Afraid) plus a superb choice of additional cuts. As for the original albums &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; and &quot;Rumours&quot;, this release renders getting those albums as somewhat useless, as only a few of the more obscure cuts on those two releases have been wisely omitted from this collection. From &quot;Tusk&quot; up until 2002, only the cream of the crop is included in this collection. The results of this collection make it sound almost like a brand new release instead of being a quarter of a century old. Now if only a collection could be compiled for either all of Christine McVie's songs or the transitional period leading up to the period represented by this collection (Bare Trees-Mystery To Me-Heroes Are Hard To Find). As for fans of the original bluesy Fleetwood Mac, this collection is probably not for you.
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere was my first Gaiman read.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching Richard Mayhew transform from somewhat of a slug in the early chapters, into a hero.  Gaiman's imagination is boundless.  The manner in which he described 'below London' was unique and written with abandon.  There were surprises around every corner.  His villains were truly vile, and his heroes were truly heroic.  Although some of the characters kept you guessing as to whose side they were on, ultimately this is a good-versus-evil story.  Previous reviewers have given you the gist of the story.  I'd just like to say I feel I've discovered a diamond in Gaiman.  He's now one of my favorite writers.  I'm reading STARDUST next.
B00006LPIV|4.0|got to see this Film recently&I didn't find it near as Strong overall as it was advertised as being.it had some twisted moments&elements going on but overall not that different from what I've seen in film over the past several years.enjoyed the music&overall chemistry.
0380804557|5.0|My second Neil Gaiman book did not disappoint.  Tristran Thorn goes on a quest to find a fallen star and, boy, is he in for an adventure!  Stardust is a fairy tale for adults.  That's already, undoubtedly, been said.  There is magic, treachery, pathos, witches galore, and all other manner of magical creatures great and small.  What I loved about the book was the prose.  It went down so smoothly that I read this book in a matter of hours.  Now, I'm geeked-up to read AMERICAN GODS.
B00005JLRT|1.0|'The Next Generation' was a fantastic television series, so I guess the only thing I want to know is why they cannot make a decent movie from it?<br />So far all the movies have just been attempts at writing episodes and stretching them to film length. This has failed repeatedly, though 'Generations' was worth watching simply for Malcolm McDowell's Soran and 'First Contact' managed to captivate because it introduced a new bad guy (to the films, that is) and showed us Trek history.<br />Having said that, 'Nemesis' ranks second to last in the TNG film series (with 'Insurrection' easily ranking last) because of its truly unimaginative story. Sci-fi clones. Star Wars, anyone? New focus alien to the films. Didn't we do that with the Borg in 'First Contact', the Ba'ku in 'Insurrection'? I'm all in favor of doing more than just Klingon-oriented films, but don't base a whole movie simply on some under-represented alien race making an appearance. Yet another sibling to Data? All I can say is that Soong must've been a Catholic, if you know what I mean.<br />However, as much as I disliked the movie, I felt it would've been a very good science-fiction movie had it not been 'Star Trek.' I expect a certain level of quality when I go see something bearing that title. Unfortunately, 'Trek' seems to be in a bit of a slump. The TNG movies, 'Voyager', and now 'Enterprise'? Are we ever going to be rewarded with another 'Trek' experience worth our time? We've watched for so long, why must they continue to disappoint? If you liked this movie, I'm glad. This was just my take on the most recent outing from the TNG cast.<br />Being a hypocrite, you will find this DVD in my collection when released. Being a film student and a long-time 'Trek' fan, I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I didn't own all the movies.
B00006HBUA|2.0|Given the stars involved, the hilarity of the old cartoons, and the big budget, Scooby Doo should have been a sure fire hit.  Unfortunately, it was just another example of filmmakers trying to buy quality with special effects.  <br />The acting was the first disappointing factor about this dreadful mess of a movie.  Teenybopper king Freddie Prinze Jr. plays Fred with over-the-top cockiness, and for some reason decided to make the character appear to be gay!  Sarah Michelle Gellar was slightly better, but not by much.  Her Daphne has a bad case of \\"valley girl\\" syndrome, and like Prinze, Gellar overacts, which is completely unlike her.  Linda Cardelinni as Velma was a decent decision.  Though she didn't contribute much, she didn't ham it up like the rest of the cast.  The only instance where these over the top screwball antics were completely acceptable was in Matthew Lillard's Shaggy.  Lillard must have watched the old cartoons for months, because his Shaggy is dead on, and he interacts with the CGI Scooby just as the cartoon did thirty years ago.<br />The plot is too ludicrous for words.  In short, the four get into a big scuffle in the beginning of the film, and they go their separate ways.  Well, of course they end up having to get back together to solve one last mystery a few months later.  They set off to a tropical island with a creepy amusement park where college coeds are being turned into zombies.  The normal hijinx occur, and its up to our heros to save the day. <br />The biggest problem with this film wasn't the acting, or the ridiculous plot.  It was the fact that the movie couldn't decided who it wanted to cater to.  There were some absolutely hilarious moments of innuendo dealing with the urban legends that surround the cartoon, but these moments were few and far between.  For instance, there is a scene in which the mystery machine is shown with smoke billowing out the windows, while Shaggy and Scooby are heard laughing hysterically, addressing the rumor that the quartet was constantly stoned.  A few seconds later, we just see that the two are barbequing inside the van.  Humorous moments like this one are a rarity, as we have to sit through low brow farting humor most of the time.  The filmmakers should have decided in the beginning whether they were going to target older audiences, or go for a new generation of Scooby fans.  The constant jumping back and forth is quite annoying.<br />The lone highlights of this wretched film are Lillard's performance as Shaggy, and the Outkast song \\"Land of a Million Drums\\", which is featured on the soundtrack.  <br />If you were a die hard fan of the cartoons, this may interest you.  For those who were just casual viewers, it was certainly nothing special.  The only ones guarenteed to love it are kids between the ages of 5 and 12.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this one if at all possible.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Rated 3.9<br />I didn't like them all. Sometimes Cornell seems to be singing to an entirely different song, it doesn't sync for me. I can't make myself care about the lyrics and so the songs feel dull at times but this is great rock. For some reason, it reminds me of Monster Magnet... (?)
B00005JLO2|3.0|As everyone has mentioned, this movie is about a young man, branded a coward by those closest to him, who sets out on a near-suicidal mission to redeem himself in the eyes of his friends, family, and most importantly: himself. The acting in this film was superb, as were the landscapes of the desert. And the whole concept of the movie is great--one man's struggle with his own inner strength.  <br />The problem with this film, as I see it, is that it's too drawn out.  Most of it drags, and the really interesting parts (like the battle sequences) are much too brief.  Sometimes the story sweeps so fast you feel like you're being left in the dust, and other times it seems like the plot is stagnant.  Had the script been a little better, this would have been an excellent movie--the concept is great, the acting is good, and even the directing was exceptional.<br />This movie is worth seeing, for sure.  It will be an entertaining couple of hours, but I don't know that this one will stand up to repeated viewings.  Still, Four Feathers is worth a try.
B00005JKZT|3.0|The nine members of The Fellowship of the Ring were torn into 3 groups in the first installment of the LOTR. The Two Towers picks up mid stride and follows as each group moves inexorably toward their destinies in this classic struggle of good and evil. Tolkien gave us the war we wish we were fighting and Peter Jackson lets us struggle with a foe whose face we can see, an enemy we can recognize on sight. The battles of the Two Towers are fought, for the most part, on open battlefields; far removed from innocent civilians. The Two Towers also echoes America's view of itself as a reluctant warrior. None of these characters wants be be involved in the battle to free the world from the clutches of evil by destroying the One Ring. But, as Sam says, some things are just worth fighting for. Be sure to have seen the first movie to fully understand the second; for the only recap is that of Gandalf the Gray falling to flame and shadow in a dream that Frodo has in the opening minutes. <br />Once again the grandeur of the New Zealand countryside provides a breath taking setting and the genius of the computer generated portions of the action blend seamlessly with the stuff of real life. Readers of the Trilogy will recall that The Two Towers was the most action filled of the three books when they sit thru this 3 hour movie in what seems like an hour and a half. If there was any portion of the movie that didn't exceed my expectations, it would be the sound track. Although Howard Shore did a wonderful job once again; there were times I wanted more from the music. I wanted strings or ethereal choral voices to sanction the tears that were welling in my eyes when Gimli and Legolas learn that Aragorn had fallen. In the midnight showing, an actual CHEER went up from the crowd when Gandalf the White returned to give hope once more to the trio seeking Merry and Pipin. Smeagol aka Gollum, added a dimension to the movie that was greater than his role in the book; it was brilliant acting by Andy Serkis in a mode that at times seemed impossible, that made it all so real. <BR>In post 9/11 America, this movie affirms that there are absolutes in both worlds and that the forces of good, although tempted to use the tools of evil, must 'stay true'(as Aragorn puts it) to themselves and to their knowledge of good, in order to prevail. What is more, movies like The Two Towers help to show us who we want to be rather than who we are. And as Sam says, this movie reminds us that there are still things worth fighting for. Amen
6305754969|5.0|Director Howard Hawks turned out some great westerns, but this has to be the best (in my opinion).  Teaming up once again with John Wayne, El Dorado is a great film with an engaging storyline and a cast of characters that you can't help but like.  First of all, there's the Duke, playing Cole Thornton, a gunslinger for hire who finds himself mixed up in a water dispute.  Also starring is Robert Mitchum, a drunken sheriff who's an excellent gunslinger--when he's sober enough to hold a gun.  But the one who steals the show, in my opinion, is James Caan, aka Mississippi.<br />Caan plays a young man who can't shoot straight but is great with a knife.  To compensate for this, Cole buys him a sawed-off shotgun, and hilarity ensues every time he pulls the trigger--  everything from shooting the wrong guy to wounding his friends to missing his target altogether.  In fact, this is one of the great things about this movie--it's funny.<br />This is a great Western, one of the best in my opinion.  The story is intriguing, and the characters have a great chemistry.  If you want an good old-fashioned bang-em-up Western which is good for a lot of laughs as well, try El Dorado.  You won't be disappointed.

B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow's albums have always been good.  With each title released it seems the music gets better and better.  After the release of \\"The Globe Sessions\\", the seeming pinnacle of her career, an album nominated for \\"Album of the Year\\" at the Grammys, one could not possibly imagine how to follow that up.  Along comes \\"C'mon C'mon\\".  Starting the album off with the blazing \\"Steve McQueen\\" and the infectious \\"Soak Up the Sun\\", the album hooks listeners into a soundtrack for the perfect road trip through America.  From the grinding hook of \\"You're an Original\\", and the blistering guitars of \\"Lucky Kid\\", Sheryl Crow proves she can still rock with the best of 'em after 40.  On the lighter side, the touching \\"Safe and Sound\\", the tender ballad \\"It's So Easy\\", and the hook infested title track further heralds Sheryl's reputation as one of the most prolific singer-songwriters of rock-n-roll.  All in all, Crow rocks!!!!!!!
B00006RIO7|4.0|I absolutely loved the movie, the music, and the dancing it was first rate!   The day after I saw the movie I went online and wanted to buy the soundtrack! But, I , like everyones else who has written a review, was highly disappointed when I heard a 'new' rendition of Cell Block Tango/He had it Coming!! This was the reason I didn't buy this soundtrack but bought the original Broadway cast version and it is AMAZING!!! I am still blown away by the singing talents of Ms. Zeta-Jones, Ms Zellweger, and Mr. Gere, but I think the original is better!
0790738082|4.0|I must admit the first time I ever watched this version of the \\"Music Man\\", I wasn't exactly impressed. The music was great, the acting very good, but still something didn't seem right. After watching the version staring Matthew Broderick on ABC and loved it, I decided to give the original another try. I've come to the conclusion that the film's major flaw is its cinematography. The film never seems to break past being a Broadway show and most of the staging reflects that. Most of the action takes place just as it would on the stage with little creativity. Even with this flaw, the film is still a lot of fun. Robert Preston's Harold Hill, the traveling con man attempting to swindle the town of River City,  is a remarkable performance. Herminie Granger and Susan Luckey also put in great performances as Mrs. Shinn, the mayor's wife, and her daughter Zaneeta respectively. Shirley Jones also stars as Marian, the town librarian and music teacher that Hill falls in love with. While the character has so much potential, Jones seems to play her somewhat flat and is also limited by not being able to act and sing at the same time. All in all, though, it's a fun film and recommended to any musical fan.
B00005JLO2|4.0|This is an excellent movie.It has everything you could ask for.Love,mystery,action,friendship,great shots of the desert,and self-discovery.Don't forget the gorgeous Kate Hudson too.This is one of the best movies in the past six months.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Thats what you are if you pretend to enjoy this \\"film\\". A sheep. The media pretends that they are so sophisticated and \\"arty\\" and that anybody with any sense would just love this movie. Wrong. The only reason anyone would pretend to like it is because musicals are supposed to be \\"arty\\" and the media tells you it's good. How could you enjoy this? So boring, none of the actors can sing, and the plot and dancing are so [bad]. If you want to watch this just so you can pretend to love it and tell your friends about it, then just rent it. Don't actually buy the DVD, it's just totally jam-packed with a bunch of stuff that no self loving person would actually watch, or actually buy.
B00008BXJF|5.0|Disgruntled with modern music masquerading as rock 'n' roll? Tired of all of the cookie-cutter grunge bands that play with four chords and a prayer? Tired of volume being mistaken for cleverness? Pick up Power To Believe.<br />On the first listen, I thought &quot;ah yes, THIS is what rock used to be about!&quot; Excllent hooks, masterful percussion and an inescapable catchiness that makes you want to thrash about the room. I'll say up front that unlike many other reviewers here, I liked Crimson's last offer: Construktion of Light. The new album is in that league and beyond.<br />I don't miss Bruford one bit on this album. Mastelotto's electronic persussion work to me is more inspiring and more on the cutting edge than what I've heard from Bruford lately. Likewise, I don't even miss Tony Levin on bass. Trey Gunn is masterful on his Warr guitar, belting out extremely low-end bass that drives these energetic tracks forward.<br />Of course, it goes without saying that Fripp is a guitar genius who never fails to deliver. For a guy edging towards 60, he's teaching the whippersnappers the meaning of true rock musicianship. This is how it's done, kids. Take a lesson.<br />What's the only thing that I would have liked more of on this album? A little more space for Belew's lyrics and vocals. Not a tremendous amount of voice work on this one, but this is a minor point.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica is a little more tame this time around than their previous recordings, but still turn out a great metal album.  One of the best sellers ever.  Highly recommended.

6302424887|5.0|I remember this film,if you like to see heads getting cut off by a sword,a woman getting raped,and a man getting hit in the face with a 'chain mail' and seeing blood splatter all over the place,this is the movie to get.In my opinion,I have never seen a movie of a historical figure depicted in this unique fashion or point of view. This movie has a lot of gore scenes,if you have kids,you'll stay away from this movie.
6303482295|5.0|This video is one of the &quot;Super Cities&quot; series produced by the International Video Network, which consists of one-half hour tapes of 22 of the more interesting cities in the world. They are, far and away, the best travel videos that I have seen.<br />The approach that the producers take is to mix aerial and ground footage in roughly 50/50 proportions. This approach is especially effective for Budapest, which is actually two cities (Buda and Pest) divided by the Danube.<br />What comes across is what must be an exceptionally pleasant city to live in, especially in the summer, with numerous parks and outdoors cafes. While there are some interesting sights, however, they are limited in both number and quality. As a result, I took Budapest off my list of places to visit.<br />That, of course, is one of the things that a good travel video should do--provide you with enough information to make an intelligent decision as to whether or not to visit a place.<br />The Super Cities series also includes a tape on Istanbul, which is similar to Budapest (in mixing elements of East and West), but is a far more interesting city. That tape is also excellent, the only difference being that it will convince you that you want to visit Istanbul.
B00006CXXU|5.0|There was once a time where Christina Aguilera's music would be compared to that of Britney Spears, after hearing this album it is obvious that there is no competition, Christina is undoubtably the winner! \\"Stripped\\" is a somewhat masterpiece! It makes us wonder why she spent so long promoting a false image and releasing songs such as \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" and \\"What A Girl Wants\\". This album shines! It shows the real Christina; In each and every song you can somewhat relate! Lyricially amazing i think is the term! <BR>There are some truly brillant songs on this album!
B00005J4HH|4.0|Origin Of Symmetry shows just hard and how heavy a british band could be. Before Muse there was brit pop, yes i agree matt bellamy sounds like thom york, but nowadays, how many singers dont?? it varys from coldplay to ten-four.<BR> Being a guitarist, I've always been in awe of the technicality tht matt plays on the albums and this was no exception. I must recommend everyone to buy this album.
B000003CKH|5.0|This was probably the first album I have ever bought, I got it in 6th grade. Now, many years later it still remains amazing. It is Cakes best album. The music travels through many categories very well. And the lyrics are amazing. The songs themselvs appeal to the young and old, because they rock, are atmospheric, catchy and have deep meaning. Im not usually a fan of pop music and when I am its a guilty and temporary pleasure. This record takes pop music to the next level, making it origional, inspired and creative. There is not a single bad song on this and I have not met one person who didnt like this cd. Not one, ever. <br />The album also has a lot of other deeper stuff that I could go on and on about but ill let you discover that yourself.
B000089RVX|5.0|It's rock. It's melodic. It's captivating. Dark and emotional, Evanescence has the potential to become something huge. The originality in the song writing, singing, and lyrics is amazing and one of a kind. Evanescence is refreshing after listening too what has been on mainstream for too long. This is the type of music that is hard to ever get tired from. You may put it down for a while after overplaying it, but once you are reminded of them, you'll put it back on repeat. It's worth every penny, which is different that other bands.<br />I'd like the RIAA to realize that I and others wouldn't have fallen in love with this band and bought the cd if it wasn't for MP3's...
B000069AUI|5.0|How do I even begin to describe in words how wonderful this album is?  Brillant, beautiful, soulful...it is a masterpiece that showcases the true talent that is Coldplay.  From the magnificent ballads such as &quot;Green Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Scientist&quot; to the raging rock anthems of &quot;Politik&quot; and &quot;Daylight&quot;, how could anyone not fall in love with this album?  And if for some ungodly reason you're not impressed after the first few songs...just wait until &quot;Amsterdam&quot; comes on.
B00005U122|3.0|Brought this recently, while roger waters looks great (in shape, voice ) etc. I did'nt like the guitar playing. There is no way anyone can beat David Gilmour. It always looked like the guitarist were struggling to match upto David, just to produce the right sound. Maybe i have been listening to pulse a little to much, but no one can beat the fuild and smooth guitar playing David has, which was sorely missing here for Pink Floyd songs (which had lots of guitar playing). For Rogers own (From Amused to Death etc) i loved the way they were played out. Especially \\"Bravery of being out of Range\\". Also \\"mother\\" was awesome. His voice is still fantastic. But for the above mentioned points this dvd only gets 3 stars.
B000001EXR|5.0|Ok, first off -- whoever that knucklehead was who cited &quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot; as being among Kiss' weakest albums.....get your head out of your a**.<br />&quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; may be a bit heavier than the &quot;classic&quot; Kiss sound, and yes, it may sound somewhat calculated to fit in with the mid-90's sound, but SO WHAT?!?  Haven't Kiss been changing with the times since day one?  Didn't they explore disco?  Hair metal?  Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they fail.  The bottom line is, the people who criticize this album rarely mention the tunes themselves, only the style of the music.  This takes 1992's &quot;Revenge&quot; to the next level.  <br />While this album does not scale the heights of &quot;Destroyer&quot;, it ranks as the band's best effort since &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; in 1982....if not &quot;Love Gun&quot; in '77.  Catchy, melodic and (gasp!) CREATIVE tunes are abundant -- this stuff is more thought out and interesting than your average Kiss material.  I'm not saying I would love it if all of their stuff was like this -- the fact that Kiss' music is mindless and fun is one of its greatest strengths.  But this is a nice change up from the usual &quot;party&quot; songs. <br />Yes, you will find stuff that sounds vaguely reminicent of Soundgarden on here, but the songwriting also invokes the likes of The Beatles and Led Zeppelin on several tracks.  Plain and simple, it is Kiss' most grown up &amp; respectable efforts EVER.
1555175163|5.0|This is the first book I purchased off Amazon and read it in a day. While a thin book, it is an interesting read. The book talks about the life of the late, Great Grandmaster [Y]Ip Man, how he came to learn Ving Tsun Kung Fu, how he lived and what he was. While you could easily find a life story of him easily by a net search, this book shows more a philisophical response to his life and decisions he made, something that is not in other stories I've read on him.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I'm gonna keep this short & sweet. I've been a Metallica fan for a long time, but resisted buying this CD because I figured it would be so watered down - nothing like the chord thrashing, boot stomping, driving beat and growling vocals that I grew to love.<BR>Boy, was I ever wrong. A few weeks ago I just had to scratch that Metallica itch with something new, and the only place left to turn was the S&M CD, so I broke down and bought a copy and Oh My God, this is absolutely incredible stuff!!! Yeah, some of the numbers are better than others, but this really is a fantastic collection of Metallica tunes and the orchestra (in almost every case) really does blend in very well with the guys. It seemed to me that it took a tune or two before they were all comfortable, but then they just blew the roof off the place. After listening to the two CD set about five times, I bought the DVD too.<BR>So yeah, I highly recommend this CD - especially if you are like me and had no desire to hear the guys backed up by the symphony.

B00005JLSC|2.0|People may call this the movie of the year.<BR>BUT I wouldn't.<br />The music is big and rhythmic and powerful.<BR>BUT it does not swing like the 30s band sounds it builds on.<br />The dancing is flashy.<BR>BUT is it good?<br />The girls are everywhere and designed to stimulate.<BR>BUT Mary Louise Parker and Janel Moloney on \\"The West Wing\\" are sexier just standing there than the two stars and the chorus babes put together.<br />The acting is on a grand scale.<BR>BUT I somehow cared about none of the characters.<br />...<br />The cinematography and set design and colors are terrific.<BR>BUT ROAD TO PERDITION, QUIET AMERICAN, GOSFORD PARK did that better.<br />The movie is creativity incarnate.<BR>BUT at its core, empty.es as duo.
B000002MU3|4.0|Since R.E.M. started in the early 80's, they've built a very huge career from the diversity of their smalltown, Athens, Georgia. Nevertheless, this album would absolutely be a difficult one to make. On this album, R.E.M. had to go out on tour for, and not look back. It would be a tour, and a record they would never, ever forget.<br />The 1994 album, Monster went multi-platinum within a matter of a few months, and the music went back to the hard feel that R.E.M. was known for. The songs still blend in with hard rock, and a couple of power ballads on the side. The music still is as powerful, with What's The Frequency Kenneth?, Bang And Blame, and Strange Currencies. But, the record also had a much more understanding meaning behing it, as R.E.M. dedicated the record to River Phoneix, who died of a drug overdose in 1993.<br />Unfortunately, Monster would be the next-to-last album R.E.M. would perform with Bill Berry. His abrupt exit from the band would change R.E.M. into a trio, and change the feel of their music for good. If you're a true R.E.M. fan, I suggest you get this album.
B000002JS0|5.0|AC/DC HIGH VOLTAGE is one of the greatest first albums i have heard. Although most of the songs kind of sound the same I still enjoyed this album. I liked this better than BACK IN BLACK. I liked early AC/DC or the better put as &quot;the Bon Scott era&quot;. I like the addition of bagpipes on the first track. Live Wire is a good. My stuggestion is that if you want to get a AC/DC album start with this one first.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This CD is great. I love every song on Siamese Dream. It just has this perfect flow that gets you hooked on it. Songs like &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; and &quot;Geek USA&quot; make Siamese Dream a wonderful Smashing Pumpkins album. I definently recommend this CD to anyone interested in rock music. The lyrics and vocals by Billy Corgan are amazing and the music backing them is awesome. Siamese Dream is well worth a listen.
B00004XPP0|5.0|STAR WARS in general is a great story. On the other hand there are only 3 good Star Wars movies [so far I haven't seen Episode III yet]. I was dissapointed at Episodes I and II cause there are movies but they are not cause I'd say 80 percent movie is computer animated or CGI.  The Original Trilogy is timeless classics, in other words they don't make movies like that anymore. I don't mind the VHS but I wish they would release these and the original version on DVD cause VHS is a old format[but yet it is a classic format] and STAR WARS trilogy is a DVD worthy movie.
B000002U9E|5.0|A number of years ago, I heard a person describing what she was going to do for the weekend, \\"...going home, kick off my shoes, open a bottle of good wine and get into some Kate Bush.\\"<br />I had no idea who Kate Bush was but my curiosity got the best of me.<br />Wine is so much better now...
6305428425|5.0|Romy and Michele make such engaging and wonderful couple, they carry the movie very smoothly to the end. They are almost genious. The plot is simple, the characters are stereotypical and the events are somewhat perdictable. So what? They don't make the movie any worse but even better. You don't need complicated storyline and supernatural heroes to make a good movie. Romy and Michele's straight-forward characters not only entertain the audience but give us deeper lessons and feelings, too. You don't have to be ashamed of who you are but be yourself and face your problems no matter how others may judge you. Their courage gets rewarded and there are emotional instances when they realize that there are other important things in life than career and money. You get the sense of life that it is not worth living if you are not going to have fun anyway.
B00004Z459|4.0|I have since forgotten how long ago I bought this cd, but when I first bought it, it was constantly in my cd player. Now it manages to sneak in every now and then, only because I've sort of outgrown the feeling the cd gives off. However, at the time, I felt I could relate to a lot of the lyrics and the feelings the songs gave off.<br />Because I'm not all that great with words, I'll just be blunt and give you a review of the cd song by song.<br />Track 1 - Papercut: I think this song has a good beginning (I think the beginning of the first song on a cd is incredibly important - it builds you up and lets you know what you're in for with the rest of the cd), and the lyrics are so-so. Final rating? I'd say 2 1/2 stars.<br />Track 2 - One Step Closer: This was a favorite of mine, until it got massive airplay and you heard it on every radio station and every time you turned on MTV. Still, before it got played out, it was a great song. Final rating: 1 1/2 (only because it's played out and I'm sick of hearing it).<br />Track 3 - With You: One of the songs I really related to, and still do (I thought it explained my feelings towards my ex quite well). I honestly have nothing to say about it (and if I did, I'd probably start rambling about my ex, and I'm sure you'd much rather hear about the cd than my ex :P ). Final rating: 3 stars<br />Track 4 - Points of Authority: Ahh, this brings back memories of driving around with my good friend and her trying to imitate the wierd way Mike Shinoda says \\"forfit\\". (She still hasn't gotten it, by the way.) I honestly have nothing to say about this song. It's not one of my favorite tracks, it's not one I dislike. Final rating: 3 stars<br />Track 5 - Crawling: Ugh, if I hear this song or see the video one more time, I will march down to MTV myself and hurt someone. This song had massive amounts of my respect until they released it. Now I'm so sick of it. It's a disappointment that they released it - it used to be my song, now it's everyoneelse's song. My advice? Listen to it once and then skip over it from then on. Final rating: 2 stars<br />Track 6 - Runaway: I absolutely love this song. The beginning and the way it builds you up is awesome. And the lyrics are awesome... For some reason this song always brings me back to times I had forgotten, times when I was in fact running away from whatever was haunting me. And it always reminds me of night time for some reason... Final rating: 4 1/2 stars<br />Track 7 - By Myself: Another song I can still relate to. The lyrics are great, not just the chorus but all the verses. Final rating: 4 stars<br />Track 8 - In The End: Again, as with One Step Closer and Crawling, I used to have respect for this song before it got released. However, it hasn't gotten as much airplay, so it's not that annoying as of yet. However, don't expect that to last long. Final rating: 2 1/2 stars<br />Track 9 - A Place For My Head: This is my favorite track on the cd. The beginning...can't explain it, but it's awesome. And the sort of fast way he sings sounds cool. Lyrics are awesome. The chorus is even better. Used to blast this when I'd get mad at my parents. Good for getting out aggression. Final rating: 5 stars (I'd give it more if I could!)<br />Track 10 - Forgotten: Nice to hear a song that starts with lyrics instead of music. Lots of aggression and gets you revved up. Takes a while for the chorus to come up, but it's worth it.<br />Track 11 - Cure For The Itch: A good song, but I usually fast forward about 54 seconds (where the mood slows down and the piano comes in). It's cool to chill to, but doesn't lose any feeling. It's sort of an intermission, if you will, so you can relax for a minute. Final rating: 4 1/2 stars<br />Track 12 - Pushing Me Away: All in all, a good song...not one of my favorites, but whatever. Final rating: 3 stars<br />All in all, this is a good cd worth owning if you have the extra bucks around to buy it. If not, find a friend with a cd burner, hehe. :P
B00001OH7T|5.0|If you are like me and you grew up on this guy you have to admit that from a white guy visiting america in the 70,s this is the best picture postcard of a cocainefilledinfusion of sixties seventies disco you are ever going to find a complete masterpiece of fusion of music melody and soul in a rare departure for Bowie you get some of the funkiest rythm and gospel fused with searing guitar and vocal prowess.......a classic album neglected and overlooked maybee its time has come!!!!!!A classic!!!!!!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|This is one of those albums that you can listen to over and over again and it will always make you feel warm and good about yourself.  Whenever I listen to it, it gives me this warm feeling letting me know that music can STILL influence my life to the point where I base most of my life off of it.  An absolute GREAT album.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I won't go into a track-by-track review.  (C'mon, guys -- does anyone really read the page-long CD reviews posted here???)<br />This is a fabulous CD.  It's too dark merely to call &quot;mellow,&quot; but far too engaging to call &quot;depressing.&quot;  Though I haven't had it long enough to be sure, I think it's going to replace Mutations as my favorite Beck CD.<br />Listen for the Beatle-esque touches.
0930289528|2.0|The idea of a masked terrorist fighting back against a totalitarian government is a interesting story, but the characters in THIS story are weak at best! Some of the dialogue is hokey and the artwork is muddled...
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is one of the best CDs that I have listened to in quite a while.  Amy's lyrics and the harmony that she records herself is a nice touch.  Also, the CD is rather deep - some thinking is required and interperetation as well, which is what music is - your own interperetation.  The only thing that is dissapointing is the number of songs - just eleven for this album.  I honestly can't wait for another album, these people are awesome.

0679879269|3.0|I can't recall another trilogy in which I so enjoyed the first two volumes (see my earlier reviews) and was so thoroughly disappointed in the finale. Lyra (now called Silvertongue) and Will Parry are back in Lyra's world this time, gearing up for the final battle between Good and Evil, trying to reach Lord Asriel, who commands the forces of humankind against the malevolence of God. Lyra was kidnapped by her mother at the end of Book 2 and has now been stashed in the Himalayas, and Will has to rescue her. He just happens to meet up with the migrating armored bears, who promise to help. Will's long lost father also has a key role -- there's no such thing as a chance encounter in this universe -- and so is Dr. Mary Malone from our own world. So far, so good. But by the halfway point in the narrative, we're involved with angels who have very human characteristics and whom I found totally unbelievable as what they are supposed to be, and the pace has slowed to a frustrating crawl. Frankly, I couldn't finish the book, which was very upsetting after all the time I invested in the story and the pleasure I drew from it until now.
B000089RVX|5.0|Very few CDs inspire me to buy them as soon as possible, but Fallen is one of those few.  Unlike most modern bands, Evanescene does not merely give lip service to melodies between pseudo rap vocals, they let the musical themes of their songs set a somber mood that is complimented incredibly by a very talented Amy Lee.  There is not a bad song on the album and I would buy it twice if it got this band into the forefront of the industry.  Buy this CD if you like the samples because it will not dissapoint!  What are you waiting for....buy it!  NOW!
B00006JJ1O|1.0|Music continues to go further down the drain to Hades. T.A.T.U is another fine example of great marketing but no substance whatsoever underneath the slick, marketing appearance. First of all, WTH were they thinking of covering The Smiths' classic \\"How Soon is Now?\\"? Have the girls in T.A.T.U even heard of The Smiths? Whoever thought it would be a swell as to pass off two underage girls as lesbians singing chirpy pop songs is a 'genius' to come up with that ploy to sell records. If anything, the person responsible for T.A.T.U's image needs a swift kick in the arse for giving lesbians a bad name. \\"All the Things She Said\\" is an awful song. I would take Kidneythieves' \\"Before I'm Dead\\" over this duo and I'm no fan of Kidneythieves either but at least that band has a singer who can actually sing and music that doesn't make me nauseous.
0871137380|4.0|Mark Bowden deserves lots of praise for writing this book because if he hadn't, this would be another untold chapter of American heroism.  Never mind the objectives of the American government or the means they used to find Aidid, these Delta and Ranger soldiers risked their lives for America.<br />Bowden jumps from the situation of one soldier to another constantly while never leaving the big picture throughout the story.  Reading this book was like watching an action movie - the intensity really came across.<br />I would have liked to learn more from Bowden about the question of U.S.'s presence in Somalia, but that belongs in another book discussing their international role.
B00006RINF|5.0|This album almost exceeds words.  I was rather anxious to hear this album.  I knew it would be good, but I wasn't sure if it would live up to Unleased Memories.  After the first track began, I knew I was in for a ride.  This band finds the perfect balance of beauty and darkness, and also melody and heaviness.  Christina's vocals are amazing, like there was any question.  They are beautiful as always! And it seems the male vocals are incredible as well! Andrea's vocals just seem to get better. If not in Lacuna Coil I believe he could front a band on his own very well. This album is not one to be missed!
B000002TQV|5.0|For those who long for an album that you can put on, listen to, and enjoy every song...this is an album for you, but be forewarned, once you put it in your CD player..you may never want to take it out..<br /><br />There are very few albums that I can say have struck a chord in my heart like this one.  The album has swirling guitars, catchy hooks, and a great amount of depth from songs which blast you off with a burst of energy like \\"The Bends\\" to melodic and haunting songs which evoke memories like \\"High and Dry\\" and my personal favorite \\"Black Star.\\"<br /><br />If I could choose three words to descibe this album I would submit:  Passion, Exploration, and Remorse.<br /><br />I could not give an album a higher rating.  In fact, while others may disagree and argue that the musicianship of OK Computer and other later efforts by this band far outreaches this album, to them I offer the emotions and connections one experiences when plugging this album into your CD player and letting go.<br /><br />One listen and you are hooked.  The album somehow releases an energy and sensitivity which is unmatched by any other band or album I have heard.  There simply is not a bad song on the album and the only way to truly experience the depth of the songs and the reaches of this album is to listen at least once all the way through.<br /><br />Some of the songs like \\"Street Spirit\\" and \\"My Iron Lung\\" have such beauty and contradiction in their styles.  \\"My Iron Lung\\" takes you on a journey through several types of music but still maintains a common feeling, and I think the song \\"Street Spirit\\" ends the album on a softer, floating back down to earth feeling that seems to perfectly end the voyage of this album.<br /><br />You have been warned.  If you don't know this album and like bands like Coldplay...you ought to find out where they obtained a major influence and you will see why this album which was originally released in 1995 is still one of my top 5 albums of all time.bums of all time.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|Who are T.A.T.U? Two teenage lesbian singers from Russia and of course, the latest pop sensation all over the world. <BR>   Through the 12 tracks of their English debut they mix elements from pop and dance with  infrequent strength. Their sound is quite different to everything else out there, and I must admit that some songs are amazing. Still, there's a big problem...is this an lp or ep?...let's count the tracks...there are 12 at first sight...but...they are only 8 really. Because it contains the Russian version to \\"Not gonna get us\\" and \\"All the things she said\\", then there is an extended version of \\" Show me love\\" ( which is totally unnecessary) plus the remix of \\"30 minutes\\" which is weak.<BR>   On their first single, the powerful and sexy \\"All the things she said\\" they sing about what it feels like loving someone of your same sex. In this song in particular their voices sound sweet in the verses and hard in the chorus, which gives the track a split sound which is really interesting.<BR>   While most of the lyrics are about love, often they hold a twist just to say how hard it is going through their situation because they are in a position which many people do not accept.<BR>   Julia and Lena sing in a way which is not very common, they have girl voices which sound angelically at times and strident at others. They can handle the vocals pretty well, though their songs may be difficult to sing to an average person.<BR>   Other standout moments are \\"Show me love\\" which goes in a similar way to \\"All the things she said\\" ( the best the disc has to offer), and \\"30 minutes\\" which sees T.A.T.U. all calmed down with a pretty little background music.<BR>   The album includes  an enhanced section which features the video to \\"All the things she said\\" and behind the scenes with Lena and Julia.<BR>   T.A.T.U. with their unique sound will be the next big thing, though they will have to find better  ( and more!) songs since nothing on the album is half as good as their first single.
0792840461|2.0|I bought this DVD ... because I'm a long-time admirer of Steve McQueen and had never seen this particular film.<br />And I was disappointed. It might be the worst Steve McQueen movie I've ever seen.<br />To begin with, McQueen should not be playing a wealthy businessman. It doesn't suit him.<br />Secondly, director Norman Jewison's use of split-screen tecniques is overdone by a factor of 10. At times there doesn't even seem to be a point to it.<br />Thirdly, the soundtrack music is loud and intrusive, as if the director wants it to be another character. (\\"Also staring Michel Legrand as the soundtrack.\\")<br />One reviewer remarked that the chess scene between McQueen and Dunaway is erotic. Soporific is more like it. If any part of that scene drew my attention it was the design of the chess pieces. As for the interplay between the actors... that's when I shut the movie off and went to bed.<br />The premise of a man who had dangerous hobbies to keep him interested in life is a good one. I've done similar things myself. But it was poorly done in this movie. And Steve McQueen was wrong for that role.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie has touched so many lives and has taught people to appreciate life a little bit more. There was not one bad thing in this movie and i for one am really picky with movies. I guarentee you that you'll love this film!
B00006CXXU|4.0|I don't know if this a fair review of Christina's cd (i haven't listened to ALL of the songs)..but from what I've heard this is what I have to say.  Outstanding.  Everything so far I've heard on this album is incredible. <br />Can't Hold Us Down- Definitely one of my faves.  One of the best chick songs of the year, and with a truely (...) message.  It has a great beat, and Lil Kim makes the song even that much better.  A definite must listen.<br />Walk Away- This song recently has become one of my favorites.  It displays Christina's beautiful range.<br />Fighter- Great message, and pretty good song after a couple listens.  Doesn't hook you from the beginning but overall is a great song.<br />Infatuation- Love this song.  The most poppy you'll get on this cd, and I'm definitely lovin' the latin beat.  It's a very cute song.<br />Loving Me For Me- If you're in love, you have to listen to this one.  The lyrics to this one will draw you in, but the melody you have to get used to..but you gotta check it out.<br />Impossible- A great song with a r&b twang to it.  Sounds like an Alicia Keys song (probably b/c she wrote it), but a very good song.  It can tend to get old fast though.<br />Underappreciated- Poppy and fast.  I like this song a lot too.  It's one of my recent faves..but didn't hook me from the beginning.  It's cute.<br />Beautiful-  Beautiful is beautiful..but it's sad that this song is way too overplayed on the radio and such..but an awesome song.<br />Make Over, Cruz, and Soar, I have not yet listened to.<br />Get Mine, Get Yours- GREATT song.  Very veryyy sexy..and kind of goes along with \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\".  Definietly shows how two can play that game.<br />Dirrty-  Great party song!  Can get old compared to the other great songs on this album, but still good.<br />And I have yet to listen to A Voice Within, I'm Ok, and Singing My Song.  <br />Overall..this is a great cd.  A must have, and lyrically and vocally wonderful.  Very much worth your 16 bucks.s,digs deeply into her past. \\"I'm Ok,\\" undisputedly the most emotional song on the album, reminisces about tougher times and her abusive father. Much of the song Aguilera recorded lying on her back, and it can be heard that Aguilera is holding back tears while singing. The lyrics are powerful, and are sure to bring about Christina-sympathizers. For example, the words, \\"It's not so easy to forget, all the marks you left along her neck/When I was thrown against cold stairs/ And everyday afraid to come home in fear of what I might see, next...\\" are some of such seriousness that are nowhere to be found previous works. <BR> One of the highlights of the album is what seems to be Aguilera's indirect payback at superstar rapper Eminem, who has been known to shoot out low blows at Aguilera. In \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" the up-beat second track of \\"Stripped,\\" Aguilera says, \\"So he does what every little boy would do/ Making up a few false rumors or two/ That for sure is not a man to me, slanderin' names for popularity/ It's sad you only get your fame through controversy...\\" She even goes on to say, \\"You must talk so big to make up for smaller things,\\" which leaves to the imagination what \\"things\\" she is talking about. However, Aguilera shows good taste in not mentioning Eminem's name and keeping the payback subtle. This song is one of the catchiest on the CD, as song centers around a woman's image, as well as featuring female rapper Lil' Kim. In the song, Aguilera also gripes about men being praised for sexual successes, while women are deemed \\"whores\\" in similar behavior. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" is sure to be a hit if it is released as a single. <BR> Throughout the album, Aguilera belts out lyrics about her image, one that has gone downhill since she has come out of her shell. Lately Aguilera has been three-fourths naked in public, and her raunchy video, \\"Dirrty\\" has brought around negative talk about her change for the worse, as well as her appearance on the cover of Rolling Stone,which showed Aguilera wearing nothing but black boots and a guitar. If anything, this sort of publicity will probably hurt album sales. The caliber of music on \\"Stripped\\" has proved that her gimmicky provocative style is unnecessary. <BR> The bottom line is, don't let this dramatic change in her image keep you from listening to this album. Or at least downloading a couple of the songs. This is just another example that some girls are truly meant to be heard, but not seen.
B000056HE9|3.0|Cary Grant is an angel.  David Niven is the bishop.  Loretta Young is the Bishop's Wife.  See a love triangle starting to form yet?  This is a Samuel Goldwyn film that is as enchanting and fulfilling as anything to ever come from Hollywood.  The bishop is being pressured to build a cathedral by a society matron (Gladys Cooper - who even in her late thirties was always playing somebody's widow or mother) and has no time for his wife.  Dudley (Grant) is an angel, the answer to the bishop's prayer that turns out to be his greatest obstacle when he takes a sudden interest in Julia (Young). <BR>Previously released by HBO Home Video, this MGM edition appears to be the same disappointing transfer as before.  Gray scale and contrast and black levels are weak.  Digital compression artifacts crop up now and then and edge enhancement and aliasing problems make for a real frustrating viewing experience.  The sound has been matrixed by CHACE INC. into a sudo-stereo mix.  The original mono is also included for the film purist.  Both are strident and lacking in tonal quality and bass.  There's a theatrical trailer included but nothing that will set the world on fire or enhance your love of this holiday classic.  I suppose the one saving grace of the film is the film itself - with Grant, Young and Niven at the helm, the first time viewer is guaranteed an enchantingly good time.
B00005221M|1.0|Any current release of Last of the Mohicans on dvd is completely different from the original movie. This director's cut version has lost everything that made the movie great. I'm hoping the studio will release the real version on dvd sometime soon. Until then, everyone will have to settle for watching the original version on vhs.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Audrey Hepburn won her Best Actress Academy Award the first time out in director, William Wyler's &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;.  The plot concerns itself with a princess, tired of her royal duties, who decides to play hooky from the palace for one day and winds up falling for a handsome American newspaper journalist. Gregory Peck co-stars.<BR>Paramount Home Video has painstakingly restored &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; to its original luster.  From the opening credits to the final, heart-breaking fade out, this is a magical DVD viewing experience.  Contrast, gray scale, and clarity are superb.  A few minor instances of pixelization (and I mean extremely minor) do not distract from this beautiful presentation.  The soundtrack is mono but digitally remastered for a fresh, crisp sound and remarkably low background hiss. Extras include a a couple of documentaries, one on the film, another on resident fashion designer, Edith Head.  Also trailers and a stills gallery.  An &quot;A-1&quot; treatment for a first class fantasy that continues to charm us from beginning to end!  GET IT TODAY!
B00006C79E|1.0|For some reason, I rarely see a bad review of a Saint Etienne CD.  No other band, in my opinion recieves such positive press from both fans, and critics alike.  I expected Finisterre to be the album that would change the opinions of many who held previous Saint Etienne records in high regard.  Alas, this is  not the case, and I'm a bit suprised. <br />Finisterre has some great songs on it, but none of them manage to capture the spirit, atmosphere and emotion of previous efforts.  Take for example Saint Etienne classics such as 'Mario's Cafe' and 'Your in a Bad Way'; both have an almost undefinable emotional quality about them.  They are songs that bring out moods and melodies that made us fans of the group in the first place. <br />Let us not also forget the classic 'Good Humor'.  Quite possibly the bands best effort to date.  All the tracks on that disc have that special Saint Etienne signature sound that stirs the imagination and the soul each and every time you listen to it. <br />But Finisterre, evokes no such emotion.  To me, the album is trying to hard to re-create New Wave 80's pop with a modern twist.  Some tracks manage quite well in this effort, but at what cost?  In an effort to create a more experimental sound, I believe the band have sacraficed the elements of their music that set them in a class of their own.  <br />Where are the lush strings on Finisterre?  The playful flutes?  What about the beautiful piano melodies?  Where is the nostalgia of the 1970's?  To me, these are some of the elements that make up the soul of Saint Etienne, and Finisterre simply does not have it.
0517122707|5.0|In fact, this novel is so good it is now one of my most favorites, even though my first impression of the book was that trying it was a mistake.<br />I had recently been disappointed by another novel, Catch-22.  A Confederacy of Dunces had the same light, comical tone as Catch-22, but the subject of it, Ignatius P. Reilly, was a character more grotesque (it seemed to me) than any of the numerous annoying characters in Catch-22.  I was expecting the worst.<br />However, as I read on, I gradually and unconsciously began to really enjoy the story.  The novel quickly developed an interesting main plot, along with many interesting subplots.  I met many characters, and found myself very interested in them and  in what would happen to them.  The writing style was excellent, and there were some sections where the writing was awesome (such as the section where we first meet Dr. Talc).  The novel was also very funny.<br />The best part of this novel was the ending, where all the little subplots fall together into a great conclusion.  I think it's one of the best endings ever.  (I've seen some reviewers call this a canned Hollywood ending.  It isn't, any more than the ending of, say, The Tempest was.  The ending was well supported by the story.)<br />In addition to being a highly engaging book with a great ending, there was a kind of indescribable unity to it, that was very delightful.  I guess the best way I can put it is that all the characters shared a common &quot;dunceness&quot; that made them all somehow related to each other.<br />Basically, I think this was just a great novel.
B00008BXJF|5.0|First off, while The Construkction of Light album was not their best and the live three disc Heavy Construkction showed some promise it wasn't until King Crimson released the crushing EP Level 5 that we got a good idea of this iterration of KC coming together. Then another teaser of sorts, the Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With EP gave us a closer studio based glimpse of the current direction of King Crimson and finally, The Power To Believe.<br />TPTB is the most cohesive and varied work in the entire King Crimson catalog. If you are a fan and are willing to be open minded you will hear it. The choice of vocoder on The Power To Believe 1: A Cappella is a clue things are different. From this almost sci-fi intro we are slammed with Level Five, a heaping slab of molten metal. This is not your average prog metal band or any metal band. This is a skilled unit of artists that had time to craft and work on a direction to play and you get to be introduced to this new direction. Level Five sums up King Crimson. It is precise, dense polyrhthmic metal that any competent player could learn to play but not compose. The riffs are massive the lead guitar work stunning. We are listening to a statement from the elder statesmen of three decades of music. They certainly don't seem ready to hand over the throne.<br />Eyes Wide Open brings the tension down to the kind of quiet song you wish more people would play. It is devoid of showmanship and pomp, it is a beautifully arranged song that could (but won't) get airplay. Imagine Sting when he still had fire in him with a better backup band and you have a good idea. <br />Elektrik starts in a ambient mode evolving into King Crimson's 'nuevo' metal and setting up Facts of Life, another view of contemporary sound that is still based in fundemental - classic songwriting. When 2003's artists sound ages in 10 years King Crimson will still sound fresh. Almost all of their material ages well and that holds true on TPTB.<br />The title track returns in a new form, an evolution that features guitar synths and eventually a big sound. It's hard to classify King Crimson and near impossible on this CD.<br />Dangerous Curves is as good a description for the song as any. The playing is stunning. Every musician is part of the mesh which was not so on The Construkction of Light CD. Behind the creative writing, arrangment and performance is a band that knows one another, has that groove that 80's KC had and the ability to drop on a dime like the mid 70's KC did.<br />This was evident on the last studio CD but this time out it's not the Fripp and Belew show. Every track here is in it's place for a reason and written with care, craft and conviction. Often King Crimson can be a cold sounding band. Even if they thrill or impress they do not always move us. The tone of every vocal track here is sincere. Even Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With has a playful, lightly sarcastic look that sure sounds like a little snipe at critics of Belew's lyrics.<br />The Power to Believe III is yet another soundscape at first, one that builds and releases tension in a classic art rock way ending with the Coda.<br />You don't listen to The Power To Believe, you absorb it, or more likely it absorbs you. The sounds are varied in a way that King Crimson hasn't done - period. The drums are vastly better sounding. I work with a drummer who has V-Drums. They do not have to sound like drum machines. And the drums don't except where warranted on the album. The use of several types of ambiences, from spacy textures to industrial noise mixed with the highly structured arppegiations and counter rhythms are a big turn for King Crimson. They have looked at the modern world and after dabbling a bit taken a sizeable leap while remaining true to their musical values.<br />The Power To Believe will be considered one of King Crimson's defining moments and one of their best, I think. Any band that can play achingly beautiful music (Eyes Wide Open) and wack you with uber-metal frenzy (Level Five) deserves some slack when listening. I can imagine luddite fans stuck at the 80's band. Well, for those who have been waiting for the album that moves to the next level, here it is. The 90's and prevous 00's music was very good but these songs are great and are the most cohesive in theme and continuity. <br />Here is the one critical issue. Fripp seems to be fixated with arppegiations and specific pitchs. As a result some might initially find some of this material to be similar to older material. But it seems to me this is the most democratic version of King Crimson. The thing that elevates TPTB are the ensemble segments and incredibly tasteful drumming and tap guitar. In fact, the use of the Warr guitar enables KC to have three guitarists or one guitar synth and complementary dual guitars. Trey Gunn is greatly underappreciated. If you can grab the Deja Vroom DVD or watch the 40 minute video on disc 2 of the Heavy Construkction CD you'll see how important Gunn is and how annoying those drums could sound. The use of (I'm guessing) traditional and electronic drums is a much better choice and results in some tasty playing and Pat getting a chance to be part of the ambience which is common to electronic artists but almost antithical to a band as overwhelmingly intense as King Crimson can be.<br />Buy the CD, if you don't like it give it a chance it's really a great work, one I've been waiting for as a fan some 20+ years.

B00005MAM2|1.0|I am amazed at the popularity of a movie that is so shallow and simplistic.  This movie puts to shame the Manga which is one of the greatest triumphs of.  The vague plot and exagerated seemingly disconnected series of violent scenes may pull some viewers in-but for those looking for more will be sorely disapointed by this movies aversion to plot and character development.  What so many people seem to label as \\"mysterious\\" and \\"thought provoking\\" is the simple fact that the movie itself was a poor execution of an epic story.  A very similiar failure to \\"Ghost in the Shell\\".  The people who have read the manga of either tend to view the movies as being inferior as they represent the creativity of the Manga very poorly...If mindless violence with vague references to what one could possibly interpret as plot and character development is your thing-than Akira Movie is for you.  If you want more then that, you will be disapointed with the movie by itself and should read the Manga.  As the movie is intended to accompany the Manga otherwise it doesn't make any sense.
0679746048|5.0|Susanna is a great writer and obviously has an unusual story to tell. Since the circumstances of the story are so interesting, as a writer all Susanna needs to do is &quot;get out of the way&quot; and I think she does this well. She has a terse writing style which I find appealing. Her character descriptions are first rate, and I think she has a subtle but keen sense of humor. She and Kay Jamison (&quot;An Unquiet Mind&quot;) have written the finest mental illness memoirs available.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.
B000055Y0X|5.0|There isn't a whole lot I can say about Dr. Strangelove.  It was a movie that was released far before my day and whose message was more powerful for my parents generation than for mine.  Despite that generation divide, this movie contains an important message beneath the comedy and the message that is becoming increasingly relevant in these turbulent times.  Peter Sellers steals the movie...what a tragedy his untimely death was.
0060930187|5.0|This book is a classic by any standard or categorization, and certainly stands out in the genre of mental illness narratives.  It is probably one of the most vivid and articulate descriptions of mental illness ever written.  Not surprisingly, I also found it disturbing and somewhat frightening.  Plath is such a skilled and fluid writer that the book almost demands that you read it many times.  Highly recommended.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.
B00005QFF1|5.0|One of the most popular exports that comes out of China is  movies these days.Zhang Yimou is among the most respected, not only in China but in the rest of the orient. Road home won an important award in prestigious Berlin film festival.(how couldnt they vote ?) Movie starts with a young Chinese man returning his village in order to attend his father's ( teacher of the village)<BR>funeral. His mother asks him to bring his father on shoulders as in old traditions. Boy is confused at first but picture starts to become clearer as he learns the legendary love between his mother and father. His father a young and idealistic teacher comes to village to open a school. Mother, a sweet villager girl is atrracted to him from the first sight. Soon teacher becomes aware of her and a beautiful as well as an innocent love starts between them,refusing to crumble against all odds.<BR>Yimou shot the present time sequences in black and white,portraying cold winter and loss of a loved one better. However majority of the movie is shot in color. He bnrings loads of emotions and reality with his color choices. <BR>His portrayal of rural china is excellent. Summer and winter shots are beautifully executed and we witness a simple but joyful life out of the towns. Villagers' social life and values are all presented lightly in sequences like when villagers force teacher to leave heavy work for them or refuse to eat beside him because he is a town gentleman. Being a teacher and a doctor in rural areas in the east is still a very prestigious social status .A young Zhang Zi Yi performs brilliantly and the rest of the act is also superb.Her portrayal of the young and innocent villager girl is unforgettable. In this movie Zhang keeps everything pure and simple. Since it is a simple story and what else one could do to paint it with the camera? Vital point is to bring out the emotions which Zhang does it in an excellent way. Viewers emotions will dramatically change as film continues and you are advised to have some tissues ready with you for  some seqences. Film has many remarkable moments, like Zi yi's food preparation for the teacher and final bit when people attend the funeral and carry the coffin etc.<BR>This movie is a remarkable example of the spirit of the cinema and Yimou tells a story which is well written, well acted and superbly directed. A rain of emotions will wash you, and you will think that without blood,sex and worthless word salad as well as none sense rules such as dogma, a great movie can be done.In comparison to his remarkable past work,(in my personal opinion) so far Yimou really made his best movie with this one.<BR>In the world of cinema, sun is shining from the east these days. So do not miss its rays of wisdom and warmth.
B000002HGD|5.0|Moby, the underground techno icon, put his strongest effort is to everything is Wrong. Hymn starts you with a hint of ambient, almost eclastic beauty. Feeling So Real grabs you after the second or third listen. Moby really  streches musically here. Its an odd piece that really grows on you. What Love &  <BR>First Cool Hive brings us to the forefront of the depth of expresion this man is capable of. He took chances that no other artist of his time would take. With Everything is Wrong, he was finalizing the techno bible so-to-speak. We end with Into the Blue- a fantastic piece that leaves you hanging in his grooves. In 1995, Moby was awesome but most folks did not see it. Then the off beat strang attempt with Animal Rights, which even now distance himself from. If you REALLY want to know Moby, this record is a must! Beautiful spin!
B000077VT7|1.0|Terrible, terrible, terrible...<br />I would give this one NO stars but that's not an option.<br />Did anyone involved with this movie read the book?!!!<br />About the only parts that had anything to do with the book written by Robert Ludlum was the first fifteen minutes of the movie, the name of the lead character, and the name Treadstone 71.  The rest came from some...script writer's head.<br />Gone are the intricate plot twists and surprises that make a Robert Ludlum novel so much fun and difficult to put down.  They've taken the title of a great book and made it into a (hopefully) forgettable movie that will have the Author turning in his grave.  I cannot believe how horrible this movie was made...
B000R8YC1I|5.0|In another time and place, a thousand years ago in the age of wonder a sacred universal source called \\"The Dark Crystal\\" has been cracked as a single shard was missing. Two new races of beings were created such as the cold-hearted and evil Skeckis whom are reptilian-bird monsters who rule the castle of the crystal where they use the crystal as their treasure and the gentle Mystics whom live far off in a place away from the castle for peace. The Skeckis have ruled for a thousand years as now a great conjunction will come when the three suns will line up for they shall rule forever, of course there is a prophecy that says that a Gelfling (Elf-like being) would save the world! Jen the Gelfling goes on a important quest to find the shard with the help of a sorceress named Aughra and joins up with a couple of more friends on a mission to heal the crystal or else the world will end.<br /><br />Brilliant and outstanding fantasy epic from Jim Henson and Frank Oz is definitely their masterpiece! It's an inspiring motion picture that has moved me since i was a kid. Five years in the making for this remarkable fantasy treasure to be made and Henson succeeded, he has created a movie unlike no one has ever made before by not using a single human being to appear on screen to make an alien world come to life. The film was a labor of love using organic material, realistic puppets, animatronics, and a crew of jewelery and woodmakers. The movie uses realistic puppets and animatronics as the cast whom are as realistic as you and me with spectacular settings and a thought provoking story to go with it, dark atmosphere and the brilliant music score by Trevor Jones is one of the most criminally underrated and greatest movie scores around.<br /><br />This DVD has excellent picture and sound quality that is perfect all the way and the extras are terrific like audio commentary from Brian Froud whom designed the world for the film including the creatures, deleted scenes, alternate workprint scenes, a new featurette, \\"The World of the Dark Crystal\\" documentary, and character illustration gallery.featurette, \\"The World of the Dark Crystal\\" documentary, and character illustration gallery.
0399224459|5.0|I'm not sure my 22-month-old actually gets the humor in the gorilla taking the keys out of the zookeepers pocket, but she loves the story on whatever level she's understanding it.  She loves zoo animals so it's fun to think of them doing something other than standing around in the zoo staring back at us.  I highly recommend this book: great illustrations, clever (and few) words and a great little story line.  I expect my daughter to come to understand and appreciate this book on many levels.
B0000019HU|5.0|When I first heard this album it floored me I had never heard anything quite like it before. The songs usually start out with beautiful acoustic guitars and gradually swerve off into jagged electric riffs but it's not as formulaic as it sounds it should be. The only letdown is that it consits of only six songs, but I promise you they will be six songs that will stay with you for awhile.<br />1.Breadcrumb Trail- Amazing, very interesting acoustic riffs and a great slow heavy chorus. Very humorus lyrics as well.It's hard for me to pick a favorite song on this album, but this would probably be a great choice. 5/5<br />2.Nosferatu Man- Begins with a great acoustic power chord progression with an amazingly dissonent electric guitar melody. Ends with an electric guitar riff-off. Probably the most acessable song on the album, but great nonetheless. 5/5<br />3.Don Amen- A very dark song with a very eerie acoustic line. Lyrics are hard to hear at times though because they are wispered. 5/5<br />4.Washer- A very sad song does a lot of things to you emotionaly. 5/5<br />5...For Dinner- The only skipper on the album, it's not horrible just too long for an instrument that does so little. 3/5<br />6.Good Morning Captain- I can't really put my finger on what I love about this song, but I do. The lyrics tell a very interesting story. 5/5
B000089RVX|4.0|This album successfully finds that intangible balance between lush beauty and primal heaviness. Typical of the record is the first single, Bring Me to Life, a piano ballad-turned-riff-driven barnburner. Highlighted by a guest vocal from Paul McCoy of 12 Stones, the song is featured prominently in the Daredevil film and soundtrack.  This track really lets their uniqueness shine and is quite catchy but in a non-pop way.  It seems that they are truly writing and playing by the heart and not by the book.<BR>Amy Lee's sweet yet strong vocals intermingle brilliantly with the bands eerie hard rock sound.  They are very talented and the album is able to amplify that aspect by showing their ability to switch genres in a matter of seconds and not destroy the over all experience of the CD.<BR>In each and every song, there are so many things happening and if feels as though everyone in the band is doing something completely different but yet the parts fit together like a puzzle.<BR>As you are listening to the album you may begin to feel like their sound and style is getting a bit repetitious and you feel like your hearing the same song again but then they whack you with something completely different and drag you deeper into their album.  The overall CD possesses a lot of feeling and each song has a certain theme and mood.  In the songs, they use the instrumentation to really get their point a cross.  Throughout the album you will hear anything from metal sounding guitars and a double bass to a soft piano, choir or even an orchestra.  When acting you are always advised to, \\"show, don't tell\\" when on this CD it should be described instead as \\"hear, don't tell\\". Fallen will definitely keep you attentive and wanting to know what's going to come next.
0783240287|2.0|This is a fun staging of a fun show. Certainly not deep, thought-provoking theater, but a fun little show nonetheless. However, I must echo the sentiments of those reviewers who said the sound on this DVD leaves much to be desired. The sound level on the vocals is extremely inconsistent, with some soloists being nearly inaudible. In fact, the sound on this disc is so poor I must grudgingly encourage buyers to opt instead for the VHS version, which doesn't have this problem.
0375703764|5.0|Because Danielewski has melded a horror story onto a romance, filtered it through an explication of aesthetics, and plunked it all in a box of mathematical impossibility. In a sense, he's going after the world. One footnote, for example, stretches on for page after page, merely listing names of architects from the past several hundred years. The author has simultaneously cemented his story in the real world and thrown the entirety of the world onto the reader, in a sense daring you to try to absorb and comprehend everything. &quot;House of Leaves&quot; reminds you how much you don't know -- which just adds to the horror that Danielewski wants you to feel.<BR>To tell his story, Danielewski uses a number of typefaces to identify different authors and a variety of typesetting effects (a là e. e. cummings, Ronald Sukenick, et al.) to place you more deeply within the story. He has footnotes all over the place, multiple appendices, collages, two-color text (yes, the title of the book is indeed [pretend &quot;House&quot; is colored blue] &quot;House of Leaves&quot;), even an index, for crying out loud. If you feel the need to see which pages the words &quot;hair&quot; or &quot;melon&quot; appear on, you'll be set.<BR>I know, I know, the book probably sounds like a grab bag of gimmicks, a post-modern stew of pretense that's all style over substance. Don't feel that way. Do yourself a favor and buy, beg, or borrow this book, this &quot;House of Leaves&quot; that took 10 years to build. Don't flip through it, though; force yourself to start at the beginning and hand the reins over to Danielewski. He knows what he's doing.<br />(Also read Chuck Palahniuik books, if you read him instead of House of Leaves, at least your getting closer to hitting bottom [the only place to be].)
1580084621|5.0|After cooking about the fifth dish from this book (&quot;Stir Fried Beef with Spices&quot;) with palate-boggling success , I would like to recommend this book to anybody serious about Thai cooking. While there are no shortcuts (consistent with the author's view to keep things as original as possible) the result is well worth the effort. Some things sound more complicated than they are. Furthermore, this is the first Thai cookbook out of the five or six I have got which explains in detail some really important techniques (like the cracking of coconut cream and why this is important for frying curry pastes). The background chapters are highly recommended.<br />My two open questions are why the Gaeng Panaeng is far from &quot;dry&quot; (with about five cups of coconut milk/cream) and why there is no recipe for Yam Wun Sen (a favourite of my Thai girlfriend, and I thought it was a classic dish). But these are minor points and maybe there is a good reason (I would be curious to learn).<br />All in all: Highly recommended, together with &quot;Vatch&quot; Bhumichitr's books (whose writing style and inside country knowledge I also like very much) my favourite cookbook.
B00000JPHD|5.0|For those modern audiences who have seen Dracula only in the many versions following Bela Lugosi's original interpretation back in 1931, they have been conditioned to focus more on what the Count does than on why he does it.  These reincarnations of the celluloid vampire are rife with hammy acting, multiple vampires, and the quick shock cinematography.  To see the first DRACULA is a lesson on how to scare an audience more with mood than with gory special effects.  Director Tod Browning plucked Bela Lugosi from the stage to reprise Lugosi's role based on the Bram Stoker novel.  Lon Chaney was the original choice, but his unexpected death opened the door for the Hungarian born Lugosi, whose rich accent layered his scenes with an ever present undertow of menace.      The lack of a musical score for nearly all the film requires the audience to focus on the dark sets that begin in the count's castle in Transylvania, then later on the ship that brings him to England, and finally culminates on the dreary streets of a London that emphasized a formless horror.  DRACULA is a film of memorable lines as well.  When Renfield (Dwight Frye) tells the count that he fears the howling of the wolves, Lugosi intones, 'Ah, the children of the night.  What music they make.' Shortly afterwards, Lugosi turns down a glass of sherry with, 'I never drink (pause) wine.'  Such lines as these today could only be played in a campy context, but coming from Lugosi's lips, they resonate with the chilling menace that director Browning clearly intended.  Lugosi was capably backed up by Dwight Frye, who invested his role as Dracula's mad assistant with a maniacal weirdness that lingers even after seven decades.  Helen Chandler as Mina comes across as a victim who seems fascinated by the count even as she clearly recognizes his evil. It is her inner tug that pulls her first one way than another that involves the audience in deciding just where does victimhood ends and willingness begins.  As I watched Mina's matamorphosis from victim to violator, I was reminded on a similar change that Patty Hearst went through fifty years later as a kidnap victim of the Symbionese Liberation Army. The truly outstanding films have the capacity to yank you out of your seat, place you into the action on the screen, and force you to recognize that what you see from the safety of your chair could also happen either to you or to someone else you know.  DRACULA is one such great film.
6304595247|5.0|I found it very interesting that all of the reviews from the UK were SO long winded and negative. Yet the 1998 version of the film with virtual unknowns are praised by these same UK reviewers--could this be the UK remake?! I loved this movie!  I shared it with my then 14 year old daughter.  I think she could connect with always beautiful Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes.  She had been reading Jane Eyre in her English class and immediately picked up Wuthering Heights.  Who says TV can't lead to book reading?!
B00003CX9E|5.0|Every time this movie is rerun on Television, I stop the remote and see it over again to pick out some of the incredible and innovative visuals and details Wells made.  The bedroom tantrum scene was years ahead of it time.  This is the greatest movie ever made!!
B000089RVX|4.0|European bands such as Lacuna Coil have been playing this sort of music for a while now, it's just recently that America has begun to accept it.<br />The music is very well done, but it's far from original.  Check out Lacuna Coil to see who started it all...
B00005JLF5|5.0|The DVD comes with a cool menu setup, and there is a slight improvement in film quality since its now on DVD. Definitely worth the money.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Daredevil.  Another famous Marvel Comics character, now brought to life on the big screen.  Many saw this as a \\"cash-in\\" on the SpiderMan fame.  Before you judge this movie, I would like to make a few points.<br />1) Stan Lee appears in a cameo.  Some saw this as a .... of SpiderMan, but keep in mind (for those of you that don't know about the comics at all) that HE IS THE CREATOR OF MARVEL.  This was probably his decision anyway.<br />2) Yes, Daredevil is blind but with enhanced abilities as the result of the accident.  This is where people get put off and think it's stupid; I really thought that this was a unique idea.  Even if I wasn't a fan of the comics I would still be intrigued.<br />Was this a good movie?  I really thought it was.  Sure, the screenplay could've used a bit more tightening, but the film was helmed exceptionally well by Mark Steven Johnson.  The film is dark and brooding, almost like Tim Burton's Batman.  The cast was good, with special notability to Michael Duncan as the Kingpin.<br />I was especially surprised at how close it is to the comic.  Sure, there were some differences (like Ben Urich reporting for New York Post, whereas in the comics it's the Daily Bugle---connecting to SpiderMan) but they were good all the same.<br />Overall, I was very impressed.  When you watch it, keep an open mind and judge it by its own terms.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|There new sound is great.  There a couple songs in russian which is very awsome.
B0000057C5|5.0|I was never really an industrial music fan but I was turned to this great band by hearing one of their songs which happened to be off their 1st album. I immediately thought these guys were fantastic. I only judged that by their music, nothing else. Then I came to know that it's Rammstein. From there on, I became huge fan until today. \\"Sehnsuht\\" has to be their best in my opinion. If you think otherwise, it's because the samples...and you have to get the cd to experience the killer sound of Rammstein. By the way, it's a shame that such a great band like them virtually get no airplay in the U.S nowadays! Yes, sure they made some stir with 'du hast\\". After that , they virtually got no exposure. Yet there's countless of worthless, talentless ...out there which isn't worth a penny yet is played daily on Mtv and radio. That just tells you how this country is screwed up.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This album is off da hook, big style. The mel-o-dies are as tight as glass. Interpol are the only band to watch out for in the future, no jokes! Some guy said to me that they were bate, and i just said to him no bredrin they are heavy. The lyrics aren't all that but just listen to the atmosphere. This is my favorite jillen album. Five Stars- absolutly marvelous. Word.
0451092163|4.0|I think after reading all the 5 star reviews of this book, my expectations may have been a little high.  <br />The story was very interesting, and as usual with King, the characters were very well written.  I thought that the story dragged a little in the middle after they got to the hotel, but before the snow really started to fall.  But once the story got going, it was pretty fast-paced up to the explosive ending.<br />There are many King books that I liked better than this one, but this is a good story with good characters and is definitely worth reading.
B0000648WZ|4.0|The reasoning behind some of the details:<br />Everyone in the movie seems American because, if current societal trends are projected into the future, there's a good chance that American English will be the world's universal language. Spanish last names predominate because they represent America's fastest-growing ethnic group.<br />The characters are all good-looking, because people probably will be in the future. If our ancestors saw us, they'd think we were good-looking, since we've had the benefits of modern dentistry and orthodontistry, nutrition, sanitation and hygene. If our civilization lasts, these trends will continue, with the additions of genetic enhancement and cosmetic surgery (already prevelant among the rich).<br />Finally, the gung-ho propaganda is SATIRICAL. And the gruesome effect of turning Melrose Place into Platoon is INTENTIONAL.<br />The movie's projections of current trends are all plausible (but the interactive news-Net and uber-medicine are the only things people seem to \\"get\\"). They're all relevant, too, because they comment on what our real values are today, and where they're leading us.<br />This is a good movie. It's a shame that, when a smart director creates a convincing future world, so few people seem to get it. But when James Cameron and Stephen Spielberg create utterly stupid, paper-thin visions of the future, audiences find them acceptable. No wonder movies are so bad these days.
0316666343|5.0|This book is so many things packed into one: lovely, thought-provoking, anger-stirring, frustrating, funny, sad, melancholy, hopeful, helpless, silly, deep and so on.<br />It shoots for greatness, and in my opinion, it falls short.  But only a little short.  The subject matter seems like it would be repellant.  Who wants to read about a raped and murdered 14 year old girl who watches her family go through the incredibly painful grieving process that transforms them all?  There's a nice read for the beach, huh?!?<br />But, Susie Salmon, our narrator, is seldom actually bitter about her death.  She is in heaven (more on that later) and can move through the lives of anyone she wants to, even into their thoughts, at will.  She is always with the living, and she has such love for them that the horrendous grief her family goes through it filtered through this gauze of her love, and thus is made bearable for the reader.  This doesn't mean the book it easy to read...quite the contrary.  There are moments so shattering and immediate that you KNOW you're reading the truth.  You think to  yourself, \\"yep, that's perfectly believable, and I can even see myself doing it.\\"  For example, at one point, Susie tells us how she and her father spent many hours together working on making ships in bottles, something only the two of them ever took interest in in the Salmon family.  But soon after Susie's murder, her father goes to his study and destroys all the ships in a fit of anguish.  The scene is shattering, because we can imagine the depth of the man's torture that would drive him to such an act.<br />What's great about the book is not how grief is depicted in the immediate aftermath of Susie's disappearance, but how that grief continues, and mutates and transforms over time.  Over years.  So many people are affected in ways that they probably can't even trace back to Susie's death, but Susie shows us how.  How her sister ended up with her husband, because shortly after Susie's death, this boy gave her her first kiss to help her with her grief, and that moment bound them together from that point forward.  And this wouldn't have happened without Susie's death.<br />I hope you get the point.  The book is deep at times, yet is sometimes dangerously sentimental and mushy.  And near the end, there's \\"miraculous\\" event (no, nothing so amazing as Susie being resurrected...don't get carried away) which is beautiful on one hand, and on the other hand feels like a bit of a cheat.  The book has struggled so hard to be \\"realistic,\\" (even though we're clearly dealing with the otherworldly, since our narrator is speaking to us from heaven) that this segment skews the book's hard earned credibility.<br />And the descriptions of what heaven is like are a bit iffy.  Sometimes it kind of makes sense, and sometimes I feel the author is just skirting the issue of giving us a more fleshed out idea of her vision of heaven.  In some ways, Susie is so engrossed with earth, she doesn't take the time to really learn about heaven, but even so, I wanted a bit more coherence to those brief segments.  (Although there is a nice moment when her dog joins her.)<br />My criticisms are fairly minor.  In my mind, this book is the best piece of literature dealing with the relationships between the dead and the living since OUR TOWN, and that's saying alot.  There may have been loftier works (C.S. Lewis' THE GREAT DIVORCE comes to mind) but few works are so utterly engrossing and moving.  Once you're two sentences into this book, it's tough to put down.  I read it in near record time for me.  I'm glad I got on the bandwagon for this well-deserved best seller.
0780627024|4.0|It all begins when David is at school in the real world. He very much likes  \\"Pleasantville\\" a TV show about a perfect world. He really is only trying to escape from the reality of his life. One day he and his sister Jen get an opportunity to change when they transport themselves to Pleasantville.<BR> In Pleasantville  (at the beginning) David seems happy and Jen unhappy. After some days that they have been in Pleasantville it all begin to change little by little, and the most unusual change of all are the colors that began to appear and the weather changes.<BR> Not all the people react well to all this changes; the black and white people began to treat badly the people with colors.<BR> After having many troubles with the black and white people David makes them all see the truth about the color of people. Suddenly after that Pleasantville got all colored.<BR> Back home in the real world David learned at last to be happy with what he has and that there is no perfect world but you can make it look like if it were a perfect one.<BR> I liked this movie because it makes you think about how would be a perfect world and what would happen if there were not music or books to read.
B000083C49|5.0|Great features.  The commentary with Nimoy and Shatner is very entertaining, a few too many pauses creep in (especially towards the end), but still a lot of fun.  I really got a kick out of the lengthy original interviews.  Overall, a ton of supplemental material to check out and all of it worthwhile.<br />The not so great news:  Paramount should've put more effort into getting the movie to look as good as possible.  There had to have been a more pristine print to transfer.  As it is, the picture quality is acceptable, but probably the least impressive in the Special Edition series so far.  The dirt speckles can get a bit annoying, and darker interior scenes look a bit murky.
0066214122|5.0|Very good book.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is into computer science.  It gets a bit technical, and knowing what hes talking about makes the book all the more fun to read.
6305922756|5.0|[...]Spinal Tap makes true fun out of the often mundane documentaries that seem to be all over the place now. The fact that some don't get the idea that it's fake all but adds to the amazing job of the director and actors in the improv-heavy film. It certainly gave the push Chris Guest needed to make other great mockumentaries like \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" or his recent \\"Best in Show.\\" I highly suggest that anyone who has seen either of the previously mentioned films check out \\"This is Spinal Tap.\\" It will give you a better view of how the pacing of dialogue, editing, and refusing to turn the camera \\"off\\" can create brilliant comedy. The DVD is packed with loads of extra features, and visual/sound quality does show improvement, but to clean it up too much would take away from the style of the film. It's meant to not sound JUST right (or look it for that matter). If you just feel that you can't make the jump yet to this film, start with Best in Show then work your way back to the more obscure. You'll thank everyone who has written reviews here later.
B00003CXDD|4.0|If your kids are fans of Tolkein and C.S. Lewis as much as mine, they will love this movie. While a little corny at times, and with cpecial effects that don't match up to 2003 standards, the story is engaging and keeps things moving, and its ideal for kids from 5-12 years old. Of course, I enjoy it, as well. But then I'm a sci-fi/fantasy geek.
B000000OAN|5.0|I loved all of these songs. As the Title of the album suggest, close your eyes and visualize yourself at the Opera. Each song is it's own story. You've got Drama, Whimsy, Love lost, Love gained and Action. It's just a Great Album!
B000001GX8|5.0|Karl Böhm had quite an interesting range of specialities, that included among its main objects Wagner, Strauss and Mozart.  While no one needed to convince me of his greatness regarding the former two, I admit that I was somewhat sceptical about his Mozart, especially after having read the previous reviews.  Some people seem to believe that he over-dramatises the opera, and misses the comedy and the joy.  I couldn't disagree more: listening to this recording is an exercise in pure fun, and Böhm never comes even close to boring me.  That being said, it is true that he takes the opera seriously, if that means it does not end up as a farce, and the singers don't sound like a pack of buffi: but that's a plus where I come from!  Joyous comedy need not mean ridicule.<br />I'm not a fan of Fischer-Dieskau when it comes to &quot;heavy&quot; German opera, but here he is more than adequate: I have no problem imagining him as a frustrated &quot;courreur de jupon&quot; of an aristocrat.  I simply do not understand those who complain about his acting. Janowitz for her part not only has the most beautiful voice, she has also been blessed with quite a fair bit of acting genius and musical intelligence, which are evident here.  She and Fidi make quite a pair.<br />Troyanos had a gorgeous dark voice (one that I can actually imagine coming from a young man, granting a certain feminine quality), and her singing here is frankly wonderful, containing a beautiful touch of heartbreaking poetic sadness.  Mathis is a refined, deliciously young sounding Susanna, for whom I have nothing but good things to say.  Hermann Prey is an excellent Figaro as well, mixing candour, ingenuity and anger.    <br />The supporting cast is good, but not particularly memorable (save perhaps for Wohlfahrt, but then again, I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or not).   <br />The remastering for the &quot;The Originals&quot; series is excellent, with relatively few imperfections.  Note also that there areno cuts; if you don't like the usually omitted material from Act IV, stop complaining and just skip it.  <br />Most highly recommended!
0064407667|1.0|I read this book thinking it would be like the wonderful Joan Aiken novels I read as an 11 year old (The Wolves of Willoughby Chase, etc.).  It wasn't.  As a children's librarian, I had seen the growing interest in the series and wanted to be able to endorse it, but I certainly cannot do so.  This series is being pitched to Harry Potter readers, but it lacks the adventure and the aesthetic and moral appeal of J.K. Rowling's books. The creepy freak-show characters and situations were nauseating. The scene where a baby girl tied in ropes is imprisoned in a cage with her mouth taped shut while the cages dangles high above the ground is not the sort of thing I would promote for 10 year olds to read. While the children do manage to overcome their situation, it seems almost by accident.  In the Harry Potter books (and Aiken's fine books), the characters have some character.  They reach heroic stature because they possess compassion, intelligence, bravery, loyalty, moral principles, etc.  Snicket's Baudelaire children are decent kids, but are pathetically powerless and lack the personal qualities that might make them heroic.  The overarching mood is ghoulish and disturbing.  All the adults are presented in a negative way.  The parents \\"abandoned\\" the children via their bizarre death and inadequate plans for their future care.  The executor is a fool who cannot see the writing on the wall.  His wife is pre-occupied and uninterested.  All the adults are either ineffectual or downright sinister.  I feel that the books are frightening to all but very jaded kids because the Baudelaires are such victims and there are no decent adults to aid them.  What a sad commentary.  Harry Potter and gang are nobody's fools.  The adults in the Potter books are a believable and even-handed mix of good and not-so-good.  Rowling, and other great children's authors present children with role models who are winners, not by accident, but because of their integrity.  They present (at least a few!)adults who guide, help and love children.  Snicket's adults ignore or attempt to exploit the children. The Snicket books are awful.
1563898586|4.0|Honestly, not Moore's best work. Remember however that Moore's best work is considered alongside the best in the industry...<br />I'm not disappointed with LXG, but I wouldn't want someone to buy this Graphic Novel on hype alone. The one thing it reminded me of was one of DC's &quot;elseworld&quot; comics or a Marvel &quot;What If?&quot; comics. The idea of a Victorian League of Heroes based on fictional characters of that time period is in itself fascinating. And each character has their own personality, history and agenda.<br />The one thing that did bug me was O'Neill's artwork. I'm normally very open to artistic stylings in comics, but not this time. It was what seemed to be a &quot;never draw anything twice&quot; style with graffiti aesthetics thrown in. Oh well.<br />Still, a good story and an excellent concept.

1563894696|4.0|I would agree that Jeph Loeb falls a little short of Miller and Moore, but this graphic novel is still worth the money. The first thing you'll notice when you pick up this Graphic Novel is that it's BIG! 368 pages big, an entire years worth of comics, 13 issues BIG. Since &quot;The Long Hallowe'en&quot; is about the same price as a regular Graphic Novel, it's already a perceived value.<br />The story itself was quite good. It should keep you flipping the pages. The artwork and color (imo) could have been better, but since this was a part of the regular comic run and monthly deadlines are what they are, it's quite understandable.<br />All in all, a nice extrapolation of Miller's &quot;Year One&quot; stories with an organized-crime spin. A classic? No. Worth the price? Definitely. No regrets here.
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|How can you refuse a CD with a track entitled \\"Marion Barfs?\\"<br />Those who have seen and are familiar with the film will find the music a powerful reminder of the anguish of the film. People say that many tracks sound exactly alike, but their subtle differences and the nature of the scenes they accompany in the film provide very different listening experiences. For example, the SUMMER OVERTURE and LUX AETERNA sound similar, but their slight teaks in orchestration and the drasticly different atmosphere at the film in that point in time make the experiences very different.<BR>Brilliant, sad, anguished, and haunting, this music has the same inpact of the film, which isnt what most people consider their cup of tea
B00004Z459|5.0|All right, this CD is the best one I've ever listened to.  It has the best blend of sounds and greatest songs on it that I've ever heard! Here are my reviews for each song:<BR>1. PAPERCUT- Definitely a great start to the CD.  I love it and keep listening to it constintly. 4/5 stars<BR>2. ONE STEP CLOSER- This is a wicked nice song!  It gets your pulse up, and for all you metal-lovers, there is plenty of rockish riffs and screaming in this one! 5/5 stars<BR>3. WITH YOU- One of the best on the disc...5/5 stars<BR>4. POINTS OF AUTHORITY- This is my second favorite song on the CD.  It's an upbeat tune with a mix of rap and rock. 5/5 stars<BR>5. CRAWLING- A great song for those who hate themselves...JUST KIDDING...this is a great song and is a definite joy to listen to. 4/5<BR>6. RUNAWAY- this is probably the lowest point of LP's CD.  It's a great song, but their are some parts to it that aren't too great. 3/5<BR>7. BY MYSELF- I LOVE THIS SONG!  It's theme can relate to much people out there and is an overall awesome song! 5/5<BR>8. IN THE END- This is a great song.  It's just a little overplayed.  The radio can do that.  They can really jack-up a song by playing it too much.  4/5<BR>9. A PLACE FOR MY HEAD- this is my 3rd favorite song on the CD.  It's great...5/5<BR>10. FORGOTTEN- THIS SONG ROCKS! I loved it from the first time I've heard it and I still can't get enough of it! 5/5<BR>11. CURE FOR THE ITCH-  HOLY ...! WHAT A GREAT BLEND OF MUSICAL AND DJing TALENT!!!  It has no words to sing along to, but the music fills you up when you play it loud and takes you to a whole different world. 5/5<BR>12. PUSHING ME AWAY- THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD! it's a hot, hot, hot, hot song with a catchy tune and great lyrics.  It was definitely a great ending to the CD and leaves me feeling like I'm glad I took the time to listen to the CD after I've listened to the entire disc.  I LOVE IT! 20/5!!!<br />Overall, I'd say that this CD rocks and everyone should go buy it!
B000060OFT|4.0|I found the quality of this DVD so good that although I'm not a big lover of the film, I enjoyed the results immensely. The problem with the film is rather echoed by Luhrmann himself in the extras when he asserts that Shakespeare would have no problem putting &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; on the Titanic. Boy, Luhrmann is off his rocker there.  As he is by messing with the ending of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; by having Juliet wake too soon. I mean, why??? Did he think young folks aren't smart enough to see the tragedy in having things unwind the way Shakespeare wrote them? (And it blows the great line by Juliet about Romeo's lips still being warm.) I guess he felt he had to &quot;up&quot; the tragedy, which was nonsense. Nonetheless, the freedom of translation also has its good points,  and that is: this is a truly creative endeavor. And for that, my hat is off to the director. Hopefully, it has gotten kids to read the actual play, which exists in its own wondrous realm of genius. Final Note: for anyone interested in extras about how films get made, this DVD offers fine material.
0920668364|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter last night.  As I read it, I cried. My husband promptly made fun of me.  Then, after I put our daughter to sleep, I found him crying over the same book - he looked up and said \\"You got me!\\"<br />I see some reviews state that the mother is stalking her son and that this is dysfunctional love.  Personally, I took the Mom climbing in the window as a parody (think sitcom) and thought it was kind of amusing.  I don't think you are really supposed to read too much into that.<br />As far as dysfunctional love, I do not agree with that at all.  This is a story of the unconditional love a parent has for their child.  And while of course the relationship between a child and parent should grow as the child grows, the nature of this love does not necessarily change.  I don't think mine will, when my little girl is 25, she will still be my baby, even though I'll treat her as an adult.<br />Finally, someone thought it was wrong that the son has a daughter, but not a wife.  That is infered.  A wife is not mentioned, but neither is a daughter until the very end.  Personally, I assume he has a wife.  And if he does not, that would NOT mean that he loves his mother or child any less.<br />I think this is a beautiful story, I will be buying copies for my sister and my friends too.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Good quality DVD and excellent movie. I wasn't sure what to expect from the uncut version (I love the American releaseof &quot;The Professional&quot;), but I think the added material does enhance the movie. It's rather embarrassing to think that the rest of world got &quot;Leon&quot; and we got the &quot;babied&quot; version. There's nothing objectionable here.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Any comparisions to \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" or \\"Wizard of Oz\\" are simply erronious and insulting, .... These series are well written and read classics. The word 'classic' does not come to mind when viewing or reading \\"Harry Potter\\". It's an alright book, but not phenomena like \\"C.O.N\\" or \\"W.O.O.\\". Someone pointed out that this drivel will be read again and again, and that makes it classic. Go to it, but good writing will always be the preference of those with taste. Certainly, \\"C.O.N.\\" Chronicles' is moralistic, but more, it's well written, and will be read over and over again (entering a 3rd time, as many will attest).  So too, will 'The Earthsea Trilogy' by LeGuin, and L.O.R. be read over and over again.  However, this should not be a test of a 'Classic' novel; for most people (accurately) consider \\"Moby Dick\\" and \\"War And Peace\\" classics, but few will ever read them more than once.  Who cares if the miraculous happens over and over?  I don't see how it is missing in C.O.N., but then, talking animals and a interdimensional portals to lands full of mythic and magical creatures happens every day in my house.  The miraculous occurs often in a lot of namable dime-store novels and children's books that are long since forgotten by most, (the 'Mushroom Planet' series comes immediately to mind). People read 'Nancy Drew' over and over again, good stories, but not classics. This goes beyond the point of the DVD, but people in search of good fantasy fiction should not be lead to believe this is on the level of these other stories. So, this review addresses the story, which is in both the book and film.<BR>Essentially, in this installment, Harry Potter discovers after growing up a group of \\"muggles\\" (non-magical people, usually displayed as boring and bigoted people by boring and bigoted witches and wizards, the \\"moralization\\" being here that magical people are better somehow, or at least think they are) that he is accepted to a Wizard's School, (a topic given far better treatment in Ursula K. LeGuin's \\"Earthsea Trilogy\\"), and begins his fabulous journey. He arrives at wizard school, and becomes something of a celebrity who quickly rises to the top. He discovers a transparent conspiracy (one that any of the adult magicians should have been able to see) and sets off to solve the mystery.<BR>This movie, like the book that's based on, is fairly boring and superfluous. The tasks Harry has to go through to defeat the villian are not very difficult, and thus not very interesting. It is ludicrous that this series of books and movies are controversial, where it doesn't have anything of true value concerning magic, wizards or witches. Nor does it have interesting lessons, analogies or allusions. <BR>The special effects are fairly clunky CGI work, (watch the centaur scene for jilting movements). The sets and the look of the film are both fantastic, and the 'quiditch' scene is fun to watch, though you never get the sense that Potter is ever in any real danger. The extras on the DVD are silly, and don't warrant a second disc. Though extra scenes are always nice to see.<BR>Though a children's film, there is nothing here to make a comparison to any of the classic stories realistic. It compares better with Nancy Drew or Encyclopedia Brown than some of those that have been loosely thrown about (perchance by people that have not read the series they insult by comparing it to Harry Potter). I actually enjoyed reading Harry Potter's first book though I'm not a child, but there was really nothing warranting the high praise it has gotten aside from good marketing. It just reminds me that there are better children's stories out there, such as the now defunct \\"Mushroom Planet\\" series. This movie is an enjoyable watch, but don't expect \\"Lord of the Rings\\" quality of storytelling.
B00006DEFA|5.0|The quality of this DVD is outstanding. Content-wise, I am a big lover of the theatrical release, and so was a little apprehensive about the director's cut. Some of the added material is just okay, but some of it (such as a scene between Constanza and Salieri, which adds real heft to their meeting at the death-bed scene ) make the director's cut preferable, at least by a slim margin. One thing the added material does not do is in any way \\"ruin\\" the movie,  which I had feared. Less can be more, but here the more is okay, at least in this \\"Amadeus\\"-lover's opinion.  And all added material does have a logic to it---it's not just thrown in for the sake of throwing it in. You can see what the director was thinking, how those scenes function. And the extras here are fascinating. I think this is a terrific buy for the money. VHS was never like this!
B00007LL7O|5.0|These guys are great! I can't believe how many good albums they have. I have to say that when I heard this album, I was not dissapointed. Stratovarius is one of the best metal bands I ever heard. Not only is the guitarist very good, the rest of it is as well. They know how to make really good epic power metal. Every song on this album is very good. I especially like the songs &quot;Eagle Heart&quot; and &quot;Learning To Fly&quot;. It's too bad that the U.S. doesn't have bands out there like this. If we did, half the world wouldn't be laughing at us for our poor music taste. But for those who do choose to give good music a chance, I say buy this album, along with &quot;Infinite&quot; their best album so far.
B00003CXB7|5.0|Anyone who like me is looking for high-quality transfers of old, beloved films onto DVD will not be disappointed here. And you finally get to see the whole &quot;last supper,&quot; not a panned and scanned butchery of it. Spec-tac-ular.
B000069AUI|5.0|Great album! Every song has a deep and meaningful lyrics.The band is comparable to beatles songwriting ability.<BR>Politik - beautiful musical arrangemnets. Piano and guitar blended together to form a beautiful song<BR>In my Place - great guitar and vocal performance. Soulful lyrics<BR>God Put A smile upon your face - country-like song with a nice guitar accompaniment<BR>The Scientist- It is the greatest song that you must checked out on this album. Great lyrics and music. Best song ever recorded.

B00000099Y|5.0|hands down, the best album ever.  If you don't own it , I am sorry.  If you do and don't agree, you just don't understand it.  Buy this album, read the Tool FAQ and open up a whole new world of insight.
0789723107|5.0|This is a fun book.  It can easily be read in one setting, but it will impart many good nuggets of web usability knowledge.  Krug is not as extreme as Jakob Nielsen with sparseness, but rather tackles what makes the web a unique medium.  His basic thesis is that people scan webpages for information, they don't read them, and therefore designers have to keep that paramount in mind.  As one of his chapters is titled &quot;Omit Needless Words,&quot; except the word &quot;needless&quot; is struck through.  Hear! Hear! Let's give it up for pithiness.
B00005JKL8|2.0|The marketing for this film hardly touched on one of the key story elements of a movie like this: the enemy.  Commercials and trailers show the bad guys in balaclavas with AK-47s and define them as the enemy.<br />The point?  Here we have a good chance to make a Hollywood film and touch on the Bosnian war.  Instead we get a waste of everyone's time, including the always-great Gene Hackman.  You can't fault him when he has a shoddy script and an overall lame effort around him.<br />During the Bosnian war a US pilot is shot down after discovering illegal movement and activity by the Bosnian Serb army during a cease fire.  The pilot and co-pilot get shot down and parachute out.  The co-pilot is discovered by the \\"evil\\" Bosnian Serbs and then...executed.  Right.  I guess it's because the Serbs are just bad guys.  They're portrayed as no less than an evil crew who like hunting people down and killing them.  No flattery here as we get every cliche in the book.<br />Since the story isn't going to make sense, at least we get some good effort by Hackman and Owen Wilson, who isn't too bad for the \\"hero\\".  With that nose at least he's somewhat believable as a weary soldier.<br />The film delivers some more of the now very tired action techniques of showing flying missles and bullets and planes and cars that look well executed but become utterly boring and unexciting because of their recycled feel.  I would have liked to have seen a more delicate treatment of matters in the film, turning out a better story about civil war and intervening powers, but we're left with your typical jingoist trash that provides a short cut to thinking without even being escapist fun.
B00005QIPH|5.0|... This album - this band - rocks!    I confess that I had never even heard of the Strokes until late in 2002. By then, \\"Is This It\\" had already been out there for an entire year. So, I was oblivious to all this \\"hype\\" I have read about here on Amazon.com... and to these claims that they are \\"The Saviors of Rock and Roll\\". I don't pay all that much attention to this silly stuff put out there by \\"professional\\" music critics.     SO, when my girlfriend informed me one Saturday evening of last year, that \\"some group is playing on SNL tonight... they're supposed to be pretty good...\\", I figured I'd have a look and a listen. That performance was all I needed to watch. I instantly became a Strokes fan and I went out to buy \\"Is This It\\" the next day.    What I like about this band is that, for one, they LOOK like rock and rollers. I know this is not all that important, in the end. But, come on... you have to admit that its tough to get excited by a band that looks more like they should be in a frat house or a haunted house! When you've got \\"the look\\" - and The Strokes have got it(!) - it can only be a plus. But, more importantly - musically - they offer three imperitive elements to good rock and roll. As Carlos Santana once called them, \\"The three S's\\":    1.) Sincerity, 2.) Simplicity, and 3.) Soulfullness.    The songs are infectious, hook-laden, raw, energetic romps. You can tell The Strokes love the music they are playing - it drips out from insdie the CD player! You know from the very first listen whether or not music is pure or pretentious. \\"Is This It\\" is pure rock from the first track to the last.    I'd list the highlights for you, but every track is as good as the next. Of course, the singles \\"Last Nite\\", \\"Someday\\", and \\"Hard To Explain\\" deserve particular attention. But, this is one CD that I will not be skipping over any tracks! It gets played front to back each time I listen to it... and after each listen, it seems to breath new life into itself. This CD ain't getting tired!    I have found it VERY interesting, indeed, how much mud is being slung at The Strokes, and their debut album, on Amazon's customer reviews section! Just this simple fact of how they have stirred up so much attention - and contention - points to this band's importance.    So, take the reviews that show 1 or 2 stars with a grain of salt. Some folks buy into what they hear from rock critics, and as a result they expect way too much... seemingly to forget that EVERYTHING has already been done before in rock and roll. Every new band will be compared to bands that have come before them. But, what The Strokes have done on \\"Is This It\\" is take the rock and roll baton from their predecessors and run with it - further than any band has in a very looooooooooooooooooooong time.    Whether you like them or not, make no mistake - The Strokes are the real deal.
0553382179|1.0|I belong to a group of 6 women that meet regularly and work through a book to improve some aspect of our life. We heard about Sink Reflections and thought we would try it. We were very disappointed. The book was very choppy and did not read well. A lot of the information seemed to be taken from the Sidetracked Home Executive books which we had before this book. We felt that there were too many quotes from e-mails and not enough solid how-to information that would really work for busy people. We will stick with the Sidetracked Home Executives book!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|think of this..no matter who listens, they all love it..no matter what they think of the girl's image and/or sexual preference, they always have opinions..people want to listen, people want to see them everywhere..even the homophobes in the world listen despite being afraid of the world turning into raging homosexuals..<BR>funny thing is this, if you love tatu music, you love tatu..<BR>i love every song on this cd..i recommend it and all their others to everyone i know :)
B0000024SI|5.0|Had the album &quot;Blonde On Blonde&quot; never been released, this would be my favorite Dylan album (well now that I think about it, it would be in a tough competition with Blood On The Tracks)....but that's not important.  What is important is this landmark album.  Dylan hinted towards the movement from folk to rock with Bringing It All Back Home, but this was his major shift.  With BIABH he was just getting his feet wet.  With this album he did a cannon-ball right into the ocean.  This is one of Dylan's most freewheelin', feel good bluesy albums.  Dylan rarely sounds like he's having this much fun, and this album rocks.  The lyrics are what you'd expect from the greatest lyricist of all time, the most unique voice in the history of music.  With a rocking band behind him, dylan hits that perfect mix, and the fact that this album isn't even considered his best is staggering.  Highway 61 is an album I revisit many many times, and if you're just new to Dylan, this is definitely a good one to start with, and if anyone tries to call themselves a Dylan fan without this album should be flogged immediately.  Of course this album has one of Dylan's most well known songs, &quot;Like A Rolling Stone,&quot; the one that challenged the radio's conventional 3 minute per song approach.  This album hasn't aged a day, the bluesy feel, and some of Dylan's best singing and inimmitable lyrics (although many have tried) make this as fresh as the day it came out.  remarkable Dylan, but please don't take my word for it, take a trip down Highway 61.
B000089RVX|5.0|From the first I time I heard the single &quot;Bring me to life&quot; on the radio, I knew this band was going to be awesome. Lush, dark, thoughtful, and original lyrics sung by the intense and powerful voice of Amy Lee complement perfectly to Ben Moody's creative and metal driven guitar work. This band is phenominal.I haven't been this drawn to a band in a long time. <BR>&quot;Fallen&quot; is great album. The lyrics bring about a sense of loss, but the power and will to overcome it. Any rock fan should own this CD! And not only is this band good in the studio, they rock live! Having seen them in a sold out show last night, It made even more of a fan. I even got a five from Amy Lee! IT was GREAT!! Do this band some justice, and get this CD. You won't be disapointed!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is a great way to break into the national music circuit. It has pop appeal, and rock heart. Their sound is like no one else on the market today. The band sounds amazing, their talents come together to create some soul-stirring music. I bought the CD after hearing &quot;bring me to life&quot; once on the radio. The CD has been in my player non-stop since then. I'm sure this will be the first of many amazing albums from this band.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|A freind of mine told me about Lenny Kravitz and how good his music was about a year ago, and I did not believe her, because I did not like his Corn Row and nose ring looks.  Then I bought it as a gift and heard a few of the tracks and I could not believe how talented this man is and how good of songs he has.  I am from the classic rock generation and it is hard to find new artists that actually play and write their own material. It is GREAT! And so is his #5 reissue with bonus tracks!
0385335482|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time! I love it!  It's so funny and well-written. Everyone should read it!
B00005JL3A|4.0|-Good-<BR>Resident Evil in my opinion was a great movie. I enjoyed the plot, characters, and effects. The zombies looked very realistic and the movie was very creative.<BR>            -Bad-<BR>The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because in the begininng I found the plot a little hard to follow. As movie went on I stared to understand it more. <BR>            -Overall-<BR>If you watch this movie (which you should) make sure to pay close attention in the begining 10 - 20 minutes otherwise you may get a little lost. Overall great movie, recomend it to everyone and stongly recommend it to Sci-Fi fans.
0425107469|5.0|As Koontz novels go, this is the one to buy and keep. The characters, though not as well written as some other writers, are the best Koontz has done before or after..and how can you not love and feel for that pooch?<br />This one reads easily and sucks you in.
6305428220|5.0|I love this movie, I could watch it over and over.<br />It has a great plot and the way the movie unfolds is great! It takes the body snatcher theme and uses it wonderfully. I would deffinally recomend this movie to any one who likes Sci-Fi, Horror, and a little bit of mystery. Overall Great movie!
B000002UAX|5.0|When one rates Beatles record, it seems almost natural that one tends to compare each one against the Beatles' own catalog. It's almost understood that it would be a waste of time to compare their work vs. other musicians. So - where does that leave the White Album?<br />Well, it's one of the best in it's own disjointed and fractured manner. This is the Beatles as solo artists. A band not sure that they wanted to still be together but certain that they couldn't separate. Most songs were recorded by small pairings of the band. Or solo, such as Paul's \\"Why don't we do it in the Road?\\"  Still, the band is structured enough to offer a record that moves in jerky ways this way and that but still maintains the essence of the group.<br />John Lennon seems to sum up the overall mood of the band in his \\"I'm so Tired\\" The album has a feeling of weariness at the odd world the band inhabited. The times were definitely changing and the boys sounded like they had become disillusioned with some of their utopian fancy. Not that this is a bad thing...<br />So why ramble on. This is a tough gritty album with many classics and a few second rate offerings that I know am happy to have. Let's face it, the Beatles at less then their best are better than just about anyone else.  This record is an important snapshot of a band maturing and groping towards their final burst of unity and dissolution.
0425152251|2.0|SOPHIE'S WORLD comes with one of those &quot;discussion guides&quot; with all sorts of thought-provoking or nausea-inducing questions in the back. The first question asks &quot;Is Sophie special or unusual, or can anyone become a good philosopher?&quot;<br />I hated that question when I first read it, but it does open up further questions. What is Sophie? Is she a character in Gaarder's novel? Or is she an object, a projection, not even worthy of the few considerations that we grant a character? She certainly acts like an automaton.<br />Gaarder's book alleges itself to be a novel of the history of philosophy. Unfortunately, it barely stands up to the critical examination due a novel. The plot is non-existent. The characters are flimsy playthings. Sophie and should-be-creepy mentor Alberto Knox become philosophy salad-shooters, taking the ingredients that are the basis of Western Philosophy, and spouting them out in slightly tasty but good-for-you servings.<br />I am in no way qualified to judge the History of Philosophy aspect of this book, but I suspect that Eastern philosophies are given short shrift. I also share some other reviewers' regret that Sartre marks the end into the exploration into the 20th century. The novel's &quot;twist&quot; coincides with the discussion of the philosopher that is the publisher's namesake, and this twist serves to both reduce whatever miniscule investment the reader may have placed on the paper-thin characters, while distracting from the object of relating the last sequence of philosophers.<br />One thing about SOPHIE'S WORLD is that it is a very international book. My Chinese classmates tell me they read the book. The author and the characters are Norwegian, and one of the characters serves as a UN Peacekeeper. The UN is an interesting representation of global ideals, and it is interesting to see in current events how much weight it carries. SOPHIE'S WORLD wears its hopes for the UN on its sleeves, and it just underscores how depressing it is that so many in the United States would just as soon see the UN rendered irrelevant.
B000002UB3|5.0|I won't waste time going on about the Beatles. Some folks hate them no matter what and everyone else seems to realize that they were a step ahead or around everyone else.<br />This is a bittersweet goodbye - a final attempt to be a band before they went their seperate ways - in court and life. The bottom line is that this is a supremely polished and accomplished record. McCArtney has never sounded better than he does on &quot;Oh Darling&quot;, Lennon hits his unique blend of surrealism and studio strangeness in &quot;Come Together&quot; and the true star here is HArrison with the effervescent &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and &quot;Something.&quot; NOTE: Listen to the graceful and melodic bass line on Something. It's usually overlooked but it shows why McCartney was the best bassist around.<br />A lovely album by the best band that ever played.
B000089RVX|2.0|OK- here's the deal.. if you were expecting some sick tori amos-linkin park fusion band.. look somewhere else. this CD starts out PERFECTLY, with Bring me Back to Life, but... it only goes downhill from there. Bring me back to life is the only hard song on this cd, the rest of it is a depressing tori amos type twisted [stuff]... no offense to tori. but after track number 2.. the track falls to about a 5/10. and it only gets sappier and sappier. truly not the album i was expecting. this is NOT a rock album.. but if you are looking for an emotionally saddened and cushy-mushy filled album, then GO FOR IT! but if you just like the sound of their first, and hopefully only, single \\"bring me back to life\\" then just get the single.. it is a one and only track like it on the whole cd. so like i said before.. i disagree with everyone else.. pretty much.
0316666343|1.0|This book is complete and utter drivel.  It is poorly written and inconsistant.  I don't understand how or why it is on the best-seller list.  The author uses every overly dramatic movie-of-the-week cliche in this book.  My theory as to why this book is so popular is that some marketing/advertising hot-shot remembered this piece of [junk] sitting on his or her shelf when the rash of missing girls occurred and decided to capitalize on these tragedies.  A huge marketing campaign took place with this book when it first came out.  There were even TV commercials for it. I find the whole timing of this book's popularity very disturbing.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I am 26 years old and am a pretty recent addition to Johnny Cash's fan base. 5 Years ago I became hooked when I first heard a young guy in Texas play a few of the Man in Blacks catchy tunes. I not only enjoyed listening to it, but was intrigued with how personal it seemed to this young, rough around the edges guy and how much it was enjoyed by every other young kid in that bar (including me)....Fast forward to this albumn and the same feeling holds true. It is an albumn that transcends all ages, creeds, and most of all style. My Dad gave this to me for my 26 birthday and all I have to say is thank God it's a cd, if it were anything but, it would be worn from the ware. Although many of the songs are covers and I am familiar with most as they were, I can easily follow Cash's voice through each tune as if it were coming directly from the depths of his soul...Dramatic??? not at all, thats what it really seems like. It's like your taking a trip back in time with him reflecting on his life, love, heartbreak, and mistakes. It is real, it's personal, and has a wonderful flavor. To those who said he has no voice and hated this albumn, you JUST DONT GET IT! He may not have the best voice in the business, but he has the grit and the heart and the talent to tell a story,a story that will touch you. Thats TALENT!!! and this albumn is just another testimony to that. just a little advise to those who are on the fence about this...get it, buy it, you wont regret it!
B00007JMCX|4.0|This movie is very complex and non-linear.  The viewer has to pay close attention to what is going on.  But one shouldn't panic at the first sign of confusion.  Hang on and challenge yourself to last through the movie.  You may not feel satisfied by the movie, but you will think about it.  Whether you end up liking the movie or not, it will effect you.  That makes it the great movie that it is.  I'm not sure whether I like it or not, but I'm glad I watched it.  And I think about it and I'm still confused by some aspects of it.  It needs a few views to be understood.  But I'm not straining too hard to understand everything, because being confused and disoriented while watching a movie is a good thing.  I don't really care if I don't know what's going on all the time.  It makes for a very unpredictable experience.  Too many movies today are so predictable, this one is not.  The crude sexual scenes add to the reality of the movie.  This is a REAL sci-fi movie.  What I mean by REAL, is that the movie is about an alien and outerspace.  But one wouldn't really know it until about half way through the movie.  The true nature of the picture is hidden behind a well written movie about human life.  Then when the sci-fi aspect unfolds, it has a great impact.  I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a challenge.
B000089RVX|5.0|How should i review this album ? <BR>WOOOOOOOOOOOOW . <BR>I bought the album the day it came out and since, it's becoming the only cd in my stereo, my car .... ( sorry audioslave, coldplay  great albums but bad timing ) EVANESCENCE is definitively the album of the year.<BR>reading other reviews, everyone is comparing Evanescence to Linkin Park, Garbage, Tori Amos but listening over and over to the CD, I realize that even if the musical influence of these artists is there, they came up with their own sound. it's ROCK and it' ROCKS. it's dark but melodic. Great lyrics ( nothing obscene and if your are a parent like I am that's important )<BR>1 more point Amy Lee has one of the most interesting voice in recent Rock,loud but clear. it's one rare album where you can understand the lyrics without the need to read it on the cd booklet ( u see what i mean )<BR>i hope the follow-up album will be at the same quality level than fallen. In the mean time, we will see EVANESCENCE at the 2004 grammys for best new rock band.
078322687X|5.0|This is a remarkably well done movie that treats teenagers as real people and not just sex crazed maniacs. This is pretty accurate by todays standards except for the dated music and clothing, but the issues and the cliques are still the same. Actually the only cast members clothing that didn't go out of style is the nerds clothes. (Nerd never goes out of style) Anyway, John Hughes's popular 1985 teen drama finds the usual groups of high school students a jock, a metalhead a weirdo, a princess, and a nerd sharing a Saturday in detention at their high school for one minor infraction or another. Over the course of a day, they talk through the social barriers that ordinarily keep them apart, and new alliances are born, though not without a lot of pain first. But man it gets painful when they see themselves for they really are, and they see that none of them is better than the other. This film has a positive message (except for having sex and smoking to be cool) and should be viewed buy anyone who has taste. If you don't like this movie, then you're already dead.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Rarely does a \\"sequel\\" improve on the original and yet this one is phenomenal. My brother, my son and I went to see it and all of us were awestruct. The scope, the scenery, the tension and the attention to detail make this movie a wonder. I can hardly wait for the third installment. Five cheers for the \\"Two Towers\\".
B00004RFCM|2.0|Not having cable, this was my first exposure to this show.  There are 12 episodes on 2 DVD's here, each episode being a relatively painless and pointless 22-23 minutes long.<br />In case you haven't seen it, this show is all about sex and closely related topics (like \\"relationships\\").  There really are no other side plots of any significance.  The \\"City\\" is merely a glitzy back-drop for all these beautiful and well-dressed yuppies.  And while there is an attempt made to make you think the emphasis on sex is substantive rather than gratuitous, this is really a swindle.  The whole thing is inane, if harmless.<br />I'd call the show a sit-com if it had a laugh-track.  Except that it's not funny.  We're supposed to take the characters seriously (as in a documentary or a drama), but I couldn't even after a couple of hours of it.  SJP is virtually impossible to look at IMO, and none of the other characters are at all believable or sexy.  In fact, even though there's sex all over the screen practically all the time, there's nothing here that's in the least bit sexy.  The male characters (Stanford and Skipper) are cardboard characters.  The whole thing is missable.  About the only episode worth seeing was the one on the baby shower.
B00000AF98|4.0|OK  I've read the other review about the embarrassment to listen to certain songs on this album when company comes over.  However, if you knew me and it was on when I came over, I'd become your best friend.  I love this album!  I had never heard it until this past year.  I love the sound of the 80's with the big melodic chorus's and 1,4,5 chord progressions that make music simple to listen too.  However this album isn't just that.  It's got it's edgy Kiss sounding songs too.  This album as well as the other albums Kiss brought out in the 80's seems to have a KISS philosophy behind them all.  The KISS philosophy to a musician is KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID!!!!  The less is more theory.  If you like the big hair band sounds of the 80's, you'll love this album.  I play this one with Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Journey, and this album.  Makes for a great day!
B00003CWPL|5.0|This great work of experimental cinema is now available in the US only through [a website.]  This is a painstakingly remastered version of the film.
0375414053|5.0|This book actually made me laugh out loud!  I can't remember the last time a book made me do that.   Even if you don't have children, like me, you'll love this book.  I was hoping the author had written more books.  Love her style.
0395925037|5.0|Part biography, part party manifesto and part propoganda pamphlet, \\"Mein Kampf\\" (\\"My Struggle\\") is three volumes of a work first published in 1925 while the Little Corporal was just that, an obscure agitator serving a brief prison sentence for a failed coup (putsch) in Munich. Manheim's translation of \\"Mein Kampf\\" is perhaps the best one so far. He does an excellent job translating many of the German metaphors into English. Don't feel guilty about buying this book.

B00005QG9J|3.0|It's hard to complain about this release when the second half of 2001 saw airwaves dominated by the endless drone of bland corporate acts like Nickelback and Puddle of Mudd. On the other hand, this album truly has disappointed me, mainly because it comes from a band I know can do better. <br />I don't want to simplify things to much, but here is basically how I look at the three major Incubus releases: S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was a very solid and very original effort that made for a fun listen; this album (MORNING VIEW) is a very toned-down Incubus that was obviously tempted to tread into softer and more mainstream territory by the success of their previous album's softest songs (&quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;Stellar&quot;); and MAKE YOURSELF was the middle album where both elements came together to create an exceptional, if not classic, record.<br />The first complaint I have with this release, aside from the obvious change in style intended to draw 15 year old girls into the fan base, is the lack of any exceptional/standout tracks. Where are the classic songs that we found on SCIENCE (&quot;New Skin&quot; and &quot;Certain Shade of Green&quot;) and MAKE YOURSELF (&quot;Pardon Me&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot;)? It seems that with MORNING VIEW, Incubus has thrown together a collection of songs in which about half are what I would deem 'pretty good' (such as &quot;Nice to Know You,&quot; &quot;Blood on the Ground,&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot;), and the other half are more mediocre (&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;11 am&quot;).<br />While there are sure to be plenty of fans, especially newer ones, that argue that this new, softer Incubus is simply a more mature version of the older sound, I would respond that MAKE YOURSELF featured a sound that worked and sounded much better, while still showing at least as much musical and lyrical maturity. The song structures and lyrics on MORNING VIEW have *not* (IMO) become any more sophisticated; the real difference is a shift in style towards the MTV crowd.<br />With all that said, I still listen to this record sometimes, and find it to be one of the top 10 rock releases of 2001. It's hard to deliver something that matches the quality of MAKE YOURSELF, so perhaps I was expecting a little too much. After all, there are at least four or five songs on here that recall MAKE YOURSELF to some extent and make for a good listen. My worry is that if this trend continues, the next Incubus release will be full of &quot;Mexico's&quot; and &quot;Echo's,&quot; which will officially qualify as selling out for me. Until then, I'll enjoy MAKE YOURSELF and SCIENCE often, and I'll throw MORNING VIEW in the CD player when I'm tired of those.
B00003CXSP|1.0|Man, it's just AWFUL. The B-movie \\"head\\" scene alone will have fans of \\"The Toxic Avenger\\" shouting, \\"Bravo!\\" Imagine this sequel to Silence of the Lambs being like having a pina-colada wine cooler after a glass of $150 Merlot. Those that don't know the difference have their head in the sand. Refrain from wasting your time or money on \\"Hannibal.\\"
B00006RIO7|5.0|From the best movie on earth comes the greatest music on earth.  so much energy and such great music!  ahh im obsessed!
B000005JA8|1.0|and it's certainly not a reason to buy an album.  there are too many five star reviews that point out how cool you'll be by buying this album.  what about the music?  everyone agrees that it's difficult, unpleasant, atonal, arrhythmic, and so forth.  that might make it cool, but that's no reason to buy an album like this.  if you find it in a dumpster behind a second-hand store, you might consider it a find.  paying money for it is just a swindle.  weirdness and coolness aren't the same for most people, and for good reason.  anyone can be weird.  beefheart was certainly weird, but that doesn't make him cool.  sorry.
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is amazing. It is the first alternative rock cd I have ever owned, and I can't stop listening to it. The best way to describe this album is darkly spiritual. From its haunting vocals and beats, to the chants and guitar riffs; it simply mesmerizes the listener.
B000089RVX|5.0|The vocals are beautiful and haunting, with interresting lyrics. Unlike much &quot;angst music&quot;, &quot;Fallen&quot; invokes a sense of thoughtful melancholy without being whining or grating. The music is somewhere around rock or grunge rock; it provides a great contrast to the long, haunting vocal tones without degrading into loud, rythmic noise. In short, this is angsty grunge rock done *right*!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is truely an amazing album. The music is compelling. At times, the songs will put you in a trance while others will leave your blood pumping. Its a rollar-coaster of an album, no songs will you skip over if you truely listen to every single one. I have not encountered an album worthy of such early praise since Linkin Park's 'Hybrid Theory.' 'My immortal' is such a relaxing and moving song. The hit from Daredevil, 'Bring Me To Life' is truely a captivating song which get the adrenaline flowing. Anyone who is taking the time to read this must go buy this album because there is no further reasoning behind it, great album, definately worth it.
0805062971|4.0|I thought this book was very profound. It has had an impact on my life. It showed me that life isn't about living without regrets. You have to take chances to live a real life. It is about a man who has insomnia. He meets a girl at one of the group meetings that he goes to for his insomnia. Then, he met a man named Tyler Durden. They went to a bar for a couple of drinks, and when they came out, Tyler told the guy to hit him as hard as he could. They started fighting for no other reason but to let out anger. People saw them fighting so they started fighting for the same reason. That's how fight club started. Later, the fight club turns into something more than that. It becomes Project Mayhem. The purpose of this club was to create chaos to civilization. They caused a lot of damage to the world. Project Mayhem, was spreading. That is the best part of the book. After you read up to this point, it  just gets better, and you'll never want to put the book down.
B00006X06U|3.0|Let me say from the outset that I'm a huge Joni Mitchell fan.  Whether you're a big fan or not, if you liked 2000's &quot;Both Sides Now,&quot; you'll probably like this.  If not (I didn't), you probably won't.  The orchestrations, musicianship and package are outstanding, but the songs sound rather lifeless.  I prefer the originals (by far) in every case.  Still, new Joni - even if it's re-working old Joni material - is better than no new Joni.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Bruno Bettelheim, in his book &quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot; indicates that those who grow up without exposure to (and to a certain extent participation in) fairy tales will lack something in their development as human beings. Joseph Campbell sets forth the same message in his &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;.  I believe that critics of &quot;AI&quot; who lambast Spielberg for the tone of the movie, and in particular those who decry the last 25 minutes have lost the ability to experience a sense of wonder.  A sad commentary on the tenor of our times.<br />On the contrary, Spielberg is to be applauded for taking what Kubrick handed him, maintaining Kubrick's characteristic rawness, and yet splicing it to an ending which, if not exactly &quot;happily ever after&quot;, lets the child in us relax and believe that everything will always turn out ok.<br />The acting and technical achievement have been highly praised elsewhere, and not without reason.  This is one of Spielberg's greatest achievements in the area of effects without the &quot;effects for effects sake&quot; aura of films like &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.  Haley Joel Osment's acting is stunning.  At times you have to remind yourself that what you are looking at is an actor and not a machine and yet he handles the difficult final scene with just the right emphasis. Jude Law as Gigolo Joe leaves us wishing his part had been bigger.<br />Agreed, the film is not for everyone, only for those whose breath comes a little quicker and whose attention is captured when they hear the words &quot;once upon a time&quot;.
B00004LN16|5.0|There exists today an entire army of reviewers ready to dismiss every AC/DC outing as &quot;the same old thing.&quot;<br />There is no problem with &quot;the same old thing&quot; when the same old thing is simple perfection. By contrast, the last few AC/DC albums have suffered from a bit of an identity crisis; they attempted to layer heavy-handed production on what is essentialy a straight-ahead blues band, more closely related to B.B. King than to the mass of '80s hair-metal bands that are all but extinct today.<br />George Young's production on Stiff Upper Lip brings to the forefront those strengths which make AC/DC the undisputed kings of blues-metal: the Young brothers' simple, undeniable blue-collar riffs and Malcolm Young's working-class voice. Tracks like Stiff Upper Lip and Hold Me Back are toe-tapping, head-bobbing, hammer-pounding hard-working songs the likes of which can be found nowhere else in record stores today. There hasn't been an AC/DC album (or indeed any album) like this in years, and that's a shame.<br />What a good thing we have this one to listen to!
055357342X|3.0|Now doubt, a well written and thought out book, but better than Tolkien... no.  Tolkien was, is, and always will be the master of the fantasy genre.  Martin has writen a great series but like many of todays' authors, he has not learned when to end a good series.  I am bored of folowing multiple story lines with too many sub sub plots.  I am stretched to my limit of focus with having to turn back fifty pages to remember who is who and who did what to whom.  The simple beauty of Tolkies was... is I never read the Hobbit of Books I &amp; II of The Lord of The Rings, I could read Book III and not be lost.  But as I said before... The Song of Fire and Ice is a enjoyable series... but no where near Tolkien.
B00008PX8P|5.0|It has been 27 years since I first saw \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" and pretty much since the closing credits rolled I have always sought more live-performance video from my favorite band. I have heard the audio from the 1970 Royal Albert Hall show, and many tracks from the infamous 1975 five-night stand at Earls Court and now to be able to actually see them perform from these momentous concerts is almost too much to comprehend. Combined with remaining footage from TSRTS and some \\"bootleg\\" footage and containing several interviews and their first TV performance on Danish TV from 1969, this is an incredible DVD set and will always be part of my collection.
B00003CXCT|5.0|First of all, Lucas better release just a simple remastered edition of the ORIGINAL film, without Jabba added and the new touches he gave for the re-releases (Disc 1).  A 2nd disc could have that version on it.  A 3rd disc needs to have about 8 commentary tracks (at least).  A 4th disc needs to have interviews with the entire cast.  A 5th disc needs to cover Star Wars merchandise.  A 6th disc needs to have the film with ALL the unused footage thrown back in, including the original opening sequence (according to the script) with Luke and his friends chatting on Tatooine, or at least ALL the deleted scenes.  And Lastly, it better be out pretty damn soon, before I die or something!
B000002UAI|4.0|This is one of the Beatles' most underrated albums.  I'll admit it probably would've been a stronger album with more originals but it does have some good covers (this was the end of an era since as the Beatles wrote more of their own songs, the covers would disappear, though there were a few on Help!).  This album was recorded in the midst of the Beatles touring and released in time for Christmas in 1964 in the UK (Americans would get sections of it on Beatles '65 and Beatles VI).  You can almost see the wear and tear on the Beatles' faces on the cover.  Derek Taylor mixes articulation with humour on the liner notes (the  wisecrack included in this review's title is an example of his wit).  <br />The album opens with the melancholy \\"No Reply,\\" in which John offers his evasive girlfriend one more chance (lots of acoustic guitar work on this).  \\"I'm a Loser\\" is a fun song, although the lyrics have gotten grimmer (John feels like a fool and feels sorry for himself).  You can hear the Dylan influence with the acoustic guitars and harmonica (with a touch of Carl Perkins on the guitar solo).  Also, John throws in some philosophy \\"And so it's true pride comes before a fall.\\"  \\"Baby's In Black\\" sounds almost like the woman who dumped John is about to get her due from another guy as he sings \\"Oh how long will it take 'till she sees the mistake she has made?\\" (these 3 songs almost sound related!).  \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" is perhaps the strongest cover with John, Paul and George Martin on piano with this Chuck Berry classic (if you remember The Compleat Beatles documentary, it's the opening track) while \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" is the weakest (the Hammond organ makes their reading sound dated).  \\"Words of Love\\" is fun and catchy.  Paul combines 2 classics \\"Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey Hey\\" and there are 2 Carl Perkins numbers- \\"Honey Don't\\" (sung by Ringo) and \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\" (sung by George).  \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" was supposedly written by Paul back in the 1950's whenhe was with the Quarreymen.  \\"Every Little Thing\\" sports an interesting melody with some fine harmonies by John and Paul (one of two happier love songs here).  \\"Eight Days a Week\\" (the other happier love song) is even catchier with the 1st ever fade-in in history (the title came from something Ringo said \\"We've been working eight, I mean seven days a week!\\").  \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\\" shows John in desparation (lyrically belying a chipper melody), while hoping against hope (\\"If she shows up while I'm gone, please let me know\\").  \\"What You're Doing\\" (sung by Paul) features some Spector-like drums (in the mold of \\"Be My Baby\\") and the opening guitar riff sounds like it inspired the Byrds on their version of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man.\\" <br />To quote Mr. Taylor: \\"The kids of AD 2000 will draw from the music the same sense of well being and warmth as we do today.\\"  It's amazing how prophetic these words which were written in late 1964 have become!
0780627024|5.0|Pleasantville<BR>      <br />The movie was about a guy named David that was going to watch a TV marathon. But his sister was going to watch a concert in TV with her date at her house. Then they fought over the TV remote, the remote breaks. An old dude comes to their house door. He is a TV repair dude. He gave a new remote to David. David presses a button and hi and his sister into the TV in Pleasantville. David and Jell his sister became Mary and Bud the two kids on the TV show. They start to mess-up the town with their ideas of the world where they use to live.<br />   The idea on this movie in my personal opinion is that you can't have a perfect society or maybe you can but the persons on it may not be really happy. I think that a perfect society would be really boring.   <br /> This movie is for the families that like nice movies and for the old people or people that likes funny movies. in my personal opinion I liked it. <br />      By Rogelio Campos

B0000640VO|4.0|Energetic, silly, fantastical and fun!  This is one of those French movies that shows both a joy in life and the joy in movies about life.  Audrey Tautou is a marvelous gamin, sort of a cross between Wynona Ryder and silent star Colleen Moore.  This is one of those films that gives a knowing wink at the audience while creating a great self-contained world that operates within its own sensibilities.<br />As for the DVD extras, I didn't bother watching them.  I prefered to let the movie speak for itself.
6305428425|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out on video and thought it was funny then.  Now, as I approach my own 10th year high school reunion, I watched it again.  I think this movie has gotten better.  While parts of the movie has obvious cliches, it still makes you lugh and think about your own classmates and how they are post-high school.  And it clearly gives the message - be yourself!
B000002H8F|5.0|Past their best? So the GENERAL consensus would have you believe. Nothing after Doolittle was as good they say. They lie. ok this doesnt have the raw energy of surfa rosa, nor the powerful riffing of doolittle. But it has some of my favourite pixie songs. lets face it the earlier stuff was primitive, energetic but less refined. here we just have something which oozes an otherwordly sophistication. My favourite song is the short and sweet anaestesia that is ANA. it just floats over you in beauty and petals and summer night delight. This whole record is a continuation of the sorta sound of Wave of Mutilations UK SURF version. soft and gentle but deeper than what has gone before. a slightly sad record really. in the past the Pixies advocated insanity and anger, here thats died away to reveal just people feeling. living. emotional resonance. your drinking a glass of something you enjoy at night looking out smelling the sea's rich tearful aroma. This is where this record takes you in its maturity. You can't but help enjoy it.

B000089RVX|5.0|If you have not bought this cd yet, then either youre broke or really dumb. The songs in this album put other bands to shame. \\"Bring Me To Life\\" is of course one of their best, and their calobaration with Mccoy (from 12 Stones) is how rock should really sound. Going under is their best song and it tells you one thing, this cd is awesome. Her voice is so beautiful and look at her shes not that bad either. Supprot her, dont let her die out like other great bands, excluding N'sync and Backstreet, make her rich and by her cd, she deserves it.

Jolie's portrayal is dazzling -- an untamed realism carries her performance. \\"Gia\\" the movie is powerful, absorbing, and highly provocative. \\"Gia\\" is a very poignant biography: illustrating what happens to a young model, (turned superstar), whose seemingly celebrated life is, in reality, merely isolated &amp; forsaken.  The privation is heightened, as Gia's life is erroneously perceived by others to be satisfying, trendy, and beautifully breathtaking.

B00006M183|5.0|Once again I have to express my thoughts on Pearl Jams work. The reason is simply because it is so damn good. It takes my breath away again and again and never leaves me tired! It is just something about this band that everyone else is missing. Why? I don't have a good answer for it, but I want to take the opportunity to write some words about their new album, Riot Act.<br />As all Pearl Jam albums, Riot Act is not a cd you can put on and immidiatly start enjoying and loving. The music is challenging and in control. It is challenging in the way that you need to really listen to the songs at least 20 times before you can work them out. They are kind of  riddles and the longer you read the riddles, the closer you get to solving them. That is my experience with this album, with the exception of a few songs. One of those songs are 'I am mine'. The first single from the album. This song needs no further introduction so I will leave it alone. My personal favourites are 'You are' and 'thumbing my way'. These two songs alone might answer why Pearl Jam is such a great and talented band. They are completely different in style and rythm and proves just how diverse the band can be. And most important : It all sounds too good! The weaker tracks are 'half full' and 'get right'. The songs I have left out are great great songs that needs your attention. Don't give up on this album! Look at it as a challenge and it won't let you down. Its all or none.....
038533348X|4.0|Obvious satire on all the ridiculous happy endings sewn onto stories but why else throw in the towel on mankind?   One wonders if the story might be a justification for suicide.   One supposes that Vonnegut, like his character, little Newt, was disappointed that in making a Cat's Cradle that there really is no cat and no cradle-that there is really nothing supporting the religious tripe that seem to keep people rolling down the track.  He certainly put the \\"dys\\" in utopia here.  I doubt if a more poignant tale of futility and hopelessness could be penned.<br /> Although his memorable characters are nicely drawn-they are all too easily erased by the final page.  Why struggle through so many pages of words only to reach the same blank page one started with?  Looking for virtue in the tale one can say that it was short and abrupt.  The suffering doesn't last that long.  Everyone would prefer an instant and painless end to their life.

B00006IUL7|4.0|Insomnia is of course a remake of a Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgard, directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg in 1997 but as much as this may make me a heathen to European film culture, I must confess to having never seen the original. However, thanks to one of my good friends (Steve, take a bow) I was lucky enough to see the UK premier of Insomnia as the closing movie of the 2002 Edinburgh film festival and lucky enough to see and hear the Director Christopher Nolan say a few words about this fine movie.<br />Opening with incredibly stunning cinematography of Alaskan ice fields, haggard L.A police detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Hep Eckhart (Martin Donovan) arrive in America's most northerly city to help solve the brutal killing of a teenage girl. Met by a local Detective (Hilary Swank) who openly hero-worships Dormer and his successful career as a Detective, Pacino's character sets about showing the local hicks how it's done. However, it soon transpires that Dormer is only in Alaska in the first place to avoid an ongoing criminal investigation by police Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles and it is not long before his investigation into the Alaskan girl's murder goes horribly wrong. Troubled by his conscience and the never-ending daylight of an Alaskan summer Dormer prays for sleep.<br />For many people that have seen either of Christopher Nolan's previous two movies (Following and Memento) Insomnia may seem like an odd choice; it's a 'mainstream' Hollywood movie (Warner Brothers studio), it is told in a linear timeframe and it's a remake. However, there must have been obvious attractions apart from the budget and his paycheck. First off, Stephen Soderbergh, who successfully makes mainstream movies with an Indie heart, oversaw production and secondly there was the chance to work with great actors such as Pacino, Swank and Robin Williams, although at this point I have to add that I believe Williams was totally miscast and made an unconvincing villain.<br />There are some wonderful scenes in this movie, including a nightmare like chase over hundreds of floating logs and the hunt for the killer in a freezing fog. It is also a movie that allows it's stars to shine and this is undoubtedly Pacino's best role (and best movie for many a year) and it is a pleasant change to see him with a decent script in an intelligent movie instead of hamming it up in the likes of The Devil's Advocate, alongside walking surfboard Keanu Reeves. This movie will also undoubtedly and deservedly enhance the careers and reputations of both Director Christopher Nolan and Hilary Swank, who both produce work of depth and subtlety. However, I also feel that much of the credit for what is a beautiful photographed and well-written movie should go to Wally Pfister and (for what is an excellent adapted screenplay) to Hilary Seitz. Insomnia is an excellent movie made by a very modest, very talented young British movie Director. Be warned though, you probably need an IQ to fully appreciate it.lain.<br />There are some wonderful scenes in this movie, including a nightmare like chase over hundreds of floating logs and the hunt for the killer in a freezing fog.

B00003CXXM|4.0|First off, when I first heard that they were making a movie version of Robert Ludlum's novel, I had mixed feelings. I had read and thoroughly enjoyed the book many years ago and knew that it had been adapted into a TV movie back in 1988, with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, although I have to confess that I never did get around to seeing it for fairly obvious reasons.<br />So why the mixed feelings? Partly because, for a variety of reasons, movies rarely if ever live up to the novels on which they are based. Maybe this is because we have our own rigidly set perceptions of what the characters look like or because we are already familiar with the plot. Sometimes studios rewrite the plots of our favourite novels and the movie adaptation ends up being so dissimilar to the book that everything that was good about it has either been lost in the editing, or changed to the story's detriment.<br />In the case of The Bourne Identity, the novel is a pretty substantial affair, full of plots and sub-plots, which would be pretty hard to cram into a mere 2 hours, without making significant changes. The Bourne Identity's script was reportedly written and re-written countless times. It took two years to shoot and, during this time, Matt Damon completed two other movies (Ocean's Eleven and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron). With this kind of background it is almost a wonder that this film was ever completed and as a result pre-release expectations were none too high. However, against all odds, Doug Liman (Go, Swingers) has produced a slick and competent thriller.<br />Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac found drifting in the Mediterranean sea after being pumped full of lead and left for dead. After being rescued by a fishing boat and nursed back from to health our hero sets off from Marseille with the intention of trying to rekindle his lost memories. Along the way, much to his bemusement, he not only finds himself pursued by shadowy would-be assassins, he discovers that he has skills and instincts that suggest that he himself may also be a ruthless trained killer.<br />So cue some great action sequences; several impressive fight scenes and an excellent car chase through Paris and enough of the original novel's twists and turns to keep the audience interested. Plus, throw in Franka Potente as an interesting female lead and unwilling companion, Clive Owen and Brian Cox in good supporting performances and two hours slip seamlessly by. However, although detractors will point out that The Bourne Identity is probably not the most memorable movie you will ever see (true), it is also fair to say that this is good old fashioned Saturday night at the movies entertainment and definitely worth a watch if you are looking for something undemanding. Matt Damon, excellent in The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting as a credible action hero? Now there's a pleasant surprise and with several sequels penned by the late author Robert Ludlum, we may not have yet seen the last of Mr Bourne.that he has skills and instincts that suggest that he himself may also be a ruthless trained killer. <br />So cue some great action sequences; several impressive fight scenes and an excellent car chase through Paris and enough of the original novel's twists and turns to keep the audience interested.

0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold's autobiography, Lucky, is amazing. It's some of the best writing I've read in a very long time! I lent it to someone who'd read Lovely Bones, and she read Lucky in a weekend, returned it to me saying she was going to buy copies of it for her family members.
B000002H4C|5.0|Yes I liked this soundtrack, but I did not like the movie. I know most people would probably disagree with me about the movie, but I thought it was really boring.
B000021XS0|5.0|Well, it doesn't.  This is the greatest cd of all time.  After owning this cd for almost 2 years, I felt that it was about time I reviewed it!  I'm not going to go into detail describing every single song because there are about 500 other reviews that do just that(and besides, i could go on for days talking about each particular song).  So I'll make this review short and sweet.<br />While many think Dream Theater are a bunch of self-indulgent show offs who don't have emotion in their music, they'd be dead wrong.  Just listen to this cd.  How can anyone say The Spirit Carries On isn't emotional?  Just listen to that solo!!  Basically, if you have doubted Dream Theater in the past, get this cd!  It WILL change your opinion about them!  And the debut performance by Jordan Rudess is simply stunning, especially on tracks like One Last Time and The Dance Of Eternity.<br />After buying this cd, do yourself a favor and buy Awake.  It's their 2nd best!
B00005NKKY|5.0|Bookends is considered by many S&amp;G's finest moments and ultimate masterpiece.<br />I tend to agree and although it is not my favorite, the album is exceptional.  This album marks S&amp;G at their peak, with Simon's lyrics speaking to a nation in tracks like America, Mrs. Robinson, Hazy Shade of Winter, and Save The Life of My Child.<br />The suite on side 1 is worth the price alone.  It is S&amp;G's Sgt. Pepper.<br />Excellent!
B000002H2H|5.0|Everything that a metal fan would possibly want in an album is in this one right here.  You've got the fast and the furious tracks (Fight Fire With Fire, Creeping Death, Ride The Lightning, Trapped Under Ice), the slower and more melodic tracks (Escape, Fade To Black, For Whom The Bell Tolls), and the epic instrumental tracks (Call Of The Ktulu).  What more can a heavy metal fan ask for?  This is Metallica's finest hour (or 45 minutes) and while they came extremely close to matching the perfection on this cd with their following release, Master Of Puppets, I believe that it was missing just a tad of the raw energy contained in this disc.  If you want Metallica's best cd, here it is folks.  Get it NOW.  And while you're at it, pick up Master Of Puppets and ...And Justice For All too.  Those are almost as good.  And if you're new to Metallica, don't let everybody fool you into thinking that their 80s material was their only good material.  Their 90s material is quite good too, however, when being compared to such albums as Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets, well, they pale in comparison, just as most other cds would.  Keep metal alive and pick up this cd ASAP!
0195067142|5.0|An excellent missive about the true experience of war. From the descriptions of training and boredom to the horrific examples of human cruelty, this book states all the facts without embellishment.<br />The author moves the reader along a chronological journey bereft of all the bells and whistles that accompany some documentaries in this genre. Embedded in his brevity is a powerful message of heroism (Japanese and American), stoicism and hardship. The author honors his Japanese enemies with stories of heroism and discipline that are quite extraordinary.<br />The descriptions of decomposing corpses in the mud of Okinawa will stay with me forever. The horror that he felt is conveyed in simple, powerful prose and I will not see another war movie or read another historical documentary without recalling his words.<br />The writing style is easily readable and the message behind the story is impressive. War is hell.<br />An excellent book for anyone to read. The powerful imagery might be a bit too much for younger readers, but to not read this book would be worse.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I have heard of no doubt's pervious album, BUT Rock Steady is better and the best of all.  In this album, you can hear a lot of energy from Gwen.  All the songs are good.  My faviorite song is &quot;Running.&quot;  The lyrics in the song is excellent.  No Doubt is a great band.  Gwen's performance is increadiable.  i love her style.  She can wear anything and it will look good on her.  This album is a must have.  No Doubt about it.
1558216847|5.0|I got this book (on tape) from the library. I was having some trouble sleeping and thought that a boring book on tape would do me some good. It didn't. As I listened to it every night, I found myself staying up to hear what happened next. It turned out to be one of the best books I ever read. (I ended up actually read the book and getting \\"The Odessy\\" on tape to sleep to.)
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I have seen it 3 times, and have not tired of it. If for nothing else, buy this movie for the score. The music in the film is perfect. It uses just the right mix of lesser-known (but still recognizable) 80s and original music.<br />Whether you'll like Donnie Darko really depends on what sort of movies you like. If your idea of a good movie is something you can sit back and enjoy with a tub of popcorn, then Donnie Darko isn't for you. There is also little (really no) action in Donnie Darko. No car chases, fistfights, or major explosions. If you want a lighthearted comedy, action flick, or sappy drama, this movie will bore you to death.<br />But if you're in the mood to pay close attention and think about everything you're being shown, this is a great movie. Almost all of my friends who saw this immeadiately said \\"I need to see this movie again\\" because you really can't get it all on the first try.<br />The commentary on the DVD was interesting, but didn't really do much for me in terms of enhancing the storyline.
6305433909|4.0|This isn't a perfect film.  The movie is full of cliches, and the ending is kinda anti-climactic, but, what's wrong with cliches if they work?  This isn't for people looking for an Ingmar Bergman movie, but for people who love movies with great music. Yes, if you were under a rock when this film came out, this second Sister Act film has a killer soundtrack, which for me was better than that of the first film. The songs, especially Oh Happy Day and those songs with Lauryn Hill (her presence is electrifying) never fail to produce goosebumps. Unbelievably soulful. If you loved Fame, Flashdance, and films of the sort, this is for you. Don't listen to the critics. You'll be watching this movie over and over again and will be one of your personal favorites.
B0000028MA|4.0|The Singles soundtrack is the companion to Cameron Crowe's 1992 film and demonstrates that movie soundtracks could be marketed as excellent compilations.<br />The whole alternative/grunge scene really exploded in 1991, and for awhile Seattle was the hip, cutting edge place to be. By 1992, there was already some backlash, and Pearl Jam, Alice and Chains, Soundgarden and Mudhoney were not really fledgling bands, most of their members having paid their dues in smoky local clubs in the late 1980s. This disk is a great snapshot of Seattle in the early 1990s, with many of the songs written especially for this soundtrack. I think it's a great time capsule that holds up well even ten years later.<br />Alice and Chains starts us off with &quot;Would,&quot; a slow burn with rumbling bass, muddy guitars and haunting harmonies by Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell. Great lead-off punch.<br />&quot;Breathe&quot; by Pearl Jam follows, perhaps a cut that didn't make their debut &quot;Ten&quot; but a fine song with cool sliding basslines, dual guitar interplay and nice drum track. Eddie Vedder displays his powerful baritone and backs himself up nicely.<br />&quot;Seasons&quot; is a solo piece by Soundgarden frontman, Chris Cornell, singing with only guitar accompaniment with introspective lyrics that remind one of sitting on the wall at Kerry Park on Highland Drive and overlooking Seattle.<br />&quot;Dyslexic Heart&quot; come from non-Seattleite Paul Westerberg, who had success with the Replacements. This song is fun grunge pop, with clever lyrics, and was the theme for the character relationships in the movie. Very popular with the girls, too.<br />Cameron Crowe linked his relationship with Nancy Wilson and her Seattle roots for The Lovemongers cover of Led Zeppelin's &quot;Battle of Evermore.&quot; The guitars and mandolins have a very live feel, and Ann and Nancy's harmonies blend well.<br />&quot;Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns&quot; comes from Mother Love Bone, whose singer, Andrew Wood, was an early casualty from overdose before his band had a big breakthrough. Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam were also in this band.<br />&quot;Birth Ritual&quot; is some true metal crunch from Soundgarden, all feedback, distortion and Cornell's pipes at full throttle.<br />&quot;State of Love and Trust&quot; by Pearl Jam is a more urgent performance than &quot;Breathe&quot; and rocks harder.<br />&quot;Overblown&quot; by Mudhoney is another great rocker with brain-bashing drums, from a band that never received the national attention of many other Seattle bands, but stayed true to its course and rattled the walls of many a club.<br />&quot;Waiting for Somebody&quot; is another Paul Westerberg tune that's musically similar to &quot;Dyslexic Heart&quot; but not quite as catchy.<br />&quot;May This be Love&quot; is a somewhat obscure Jimi Hendrix tune, another homage to a Seattle hero, with some trippy guitars, vocals and lyrics.<br />&quot;Nearly Lost You&quot; is one of the sleepers here, and one of my favorites. Fantastic guitar/drum interplay and outstanding throaty vocals by Mark Lanegan. Screaming Trees were true flannel-wearing guys from the eastern Washington cow town of Ellensburg and used to play at barn parties for local school kids.<br />The disk closes with &quot;Drown&quot; by the Smashing Pumpkins, another non-Seattle band, but one that was part of the initial grunge movement, with layers of distorted guitars and Billy Corgan's trademark vocal style.<br />It's interesting to see where these groups and individual members are at now, and how the music all goes in cycles.Wood, was an early casualty from overdose before his band had a big breakthrough.

B00005JLXC|3.0|I liked this movie a lot; I have to say that before I start picking it apart. This movie had a lot going for it; it just didn't take it as far as it should have.<br /> I'm a huge Marvel Comics fan. I am fiercely loyal to the brand, and I seldom, if ever read comics published by other companies. As such, I have been very happy with the majority of movies based on Marvel titles. X-Men was fantastic, Spider-Man could have used a little more polish in the CGI arena, and Blade 2 was at least good for a laugh.<br /> Of the Marvel movies I always imagined that Daredevil would be one of the most difficult to do as a live action movie, simply because Matt Murdock is so deeply tortured, and the characters around him are so deep that it would take the perfect cast, the perfect director, and a good solid script to pull it off... the same with any other Marvel comic-turned movie. So far so, good, right?<br /> Daredevil did not have the perfect cast. While Affleck was perfect for Murdock (I know not everyone agrees, but I think he did great) and Farrell turned the cheesy villain Bullseye into something really cool, Jennifer Garner's Elektra left much to be desired... especially since she looks nothing like the comic character, not even remotely close, and as big of a fan as I am of Michael Duncan Clarke I was not impressed with him as the Kingpin, but that's the script and director's fault. I sincerely believe that this flaw in the film was the result of lacking screen time. Daredevil did to Kingpin what Star Wars did to Darth Maul.<br /> The plot was also a bit shallow in some regards. The movie did a great job in focusing on Matt Murdock, and his tortured soul, and presenting the world from his eyes... it did not do a good job of presenting the world around him from any other perspective. We do not get to know Elektra, we do not get to know Foggy, we do not get to know the Kingpin, or Bullseye. That's where this movie goes wrong.<br /> Spider-Man did a great job of allowing us to get to know both Peter Parker and Norman Osbourn, as well as Harry Osbourn, Mary Jane Watson, and even Aunt May. Spider-Man was a little on the long side, but that's a plus. I can sit through two and a half, or three, or even four hours of a good movie no problem. In contrast, Daredevil seemed too short for me, and the only hope I had by the end of the film was that they sequel wouldn't take long because I was not happy with the way the film ended, I was left hanging.<br /> I think that this movie should have left the audience, and Matt with a bit of a mystery to solve. Who was the Kingpin? Did he even exist? Elements of this mystery were there, but should have really been played upon. Perhaps we should have seen Wilson Fisk as a Philanthropist, someone that the uninitiated audience, as well as the community of the film would be shocked to find out turns out to be the Kingpin. Or at least the community of the film if we HAVE to have the interaction between Fisk, and Bullseye. Maybe Bullseye could receive emails instead just to ad to the mystery?<br /> What this movie did right was beautifully done, however. We got to know Matt Murdock very well, and for that I have to say kudos. I just wish that the movie had developed the other characters of Hell's Kitchen as well. The movie would have been a lot better that way. Instead it left me wanting.to know both Peter Parker and Norman Osbourn, as well as Harry Osbourn, Mary Jane Watson, and even Aunt May.

B000089RVX|5.0|I love the good strong vocals from the female lead.  She reminds me quite a bit of Loreena McKennitt, particularly the later tracks.
6305252572|5.0|In order to appreciate this film fully, you hafta turn yourself back in time to 1982, an' try an' remember the political an' social mindset of the day. Then imagine watching '48 HRS.' an unabashed an' raucous cop thriller that breaks the very foundation of political correctness. Now how does that make you feel? If you say, sick to your stomach, then maybe you needa loosen your jock strap an' try it again.  E'ybody knows the plot, the hard-drinkin', chain-smokin' San Francisco cop Jack Cates, played by Nick Nolte (who looks almost TOO comfortable in the role of a wasted, burn-out), is lookin' to put two recent prison escapees an' vicious cop killers away after he tried an' failed to apprehend them. In going over the case he comes across several members of their old gang an' decides to go talk to one'a the incarcerated ones. Here's where Eddie Murphy comes in. Reggie Hammond is the smooth an' dapper, fast-talking convict who convinces Cates to get him out of jail an' on the street to help him solve this case. Cates reluctantly does so, an' from there is' jus' the two of them together goin' from place to place, crook to crook, bar to bar, lead to lead, tryin' to keep from killing each other in the process. Cates is a rough-edged, semi-bigot with an apparent vendetta toward these crooks (though apparently jus' for stealing his gun), Reggie is the charming, jive-talking criminal, with a more obvious vendetta toward the crooks (they dropped the dime on him, got him locked up, an' are now tryin' to steal a half a million dollars of his hard-earned, er, um, hard-stolen cash). Both are on the same mission, but with two TOTALLY different personalities an' when they mix it up, oh, is' gunpowder. E'ybody talks about the scene with Murphy in the country-western bar playin' cop (\\"Alright listen up. I don't like white people. An' I HATE rednecks. You people're rednecks. That means I'm enjoyin' this s---.\\") an' although it is funny, my favorite scene comes right after they questionthe two ladies who were s'posedly in cahoots with the killers, when Nolte an' Murphy finally drop the trash-talkin' an' jus' have a drunken brawl in the street only to be broken up by two cops on the beat. <br />This is the original buddy cop flick. With two guys who're ironically ANYTHING but buddies. Depending on the way you've come up watching movies, this one will either be a wonderfully offensive cop thriller, or a horribly offensive cop thriller. Of course, no matter how you look at it, '48 HRS.' will forever be a hallmark, because it was one'a the first movies of its kind: a rough-edged, blatant politically-incorrect film centering on characters that are so sleazy at times you hafta force yourself to like them, an' revolving around racial stereotypes an' sexist banter thas' thrown around like it's nothing, not to mention some brutal violence. Now it'd be much harder to overlook all the coldness if it wasn't for the charm an' appeal of Eddie Murphy, in his film debut. He is the main reason to watch the flick, although Nolte's character also provides the perfect counterbalance. Directed by Walter Hill, '48 HRS.' set a new standard for the way action flicks were to be played for the rest of the 1980s. With laughs, wit, chemistry, an' a not-so-serious attitude set against a very serious backdrop.
B000001EUP|4.0|The album has some frantic hard rocking tunes like \\"Blackout\\", \\"Now\\" and \\"Dynamite\\"; some melodic rockers in the shape of \\"Can't live without you\\", and softer tracks like \\"No one like you\\" and \\"You give me all I need\\". You also get a good typical Scorpions ballad in \\"When the smoke goes down\\" (a formula the band used several times later). All in all, this is a good rock album and it's not as commercialized or polished as the following \\"Love at first sting\\". This reminds of a time long gone by and it's a pleasure re-living the past, when heavy metal was king on the mountain.
B00003CXIP|4.0|\\"Stand by Me\\" is a coming-of-age story about four boys on the verge of adolescence and junior high school, who go on a journey to see a dead body. The movie was based on the Stephen King novella \\"The Body\\" and directed by Rob Reiner, who also did King's \\"Misery\\" for the screen. This is a very faithful adaptation of a King story, and much of the dialogue came straight from the book.<br />What makes this film really great is the interaction, chemistry and performances of the four young actors. Gordy LaChance is the college-bound writer/dreamer, played by Wil Wheaton (who went on to become Wesley Crusher in Star Trek: TNG) with some great facial expressions and moments of vulnerable emotion and inner strength. Chris Chambers is the rebellious bad boy, but smart and athletic, played by a very young River Phoenix (whose promising career was tragically cut short) with strength and wisdom beyond his years. Gordy and Chris are the characters who grow the most during the adventure. Gordy's older brother Dennis (played in cameo scenes by John Cusack) died earlier in the year, so he in going to view the body, he is unknowingly looking for some closure to that event. Chris is at a crossroads where he can either \\"take shop and make birdhouses with the other retards\\" or take the harder classes with Gordy.<br />Teddy DuChamp is the psycho and dramatic kid, played by Corey Feldman, who had a productive child actor career. Teddy's relationship with the father who burned his ear on a hot stove is the key to his experience during a confrontation at the junkyard.<br />Rounding out the group is Vern, the dim fat kid played by Jerry O'Connell, who of the four has changed considerably as an adult and continues to build a decent acting career.<br />The film is very nostalgic, with its portrayal of small town life in the 1950s, treehouses, corner drug stores, and woods for exploring. Along the journey, there are a number of adventures, such as train dodges, a run-in with mean old Milo Pressman and his dog Chopper at the junkyard, a swamp full of leeches, and a night spent in the woods with howling coyotes. Interspersed with these sequences are moments of reflection and kids being kids, with weighty topics discussed like \\"superman vs. mighty mouse\\" and the importance of cherry flavored pez.<br />The main outer conflict is with a group of high school age boys, led by a villain named Ace and played menacingly by Kiefer Sutherland. There are two key sequences involving Gordy and Chris and Ace, and to a lesser extent, Chris' older brother \\"Eyeball\\" Chambers.<br />Funny and poignant, this is a great film about the brotherhood of boys, and was even referenced by Michael Gurian in his book \\"The Wonder of Boys\\" as a recommended film to watch with your young son to view positive examples of young male relationships. My caveat to parents would be that there is a lot of profanity and vulgar boy talk.man and his dog Chopper at the junkyard, a swamp full of leeches, and a night spent in the woods with howling coyotes.

B00005AQE8|5.0|Fresh out of jail the infamous Tupac Shakur recorded his latest and first double album &quot;All Eyes On Me&quot;.  Filled with anger, pain, sadness and relief this two disc cd is pure gold to its listener.  2pac was not just another gangster rapper, his music still lives on years after his passing for a reason.  Nobody spoke pain and struggle better then this man, and it breathes through his music.  Whether you live in the suburbs or on the streets there's at least one song that will speak to you.  Lets not forget pac can make you get up and dance aswell.  I wont speak on the track listing because almost every song on this album is solid.  Don't take my word for it however, buy any Tupac release or read &quot;The rose that grew from concrete&quot; and enter the mind of a soldier.  RIP TUPAC SHAKUR
B000001FN8|3.0|\\"Savage amusements\\" from 1988, is the last good album from Scorpions. After this one it all started to fall down very fast and the band hit rock bottom some years later with the dreadful \\"Face the heat\\". On \\"Savage amusement\\", Scorpions continued their commercial direction from \\"Love at first sting\\" but the material is a lot weaker. Maybe the guys tried too hard to make a similar and equally successful follow up, I don't know...<br />I believe it will take a miracle to get Scorpions back on track again. While waiting for that miracle, we can at least find comfort in past albums from these German rockers!
B00003CX8U|4.0|Have only seen this on the Big Screen but was riveted. It's like a traffic accident, you can't look away. A mans road to self destruction set to great music.
B000005JA8|1.0|But bad art is worse than good non-art music.  This is the worst kind of art in the world: pretentious, inane, and poorly performed.  Give me music over art if this is what art looks like.  If you want something difficult but beautiful, listen to Sigur Ros or GYBE or Men's Recovery Project or pretty much anything else.  This is difficult and painful, with no payoff whatsoever.
0446605409|4.0|This was my first Nelson DeMille, aside from having seen the movie The General's Daughter, and I will now look to his books when I want page turning suspense. <br />The protagonist in this book is John Corey, a NYC cop who is on leave because of gunshot wounds. He is at his uncle's beach house relaxing when a nearby friend calls to him for advicw in the mysterious murder of a local couple, who happen to be friends of John's. <br />The deceased couple worked on Plum Island, known for the conduction of biohazardous and chemical research. While most detectives believe the case is related to the Gordon's discovering and then trying to steal and sell a vaccine, Corey follows another idea, that of pirates and hidden treasures.<br />Paralleling information about both Plum Island and the legends of pirates makes this book an interesting read in addition to its level of suspense. Corey is an interesting character full of cynicism and wit. <br />My only complaint is that sometimes the book is a bit wordy, and could have been edited down a lot. Regardless, if you want a fast paced, good suspense novel, don't hesitate to pick up Plum Island. You won't put it down!
0312265859|2.0|I've read all eight Stephanie Plum novels (in order), so clearly I got hooked early on.  They are funny, clever, quick reading.  Janet Evanovich has a gift for writing quirky (if annoying) characters and laugh-out-loud dialogue.  However, Stephanie makes the same lame mistakes from one book to another, and usually within the same book.  It is frustrating to see ineptitude over and over again, and I began to wonder what the men in her life see in her.  Someone once said that what a man really wants in a woman is competence, which Stephanie seems stubbornly determined not to acquire.<br />I may have spoiled the fun for myself somewhat by reading Joshua Armstrong's excellent \\"The Seekers,\\" about his true exploits as a tough yet compassionate bounty hunter in New Jersey.  Nah--I'm just tired of seeing the same old dumb behavior, with no learning curve in sight.  It's been fun,  but I want Stephanie to gracefully retire.
0812550757|5.0|Okay, so everyone who has read Ender's Game expects this sequel to include the same action, same tension, same overall feel of that book.  The thing is, you'll have to spend more time with this book, accept that nothing really remains from the original book, then love this one for what it is.<br />Ender's found a way to stay in hyperspace and time passes...3000 years, to be exact.  In that time, a lot has changed, except Ender.  He is not a hero anymore, he is Ender the Xenocide, the killer of the buggers, and everything humans do not want to be.  Or so they think.<br />He is also the Speaker for the Dead, someone who tells the story of a dead person's real life.  This book is deep, covers a lot about humanity, and it really goes forward on a pace that is quite addictive once you get into it.<br />If you've read Ender's Game, this is a must-have.  Even if you haven't, this book opens doors to the human condition many writers stay away from.  I think, if you can cast aside expectations, you will love this.
0805062971|1.0|I thought this book was pretty bad to be honest. I didn't like the story line and I didn't like the way the author wrote the book. He goes from one thing to another without really explaining anything in detail. The book is basically about the main character that suffers from insomnia, which is someone who cannot sleep. He goes to support groups in churches and halls for diseases he does not even suffer from. He goes to cancer groups and any other group that was there at the time. He went only to feel loved and liked someone cared and so he could feel comfortable letting his feelings show. Then he meets a woman named Marla. He does not like Marla because she is there for the same reason he is and he does not want to be found out. So he makes a deal with her for him to go on certain days to certain groups and she would do the same. He meets a man named Tyler Durden who makes and sells soap. They started a club where people go to let out frustration and anger. In this club they fight each other but have nothing against each other and they do not get paid. They come up with this project mayhem thing. Which is them doing things that they think will help the world be a better place. I give this book one out of five stars.
B000002KD5|5.0|ok, so im what, 15 years old and i wasnt even ALIVE when this band were around together, but that can no way stop me from saying that this record is completely amazing. Fleetwood Mac are a unique band and their blend of vocals is amazing, stevie nicks has to be my favourite out of them all, although christines vocals on Say You Love Me are fantastic. I love this record, and many many people do.<br />The best songs in my opinion are Rhiannon and of course Landslide, why i dont know, thats what makes them so great. I prefer this EP to Rumours. The music is very comforting in a way, its kinda sad too, but it is just lovely, a little bit funky here and acoustic there, its a perfect mix.<BR>This is a special CD and theres something about it that makes me love it. It's definately one that everyone should have in their collection because it's one that everyone likes, theres something for everyone in it (believe me, i like artists from Joni Mitchell to Black Sabbath and its still in my top 10favourite cds). <BR>And to all the kids out there, this band are not uncool just cause your dad listens to them, they are great musicians and have made great music over the years. ok, so i wont go on too much, but really, you wont be disappointed by this record, it is a true classic even now, 25 years on.

0780627024|5.0|Pleasantville, is a place where everything is pleasant and perfect. The main characters are David and Jen. David is very shy around girls, Jen doesn't like to study, both of them fought over the remote control then, they got in Pleasantville where everything is perfect. Their new names are Bud and Mary Sue.<br />At first, Jen/Mary Sue gets mad because they're in Pleasantville. They see everything perfect, Bud works in a ice cream shop. Mary Sue is popular in Pleasantville. This guy named Skip likes her. One day, Mary Sue and Skip, they went to the ice cream shop. Then they left the shop. They went to the lover's lane. Bud was afraid that might do something that might change Pleasantville. Mary Sue teaches Skip how to have sex. Then that same night as Skip drives home, he sees color.<br />Things start changing in Pleasantville. The basketball loses the game to another team. More people in the lover's lane start to make love. Bud is afraid that things will get worse. Then people start to appear in color and some people agree with that. Mary Sue tells her mom about sex. Then things start to change between Bud's parents. David/Bud changes colors when he punches the guy who was bothering his mom. Mary Sue changes color when she starts to study and to read. Finally it looked like the people in Pleasantville agreed to be in color. It was time to go home for David and Jen, but then only one that left was David, Jen stayed because she wanted to study there. One interesting theme from this movie is that it was better when David and Jen changed the old Pleasantville into a better Pleasantville.<br />By: Jesus Ortiz
6305308659|1.0|\\"Pleasantville\\"<br /> The name of the movie we watch was called Pleasantville, it all starts with this family whose they have a broken home, the main characters are David and Jen, Jen is a wild girl she likes to go out and party, on the other hand there is David who is a big fan of this black and white TV show, which is called Pleasantville where everything is basically pleasant (this show starts at 6:30).<br /> Jen has a date at exact same time as the show starts well, its 6:30 and they are both coming down stairs, David to watch his TV show and Jen to meet her date, David turns on the TV and his sister starts telling him to go upstairs, because her date could be there at any minute. They start arguing the remote is being thrown around and accidentally breaks, but by coincidence there is a TV repairman outside.<br />He gives them a weird looking remote control that takes them into the TV and they've become part of the show Pleasantville, everything is changed his family is real polite towards David or should I say \\"Bud\\" everything is black and white, but Jen is still the same wild girl, her new name is Mary Sue and that's when the whole big deal starts happening.
B00007GRCG|4.0|Kylie Minogue has accomplished a lot during the past year and a half.  She toured a good pop concert, received generally positive reviews for &quot;Fever&quot;, sold millions of copies of it, and broke into the States with her biggest hit &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot;, the previous hits being the late 80s SAW (Stock, Aitken, Waterman) cheese pop of &quot;Loco-Motion&quot; and &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot;.<br />The Hyper Edition is an almost complete culmination of the material from her &quot;Fever&quot; era.  Released in Japan, CD 1 contains the original album, plus four b-sides.  It's polished, inoffensive, Euro, electro-pop.  Although it's slickness can wear thin clocking in at over an hour.<br />CD 2 is the reason to buy this package.  It contains three mixes of &quot;Head&quot;, two of &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, two for &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;, and the brilliant electroclash take on &quot;Come Into My World&quot;, remixed by none other than Fischerspooner.  The featured b-sides &quot;Whenever You Feel Like It&quot; and &quot;Tightrope&quot; are some of the best songs to come from this era (even better than some of the album songs).<br />All four videos for &quot;Head&quot;, &quot;Sight&quot;, &quot;Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Come Into My World&quot; are found on CD 2.  Directed by the talents of Johan Renck, Michel Gondry, and Dawn Shadforth, each video is a nice companion to the appropriated song.<br />Record companies are known for milking fans for their money, and &quot;Fever&quot; has many &quot;editions&quot;.  This is the best one hands down.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first major label disc from this as of now unknown Arkansas group is the finest offering of female oriented rock i've yet to hear in the States. Amy Lee's powerful vocals remind me of Christina Scabbia or Anneke v. Giersbergen's less restrained moments. The string and choir sections scream After Forever. Fans of great music that isn't commercial pop cookie-cutter garbage or the aforementioned groups take heed. There's not a dud track on this disc. Imagine Linkin Park with Lacuna Coil in a blender and you have a good idea of whats going on here. I'd love to see this band make a HUGE splash in the U.S. so that other great chick fronted bands may get some deserved notice. Truely a great listen.
0780623703|5.0|Movie review of Pleasantville<br /> The story begins when David and his sister Jen are fighting over the remote control and than one minute later they were in the TV. In Pleasantville and everything in Pleasantville is perfect .There is no rain and no bad days and everything is very perfect.<br /> Later on in Pleasantville David and his sister name are changed. His name is bud and his sisters name is Mary Sue and everything in Pleasantville is black and white. Later on some things start to change in Pleasantville.<br /> In Pleasantville nobody knows about sex until Jen has sex with her boyfriend Skip and then all the young people start to have sex with each other. Everything in Pleasantville starts to become in color and David goes home and his sister goes to college. And then everything in Pleasantville is normal like in other places and now the roads go on and on and they never finish.<br />The End <br />Edwin Yanes
0783226063|2.0|This movie, while it doesn't live up to the book's magnificance, is better in many ways than Harrison's series. Both adaptations have their good points and bad ones, but they're also complete opposites. If the good points of both films were put together, you'd have a damn near perfect Dune adaptation.<br />There isn't any one field to point out (audio, characters, acting, etc.) flaws in, because they all have contrasts. For example, the actress for Jessica was playing her beautifully. She's exactly how I imagined her and then some when I read the books. Paul, on the other hand, is much too old to be protraying a teenage kid. He also suffers from that 80's Hair Mop syndrome that was popular back then (a lot of the characters did, actually. They should have changed the styles for the characters).<br />The next flaw is the music. Toto?? Come ON already. The composed music was actually not bad at all... the Harkonnen themes were supportively eerie sounding. But the Wormride sequence music was just.... blech.<br />While the costumes were generally on target, the Stillsuits looked ridiculous. I guess they tried to make them look less primitive and more high-tech. The Stillsuits are supposed to have hoods, cloaks and full face masks, not hospital nose-tubes. The cloaks are supposed to help the Fremen blend in with their environment. The black ones make them look like a herd of...hospital life support escapees wearing 80's mops and tight black jumpsuits.<br />While the Harkonnens were rather...... interesting, they didn't match up to the book. But for some reason I found the Baron entertaining to watch. His antics gave off a good sense of psychotic atmosphere, and the Baron was definitely supposed to be psychotic. But he wasn't supposed to be a naked, flying fat man covered in fungus. I liked Harrison's version a bit better. They appeared more sophistocated, but in a deadly way. This is how they were meant to appear. Picture a combination of Romans' sophistocated brutalityand dark, industrial machinery. This would be the Harkonnens as Herbert intended. And the HEARTPLUGS?? Don't get me started on those... they were a bad idea from the start. Herbert himself even agreed! I'm glad Harrison left them out.<br />And Alia... oooh man she was just CREEPY. I mean, sure she was supposed to be intimidating, but in a POWERFUL sense! Not in a Stephen King sense! She actually would have done fine, if they just used HER voice intead of that shrill, overdone voice-over.<br />\\"with many Fremen waaaariorrrrrs!\\" This line of dialog made me shiver, it sounded so weird....<br />Well the bottom line is that the movie isn't up to par with the book, but then again, Harrison's isn't much better.... if you REALLY have to pick one of these (I don't recommend either one, really), i'd go with Harrison's version. At least it's more complete and is less obscure in it's storytelling than this one is.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Norah Jones has a nice voice, very reminiscent of Rickie Lee Jones however, I didn't find any tunes which I found that memorable. In fact, There weren't any tracks which were medium to up in tempo. All tracks were very much the same in style and presentation. Maybe she should take a lesson from Rickie Lee Jones on how to groove. Grammies have become a disgrace in recognizing true talent, maybe they need some holes drilled in their ears.

If you are going to learn something why not learn it from the master. Arnold is a very smart guy and his writing style is engaging and easy to read.  You do not have to be preparing for competition in order to get great value and advise from Arnold's instruction. Anyone who want's to get involved with a body building program should read this book before you lift a single weight!
B000089RVX|5.0|I have been eagerly looking forward to the release of this CD since i heard their first song, bring me to life. I came across bring me to life by accident and am glad I did! The cd is amazing. Her voice is absolutly beautiful and fits beautifuly with the melodies and harmonies. The CD is wonderful and i would recommend it to ANYONE who wants to listen to something original and unique.
B00000IREA|4.0|Yes, camp and lots of eye candy, if you're into ultrasexy young nymphettes floating around in cush love-den space pads. The opening credits set the tone and are rightly memorable, but for me the zenith of the film is right after Fonda has broken the Orgasmatron and she just sizzles in ecstasy. Whoa. Makes me wish I were around when this movie came out... oh, and that I had the necessary fame and fortune to date this chick. Oh well, her loss, poor thing.
B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee's melodic voice combined with edgy guitar riffs creates an original sound that works surprisingly well on this debut album. In the midst of all the rap/metal and Nickleback sound-alikes, Evanescence is a real stand-out. First, because there are so few females in the male dominated rock industry and second because her voice is just so haunting and powerful that it follows you. It's like Sarah McLachlan meets Linkin Park. There's that same eerie, poetic melody, but with a sound you can rock to instead of lull you to sleep. I've read several people make references to Tori Amos, but I just don't see it, other than they're both females. If anything, this album is more reminiscent of POE. If you like &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, the song that's been getting tons of airplay, you'll like this album. &quot;Going under&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet&quot; are more of the same, while &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Haunted&quot; feature that powerful voice minus the guitars. I highly recommend this CD!
B000002U82|5.0|I don't know what I can add anything that hasn't already been said about this landmark album.  It would definately be one of my &quot;desert island&quot; CDs.  I was introduced to it in college (89-93) and it will always be one of my favorite Floyd albums, thus...one of my all-time favorites as well.  If by chance you don't own this album, I recommend running out and getting it right now, no matter what your musical tastes.<br />To correct another reviewer...he said to start the disc while watching the Wizard of Oz when Dorothy appears in Oz.<br />I believe the best way to sync them up is to start the CD during the MGM lion's third roar.  Turn up the music, down the lights and enjoy....
B00006L7XQ|5.0|keeping it short - a great album...melodic, simple, and sad. mr. cash has a way of putting things that seem more true to him then any listeners. his tone, his finger picking are what is important - the money earned over the years and his appearence is irrelevant to the value of the artist. he never once says how much money he has made and he is obviously aware of his physical features - album covers prove it. all in all - highly recommended with 5+ stars
B00005RY7X|5.0|\\"I Get Wet\\" is one of the greatest albums of our time. No theme, no big story behind it, just good, hard metal music. This album is for anyone who looks at life as something that is meant to be lived with as many good times as possible.<br />It's also a major pick me up. If you're feeling ..., after slapping this baby into the cd player, after a few seconds, you can't help but smile and sing along to the catchy beats and words.
B00005ARDC|5.0|This group is incredible!!!  Their first album is great.  They are so high energy and at the same time mellow.  This cd is great. All the songs are good, each one for a different reason.  Songs like Love Burns, Red eyes and tears, Whatever Happened to my Rock'N'Roll, Rifles, Awake, and As sure as the Sun will leave you blown away.  This is awsome for anyone who is a fan of rock music.  You need this cd.
B00005JL96|5.0|I was impressed and amazed by the animation. It showed togetherness, acceptance and love. These are three key items we all search for and need. Parents, sit down and enjoy this one as a family.
B00008IAMD|5.0|That proclamation is no small statement in a year when great albums were released by George Harrison, Tom Petty, and Dave Matthews among others, this cd however tops them all. From brilliant new compositions such as &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; to stunning covers like &quot;Hurt&quot;, from traditional classics like &quot;Danny Boy&quot; to popular songs of decades now past such as &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot; Johnny Cash even at the age of 70 years young continues to make wonderful music. When Johnny Cash covers a song he does not replay it as much as he reinvents it, and stamps his signature on it. There are many great moments in this albums 52+ minutes &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; is one of those moments, where Johnny takes the 1989 electronic Depeche Mode song and strips it down to an accoustic guitar, (played by Red Hot Chili Pepper John Frusicante)a piano, (played by Billy Preston)and a slide guitar and The man in blacks voice of reason. A personal highlight for myself was &quot;In My Life&quot; the Beatle classic sung with a heart that has seen 70 years of living and plans on seeing quite a bit more. The album closes with &quot;the whole Cash gang&quot; joining Johnny for &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; and if you don't get chills in your spine when everyone joins in on the chorus you may not bleed red. With the addition of the dvd single featuring the incredibly moving video for &quot;Hurt&quot; (which is worth the purchase price alone) makes a great album even better.
B000000WA4|5.0|This is the Smashing Pumpkins best album. Siamese Dream is a close second, but this blows it away. I love it when rock bands put out two disc albums like this one, because it allows you to get a much grander and larger experience out of the music. Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness is the only album that lets you hear all the sides of the Smashing Pumpkins. Great hard rocking tracks like \\"Zero\\", \\"Bodies\\", \\"XYU\\", and \\"An Ode to No One\\" push you off the edge, while songs like \\"To Forgive\\", \\"1979\\", and \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" fill you with that bittersweet feeling only Billy Corgan can bring. This album is very dimensional and has a broad spread of emotions. I definently recommend this 2 CD album to anyone who wants to know what truly great music is.
0780623703|3.0|Movie review<BR>(Pleasantville)<br /> The movie it's about a perfect world, which is interrupted by a boy and his sister (who were not perfect).<br /> The perfect world was called Pleasantville and at first it was a TV show but magically these two guys get in it.  They tried to live just like the other persons in Pleasantville but they couldn't, because they were humans so they give up, and made the people from Pleasantville think the way they thought.  That change make the people from Pleasantville looked like real humans.<br />I'll classify the movie as comedy-fiction because sometimes it was funny and fiction because there were some things uncommon and unreal in the movie.<br />Gustavo Sanchez
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is one of those albums that you just need. It's a necessity of life, plain and simple. Of course, this album has &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; on it, the one song everybody has heard, but Nevermind opens a door to several other songs that, in my opinion, are just as good if not better. This album proves that Nirvana is a strong band, with smart lyrics and awesome rock music. You can't help but listen to this album a million times. It's like a painting that you see something different in every time you look at it. Get this CD if you don't already have it. It's worth whatever you have to pay to get it.
0316096199|4.0|This book opens with a terribly vivid description of the rape and beating Sebold endured as a freshman at Syracuse. Is it possible to say I liked such a book? Can you like a book that frightens you, challenges you and makes you fearful of modern America? I was riveted-maybe that's a more apt description. Sebold's writing is captivating, as is the story of the aftermath of the rape, including her attempt to prosecute the rapist. <br />Lucky mostly deals with the very complicated business of getting on with your life after such a life-changing event. How do you act after a rape? How do people treat you? These are some the questions Sebold answers, and they are not easy answers. At the end of the book, you don't get the feeling that she's \\"over it,\\"-not by a long shot, but you do get the feeling that there is hope. So you won't finish this book feeling totally despondent and helpless, but you won't exactly feel good.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence (Phillip Noyes, 2002)<br />If Rabbit-Proof Fence is not the best film of 2002, it's certainly within the top three, and missed 'best' by a short nose. Noyce, who is known for directing junk, not to put too fine a point on it,(Patriot Games, Sliver, Clear and Present Danger, et al), gives us his first good film since all the way back in 1989, when he took the boating scene from The Talented Mr. Ripley and turned it into the brilliant Dead Calm.<br />Rabbit-Proof Fence is the story of three racially mixed girls, Molly (the hauntingly beautiful Everlyn Sampi in her screen debut, which has already garnered her at least one Best Actress nod), her sister Daisy (Tianna Sanbury, also a newcomer), and their cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan, and you know the refrain by now). Pitted against them is, well, all of Australian white society, and a select few aborigines as well. The three girls are taken from their home in Jigalong and sent to the Moore River camp for girls, sort of a twisted Outback version of a finishing school for indentured servants. The head of the camp (and then, through the magic of cinema, the voice of Australian white society) is Neville 'the Devil,' played by Kenneth Branagh. Despite Neville's veneer of civility, and the complexity of his feelings for aborigines ('just because they use Neolithic tools does not mean they have Neolithic minds,' he says to an assistant at one point during the film), the girls see through this façade right quick and decide to walk home, a journey of some twelve hundred mile across the Australian outback. In order to do so, they have to follow the rabbit-proof fence of the film's title, erected in the outback to keep the plagues of (British-imported) rabbits away from the farmlands.<br />The first fifteen minutes of Rabbit-Proof fence are some of the most difficult footage to watch ever filmed; Noyce's camera angles and rapid cuts are disturbingly effective during the scenes leading up to the removal of Molly and her cohorts. Horror film aficionados in the audience will immediately recognize the camerawork as a pastiche of trickery first pioneered by George A. Romero (the blindingly fast cuts are a trademark of Dawn of the Dead, and anyone who's ever seen night of the Living Dead will recognize the car-interior perspective of people beating on the windows from early in that film). So, perhaps, Noyce has learned something from his time in America. Too bad he didn't use it when making The Saint.<br />The film calms down from there, but stays on an emotionally high pitch throughout even when the pace slows down. The last hour of the film almost has to be slow by definition; it's hard to keep a pace up when your main plot point is three girls walking for over a thousand miles.<br />Perhaps the best thing about Rabbit-Proof fence is that Noyce doesn't take the easy way out and turn this into a road movie. The trek isn't used as an excuse for us to watch long scenes of the three girls bonding by firelight, nor are we given long intercut scenes of what's happening in the world around them (they pick up news of pursuit from people they encounter along the way, but cut scenes of their pursuers, and Neville's reaction to the continuing frustration of same, are kept mercifully short throughout). As a result, the movie runs barely over ninety minutes, which is just about what it should be. Noyce gives the material the necessary amount of time to tell the story, and not more.<br />Absolutely stunning. A must-see film for those who rightly believe there's something wrong with the Academy's heads for nominating the tripe they did for the Academy Awards this year. **** ½and her cohorts.

The Mel Torme jokes sounded stale but maybe they were for europeans ?  The pinto joke was still good and the motorcycle hair sticking out straight backwards makes me die with laughter.  And the happy cow in boots is classic !  (^:<br />Jonathan M.
B00004S875|4.0|This is a good album.  The transfer to the SACD was pretty good, but not as good as the transfer for The Stranger.  Hence I am giving it a 4.  On the Stranger, you can hear the strums of the guitars very clearly, not quite as much on this one.  It still sounds better than the normal release, but not as good as some of the other SACD releases out there.<BR>Also, I think I like the songs on the Stranger better.  They were more personal.

B00005OAIE|1.0|I guess after so many years of being force-fed bland, derivative pop product on the radio, I now just instinctively know when I'm being scammed.  That was how I felt the very first time I heard \\"No Such Thing\\" on the radio.  Even though the song was being played on a station that specializes in supposedly more sophisticated, adult, Boomer-oriented fare, I was able to instantly recognize \\"No Such Thing\\" as faux-adult music, dropped ever-so-slyly into the mix.  The line \\"I want to run through the halls in high school\\" was all I needed to hear.  Running in the halls at school - OOOOHHH, you're so BAD dude!  Since John Mayer makes fake alternative music, naturally he's got to throw a dash of fake rebelliousness into his lyrics to give them just that bit of \\"edge\\" that supposedly will appeal to the slightly kooler Kool Kids, but not be so shocking or controversial that it might turn off the Wal-Mart shoppers (and their parents).  That line sounds like it was written by a marketing committee, and so does the rest of the album (make it sound like Dave Matthews, but \\"skew younger,\\" and throw in some jazz chords to fool the hep-cat, older Boomer DJs).  Give me a break.  It's because of tripe like this that nobody listens to the radio anymore.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence snagged me with 'Bring me to life' because unlike the other tripe on the radio, this was really good.  If you liked Switchblade Symphony, I think this is where they would be if they hadn't broken up.  The compositions are just awesome and, also somewhat unique is the fact that every song on the CD is great.  There's no filler here.  If you don't already have it, you have to pick it up.  You won't regret it.
B00005JM1D|4.0|So this film is dumb, unambitious, very silly, not at all challenging, tacky, gratuitous, sick and occasionally gross. (I could've gone my whole life without seeing Will Ferrell naked - thank you very much.)<br />It's very funny. Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson are clearly having fun with the film, which is fun in the vein of dumb fraternity movies like \\"Animal House,\\" though it's not as good as that.<br />The plot's nonsense. A bunch of thirtysomething guys trying to recapture their lost youth in the face of maturity and commitment decide to fly in the face of all that by starting a fraternity, though none of them are enrolled in college. They run afoul of the nerdy dean, who vows to get them kicked off campus. It's all fairly standard-issue stuff.<br />But the film goes for all the laughs it can get and manages to get quite a few of them.
B0000646UN|2.0|The story of Finland's resistance and stalemate against Russia is a true story and the film does justice to the story.  Unfortunately, the quality of the VHS tape is terrible - fuzzy, grainy,distorted.  Like the poor quality you would get from a multiple generation copied home video that was the final copy of all the generational copies made (copy of a copy of a copy, etc.).  What is really unfortunate is the DVD is equally bad, apparently just a DVD copy of the already bad VHS tape.  The Belle &amp; Blade Studios who market the VHS/DVD did a real dis-service to everyone who buys the product.<br />The action scenes and story line is above average and at times can be truly gut-wrenching.  The sub-titles are frequently in rather bad or garbled English (the film is in Finnish)and were obviously translated by a person who had poor command of the English language.  The sub-titles cannot be disabled as they are part of the film.  I just wish the VHS/DVD copy was better in quality - I can put up with the sub-titles.

B00006LLNU|2.0|I hope this album is not an indication that Sigur Ros have already peaked, but Agaetis Byrjunwas a LOT better. I really like Sigur Ros, and I really tried to like this album, but I don't (very much). Sounds like they've run out of steam musically. And repeating the same (made up) lyric throughout the whole album? Even when relieved of the constraint that lyrics need to make sense, the best they could come up with was &quot;u sigh&quot; (repeat ad nauseum). Agaetis Byrjun had heart, () sounds like they want to be Godspeed You Black Emperor. And failed.

1577311523|4.0|Having approached this book with a healthy degree of skepticism but also intrigue (for it's really popular) I had the critic's knives sharpened and ready for carving.<br />Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to let this animal live. The Power of Now represents one of those books that is not one of the heavy hitting intellectually stellar works on my shelf but the book serves a real purpose and benefits people. Here's why: Getting through the labyrinthine texts of Buddhism and Mysticism, translating it for Westerners in a meaningful way and serving it up in a manner that is easily digestible requires a lot of work. The modern book buyer is often too impatient to pursue the wonderful titles by Alan Watts, which in a more poetic way pretty much say everything that is said in \\"Now,\\" and more. Most people do not have time for that. They want an easy-to-get, nicely presented work that IS EASY TO READ.<br />Yes, that is scary in a sense, but as long as they are getting good ideas, should we hold it against them? I don't think so. If they weren't reading this, it may be something their favorite talk show host recommended which turns out to be far worse. Imagine a book on enlightenment according to Benny Hinn! At least Tolle is a likable and believable chap.<br />Tolle serves up the \\"Thou Art That\\" motif in an easy to assimilate language and a palatable question/ answer format that renders a \\"communicate the basic idea\\" style.<br />Personally, I prefer the edgier works such as \\"Undoing Yourself\\" by Hyatt. However, the reality is that someone buys a book in an airport and wants a nugget of divine wisdom served up with the peanuts. This work is perfect for them.<br />While babysitting the nephews, I removed this copy from my relative's bookshelf and began to flip through its pages. It is perfect when you have a kid on one arm and limited attention to devote to a book. The ideas are straightforward (and despite some new age mumbo jumbo from time to time) are communicated with a decent flair for writing. No harm done.<br />One comes away with the knowledge that \\"enlightenment champions\\" take many forms and they're not always heavy weight.ent flair for writing.

B00005B36H|5.0|The band Tool has always been a talented mix of rock, metal, and obscurity with their seductive and melodic yet bludgeoning riffs and poetic lyrics of life and angst, but their true genius shows on `Lateralus'. By broadly expanding their musical horizons Tool has created a very complex and alluring album that - quite simply put - is one of the greatest albums of all time. From the opening minutes of \\"The Grudge\\" to the strange closer \\"Fiaap de Oiad\\" (a distorted two and a half minute clip from Art Bell's radio show) you can tell that Tool has matured into a band that is beyond words. Maynard's vocals are as beautiful as ever, but on `Lateralus' the focus is on the music more than Maynard's voice, thus creating an epic aural landscape. Adam Jones surpasses that of the normal guitarist / composer by writing and playing such intricate riffs and music. How the found the time to write such an epic album - the tracks average out at over six minutes, but that is only because the three interludes (\\"Eon Blue Apocalypse\\" (1:04), \\"Mantra\\" (1:12), and \\"Fiaap de Oiad\\" (2:49)).<BR>Crushing the likes of Dream Theater with this album and truly separating themselves for the rest of the metal genre, `Lateralus' contains some the best written songs of the past twenty years. Starting off with a track like \\"The Grudge\\" was perfect, it symbolized Tool at their best with its melodic introduction the to its crushing finale, a great track. After the excellent and - for the most part - melodic next few tracks (\\"The Patient\\" and \\"Schism\\") you hit the combo of \\"Parabol / Parabola\\". \\"Parabol\\" being a fairly ambiguous and melodic track gets you ready for the - for lack of a better term - \\"balls-to-the-wall\\" sound of \\"Parabola\\", it perfectly embodies them at their heavy points. My favorite track on `Lateralus' is the title track. The introduction to this nine and a half minute epic (though a long song, it is an effortless listen) is absolutely mind blowing, by what makes it so great it the ending. The technically insane guitars, the emotionally charged drums and bass, and the screaming of \\"Spiral out, keep going\\" just personifies the perfect song. `Lateralus' is an album like no other. Its sheer brilliance is matched by few if any and the whole feel of the album is truly an experience that you will not soon forget. I you do not own this album I suggest you pick it up, listen to it, and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I did. This is the essence of music captured on a disc, absolutely stunning.
0671015206|4.0|A good read, but filled with many statistics that are skewed by a small sample of millionaires.  I enjoyed the direction the authors took to describe the LIFESTYLES of the wealthy compared to the spendthrift.  I did have a problem with a general overtone of the author's message, that the wealthy are so preoccupied with frugality that they don't enjoy a premium lifestyle.  I just don't buy it.  Where were the stat's on vacations, perks, education, etc?  <br />Worth the read to develop a different perspective, but don't bank on the stats that drive all its suggestions; however, the book was very well researched for its small sample.

1573229725|4.0|Fingersmith is a good book filled with twists and surprises that keep the reader interested. Set in Victorian England, the story is about a family-like group of thieves, fingersmiths, that deal in everything from stolen goods to babies and a household involved in shady activities.  In particular, the story is about how the lives of two innocent young women are affected by the greed and deception of those they depend on.<br />  Susan is my favorite character.  I feel sympathetic towards her and I like the way her character grows.  Although reared by and among thieves, Susan maintains her trustworthy innocence until a very dirty trick is played on her and she becomes tough and determined.<br />  Just as the plot becomes dull and predictable, Sarah Waters injects a twist or surprise that catches the reader off guard.  One good lesson to be learned from this book is that a thief will lie and steal from anyone:  family, friends, business associates, confidantes and enemies.  We can learn from this because sometimes we think that a person we meet will never do us wrong and we think highly of him.  By reading this book, we see that some people will step on and use anyone.

0787119083|3.0|This is a trickster novel with literary pretensions...but the pretension is mostly about Dumas, basically a pulp novelist himself. So this is a pulp novel about an old pulp novel posing as some kind of high literature. Its quite entertaining for a while, but the plot gimmicks become somewhat tiresome and the end is entirely anti-climactic. The good bits are the details about the Three Musketeers, the parallel references and the mystery of the &quot;Nine Doors&quot; - which gets a frisson of excitement going because of the satanist aspects...this isn't fully exploited and you get the feeling that P-R is like Corso: the whole thing is a big tedious joke. In the end, it's like a nouveau roman for high school students - go back and try Robbe-Grillet's &quot;Erasers&quot; or &quot;Maison de Rendez-Vous&quot; if you want the real thing. David Warner does a pretty good job with the audio version, his voice for Corso being especially good, but even he can't inject sufficient tension into the plot to maintain interest.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence: v. to gradually fade- That is what the dictionary states. This band is far from fading. After they burst onto the scene with their high energy and very dramatic song Bring Me to Life, Evanescence has captivated my attention. Amy has this voice that could possibly be used to hypnotize people. Her voice sounds so smooth and powerful. She is the perfect balance to the heavy guitars and screaming violins that are very prominent on Fallen. On &quot;Going Under,&quot; the band tries to explain what a bad relationship is like. She sings: &quot;I'm going under/Drowning in you.&quot; Every song is catchy and greatly crafted. I especially love it when a full symphony joins in on most of the songs. The only problem I had with this album is that every song sounds sort of the same. But that is a good thing if you love Bring Me to Life. Only two ballads on this dark and moody masterpiece. My Immortal is perhaps the saddest song I have ever heard. Brilliant!! Bottom Line: MUST HAVE!!
0316666343|2.0|I'll make this short and sweet.  It's a well written book, conceived in a poetic style that I have not seen in many books of late. The idea of a girl looking down upon her family after her untimely death is a very captivating and unexpected way to tell a story.  So, why so few stars? Freudianism.  The book starts as what is a fun, yet believable flight of fantasy, and lands just short of vulgar.  It was a good story gone horribly wrong.  By the end of the book, you'll have lost interest, being alienated by the blunt sexual references that are, in the end, more than just references.  If you decide to read it, you'll be enchanted, then greatly disappointed...
B00005JKED|5.0|This is the type of film that you see once and remember vividly for some time.  It's a great story.  Both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke give good performances.  The DVD includes additional scenes and an alternate ending.  As soon as I finished watching this movie, I wanted to see it again.
B00005RYLE|4.0|This is a fine dvd, with good features and tasty packaging. But no one seems to have commented on the fact that it's letterboxed. Let me explain myself here, I love letterbox and firmly believe in seeing the whole image. However, this film was shot in 16mm, which means it's aspect ratio is square and fits on television screens as is. So those little black bars are in this case only covering the top and bottom of the image. Why on earth this was done is a mystery to me. Maybe to cater to people with 16:9 televisions? Also the THX people really did effect the look of the film, as the colors are noticeably different from earlier dvds. Now this is fine, there's nothing wrong with that, but I'd venture a guess that the older editions more accurately represent what The Evil Dead was when it first came out. This edition is sort of that as seen through the eyes of a digital telecine colorist technician, which may be better in some people's eyes. Personally I'd go with the Elite Entertainment version which is fullscreen and has nearly all the features this version has. This version is really more for hard-core collectors.

It was never what Led Zeppelin was supposed to be about. Our thing was playing live. In that sense, Zeppelin was very much an underground band.

B000001EAQ|5.0|POP is, in my opinion, a crowning achievement for the band. This CD has everything you could possibly want in a U2 album. Great lyrics. Great songs. Great guitar riffs from the Edge. It's their most underrated album, and it's a shame. It's an album of many emotional layers. Here's a breif overview of the songs with ratings:<br />1. \\"Discotheque\\" - Great opener. Definately a good dance tune. 10/10<br />2. \\"Do You Feel Loved\\" - I love this song it's great. Fantastic lyrics. 10/10<br />3. \\"Mofo\\" - Best example of Bono's lyrical genius. 10/10<br />4. \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" - A great example of how diverse this album is. 10/10<br />5. \\"Staring At The Sun\\" - What can I say? Another great song from an already great album. 10/10<br />6. \\"Last Night On Earth\\" - Awesome rock tune! Killer riff from the master, The Edge. 9.5/10<br />7. \\"Gone\\" - I like the intro to this great song. 10/10<br />8. \\"Miami\\" - Good rock tune. 9/10<br />9. \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" - See above.<br />10. \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\" - I think this song is great, and so will you. 10/10<br />11. \\"Please\\" - Best song of the album. The modern day \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" 10/10<br />12. \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" - Good closer to U2's forth masterpiece!<br />Do yourself a favor and get this album and any piece of music U2 puts out there. *POP* is a journey, a rarity that takes you from reality, and sweeps you up with it's sonic sounds and blazing brilliance. Get it!!!!!!<br />- Justin<br />A U2 reviewer...
B00005QCYC|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the Jurassic Park films, the first two anyway. They combine groundbreaking special effects in both animatronics and animation with some really good, solid storylines. The Star Wars of its day, this trilogy is an amazing adventure, some of my favorite movies. The first two, anyway. <br />Since this is really a rerelease box set and the point of getting it is to get the films on DVD instead of watching them for the first time, thats what I'll focus on. Basically, the movies are great. You won't be disapointed. <br />As far as DVDs go, the Jurassic Park and The Lost World special editions are about average. They have a fair amount of special features and some nice sounds and transitions, but I think they could have gone a little farther. The menu screens are particurally dark and drab. The features are overall informative and interesting, especially if your a fan of the films. <br />The Jurassic Park 3 DVD is quite a bit better. It's overloaded with features, the menus have a deffinate theme going and its really well desinged. You get all sorts of neat stuff beyond the basic \\"Making of\\" features. There are 360 degree views of the computer models of the film's dinosaurs, step by step tours of the process at Industrial Light and Magic, and some really neat stuff about the art and design of the film. The movie itself is pretty bad and an insult to the first two, but its a really nice DVD.<br />With this trilogy set you get the bonus \\"Beyond Jurassic Park\\" DVD, which is pure [junk]. It's only worth watching if you're a Jurassic Park fanatic, because its basically table scraps from when the films were produced and some really lame, slapped toghether bits like a split screen comparison of The Lost World's key scenes before and after the post production effects. Yawn. <br />Unless its cheaper to get the boxed set, I'd recomend buying the three movies seperatly and not bothering with the exclusive disc in this set. The Jurassic Park films are excellent movies, not to be missed!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Gwyneth Paltrow does an admirable job as Emma.  She is charming, witty, and utterly engrossed in her matchmaking activities, even if her accent isn't perfect.  (I don't know why people expect Americans to get the accent absolutely correct anyway.  Try to do better yourself.)<br />While &quot;Emma&quot; may not be perfect Austen (the A&amp;E/BBC versions of all movies are wonderful), I find this movie delightful and probably one of the most romantic films I've ever seen.<br />I am NOT a chick flick person.  I abhor sappy romance.  &quot;Emma&quot; is neither.  Movies are so much more fun when the romantic entanglements are a perfect riot of Austenian theatrics, and as this IS Austen, it's a joy to watch.  <br />Mr. Knightley is the perfect prince/hero/knight simply because he is the &quot;guy next door&quot;, yet he displays such wisdom and prudence in the matters of life.  My favorite line (of course) is, &quot;I rode through the rain...&quot;  I have trouble keeping myself from breaking out into a huge grin at that part, even if I'm watching the movie by myself (or in front of people!)<br />Hilarious, romantic, and entirely refreshing, &quot;Emma&quot; is near topping my list of &quot;chick flicks&quot; even though I hold that it is NOT one at all!  :-)
B0000640VO|5.0|This film is sooo cute, humorous and visually beautiful.  This is a beautiful romantic comedy that tells a beautiful story.  I recommend it people who likes chicks flicks or a funny movie.
B00000DCHE|5.0|The liner notes say it, everyone repeats it, and it's true:  This is a CD to be played LOUDLY.  The difference between these live recordings of Joel's early work and the studio recordings of those pieces is amazing.  As soon as the band smashes its way in on &quot;Miami 2017,&quot; you're on a roller-coaster ride that just doesn't stop.  Initially, I was a little skeptical about the idea of choosing audience sizes to match the songs, but it works perfectly here, proving that Joel knew exactly what effect he was trying to create with each of these pieces.  This album's brilliance lies in the way it redefines songs I passed right over before.  &quot;Los Angelenos,&quot; for example, is fairly mellow on &quot;Streetlife Serenade&quot;; here it's a funky, energetic rocker.  Similarly, I never cared much for &quot;Captain Jack,&quot; but this live performance transforms it into a 7-minute epic of guitars and drums and Billy Joel playing the piano so hard he (allegedly) breaks strings.  In addition, we get such fare as &quot;You're My Home&quot; and &quot;Everybody Loves You Now,&quot; both of which are gems that could easily have gone unnoticed otherwise.  The adrenaline running through the crowds on each of these performances gives these songs the hard-rocking quality Billy Joel always wanted them to have, as opposed to the somewhat oversentimentalized feel some of them had on his other albums.  This is a CD you'll listen to again and again, and it'll pump you up every time.  For all those people who thought Billy Joel was only about soft-rock ballads:  think again.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this CD a year before her 8 grammy awards, and I love every single song of it.  The mood is very soothing and the first time I heard it, it reminds me of a 50's smoky jazz bar.  I listen to it while I fall asleep and it brings me very sweet imagery and memories.  I recommend it to anyone who likes good melody and soothing jazz vocals.  Her voice is very different.
B000002UAR|5.0|Back in 1966, I was walking along a street in center city Philadelphia past a record store known for its complete catalog of hard to find records and saw this album in their \\"recommended\\" rack that faced the glass door for potential customers to see. I was intrigued by the very untypical artwork for a teen-oriented album on the cover, and the Beatles had been doing some stuff lately that I had really liked, like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\" and I thought, \\"Why not?\\" and bought it. WOW! The Beatles had matured!<br /><br />This was, in fact, my very first rock album purchase and it was an auspicious start. Between \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", \\"I Want To Tell You\\", \\"Love You To\\", \\"Rigby\\" and \\"Taxman\\", I was hooked! After this I became a progressive rock aficianado second to none! Thanks to JPG&R, I got into their movies, Procol, The Yardbirds, \\"discovered\\" groups like The Pink Floyd, Cream, Hendrix, The Moody Blues, The United States of America and others....I was a full fledged, card carrying member of the Summer of Love and loved it!!<br /><br />We may never see a genuine phenomenon like The Beatles ever again...a group that had the great publciity and fan tumult afforded EVERY \\"new\\" rock act of the early sixties, but also one that actually went out of its way to JUSTIFY that adoration with first rate songwriting and trendsetting! If you ask me, the boys never equalled this album again....Yes, \\"Abbey Road\\" may have been enjoyable, and Sgt Pepper's may have taken the whole \\"Revolver\\" mindset further, but the \\"album with the Aubrey Beardsley cover\\" was where it all started, baby!!<br /><br />If you want to know what made so many people of your grandparents' or parents' generations finally LIKE the Beatles after intiial scepticism, this album will give you an excellent example! I remember one rock reviewer of the time describing \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", one of THE major standout cuts on the album, as \\"...God singing through a megaphone\\"! To this day, that's STILL what it sounds like to me!sounds like to me!
B000069AUI|5.0|Once in a great while a group of talented musicians will come along that are unconventional, absolutely refreshing and will draw the attention of those of us that are tired of the usual drone of top 40 music world. Coldplay has out done themselves on this latest release, loaded with lush guitar riffs and boldly creative musical arrangements. I always hate to label a band or make comparisons but I think you'll notice at least the influence of Pink Floyd, Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) and The Moody Blues. Take an aural tour of Coldplay and you will undoubtedly feel a Rush of Blood to the Head from listening these talented Brits. I predict that even greater things are to be heard from future Coldplay recordings.
B00000IQC8|4.0|I became a fan of Kevin Smith by seeing &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;.  &quot;Clerks&quot;, although the first, was the second Viewaskew film I saw. Although funny and entertaining, I don't think I would have liked it as much if I didn't know the back story.<BR>That being said, this DVD is a must to have in your collection, if for nothing more than the introductions to characters that will pop up in Smith's future outings.<BR>Check out the alternate ending. Thank God they didn't use it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I don't know if people can truely say anything negative about this album. It is so increadibly well put together. All of the songs have a great beat and the piano ballads are increadible. I don't think you could ask for more. You could put this under somewhat of an industril genre if you wanted to, but Evanescence doesn't need a genre. They just put out good music to help people through hard times and just to share hope. This is an album that needs to be in your c.d. player on heavy rotation. dig through your wallet and go out and purchase this masterpiece. you WON'T BE disapointed!
B00006RIO7|5.0|Oh my God -- this movie and soundtrack thing has become an obsession for me.  Went to see the movie for the first time a week ago today -- and I've now seen it three times (so far).<br />I bought the soundtrack, and listened to it non-stop on a car trip from Massachusetts to Virginia (10 hours).  What's wrong with me?  This soundtrack is like musical heroin.<br />I must say that I start all over again at the end of the actual movie soundtrack.  I don't much care for the cheesy-pop-song version of any of my favorites.  (Including that stuff is sacrilegious, IMHO...)<br />Excuse me -- I have to go push &quot;play&quot; and start the CD again.  (Is there a 12-step program for &quot;Chicago&quot; addicts?)<br />-- Janis Jaquith, Public-Radio commentator and author of BIRDSEED COOKIES: A FRACTURED MEMOIR

B00006LLNU|2.0|Doesn't come close to the last album. They tried to use the same formula that made <BR>the last album so successful but in the end just made a mess. Ive listened to this cd 50 <BR>times now and can't remember a single song from it. Perhaps leaving the tracks <BR>untitled was not a good idea either. In an attempt to be artsy, they left out one <BR>important ingredient, good music.
B000068PQ0|3.0|The first track on this record, 'Fight Test,' is perhaps the best piece of Pure Pop this listener has ever heard.  The band throws everything but the kitchen sink in there, and skates the always fine line between sentimental and maudlin like polished pros.  Listen to this song and be transported.<br />As for the rest of the record?  Ma-ma, as 'Yoshimi' would say.  One reviewer said this record 'rocked.'  It may do a lot of things, but rock isn't one of them.   Most of these songs just meander around----on the whole the record creates a sort of aural landscape of its own---a languid, 'do I have enuf energy to get up and fix another mai-tai' kind of landscape.  And it has about as much to do with robots as baseball does with cricket fighting.  And that probably isn't a bad thing.  If the concept is a joke, the joke doesn't come off; it it's not a joke, well, it doesn't come off either.<br />But 'Fight Test' is so much different than anything on the record.  For this track alone this listener worships at the shrine of the 'Lips.'
B000089RVX|3.0|This album falls way short compared to the pioneers of this genre. Every song on this album uses the same formula. All the fast songs sound exactly the same, all the slow songs are the same. Though the vocals are superb, the musicianship is quite mediocre. Riffs during versus, thrashing during the chorus. And expect to hear the same chords over and over. I am actually amazed it even took this long before a band like this emerged in the U.S.(are they from the US?) We are so far behind. But then again, there are so many of these bands in the underground scene, it was just a matter of picking one and marketing them well. I do have hope for this band and will continue to listen to this cd but I hope they mature and can reach the caliber of the bands before them. Check out Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, Nightwish, to name a few.
0780627024|3.0|\\"PLEASANTVILLE\\"<br />This movie is about one brother and a sister who are very different one from other, but something really weird happened with them that helped them to change their attitudes for the better.<br /> There is this guy named David who is very shy and he only likes to watch TV.  Especially one program named Pleasantville, and it is on TV Time.  His sister is Jen.  She  is only preoccupied with herself, and being cool.  She never studies.<br /> One day they were fighting because both of them wanted to watch TV at the same time, but the control remote broke.  Suddenly a repairman appeared in the door and he gave them a magic control.  They got into the TV and appeared in the TV show David used to watch.<br /> The place is called Pleasantville, it supposed to be a perfect place, but it really is not for me, of course.  Many things happened there and everybody changed and also the place.<br /> I think everybody changed for good because everything in that place was the same always.  David, now named Bud, changed his attitude.  He was shy and a coward, now he was brave and Jen, now named Mary Sue, was a very studious girl and concerned for her future. <br />Cecilia Lopez
B000000993|5.0|I  have to say that \\"undertow\\" by tool is by far one of the best albums they have done todate! I got  their ep \\"opiate\\", and  tool's albums  , \\"aenima\\" , and \\"lateralus\\" along with their salival box set which i enjoy  to this day and all the videos on the box set are just too good and i always zone out and turn the lights off while watching those amazing videos and listining to songs like \\"part of me\\" which  was my personal favorite.Now,  with this album \\"undertow\\" we  see a darker tool with a more progressive sound then in \\"opiate\\" which was heavier, i might add. Tool's debut \\"undertow\\" changed the face of \\"alternative music\\"<BR> in 1993 because i remenber how kids changed their views in music as soon as tool realesed \\"undertow\\"... It was an uneasy feeling of things changing so at first i was like tool ? what the ? because i seen these guys  in lolapolooza and i wasn very impressed but as i lsiting to \\"undertow\\" more and more i started to enjoy the music  and understand it as well as getting obsses with it... As for tool's ep \\"opiate\\" i didnt  even like none of those songs at first but i started to understand them  and  again getting obsses  with them... I quess if tool can do something is change your mind!! I got some personal favorites on \\"undertow\\" and they are \\"prison sex\\" , \\" sober\\" ,  and , \\"crawl away\\"  because i can realy see why tool is so respected  with each sound and liryc of those 3 songs i named its out of this world... Basically if \\"lateralus\\" is the only tool album you got then you missing of  some good substance that tool once had   and still do but not like they had on their \\"undertow\\" days! Laters !!
B00006LLNU|2.0|Sooooooo, I read all the Sigur Ros/( ) reviews here on Amazon (\\"sheer beauty\\" \\"I cried several times during this CD\\" etc etc) and figured OK - I'll give ( ) a shot. I own the previous disk - which I think is so-so. And.........<BR>  <BR>This has got to be the most overrated load of hooey since \\"Kid A.\\" There's nothing memorable here; the music's not even that interesting. I thought maybe a second listen might help, but no. The main problem is the singer has only one phrase which he repeats on every song - apparently in lieu of being able to write actual lyrics. It sounds like \\"OOO-SIGH-OH,\\" or something, and becomes even MORE tedious and irritating the second time around. I dunno. The black lipstick and fingernail polish crowd might dig it after they've skipped their lithium treatments, but ( ) doesn't do it for me. ...
B00007E8V4|5.0|Soad's  is an amazing band that plays  awsome music  their latest effort \\"steal this album\\" shows  how much talented these guys realy have and what they have to offer us!!Upon purchasing  this wonderfull disc i found myself to be very pleased and not disapointed at all specialy songs like \\"chic n stew\\" , \\"bubbles\\" , and , \\"innervision\\" all are great tracks to me!!! I can't stop listining to \\"chic n stew\\"  my favorite teack  on this masterpiece that  soad can bring with nothing but originality and yes being original is  good!!! Laters!!!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This is a wonderful, beautiful movie  it is a little mixed, but it all works, with the flat, cartoonish elements which Baz seems to prefer, conquered by the elements of actual drama and dance.<br />Paul Mercurio dances very well, and he carries off a variety of routines;  he manages the ballroom dancing fine, even though he is more a modern dancer by training;  of course, his solo which is interrupted by Frans approaching him, and steeling her nerves to ask him to dance with her;  the laughable pseudo-Paso Doble which excites such mirth;  and the flamenco-in-training with Antonio Vargas.  Tara Morice and Mercurio are a terrific couple, and she does so well with the dancing, few would ever suspect that she was not herself actually a dancer.  Vargas is fantastic.  And crucially for the movie, Mercurio, Morice, Vargas and Armonia Benedito form the emotional heart of the movie, and they carry it off brilliantly.  The unsung genius of the movie, for he serves as a crucial pivot between this, the human element of the story, and the cartoonish Baz element (the comic-book caricatures which are Barry Fife, Les Kendall and Mrs Hastings), is Barry Otto as Doug Hastings  within the confines of caricatureville he is an object of scorn and contempt, and meekly escapes into his own dreams in a number of shadowy solo dance scenes (and impressively plastic in his movements, too).  Otto comes close to stealing the scene when his insistence on bending Scotts ear dispels the fog of Barry Fifes manipulative deceptions, at the last instant, when Scott and Liz were just about to go out to the dance floor for the Latin Finals  and when his clapping conquers the Un-Music when Fife has pulled The Plug ....<br />This is a fabulous movie, with some exhilarating dancing, and a great deal of charm.  Indeed, it is a great movie, in spite of Baz Luhrmann.<br />The more we have seen of Bazs work since Strictly Ballroom, withhis juvenile obsessions with breasts and sex, the color-blind dependence on gaudy extremes which we are invited to interpret as fresh vision, the low-budget high concept which The Blazoned Motto is supposed to represent  the wonder is, that Strictly Ballroom succeeds so marvelously well.  The answer to this puzzle must lie in the fact that Baz was but a co-writer, and but a co-director of SB  so that the other party must have been the artistically responsible half, who made sure that SB rose above Bazs conceptual limitations.  Whenever we see something more recent by Baz, and gag at its shallowness, we come back to SB, and we wonder that he managed to get THIS movie so perfectly right.<br />Five stars, though you wont need to bother with the Baz-ly commentary, which is about 2% genuinely interesting information about the making of the movie, and 98% empty, self-flattering Baz-chat.
B000000WA2|5.0|Blur's follow-up to 'Parklife', this disc continues the band's ironic lyricplay concerning the empty, repetitive state of modern life in Britain.  My favorite track is the lovely 'Yuko &amp; Hiro', a fitting counterpoint to the matched track #15 of 'Parklife', the equally brilliant 'This Is A Low'.  Other notable tracks are 'Universal', 'He Thought Of Cars', and 'Ernold Same'.  'Parklife' caused Blur to blow-up in popularity; 'Great Escape' is their work on top of the mushroom cloud.
B0000203Y5|5.0|This film is incredible.  Its treatment of the Cuban musicians, as well as the delicate handling of the culture as a whole, is fantastic.  I showed several Spanish classes the film, some very basic students and some more advanced--all enjoyed it very much, thanks to the humor, vibrance, and beauty of the video.  Especially exciting for the students were the scenes in which the band members visit New York.  <BR>A wonderful look into the life of some amazing men and women utterly committed to creating clear, beautiful music.  Fascinante!
B000002U3P|5.0|No exaggeration.  This disc is completely and seamlessly evocative of the film from which it's derived.  There's a terrific blend of Britpop, dancehall rock and bombing techno, including the immensely enjoyable 'Born Slippy'.  Every song supports every other song, making the disc extremely listenable and ageless.<br />Other factors:<br />1. For Blur fans in the US, only opportunity to get 'Sing' on disc;<br />2. Pulp's 'Mile End' is one of the greatest songs of Britpop, a happy melody counterpointed with extremely downtrodden lyricplay.
B000089RVX|5.0|From a major record label that brought us the likes of mega-superstars Creed, 12 Stones, Chevelle, Seether, it's a wonder what new sound Wind-Up has in store...they answer accordingly to the lagging music industry with Evanescence, a new band that most likely will truly change the face of music in this new year by reviving piano and rock fused together with overpowering lyrics and vocals.  The debut album, Fallen, brings together all the grittiness of modern hard rock but also meshes together the symphonic elements of classical music for an album that stands at the pinnacle of a new wave and defines a totally new genre of music.  \\"Going Under\\" opens the album with a very dark tone but crashes louder too with gritty guitars and crashing drums throughout the chorus...very strong start.  \\"Bring Me To Life\\" features the vocals of a 12 Stones singer layered over a very strong guitar lead and Amy's strong passionate vocals, making it a perfect breakout single for the album.  \\"Everybody's Fool\\" follows suit in the rock vein but keeps strong lyrics and the pace as well.  \\"My Immortal\\" is the best song ever written or recorded but especially this new version appearing on Fallen...the piano tone and the violas in the background create a very melancholy backdrop to very poignant and sad lyrics...beautifully haunting and passionate and the best song I've probably ever heard in my life both lyrically and musically.  \\"Haunted\\" follows eerily but the pulsating of the track makes it cutting edge and innovative...nothing like this exists anywhere in the musical market today and the ghostly tone of the lyrics makes it truly haunting.  \\"Tourniquet\\" is a cover song but nonetheless better than the original and a good song leading off of a strong mid-section on the album.  \\"Imaginary\\" makes another appearance but this time with the aid of violins and violas littered throughout the track coupled with gritty guitars...a combination usually not imagined possible but pulled off wonderfully like something from imagination coming to life.  \\"Taking Over Me\\" is an excellent track but seems out of place at the end of the album because it seems to take more from the stream at the beginning of the album...nonetheless, it's still a great song.  \\"Hello\\" is another very dark song on the album but it's very poignant and passionate...Amy's vocals start of slowly and low but increase with intensity as the song progresses while cascading over the piano accompaniment.  \\"My Last Breath\\" is an excellent song to lead towards the end of the album with great lyrics as well.  \\"Whisper\\" appears as the closing track to the album and the violin solo at the end makes it absolutely amazing and memorable along with great lyrics and the album seems to end too soon.  Fallen is a record that truly changes the course of modern music with its intense passion lyrically and musically but it also fuses together the elements of hard rock and classical accompaniment that truly make this album a masterpiece in itself.
B000002TQB|5.0|Perhaps the greatest pop album of the 90's, and maybe then some.  Beautifully decries the apparently burgeoning materialistic spirit of England's youth with 15 wonderful, memorable tracks.  Too many great songs to mention, this album both invites and commands repeated listenings.  Brings to fruition the themes and potential exhibited in Blur's two preceding discs, 'Leisure' and 'Modern Life is Rubbish', both of which are hardly at all uneven and terrific albums on their own.
B00005Q4GV|5.0|This movie is an excellent example of what kind of man that Gen. George S. Patton was(even though he had his faults). Also the war scenes are and shows what Patton and his troops went through during WW2. <br />George C. Scott's portrayal of Patton is excellent, so much so that I sometimes forget that it's an actor playing Patton rather than the man himself.<br />The only minor complaint that I have about this movie is that it's not totally historicially accurate(e.g. the slapping incident- there were two slapping incidents and the movie condenced both of them into one incident).<br />This is the greatest war movie ever and I definitely recommend it to everyone.
B0000039LE|5.0|This is a masterpiece, it starts with the escape of Micheal Myers from a maximum security mental hospital and making his way back to his home town of Haddonfield. The film builds up with several very creepy sightings of Mr Myers and ends on Halloween night when Myers terrorizes a small group of friends including babysitter herroine Lorrie (Jamie Lee Curtis).<br />The movie is helped tremendously by an excellent score, composed by Carpenter himself, it adds real excitment to the movie.<br />This is a must for any horror movie fan.
0345442970|4.0|If you want to know more about the background of E1, then this book will be really helpful. If you want your Sci-Fi blazing with star-battles and light-sabre clashes in every chapter, then this is probably not for you. When the other reviewers have said that this book is about politics, they aren't kidding.  It explains a lot about the Federation, Valorum's troubles, Palpatine's popularity, the blockade of Naboo, etc., with just enough action thrown in to keep it interesting (at least enough for me).<BR>     I agree with others that Palpatine is the most interesting character of this book. It is truly chilling to see him in action, just seeing the double-meaning in his gentle demeanour and seemingly innocuous statements, knowing what he will do in the future. Not a lot of action (as compared with other SW books), but a lot of political intrigue and manipulation. If you like LaCarre spy novels more than James Bond movies, this might appeal to you. Slow reading at first, but I thought the ending more than compensated.  As someone else described it, &quot;a should read but not a must read.&quot;
B00003CXCW|5.0|I hate to use a cliche right off the bat, but they really don't make them like they used to and this film is proof of that. The great Billy Wilder, who already had such classics as The Lost Weekend and Double Indemnity (both great films in their own right) under his belt, came out with Sunset Boulevard in 1950. I've heard more than one critic say that they consider this his best film and that's saying a mouthful when one realizes that it's up against other great Wilder films including Stalag 17, The Apartment, and Some Like It Hot (as well as the aforementioned greats from the 1940's). <br />But what of this film? Yes, we have scathing commentary on how shallow, materialistic, and rotten Hollywood (the entertainment industry?) can be. We have typically great Wilder dialogue, humor, and characters. Great charcters? William Holden as  struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis who realizes too late that he has prostituted himself simply can't be beat. Of course he would follow it up with other great performances in Stalag 17, The Wild Bunch, and Network. Without a doubt, Gloria Swanson gives the performance of her career as Norma Desmond--the former silent film actress who refuses to acknowledge that time has passed her by. At times, Swanson is over the top but absurdity seems to be appropriate for the character. Ehric von Stroheim is also excellent as the joyless butler with more than one dark secret. <br />Moreover this is a great story with characters that we care about in one way or another. If one doesn't identify with Norma Desmond, he/she most likely pities her. There's also a couple of good extras on the disc, including a 25 minute documentary that covers some of the goings-on with the making of the film. Unfortunately, it would appear that the only surviving cast member at the time of the filming for the DVD was Nancy Olson who played Betty Schaefer, the young screenwriter who falls for Holden but can't quite seem to pry him away from Norma. Otherwise, it's entertaining enough. The script for the original opening sequence is included as well (no, the famous body floating in the pool shot was not the original beginning to the film).<br />Do enjoy this film and be sure to seek out other Wilder classics as well. Billy's counting on you.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Let's face it. Johnny Cash is in his 70s. He's never going to sing with the gusto he did on &quot;Ring of Fire.&quot; Nor should he. <BR>Instead, Cash embraces his feebleness and reflects it truthfully. He knows his end is coming, as the lyrics of his original songs and covers prove. He wants to share some wisdom and memories before he goes. And he does it well. <br />As for singers who &quot;talk&quot; their songs, how has Wayne Newton managed to stay around so long (not that I'm fond of him by any means)? Or some hip hop and alternative artists?<br />Cash could easily have re-recorded some of his classics and made a mockery of himself. Instead, he picks some startlingly relevant songs like Depeche Mode's &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Hurt&quot;, breathing new life and perspective into them. He isn't afraid to go outside the boundaries of &quot;country&quot; music. I'm personally thrilled to see the youth-dominated VH-1 playing the &quot;Hurt&quot; video. It's a testament to one man's colorful career. <br />True, there are a few misses among the hits. &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; is one of them. <br />Cash is no saint and he'll state it frankly. He's known addiction and done his share of stupid things. But he's been a consistently skilled story teller and musician from the beginning. And he knows his craft. He doesn't appear on TV shows to spout obscenities or criticize his fans, unlike many of today's musical stars.<br />What more can you say? He's the Man in Black and when he's gone, there will be another one quite like him.
B000059QY2|2.0|By quickly going through the reviews, none seems to have pointed out an apparent problem of this DVD. Sound quality is so bad and not at an acceptable level.
0790732203|2.0|I think most people who buy/rent this DVD have already seen the movie and know what they're getting. There are a lot of good reviews on this movie here at amazon.com but I only saw one that mentioned the quality of the DVD. It is absolutely horrible. The companies who produce these dark, grainy DVDs need to know that the consumers aren't going to accept this type of low-quality transfer. I'd gladly pay a bit more money for a DVD that's viewable. We know how good movies can look on DVD. So why release a disc that looks as poor as this one? As consumers we need to demand better! Just as VHS movies recorded in SLP or EP were unacceptable, so are DVDs that look as bad as this Risky Business disc.

0792839625|1.0|Those who have not seen the stage production please understand.  This film is not horrible just because it is different from the stage production.  It is a travesty in its own right - unquestionably one of the worst musical films of any kind ever made.  I just rented the video again recently after having seen a wonderful revival of the stage production in New Orleans, and I had forgotten just how bad this film is.  First, Richard Attenborough has directed some fine films, but I can't imagine a worse choice to direct THIS - sort of like asking Michael Bennett to direct &quot;Gandhi,&quot; I suppose.  Second, never has a more unappealing, more clueless, and less musical cast ever been assembled.  Then, as others have said in their reviews, several songs and important pieces of dialog are cut or rendered unrecognizable, and weak replacements are added.  Perhaps someday someone will have the guts and the money to remake this film  properly.  In the meantime, if you've never seen &quot;A Chorus Line,&quot; don't bother with this mess.  I would recommend you buy the newly remastered Original Cast CD with it's extended liner notes, and wait for a moderately competent stage production to come to your town sometime soon.
0066214122|3.0|i read this book, and thought that it was fairly dectn. my problem with it was that it kept on repeting itself. the same scenes seemed to happen again and again. now, if you have never read any of mr. crichtons books before, then you would most likely give it 4-5 stars, but it would be confused out of your mind. all those who are familiar with crichtons writing style would give this an average rating. in order to understand this book more, then read some of his other works such as \\"The Andromeda Strain\\", because this is one of his most comple pieces. also, \\"Prey\\" contains very strong language, and some disturbing scenes. my advice: get it from the library, its not worth $...

0790731452|4.0|Tim Burton's film \\"Mars Attacks!\\" is a silly, satirical, sci-fi spoof of the 1996 film \\"Independence Day\\" and was inspired by several 1950's-era sci-fi/horror films (mostly of the \\"B-movie\\" variety) including:<BR>* \\"Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers\\" (1956): the flying saucers used by Tim Burton are nearly identical to the ones used in this film.<BR>* \\"Invasion of the Saucer Men\\" (1957): the bulbous, vein-covered heads of the aliens may have inspired the design of Tim Burton's Martian design.<BR>* \\"This Island Earth\\" (1955): the Metaluna mutant insect workers with large eyes and bulbous heads may also have inspired Tim Burton's Martian design.<BR>* \\"War of the Worlds\\" (1953): waves of seemingly unstoppable Martian ships attack the Earth with powerful weapons that burn everything.<br />After President James Dale (Jack Nicholson) is warned that a large number of ships were detected leaving the surface of Mars, General Decker (Rod Steiger) recommends military action; but Professor Donald Kessler (Pierce Brosnan) and Press Secretary Jerry Ross (Martin Short) recommend opening a dialog with the approaching Martians.  After finding a way to translate the strange Martian language, Professor Kessler establishes a dialog with the Martians and a meeting place is agreed upon in the desert outside of Las Vegas, but events go awry as the Martians attack the American dignitaries and other personnel.  Was the attack really a misunderstanding?<br />Tim Burton's satirical vision of a Martian invasion of Earth include political ineptitude, Americans' attitudes towards government and military \\"intelligence\\".  Though the characters and story are not as endearing as those of the better sci-fi spoof \\"Galaxy Quest\\", \\"Mars Attacks!\\" is still a very entertaining film.  Other cast members in \\"Mars Attacks!\\" include Glenn Close as First Lady Marsha Dale, Annette Benning as Art's wife Barbara Land, Sarah Jessica Parker as a reporter captured by the Martians, Lukas Haas as the unintentional hero, and other performances from Danny DeVito, Michael J. Fox, Tom Jones, Jim Brown and Natalie Portman.<br />Overall, I rate \\"Mars Attacks!\\" with 4 out of 5 stars.  People who enjoy sci-fi as well as fans of Tim Burton's films will more than likely enjoy the film.  If you aren't sure whether you would enjoy a satirical film showing mankind and Martians battling (with lots of red and green blood), you could first rent a copy before deciding to purchase it.
B000005ALN|5.0|This album is perfect.  Never before have I heard an album which have lyrics of this depth.  The songs lyrics are constantly revealing a deeper meaning with each listen.  It's only while listening carefully that you can recognize the shift in focus of \\"You have been loved,\\" from the mother of the dieing man, to George Michael himself as he talks to that same man who as it turns out his lover... and then you realize that the lover has passed away and this is a post-mortum conversation, a prayer of sorts. <br />It is songs like this that make this album truelly stand out.  The dance tracks on the album serve as the bridge between the truelly touching moments on the album.  \\"The Strangest Thing\\" is my favorite track on the album... once again with lyrics that have meaning on multiple levels.
0967851408|4.0|Charles F. Haanel was a successful business man who discovered that spiritual life is a key to success in everything you do. He proved that what is happening outside is in a direct relation to what is taking place in your consciousness.<br />When the Master Key was published, it was one of those books that successful business men wanted out of the market. They didn't want people to read this book as its truths would help anyone to overcome limitations.<br />The rumor is that when Bill Gates was just a student, he read this book and utilized its truths. Rest is history. <br />I have read this book - it is divided in chapters that have introductions and numbered paragraphs to study. It starts from understanding the principles of your conscious mind and its power and advances to utilizing these principles.<br />As you put in use what the author explains in this volume, you will start seeing substantial changes in your reality. In many ways, Charles was so much ahead of his time. Even today most profilic business coaches such as Antohony Robbins etc. do not admit the fact that your life is in your control 100%. We are taught that we are at the mercy of externals, but it ain't so.<br />In many ways, Charles F. Haanel is the most outstanding business coach there has ever been. Way before current business coaches who incorporate spiritual life and business, he did it. If you are an owner of major company -- have every employee of your company to read this book and utilize it in their daily routines. Your company will become the new success story. That is for sure.<br />Why am I giving just 4 stars for such an outstanding book? Well that is because the volume is rather long. I think the central message of this book could have been condensed into 60 pages -- but instead the author goes on and on for several hundred pages. On the other hand -- this does ensure that everyone grasps the principles involved in creating success.<br />Does it work? Yes it does. Why do some peoplefail? Well, they just read this book but don't put in use its truths. For some it is difficult to understand or believe that your life is just a mirror that is telling you what you are in your consciousness. Think you have a problem, and one will surface. Think you have a solution and it is as well yours. Fair game.
B000002OMN|5.0|Meat Loaf was the first rock star that I was obsessed about.  The reason for that obsession was this incredible album &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell.&quot;  I loved every song on the album from start to finish and actually wore out my cassette (hey! It was 1993) and had to buy a new one!

0446677450|5.0|I am 16 years old and just bought this book yesterday evening. Today, I am almost finished with it. I cannot put it down. I am simply amazed how simple Robert Kiyosaki can put finances. I have realized how much of a joy reading this book was. I have been contemplating what field to go into in college. Now I know that Business Finance is my route. This book teaches you everything you need to know and then some. It's not a &quot;tech&quot; book that just uses finance jargon used only by CPAs and the IRS. It is simply and easy to understand. It gives you inspiration that owning your own company can happen, not only in your dreams. I recommend this book to any one of any age who wants to know how to manage their finances or simply would like to see if they know as much as they claim they do in the world of financing. Thank you Mr. Kiyosaki!
B00006V9A0|4.0|This album is great for the casual Nirvana fans, but the true nirvana fans would like to hear the real Nirvana rarities released on an album. These songs have been floating around for years on bootlegs and should be cleaned up and put on the next nirvana release. They should include the cover versions of kiss's \\"DO YOU LOVE ME\\" the wipers \\"D-7\\" and \\"RETURN OF THE RAT\\" the velvet undergrounds \\"HERE SHE COMES NOW\\" fangs \\"THE MONEY WILL ROLL RIGHT IN\\" and the knacks \\"MY SHARONA\\". Other songs they should include are early originals never released on an album including \\"IF YOU MUST\\",\\"PEN CAP CHEW\\",\\"BLANDEST\\",\\"MISERY LOVES COMPANY\\",\\"SAPPY\\",\\"JUNKYARD\\",\\"OPINION\\",\\"TALK TO ME\\",\\"SPANK THRU\\",\\"OH,THE GUILT\\",\\"IN HIS HANDS\\",\\"ALCOHOL\\",\\"RUN RABBIT,RUN\\",\\"BAMBI SLAUGHTER\\",\\"CLEAN UP BEFORE SHE COMES\\",\\"PAY TO PLAY\\",\\"IMODIUM\\".They should also include all the b sides including \\"EVEN IN HIS YOUTH\\",\\"CURMUDGEON\\",\\"MOIST VAGINA\\",\\"I HATE MYSELF AND WANT TO DIE\\". It is such a sin that most of this material is being withheld from the public. In my opinion they should include all of this material on a box set with alternative and live versions of their hits.

This movie is freakin great...The plot was awesome and it kept me going; I never got bored or moved my eyes off the screen for a second.  The action keeps on going!  Matt Damon plays a great role.  He wakes up one day and cant remember a single thing about his life...but he seems to be the smartest man on the streets.  Now it is his goal to gain an identity.  If you want to see a good action/thriller movie, check this one out!  You wont be dissappointed!

0066214122|3.0|In _Prey_, as typically, Michael Crichton trusts studiedly cinematic storytelling to mimic the model medium's ability to oblige, even in readers a-swell with relevant expertise, and however commingled be what's possible, predictable, and preposterous, enough of volitional credulity to keep the pages turning at speeds approaching flicker frequency. Short chapters switch rapidly and irregularly among perspectives to at once impart a juggernautish immediacy to the action's unfolding and maintain that pace by repeatedly coaxing the reader just a few pages further, while palpably precisely detailed descriptions of characters' intuitions and eurekas augment the filmic effect.  This narrative strategy is far from uncommon, and, pending one's purchase of premise, breeds a &quot;read&quot; whose feel is either exciting or contrived and manipulative. It is Crichton's habit, and has in his hand begat an oeuvre that sawtooths steeply between instances of the former impression (e. g., _The_ Andromeda_Strain_) and of the latter (e. g., the ludicrous, lamentable, and hopefully authorially-lamented _Congo_).  <br />_Prey_, for me, proved passably palatable if not necessarily wholly swallowable.  Read in a single sitting during a snowbound afternoon and evening, I found it at least as entertaining as any competing TV fare, and its tangents with what I know of current or foreseeable technological reality certainly tempted further exploration via the bibliography Crichton here, as to his several most recent novels, so welcomely appends.<br />I'm unsure how or even whether I should express my one real complaint about _Prey_, as it could well be a spoiler for its potential readers whom this review's titular pun does not elude. On the other hand, any such reader will almost certainly remark, as did I, from the book's very first page, an inescapably prophetic similarity to a twice-filmed short story Jack Finney wrote nearly 50 years ago.  One might call Crichton's story and Finney's perfect podmates, differing mainly in a few mechanical details ... or ought I to say &quot;particulars&quot;? In any case, don't fall asleep reading this book.   ;-)
B000089RVX|5.0|with the exception of lincoln park, the cult and some other bands i really am not a big rock fan. i havnt been since the early 90's. id rather listen to trance and synth music like depeche, etc. well, all that changed when i saw this band on jay leno on march 6. From the first note, i just stood in my living room, paralyzed. i couldn't beleive my ears and eyes.From the vocals to the music ,to the lyrics,&quot;bring me to life&quot; is a masterpiece. Probably the most perfect and refreshing song i have heard in ages.This band owned the stage that night. of course the next day i went out and bought a copy of the cd. It hasn't left my car stereo since. EVERY SINGLE TRACK ON THIS RECORD IS A GEM! if i had to pick,I'd say &quot;tournequet&quot;, &quot;haunted&quot;, &quot;going under&quot;, &quot;whisper&quot; and &quot;bring me to life&quot; are the standout tracks. If you, like I, want this band to do well..dont burn this cd, go out and buy it instead. it is well worth it.
B000001Y5J|4.0|It didn't take me too long to get sick to death of Nine Inch Nails even before their T-shirts started outselling their albums.  A very cheesily produced show at Lollapalooza (which started with various band members theatrically slamming their [don't laugh] keyboards to the stage every five minutes [whoo, anarchy!  Rock on, dude!] and ended with one of their roadies picking up and playing a discarded guitar) was my first and last live experience of this extremely under-talented hack who's been the critics' wet dream since the release of \\"The Downward Spiral\\".<br />Prior to \\"...Spiral\\" however, Trent released this EP and it was much better than the low-rent Depeche Mode tribute \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", and ended up being more vitriolic and abrasive than anything he's released since.
0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton's Prey. 2002 by Harper Collins.  Hardcover 1st edition, 1st impression. Signed.  Well, Crichton has another blockbuster on his hands.  Poor guy!  Action packed, science packed, with the now-to-be-expected biological terror.  Extrapolating on organic molecular-level manufacturing, swarm behavior, and computer modeling of swarm behavior, Crichton takes off on a non-stop roller coaster ride of deceit, greed, conceit, and other common human strengths.  The science, to my thinking, was more complicated than the genetic engineering of Jurassic Park, but that may be because I studied life science and did not fare well with organic chemistry! Molecular sized organic machines with enough memory to store simple swarm programming are developed for scientific and medical use.  In steps Uncle Sam.  More memory, more complicated programming, more power more, more, more.  The little buggers escape, evolve extremely rapidly and kill anything in their `sight' to use as food for reproduction. Yes, reproduction and the lab staff become the Prey.  To keep things from extrapolating out of control, Crichton contains the story in a remote desert laboratory and the immediate surrounding area.  As with the remote island of Jurassic Park, the barren sea floor of Sphere,  Andromeda Strain, et cetera, this has become standard stock for the author, helping him focus more on the story rather than the environs.  This is a good, fast read.  Entertaining, and classically Crichton.  Thanks for reading.  Enjoy the book. RDKedd at ABNormalBooks.

0780627024|5.0|Pleasantville is a movie where everything was perfect, there was no sex, toilets, big bed and everything had color all was, black and white. The imperfect world was wrong, there was a girl named Jan. She always had problems. She did not like to go to the school and read books. She love go out with her friend. She never was at home on time. Also there was a boy named David and he was smart. He likes to go to school and he was a nice boy with their parents. They were twice, but they were very different. <br />They entered Pleasantville when they were fighting with the TV Control suddenly they were than. Jan did not understand what was happening she did not like Pleasantville because everything perfect and they cannot be like the others girls. David understands more that Jan because he did know more about the Pleasantville he explained what was go on there. Also there were named with others names Jan was named Mary Sue and David was named Bud.<br />One day Skip when he was going to his home he found a rose in color. He did not talked about it. There started some problems in the Pleasantville because something was started having color. In Pleasantville also was not rain one day was raining and there was a rainbow.  People hate the people how dress clothes in color and they were fight to destroy all that was in color.<BR>People started doing things wrongs and Mary Sue started read books and she did things that she never like to do. One day their mother change to color but her husband did know what was happening to her, Bud helped to her by putting make up in he face.<br />Later they went to court to talk about what was happening there were people in color and people white and black. When one people hate the persons in colors    he said than that could not happen there because here was a perfect world, but suddenly he change to color and they cannot believe it.<br />There was more people and things in color; Mary Sue was reading a book when she changes to color. There started everything wrong, people started doing things wrongs and finally everything and the persons change.<br />This movie was good I learn that people live better with out problems and is bat to live doing wrongs things.

0786867973|5.0|I am not a 'girly girl'. Babies do not make me coo with delight, I have never been able to finish an issue of 'Cosmo', 'Seventeen', or 'Woman's Day', I do not obsess about my weight and I have no idea what either an empire waist or princess seam is. So imagine my surprise when I flicked on my TV one day, saw someone in a pair of jeans and a nice blouse separating eggs with her bare fingers and whipping up some delicious looking meals, and thought to myself \\"that looks like fun\\".<br />That someone, of course, was Nigella Lawson and as soon as I could, I borrowed a copy of 'Domestic Goddess' and decided to give my kitchen skills a workout. I'd never made anything from scratch before in my life and was absolutely terrified but the book made it so easy, so comfortable, so fail-safe, I was trying new recipes as fast as I could scrounge up the ingredients and I had bought a copy of my own within a month.<br />The book itself retains all of Nigella's warmth and easygoing manner; it's like having a British friend in your kitchen with you. She never makes you take the longer, more complicated route through recipes and freely admits to using her microwave to speed up some processes. Since the recipes are mostly for baked goods you have to follow some exactly or risk flat bread and misshapen cakes but once you get comfortable there is plenty of room for experimentation. Blackberries are not cheap and whipped heavy cream is too bland for my tastes so I use Cool Whip and Black Raspberry preserves for the center of my Victoria Sponge Cakes.<br />Depending on how cooking inclined you are you might find yourself having to shop for things like Springform pans and ramekins but the Chocolate Baby Cakes alone are worth the price. All the desserts are excellent and, though a lot of the meat pies and breads are a little too English for most American palates (Game Pie with pork belly anyone?), you're bound to find something you you'd like to try at least once.<br />You owe it to yourselfto give the Garlic and Parsley Hearth Breads a chance, the recipe is a bit challenging but the smell it fills your house with, along with the taste of the final product is all the reward you'll need. <br />So while I still have no idea which handbag goes with what outfit or the difference between formal and black-tie, I do think that nothing pulls together an ensemble quite as nicely as an apron.
6304806426|2.0|I want someone to explain to me why so many Oscar-winning Best Pictures have gotten such terrible treatment on DVD.  See the bottom of this review for a complete list of discs 'Not' to get! \\"The English Patient\\" concerns itself with the identity of a downed pilot, so badly burned that he is unrecognizable to the allies who temporarily save him from death.  Ralph Fiennes is the man of mystery, Juliette Binoche, his faithful nurse and William DaFoe the stranger out to discover the truth.  This is a sweeping, grand epic that is quite interesting in its own right, though if you've read the book on which the film was based, you will be disappointed with the handling of some of the aspects of the story.  There's also some gratuitous nudity that really has no point being included.  It did nothing for my admiration of Kristin Scott Thomas' acting abilities. <BR>\\"The English Patient\\" is widescreen but not anamorphically enhanced.  The feature is also split in half on a 'flipper' disc, a real pain.  There's a goodly amount of edge enhancement, pixelization and shimmering of fine details that distract throughout the movie.  Colors are also not well balanced.  Some digital grit and a lot of film grain also present.  If this is what Miramax calls a \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" I'm not sure I want to see what their regular DVD releases look like.  THERE ARE NO EXTRAS.  Not even a theatrical trailer and no audio commentary or \\"making-of\\" to accompany this epic story of tragic love.  BOTTOM LINE: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!<br />P.S. Here's that list of other Oscar Winning Best Pictures currently available on DVD but in painful-looking transfers: GOING MY WAY, THE DEER HUNTER, THE STING, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, THE LAST EMPEROR, THE GODFATHER, THE GODFATHER PART II, YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, CHARIOTS OF FIRE,  THE APARTMENT, TOM JONES.  All represent a low in image quality and mastering efforts.  Many are not anamorphic and some are not even in widescreen - COME ON! GET WITH THE PROGRAM!!!

B00004RFCM|1.0|Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker)writes a weekly newspaper column about sex. And she's not starved for plot lines.  All she has to do is ask her friends, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha.  So what's a girl to do with her time in-between writing for the love-lorn and sexually starved?  Fall in love with Mr. Big (Chris Noth - of Law & Order fame), naturally. <BR>This series is one of my all time television favorites.  It deals with the oft' taboo subject of sex with frank humor and down right crude legitimacy.  The characters are well drawn and the plot lines are engaging.<BR>Why then has HBO done such a lousy job in mastering the series for DVD?!?  There is so much digital grit that the image quality on these discs is akin to watching a regular television signal through the worst blizzard of the century.  Colors are muddy and weak.  Contrast levels are horribly low. There are all sorts of aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement problems.  BOTTOM LINE: this is one of the worst examples of DVD mastering ever!<BR>If you absolutely can't live without the series I suppose you'll have to buy it like this. But if I were you, I'd much prefer having my guilty little pleasures preserved in memory's eye from watching the series, as presented in considerably better quality, on HBO television. <BR>*Aside: I usually don't comment on presentation but the packaging of the discs is equally pathetic.  We don't even get a slip or booklet with the chapter listings or little blurbs or snippets about the characters and series.  If I could have, I would have given this DVD set 'zero' stars.  <BR>**Aside Part II: The second season on DVD is a bit better in image quality than the first, but it's still lightyears behind most digital transfers available today.  So as far as \\"Sex and The City\\" goes - JUST SAY NO!
B000001EHS|4.0|This cd is a great introduction for the new Def Leppard fan (like myself).  I do not own any other of their cds, so I don't really mind that most of this music was off their Hysteria cd.  Here's a quick song run through:<br />POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME: 10/10, I like this song. There most well-known, and what got me interested in this group.<BR>PHOTOGRAPH: 10/10, Great song, love the vocals<BR>LOVE BITES: 8/10, Not a bad ballad, but nothing special here.<BR>LET'S GET ROCKED: 8/10, Interesting, but not a favorite.<BR>TWO STEPS BEHIND: 10/10, This is a great ballad.<BR>ANIMAL: 10/10, I really enjoy this song, the singer gets into it.<BR>FOOLIN: 10/10, without a doubt the best song on this cd.<BR>ROCKET: 9/10, This has an awkward beginning, but picks up near the end.<BR>WHEN LOVE AND HATE COLLIDE: 8/10, An ok song, nothing too great<BR>ARMAGEDDON IT: 10/10 Great song, second favorite.<BR>HAVE YOU EVER NEEDED SOMEONE SO BAD: 8/10 Another ballad, getting a little tiring.<BR>ROCK OF AGES; 8/10, not bad, not spectacular.<BR>HYSTERIA: 9/10, This is a pretty impressive ballad.<BR>MISS YOU IN A HEARTBEAT: 7/10 not a fan of this song<BR>BRINGIN ON THE HEARTBREAK: 7/10 I would think they could have found a stronger ending to this cd.<br />overall, i would recommend this album to anyone who just wants a quick overview of Def Leppard without having to buy all of their cds. My one complaint: WAYYYYYY to many ballads on here!
6305212112|4.0|Based on the novel by Fannie Flagg, \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" follows the exploits of Iggie Threadgoode, a tomboy who, after the loss of her beloved brother, endears herself to an upright young woman.  In between their relationship the issues of racial tension, spousal abuse and murder are dealt with, maturely and honestly. This is the sort of film often disparagingly refered to as a woman's picture, but so full of charm, grace, intelligence and poignant performances that one could easily be a guy and cry by the end of the final fade out. <BR>Universal Studios has done an exceptional job on this DVD.  You not only get the extended director's cut of the film but a keen documentary and a host of other intelligent special features that, for once, do not satisfy simply superficial demands for \\"made-up\\" extras.  <BR>The print used to remaster the film has been well preserved and is beautifully represented.  There is some minor pixelization, edge enhancement, shimmering details and faint (I mean faint) aliasing problems but nothing that will rob you from experiencing this movie with the greatest of emotional depth.  If you have never seen this movie, it is on my top ten list of American films I think every living person should be required to see.  Another is \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\".  Enjoy!
6304118392|5.0|This movie is an EPIC!!! Misunderstood by many people. But behind the violence and blood, this is a great piece of art!!!<BR>Oliver Stone confronts us with our near future society, when we are on the edge of a lawless society. Two crazy kids who have seen too much TV go berserk and violently kill the people who get in their way. Because of the media-hype and attention they get, they don't wan't to stop; so in a way this movie is a satire on the media. <BR>But all things come to an end, and they're caught by a crazy police inspector Tom Sizemore. The jail is runned by Tommy Lee Jones, and he really plays his best role here.<BR>The movie is shot in color, black&white and on many videoformats, which is very stylish, because Oliver thought it all over in the scenario. This makes it the ultimate MTV-movie. I mean short shots following each other up in a very fast way.<BR>Great soundtrack with 3 Leonard Cohen songs incl. the future. Great choice of music. And a great script, by Quentin Tarantino, with catchy phrases that makes you think. For instance when Woody gives the live interview, he states that he thinks it's normal to kill other people and other living things. Everybody kills but instead of calling it murder they call it \\"industry\\". This made me think a lot, and along with the crazy characters and happenings in this movie, I could only say after watching this movie: 't's a crazy world we live in! And why blame Oliver Stone? He just reflects society, and I think the opponents of this movie just can't handle reality.<BR>Don't turn your back on the darkside of life; face it!<BR>The movies are not the blame for violence; violence is here since the dawn of mankind, the movies are here for merely a century. The violence and blood in this movie is just the \\"paint\\", you have to see and understand the big picture.<BR>Along with Pulp fiction, Killing Zoe, Reservoir dogs and True Romance this movie belong to the \\"nouvelle violence\\" genre, a genre that got much attention in the 90s, but already started in 1986 with Henry:portrait of a serial killer.
B00004XPPK|4.0|Like so many other film noir classics of the golden age, the plot of \\"Gilda\\" really makes no sense.  She's in love with a penniless bum, Johnny (Glen Ford)who just happens to fall into a tub of butter after a big time casino thug (Joel McCready)who also happens to be Gilda's new husband, elevates Johnny to the level of fellow racketeer.  There's also some business involving some Nazi's but this is extremely sketchy at best.  What is really quite bizarre is the way Johnny and Gilda seem to absolutely hate one another until five minutes before the film is over.  One thing about the film remains electric, Rita Hayworth!  Her striptease and song \\"Put The Blame on Mame\\" is one of a handful of the cinema's guilty pleasures.  <BR>I'm not certain whether Columbia Home Video is deliberately trying to tick off their consumer base with this release or not.  Although most of the film exhibits a fairly good transfer, there are moments when the film element is down right grainy.  Scratches inherent in the original camera negative are quite prominent in spots.  No aliaising or shimmering of fine details, thank heaven! The audio is nicely restored.  Columbia gives us a featurette as a suppliment but here too I get the sense from Columbia that they really just wanted to tick me off.  The featurette starts out good, has a ton of clips to show Hayworth's rise as a major screen goddess and then, right in the middle of her career, quite suddenly just ends with a blacked out screen.  No summation of Rita, the actress, the women or the legend.  Nothing!  Hey, Columbia, if you're going to do a documentary - do the whole thing! BOTTOM LINE: Movie - yes.  Extras - NO!!!
0131103628|5.0|This is the only book on C I ever owned. Enough said?
B000089RVX|5.0|Incredible... that's the only word i can think of describing this cd.  How did i come across such an incredible cd?  I was on the way to the mall, and just as i was hitting the parking lot, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; was just being played on the radio.  I couldn't believe it, in my opinion, it was the first rock band with a female vocalist that really could be dubbed damned near one of the greatest albums ever.  I heard this song and i ran in and bought the cd as quickly as possible.  I really didn't believe, at the time, that the entire album could be that good.  Every second of &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; you're taken in by haunting and extremely beautiful yet powerful vocals, easily some of the best i've heard in years.  Aside from the vocals, the guitars and rising tension of the song constantly pull you in further and further.  To my surprise, i listened to the cd and didn't hear a single thing that made me think anything other than what an incredible band this is.  I wouldn't say i like any songs better than &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and i wouldn't say it's one of the best songs on the cd in a sense, because every single song is one of the best.  Easily the greatest things going for Evanescence are the powerful vocals and deep lyrics, but it takes the entire package to really pull you in.  If i could give more than 5 stars, i would.  Evansecence isn't just a rock band with a female singer, the power you feel when listening gives it its own category that stands out from anything else available.  I strongly urge that anyone and everyone buys this cd.
0812548094|5.0|Returning from the first book, The veil holding back the Keeper is torn, and Richard and Khalan have to split up in order to figure out how to save the world. Richard is taken away to the Sisters of the Light to be taught about how to control his wizard power in order to keep from dying, only to find out that it would take hundreds of years to do so at the Palace surrounded by a magic that lengthens life. He's gotta figure out a way to get out of that situation in time to save the world from Darken Raul's spirit and be with Khalan again. Khalan on the other hand is planning to reunite the Midlands by way of force against a new threat known as the Imperial Order. And with all of that, again, another prophecy is in the way of their plans.<br />Probably one of my faves, although it's hard for me to dislike any of them. It has plenty of fighting, adventure, suspense, and character development. There are a couple more twists I found in this book than the last, so it kept me more glued. The only parts of the book that I had to force myself through were when it gets to talking about Zedd and Adie, but I know it is necessary and it wasn't so bad (i just got so into what was happening to the others).<br />The only gripe i got is the decription of how Sisters of the Light became true Sisters of the Dark. I'm not much of a reader for sexual scenes such as that, but it was kinda original (unless other fantasy books had creatures from the underworld have sex with women in order to give the women greater power). I don't know if I'd want my mom to read this book, although I got her into the first...maybe she can handle it better than I. She DOES read those romance novels, and I could only imagine what was in them.<br />We're introduced to a couple new characters like Ann, Nathan, Verna, Chaundlan(sp?), and Warren, who do more in the next books. There were a few minor characters that I wished would have expanded even more in this, but maybe the ones I'm thinking will in future books.<br />Prophecies seem to be a major part of \\"The Sword of Truth\\" series, but it would be hard to make a big deal bout them in one book, and take them out in another. The good thing about these prophecies is that they are somewhat true, but not literally true all of the time, and hopefully I get caught off guard every time.<br />The action is awesome, even if it was a small army of naked soldiers painted white against a large army of drunken, handicapped (not mentally, but if u read it u'll realize the handicaps involved) warriors. Khalan has got to be the greatest woman in a book to know: she's a beautiful, kind woman and a great battle strategist (what more could you ask for?).<br />I basically loved this book, and the whole series overall. Another re-adding of great story-telling done by Terry Goodkind. I thank him for having me spend most of my days reading his books while I have had homework to do. Sooner or later, my parents are going to ground me from reading...imagine that.
B00005JLK1|3.0|\\"Ghost ship\\" is your average last-decade horror movie. There are many movies with plots similar to this one, just varying the environment (but in all movies it is an enclosed location - this time it was an oceanliner) and the kind of horrible thing that haunts the characters. Just as an example, \\"Ghost ship\\" is very similar to two recent movies of the same kind: \\"Hause on haunted hill\\" and \\"Deep blue sea\\". Even the proportions of the ethnic origin of the actors are the same in these movies.<br />\\"Ghost ship\\" 's plot is: a group of ship rescuers (they won't do anything if there's not any money involved, of course) lead by Gabriel Byrne is approached by a young man who claims to have seen from the air an abandoned oceanliner. When they get there, Byrne discovers it is the \\"Antonio Grazi\\", a ship that was reported missing since 1962. That's when the team discovers a hidden treasure and strange things begin to happen. OK, everybody knew what the plot was.<br />So let me say other things about the film: the first scenes are very well-though and well-made and, like other reviewers, I thought I was in the wrong movie. The first mass-killing scenes are also good. The story is full of flaws and some highly-unbelieving death scenes. The prodution of the movie is competent and Steve Beck is a regular director, but knows how to keep the audience paying attention to the screen without laughing too much. Following a recent fashion in horror movies, an important character dies; the ending tries to be clever and innovative, but in fact it was not so different from what I was expecting.<br />So, \\"Ghost ship\\" is nothing the average viewer hasn't seen a hundred times. There are some cool visual effects, etc. etc. Go watch it if you have 1 1/2 hours to spare.<br />Grade 6.7/10
B00007L4MJ|5.0|The sets in Metropolis are so fantastic that, if it had sound it would be fun to watch with the sound turned off.  There's not much to the story but the DVD is everything it should be; full of bonus material and interesting insights.<br />Given that sections of the original are lost forever it seems pointless to split hairs about the absolute authenticity of what remains.
B000006NPY|4.0|I've never owned the album proper, but I have listened to parts of it quite a bit and I can say without a doubt that this is their neglected masterpiece.  Worlds better than their end-career peter-out MACHINA, possibly more cohesive than Mellon Collie, this is a spectacularly low-key work in the spirit of other such releases at the time, such as REM's \\"Up\\" and even Radiohead's \\"OK Computer,\\" if just for the more subtle, muted approach.<br />Guitar solos are very few and even farther between.  The only recognizably guitar-based tracks (mostly from my memory) are \\"Ava Adore,\\" \\"Perfect,\\" \\"Tear,\\" and \\"For Martha.\\"  The Pumpkins, however, prove they are masters of their game no matter what instruments they filter their sound through.  Proof of this is evident from he first track, \\"To Sheila,\\" probably the gentlest of acoustic numbers Corgan and Co. have ever penned, with lulling, breathy harmonies in the chorus and distant beats as if they were sounding across a vast barren desert.  \\"Ava Adore\\" serves as the resident rocker, although a high-charged, almost trip-hoppy one.  Though the lyrics leave much to be desired, it does give the album some nice contrast.  Same with \\"Perfect\\" and \\"Tear,\\" the former being a \\"1979\\"-style acoustic number, the latter being a vacuous ode-to-Corgan-angst tale of lost love and death.  From my memory, \\"Daphne Descends\\" does a good job of mining the same acoustic/electronic vein as \\"Perfect.\\"  <br />From there, however, the record becomes absolutely stunning.  \\"For Martha\\" is an impassioned epic with great guitar work from Corgan, and \\"Blank Page's\\" moroseness is pretty affecting, as well.  Overall, a solid effort, and despite the band's forays into silliness, this album is yet another reason to remember them by.  Great.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is obviously a perfect movie, one that makes me happy not only every time I watch it, but every time I think back to it. There's a reason the movie gained a big following after coming out. It just made everyone who saw it happy to be alive. But be careful.. With great DVD options comes great responsibility. Is it worth it to watch the making-of features, the Q &amp; A, the featurettes and the commentaries to ruin the magic of the movie? I watched all of the 2 DVD set one day and though it enhanced my enjoyment and appreciation of the movie, something was lost. The mystery is gone.<br />Still a perfect movie for everyone. Unless you're one of those people who hates subtitles.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Incredible music! A worthy second CD! Grade: A+

B00000I07P|5.0|This is the greatest of all of Bon Jovi's albums.  Its first track, &quot;Let it rock&quot; opens loud and strong, grabs you with the first note and does not let you go until the last note of the last song.  There is nothing wrong with this album.  The songs are upbeat and exciting, the instrument playing perfect.  I highly reccomend this album to any one out there who wants to start listening to Bon Jovi.  True, this is there 3rd album, but its where you will find most of their biggest hits from the 80s, like &quot;Livin on a Prayer&quot; and You give love a bad name&quot;.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya has always had her own very distinctive sound, comprised of equal parts of her glorious voice, emphatic bass lines, melodic piano and strings, all with roots in the Celtic folk song, but transformed to something all can enjoy. With this album, she has created a mosaic of pieces that are all very different from each other (something that could not be said of some of her tracks on earlier albums), but which together form a picture that is emotionally satisfying and solidly rounded.<br />Only Time is the feature track, a number one song that has had incredible staying power on the charts, but it is only one amongst several tracks of equal strength. One by One combines a haunting chorus with a set of dramatic he/she lyrics, a paean to the staying power of loving relationships throughout challenges. Lazy Days, the last track, will put you on your back in that summer field of long ago, when there were no deadlines to meet, where the day was yours to dispose of just as you wanted. Tempus Vernum is a center point around which the other tracks revolve, with a heavy, driving rhythm and choral vocals in Latin that are pure Gothic, a track marvelously different and inventive. Wild Child is near pop rock, a song that will pull you in with its chorus phrasing. And just to prove that she can mesmerize without her voice, Silver Inches is an all too short instrumental.<br />A remarkable set of captivating songs. With most albums, you are lucky if there are two or three really good pieces. With this one, there are no duds, only different flavors, each scrumptious.
B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World is truly the best movie of 2001.  No film has ever captured the misanthropic teenage character so perfectly.  Thora Birch plays the lead character, Enid.  She is smart, witty, and full of angst towards the dull unoriginal suburban world around her.  A lesser movie would have made her into a pretentious urban snob, but Ghost World sets her apart.  She lives in the suburbs and knows that the Reggie listening, city living, starbucks visiting, pseudo intellectuals are no better than the sheep she went to high school with.  She lives in her own world where originality and uncompromising integrity is all that is of worth.  She finds this in Seymour (Steve Buscemi).  He appears on the surface as a run down loser with negligible social skills.  Enid begins her relationship with him as his tormentor.  She is in danger of becoming what she despises, but her feelings for him evolve from contempt to pity to admiration.  Seymour doesn't dress in the hippest clothes, he doesn't drive the nicest car, and he works at a pathetic job, but he has a spirit that Enid latches onto.  Her pervious partner in crime, Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) has begun to transform into the hipster coffeehouse person that Enid loathes.  She is upset that her best friend is \\"growing up\\" and is starting to join the masses while leaving her on the fringe.  As she gets closer with Seymour the inevitable happens.  Credit go to the directing an the screenplay that avoids the clich ending and opts for a more suitable ambiguous finish that characters that are written and played this smartly deserve.
0790749815|5.0|\\"North by Northwest\\" (1959) is Hitchcock's slick and polished cross country adventure meets `the wrong man' scenario. When advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for an American CIA agent by the man he is supposed to be tailing, Mr. Van Damme (James Mason), Roger finds himself the victim of multiple attempted assassinations and a harried chase to unravel the mystery behind the insidious girl with whom he's suddenly fallen in love - Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Fueled by an unmitigated desire to make \\"the\\" Hitchcock picture to top all others, screenwriter Ernest Lehman creates two of the most memorable set pieces in film history: Roger's frantic escape on foot from a marauding bi-plane, and, the magnificent climax - fleeing across the faces of Mt. Rushmore. Naturally, park officials would not permit this latter scenario to be played out hence MGM recreated the famed landmark on a soundstage using full scale sets combined with matte paintings and rear projection. The results are flawless and thrilling. The film also contains one of the all time blooper shots in cinema: seconds before Eve shoots Roger with a fake gun in the commissary a small child can be seen in the background clutching his eardrums in anticipation of the bang.     * This is the same transfer as was made previously available on the single disc of \\"North by Northwest.\\"  Through a meticulous frame by frame restoration effort, \\"North by Northwest\\" looks better than it ever has on home video. Colors are rich, bold and vibrant. Contrast levels are bang on. Blacks are deep and solid. Whites are remarkably clean. There are NO age related artifacts and NO digital anomalies for an image that is positively stunning from start to finish. Truly, this is one of the best examples of a classic restored to its original brilliance for the digital format. Certainly it is the finest example of a Vista-Vision film restoration out on the home video market to date! The audio has been remixed to stereo with a spatial spread that is engaging and does not betray its 50 year plus vintage. Extras include a very benign documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint. It is incredibly long on personal thoughts and terribly short on detailing the production schedule. Overall, not nearly as compelling as the documentaries that accompany Universal's Hitchcock films.
0684833395|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  One minute you're doubled over in laughter and just when you think the book is hilarious, Heller ripes you apart with a juxtoposition of tragedy.  The editorial review stated that reading this book used to be a right of passage - considering today's world events, I wish it still was.
6305546789|5.0|Until very recently, John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween&quot; was the most successful independant film of all time and for very good reason.  It is a viceral fright fest of B-flick slasher moments elevated to fine art by the shear intensity of its staging and  the performances. Jamie Lee Curtis is Laurie Stroud, a baby-sitter who finds herself at the mercy of Michael Myers, the resident psycho, out to cut a few throats in the small town of  Haddonfield. Also stars Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis, the psychiatrist who is determined to have Michael perminantly put away.<br />This two disc special edition from Anchor Bay is a revelation for fans.  Disc one is the original theatrical cut while disc two represents the television version, including scenes that John Carpenter excised from the theatrical version.  Both versions are presented in anamorphic widescreen and both have been remixed to a stirring 5.1 surround audio.  There's also a great documentary that incorporates all sorts of interviews from the principle cast and production team, as well as theatrical trailers, television ads and a stills gallery.<br />Anchor Bay has meticulously remastered this film from fine grain elements and given it a THX certification that for once, is worthy of the catch phrase, &quot;for optimal video and audio&quot; performance. Color fidelity is remarkable.  Black levels are consistent and low.  Contrast levels are superb.  There is no hint of edge enhancement, aliasing, or any of the other digital problems that dogged the original DVD release. Really, this movie has never looked quite so good before, perhaps even in its initial roadshow engagement.  Top marks all around.  BOTTOM LINE: GET IT TODAY!

1558216847|5.0|For those of you who doubt whether a person can walk out of Siberia, I had a Polish great-uncle who was captured by the Russians at the end of WWI.  He was sent to a work camp in Siberia, managed to escape, and worked his way across Russia...through Western Europe...across the Atlantic...and finally to Wisconsin, where he showed up at my great-grandmother's farm in the mid-1930s.<br />For those who doubt the existence of Slavomir Rawicz, I quote from a letter tipped-in to a signed first British edition of the book in my posession.  At that time, Slavomir and Marjorie (his wife) were living on Bondgate Street in Castle Donington (between Sheffield and Nottingham).  My volume was presented to Reverend Father Grasaw--their parish priest on March 26, 1956:<br />&quot;Dear Father Grasaw,<br />My husband would be very pleased if you would accept the enclosed copy of his story.  You have always been a good friend to those who are exiled and lonely, and a good friend to him.<br />I hope that you are well, I often think and pray for you and the work you are doing.  My family and myself send you our very best wishes. <br />God Bless You.<br />Yours Sincerely,<br />Marjorie M. R. Rawicz&quot;<br />I wish that my great-uncle were alive today, so that I could document his own story in the tradition of THE LONG WALK.  I'd bet that he and Slav would have some interesting stories to swap.

B00004U8H4|4.0|American Psycho, the book, seems like an easy fit to the screen in terms of visuals.  But what's difficult to transfer to the film is the actual excess of style.  For instance, in the book you can note the actual style in which the book is structured.  There are entire chapters that, by the style they're done in and the placement they're given, tell the reader that they are non-essential.  The rants on Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the News--these run 5-6 pages in the book and are best skipped.  (Though if you go through them you find some great lines.)  In a film it's difficult to do that because they would equate to 5 more minutes on the running time and a bored audience.<br />Anyway, onto the film.  I thought American Psycho was as good an adaptation as anyone could hope for if they're a fan of the book.  Mary Harron (a female director making the ultimate movie about \\"men behaving badly\\" as she puts it in the featurette) does two things: she makes the film a real treat for those who read the book, and she makes the film funny and witty enough for those just wondering what the fuss is.  Plenty of people will figure out what the book must have been like once they see the movie.<br />I don't where to start except to say you owe it yourself to see this excellent independent film.  ...  Christian Bale is amazing as Patrick Bateman.  The accent is great, the facial expressions priceless (that look he gets when examining a rival's business card), the whole play he does on the character.  It looks like everyone gets what Ellis was doing with the book.  Everyone may hear about the notoriety of the book, but in the end American Psycho was the blackest of comedies, forcing the reader to try and laugh at moments that are interspersed with some of the most disturbing passages I've read in a long time.<br />The filmmakers do an incredible and difficult job of cutting the book down to filmable size.  It's a great job of picking scenes from the book for the screen, meanwhile leaving out entire sections and characters (Bethanie, his ex-girlfriend) but not compromising the whole thing.  This could be a 3 hour movie, instead it's under 100 minutes and feels just right.<br />Christian Bale is so commanding as Bateman that he gives a real face to the narrator of the book.  The film even keeps some of the violence, but watching those scenes from the book played off they take on a humerous tone that the black and white page was hiding well.  For instance, the murder of Al, the bum, becomes funny when Bateman starts saying those lines.  The film is not a comedy, it's a not horror movie, it's not a drama.  It's a very vicious satire that combines all of those elements and stays smart.<br />I don't see a more famous Hollywood or not-Hollywood director making this without compromising more of the book in favor of personal style.<br />Interesting to note: For some reason the UK region DVD (which you can't play over here) has 6 deleted scenes!  The American DVD has a number of nice extras, but why would they leave off the deleted scenes?  Sure, they're cutting room floor, but at least 2 of the scenes would have fit nicely into the film, and the other bits are funny as well.  ...<br />This is a highly recommended film for anyone with a little dark side, no matter how little.  It's funny and visually provoking enough for many people to fall in love with this small production and appreciate cruel satire and the blackest humor.leaving out entire sections and characters (Bethanie, his ex-girlfriend) but not compromising the whole thing.

B000002IMG|5.0|A survey of some of the greatest 80's metal albums would be worthless without this 1988 wonder.  In close quarters with _Peace Sells_ and perhaps only reigned over by the ubiquitous _Master of Puppets_, _The New Order_ smokes them all by a nautical mile on chops and taste.  Guitarist Alex Skolnick was so far advanced over any of his peers, technically and melodically, that he ended up floating over to fusion (someone asked what he was doing after Testament - check out Savatage _Handful of Rain_ and his fusion band Attention Deficit, also the jazz-oriented Alex Skolnick Trio).  The album teems with incredible playing, at times eerie and atmospheric as it is technical and erudite.  The gorgeous \\"Hypnosis\\", \\"Musical Death: A Dirge\\" and especially his  playing on \\"Trial By Fire\\" - which alone could fill an entire volume on proper foundation for metal guitar theory - is simply unmistakable and beautiful.  At the time, other than maybe Jason Becker and one or two other boys hiding in the Shrapnel metal stable, there was simply no one that was even CLOSE to being his peer, technically or artistically (well - maybe Hammett, but Skolnick still owns me to this day).  Of course, this album wouldn't be important as it is if there wasnt an incredible band behind Skolnick, one of the best to ever lay claim to the mantle of thrash.  Chuck Billy remains one of metal's best-kept secrets, posessing at once both terrifying range and demonic growls.  Eric Petersen ably supports Skolnick's nimble arpeggios with excellent songwriting, compositional and sympathetic rhythm work, and bassist Greg Christian and rock-solid, never flashy Louie Clemente complete the lineup of the best metal band to never quite make it big.  Boasting classic thrash-metal production from Alex Peralias, the band tears through terrific speed-metal numbers like \\"The Preacher\\", \\"Disciples of The Watch\\" and the bonadfide classic \\"Into The Pit\\" with a fury rarely seen at that time, or any other.  A highlight which somehow, beyond belief, seemed to get left off of BOTH of the Testament \\"best of\\" compliations, is the fantastic Aerosmith cover \\"Nobody's Fault\\", and should be reason alone to get this album if your Testament collection is unthinkably lacking it.   Perhaps owing to its brevity, but more due to its varied textures, idiosyncratic and complex songwriting, and strong performances, this is the very best album this incarnation of the band ever put out, vastly superior to the somewhat more melodic but less-consistent _Practice What You Preach_, _Souls of Black_ and swan song _The Ritual_.  Mark these words: own this, and your record collection will bear the unmistakable stamp of a metal masterpiece.
0792839749|4.0|What a fantastic family film.  I purchased the DVD last week and my small children just love the music, as I do!  This will always remain a classic for me and I am extatic it was available on DVD!
B000001IPL|5.0|This was one of the very first CD's I bought when I got my first CD player, and as long as I've had it and as many CD's have been in and out of my collection in that time, this still stands as one of the strongest. This CD is perfect in every way and is Offspring in their prime. If they were still writing albums as powerful as this today, they might have been my favorite band. Like I stated before, this album is completely flawless. &quot;Come Out &amp; Play&quot; and &quot;Self Esteem&quot; are already modern-rock classics, but in order to get to the really good stuff, you must dig deeper. &quot;Bad Habit&quot; is essential Offspring, an ode to road-rage with some blatantly raw and hilarious lyrics (&quot;You get on my a--/your foot's on the gas/and your next breath is your last...&quot;). The title track is another great example of this album's power. This is a song for outsiders who are outside the outsiders. For people so far removed and unique that they don't bother trying to fit into all the typical angry-punk cliches. Definetly an anthem for my former school-years. &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; is one of the least successful singles, but probably the best of all of the singles released off this disc, probably the catchiest song ever written about paranoia. I could talk about all of the songs on here for pages, I have listened to this album hundreds of times and dissected it so many ways, I know the tracklisting like the back of my hand (whatever that means). This CD is highly addictive. Everyone I know who owns it, loves it. It's not just a CD for punk fans, it's one of those rare albums that EVERYONE can appreciate. It really is such a shame that their past two albums have been mindless fluff, because the Offspring have shown us that they can write highly intelligent, personal and free spirited music, as opposed to, well, &quot;Original Prankster.&quot;

One who saw you as a raw but precision thing, a jewel that, with wisdom, could be polished to a proud shine?\\"<br />I can only hope that one day that one student of mine would feel about me and what I tried to do for them as Mitch Albom felt about Morrie Schwartz, his favourite professor in college.  \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is more than just a beautiful story about a student reunited with his professor 16 years later, it's more than just a story about a dying man and his last days, it's a story about how to live your life, to grasp life by it's hand and run as fast as you can with it, all the while cherishing every last minute.  While it is extremely relevant for anyone that is in a mentoring type relationship or in a teaching position, it also holds true for anyone that wants to think more about their current habits and how they can change in their day to day habits to lead a more simple and fulfilling life.<br />Reading this book was a revelation for me.  How often do I work so hard that I put everything else off until I try to finish my never ending list of tasks to do?  How often do I tell my family I am too busy, or tell myself I am too busy or I don't deserve to have special moments or to treat myself?  How often do I tell friends that I can't come out to play because I have so much to do?  If you get nothing else from this book, at least see the message of how a simple life, full of love, is the best thing in the world.  How we should be happy and grateful for every minute we have here, with our loved ones, our friends, even with those that we don't know, and how what we do really affects those around us.  <br />I read this book in an afternoon, the whole time with tears pouring down my cheeks.  I was amazed at the strength and courage of Morrie Schwartz, as he watched his once life filled body slowly turn into stone.  I prayed for a different ending to the book, but on reflection, the reason his story has so much impact isbecause he did not run away from what was going to happen to him, instead he embraced death and through dying, found a way to tell the world how to live.  I felt a fondness for a man I had never met, I felt grief for his family for their loss, I empathized with Mitch because he was about to lose what he had just found and yet I laughed with joy at Morrie's stories and I thought deeply about how I would feel if that was my life.<br />This book did an excellent job of making me realize how grateful I should be to be alive, with my life, my health, my family and my friends and also how I need not take these things for granted.  I enjoyed the flashbacks to the days of Mitch as a student and the relationship that developed with Morrie.  I loved that they met on Tuesdays and were \\"Tuesday people\\". I thought the emotions that Mitch poured out on paper were so real and touching, he did an excellent job of capturing Morrie's last days, and their friendship.  As a teacher, I can only dream that I could ever affect my students in the way that Morrie affected his.  Here is a man that stopped chanting at a Basketball game just by simply stating a question, had his students come in touch with their feelings, have people from all over the country visit him in his last days, and he did this with a grace and dignity that only so few of us possess.  <br />I want to be just like Morrie Schwartz, a teacher, a friend, a confidant, a supporter, and even if I manage to be only minutely like this, my life will be all the better for it. I encourage you to read this book because of its simple and heartfelt message about the beauty inside of each of us and the potential for all us to become great people.
B00008BXJF|5.0|A lot will be said about this disk because it's one of King Crimson's best and they're an influential band. The important thing is that The Power to Believe contains great music that is both emotionally rich and intellectually stimulating. The disk accomplishes the seemingly impossible by being forward looking and at the same time consolidating the rich KC tradition. If you never have heard KC before, then this is a good place to start. If you're an old fan, this disk will not disappoint.<br />Many have said that this is \\"heavy\\" music and that is true enough. One reviewer wrote that \\"KC has not mellowed with age.\\" But it also is deeply felt music that resonates with the world situation (in ways that are up to the listener). Another reviewer said \\"in the face of war, KC makes hopeful thunder.\\" That's a good formulation. The music sounds grim at times but also is brimming with hope. I get a similar feeling listening to composers like Mahler and bands like Tool.<br />Other amazon reviewers have pointed out the brilliance of these performances and of Machine's wonderful, clear-as-a-bell recording.  It's all true!  Anyone with an interest in \\"tweaking\\" rock music for the sake of new musical and expressive frontiers should listen to this disk.<br />May I suggest that it's Grammy time for King Crimson?!
B00005K3OT|5.0|Vianne Rocher and her daughter Anouk literally blow into the small village of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes on the North Wind.  Vianne opens a chocolateri much to the dismay of the villagers, especially the Counte de Reynaud.  Her story is full of hope and of friendship and more importantly about tolerance.  Some say it's a comedy and although has a few funny moments, it's not a comedy.  Plus, it will make you want to go out and eat wonderful chocolat!
B0000035E7|5.0|For true Nirvana fans who can get past just the radio-friendly tracks and see the band for what it really is. Not to say the popular songs weren't good, but come on now. Bleach is one of those albums that gets better everytime you hear it until every song becomes a personal favorite. Which, in fact makes this one of my favorite albums period. I don't know about some of these others that came along apparently following Nirvana's trail as &quot;grunge&quot; bands. If there is a such thing as grunge, this is it. And if Nirvana is where grunge started, then it's where it ended to.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I can't fathom the inspiration to degrade such a beautiful film as this.  It seems so close-minded and obtuse for someone to speak so harshly about David Lynch's films.  He is one of the best director's around today.  If it wasn't for his deeply rich and utterly thought-provoking films, movieland would be an utter wasteland.<br />Please give this film a chance.  It is beautiful and deeply poetic, at times hilarious and at other times sweetly emotional.  Many people write it off as a confusing, meaningless flic, but if you stop trying to \\"figure it out\\" and just let it be (like a painting in a museum), it'll all make plenty of sense.  That's one of the great things about Lynch, he doesn't answer all the questions and he doesn't tie up all the loose ends.  If you're left wondering, all the better.  But, if you really want to know what this movie is about, I can tell you in one sentence.  However, I'll refrain, so that I don't ruin it for you.<br />If you'd like to see a Lynch film that is very simple and easy to understand, try \\"The Straight Story.\\"
B00005JKZT|5.0|I was spellbound by the previous Lord Of The Rings film, \\"Fellowship Of The Ring\\". The previous is more like an introduction to the characters of the trilogy. However, that one, as powerful, riveting, and astounding as Fellowship is, it is eclipsed by this second installment film in the three part trilogy The Two Towers. The cast of this movie is perfect. The same held true with the previous as well. The thing that I found vastly improved was the grouchy dwarf Gimli. I wasnt fond of him as he seemed selfish, pompous and having a too big of an ego in the first LOTR movie but in the second LOTR movie, he was vastly improved in this movie. Gimli was much funnier expressed much more humor, and showed a much more heroic attitude to become one of the highlight characters in my opinion.<br />The whole imaginative world that J. R. Tolkien built in his mind wouldve put anything that George Lucas or Steven Spielberg wouldve imagined to shame. No pun intended. He made up entire languages, entire language accents, entire worlds, it goes on. He wouldve been impressed by the movie screen adaptations. No other novel that Ive read has been so well adapted to the big screen like Lord Of The Rings has and I doubt itll be surpassed for a long time if ever. What I find amazing about the LOTR movies so far is that things that make most other fantasy movies rather cheesy sometimes, they add so much to this movies power and emotion especially the talk treelike people, the Ents.<br />Just trying to be able to put even a drop of the creativity that Tolkien had, onto the big screen seemed impossible but with the help of Peter Jackson, doing so succeeded in every way. Ian McKellen was perfect to play Gandalf. I especially find it wonderful to see the husky voiced Christopher Lee play the renegade wizard Saruman. Even the Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger team doesnt stand a chance against the menacing Saruman, Gandalf, Frodo, or Aragorn. Those movies are all classics but The Two Towers alone in more powerful than Star Wars, & Harry Potter combined! Jacksons directing is stunning & mind boggling. In fact, from my perspective, this movie is on the border of being perfect! The visuals are amazing especially with the Saurons Eye, and the lightning above Mt. Doom, as well as the birds eye view of Sarumans Tower Palace and the Gates to it and not to mention the green creature Gollum. The way they made the computer generated creature look almost like real life footage is unbelievable and the pain, madness, and sadness is expressed in his eyes are crystal clear. The storylines are incredible emotionally deep and moving. There isnt one drop of talent that is wasted in the movie.<br />Picking up where \\"The Fellowship of The Ring\\" left off where Frodo and Samwise were when they saw the fiery Mount Doom, the two run into the alienish looking creature Gollum, a former Hobbit named Sm&eacute;agol, who found the Ring after it being lost and forgotten for thousands of years and being tormented by it's power for hundreds of years before Bilbo Baggins found it after Gollum lost it and Frodo now had the ring and is on his bid to destroy it in the fires of Mt. Doom but encounters Gollum, the one who found it after it was lost for thousands of years. Due to the permanent mental poisoning caused by the ring and his experience of the rings power, not to mention that he seems to suffer from schizophrenia, he guides Frodo & Samwise (who does not trust Gollum) towards the fiery Mt. Doom. At the same time, Aragorn, Legolas, & Gimli hunt down orcs that captured Pippin & Merry during the battle that claimed the life of Borimir in the last movie and involved the Fellowship being dispersed with Frodo going on his own. The two hobbits escape the orcs though and what lies ahead for them is well, lets just say, out of this world.<br />However, that is not the main thing that makes this one rank above Fellowship What makes this one even more powerful is that towards the ending, theres a powerful message at the ending that is oh so true but Im not going to give it out on this review as I feel that doing so would spoil the thrills. I had sky high hopes for The Two Towers but to my surprise, this movie not only met them, it surpassed them by a thousand miles to become my favorite movie of all time. Ill admit that yes, there are more characters, events and others things in the books than there are in the movies but the movies themselves are so mind-boggling and stunning that its totally forgivable as it would be impossible to yank everything out of the books without making the individual movies at the very least 5 hours long!<br />I think overall, I think this one may as well turn out to be the best of the three, as well as the one with the most substance. All I can do now is try to keep myself entertained as I now begin the excruciating one year wait for the cataclysmic finale Return of the King and witness the final battle to save Middle Earth from the evil clutches of Sauron. Ultimately, these three movies will become legendary classics as the years progress and become favorites for generations to come. I look forward spending 9 to 10 hours watching all three LOTR movies the whole way through when all three of them are out on video. Go see this movie pronto! Okay, maybe I might be exaggerating myself but believe me, there isnt enough I can to to express how much I love this incredible movie.  Well, Im now pretty much exhausted of words. Bye! Bye!

B00005QDW1|5.0|If you've been having a pretty glum day or if you just want to feel better, this is the only cd there is! I've tried listening to pop:(, metal, punk, rock, and all those other genres but this is the only cd that has worked so far! There's not one song I dislike! Listen to it for 3 seconds and it'll get your head bopping! Get this cd or you're going to be wasting your green! This is one of those albums where you buy it and go \\"What would I do without you? Hell, I'd even pay 35 bucks for you!\\"
B00008CHEU|5.0|I was sceptical, at first, to buy the t.A.T.u. album because I had only heard the girls' first single. Although I loved the first single &quot;All the Things She Said&quot;, I wasn't sure if I'd be happy with the entire album. But after listening to the entire thing, I just can't seem to stop listening to it. The girls have a very unique sound and, to me, they sound like nobody else out there! And yes, the lesbian aspect. Well, all I can say it that the lesbian factor makes me give them all the more respect, they aren't afraid to be themselves! And if you don't like lesbians, let me tell you it doesn't even matter; these songs ROCK!
B000002UTH|5.0|I disagree with KP from Seattle. This album is one of the best 80's RHCP, next to Mother's Milk. By teaming up with George Clinton (what a brilliant idea that was!) you get equal parts funk and Parliament and old school insanity. The horn lines are tight, the grooves are funky, the singing, well Anthony really didn't learn to sing until Blood Sugar. But he's got that testosterone thing happening. On Sly Stone's &quot;If You Want Me To Stay&quot; I could almost swear it's George Clinton (or Sly himself) singing. If you like the funky side of RHCP and a little more control on the frat-mentality of the later albums, you won't be disappointed with this. There's good production from George and good horn arrangements (my guess is by Flea and George...). Don't pass it up.
B00005MKA1|5.0|I rarely get albums for just one song, but the track \\"Sun is Shining\\" was reason enough for me to pick up Bob Marley's wondrous \\"Kaya.\\" In my opinion, it stands as one of his best and most memorable tracks, even if it doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Fortunately, the fun on \\"Kaya\\" doesn't end there. Marley's most popular and memorable love song, \\"Is This Love\\" also surfaces, and it burns with as much urgency and feeling as it did back in the day. It's certainly one of his trademark songs. Other noteworthy cuts include \\"Satisfy My Soul\\" and the heartfelt breakup jam \\"She's Gone.\\" And I'd be a fool not to acknowledge the excellent \\"Misty Morning\\" which still holds up amazingly well. This is well-grounded music affectionately crafted with love and attention to detail, and it's just one of many albums that cements Marley as among the most vital and influential musicians. If Marley's hits collection \\"Legend\\" is all you own, then you owe it to yourself to pick up \\"Kaya.\\" It's a true classic.
B000002UV1|5.0|Great Album - just wanted to say Subway to Venus features Flea on trumpet as part of a horn section that is kicking out some serious chops. Jeez - and if you haven't seen their \\"Funky Monks\\" documentary of the making of Blood Sugar, you have missed seeing Flea noodling around on the trumpet - he blew me away - I wonder if he's on trumpet on Freaky Styley as well? He also plays trumpet on one other tune on this album. Mother's Milk is a lot of fun, but Subway To Venus is a quintessential RHCP tune! These guys are one of the biggest current talents, and Anthony has finally learned to sing...
B00005JKZT|5.0|The second part to Peter Jackson's collosal LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is even more visually impressive than FELLOWSHIP, with new characters including King Theoden, Eomer, Grima Wormtounge and the ancient Treebeard. This time around, the fellowship has parted into three groups; Frodo and Sam force Gollum to take them to the black gate at Mordor and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin. And the Istari Gandalf returns as the more powerful Gandalf the White after defeating the Balrog. The story is more emotional than Fellowship, and the central characters are stronger presences than before. Jackson's excellent direction makes this one of the most amazing films ever made. From the march of the ents toward Isengard, Saruman unleashing his army to \\"Destroy the world of men\\", it all culminates in the incredible battle of Helm's Deep, an amazing action sequence where the seamless blend of CG and live-action builds up to a fantastic climax. Howard Shore's strident score encapsulates the very essence of Tolkein's thoughts and emotions. Ian McKellen turns in another great performance as Gandalf, but it is Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn who does most of the action here, and he's great. John Rhys- Davies and Orlando Bloom provide strong gravitas, plus with such a vast array of strong supporting actors, the combined strength of veterans like Benard Hill as Theoden and Christopher Lee as Saruman makes the story come alive. As strong as the characters are in TOWERS however, it's the CG-created Gollum that is the most amazing. Putting lame Jar-Jar and Harry Potter creatures to shame, Andy Serkis' performance helps the emotional presence of an essentially computer-generated character come to life. Treebeard and the Ents are fantastic examples of top-notch CG, but they say that the best effects are the ones you don't notice, which is true in this film. You are so focused on the story, the fleshed-out characters and the spirit of Tolkein's tome coming to life that the CG is simply assisting the tale. This is a film which you have to watch at least three times to fully appreciate all the effort that went into making a true masterpiece. I can't wait for RETURN OF THE KING...s simply assisting the tale. This is a film which you have to watch at least three times to fully appreciate all the effort that went into making a true masterpiece. I can't wait for RETURN OF THE KING...
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica is the greatest metal band(im taking about Metallica of ye olde, nothing after the black album(I didnt rely like the black album tough)) They're nothing like that nu-metal stuff that has been going around. You fall into 2 catagories. 1-You are a metallica fan, if you are buy this album now, no need to preview the songs, just buy it. 2-You are discovering and exploring rock and its good bands, and only have heard a few of metallicas songs. If you want to start with a Metallica album, I would start with Ride the Lightning. This is exellent though. Ive Listened to this album countless times and have never gotten board with it, there are solos apon solos, the riffs are amazing and you wonder why Lars Ulrichs arms arent falling of(drummer) with the speed hes going at, This is the heaviest Metallica album and, in my opinion, the best, go out and buy it.
B00003CXWV|5.0|My husband told me about this movie. I looked on my only website for purchasing (amazon.com) ROCKS! anyway, i bought it and when i watched it for the first time i fell in love with this movie. it is an excellent movie, very informative and interesting. It had me zooned into from beginning to end. I was mad when it went off!!.
B000001ESF|3.0|Rewind:  1975 - Rush had high hopes for Caress of Steel, but faced savage criticism against that album, and since it tanked, the supporting tour was labelled &quot;down the tubes&quot;, as in demotion back to the club circuit.  <BR>  Rush didn't get mad, they got even.  The 2112 epic (side 1 on the vinyl LP, for those who don't know from vinyl) has nothing to do with futurism, contrary to appearances...it is a criticism of 1976 pop culture(the priests) and the impassive music media (Temples of Syrinx and their great computers) that had no room for alternative ideas.  In the song, the pundits are defeated by Rush, metaphorically, at the Grand Finale when &quot;Attention all planets...&quot; is iterated 3 times (one time per member of Rush, get it?). <BR>  There are other sub-interpretations within the song as well...In the plotline, the protagonist suicides after his guitar is destroyed and he dreams of a better world he'll never see under the rule of the priests.  He dies, so he doesn't live to see the world freed from oppression.  The deeper meaning is that if you (the listener)give up on your aspirations, you'll never realize them...if you hold on, you may live to see better times.  The ironic Grand Finale serves as a lesson that we should all endeavour to see things through and not give up too soon.<BR>  'nuff said...so why only 3/5 stars?  Because after &quot;Passage...&quot; the remainder of the album is weak by Rush standards.  I believe Rush made better albums, and especially better concept albums that hold a concept all the way through.  As a rock album vs other rock albums, I'd give it 4 or 4 1/2 out of 5.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Although methinks the crestfallen folkie vibe may not be 100% legit (think about it: were any of Bowie's drastic poses on the level?), I'm still impressed with most of these songs -- even if the two faster sound like Peter Gabriel.  Or is it Bowie?
B000002IOW|1.0|The one star out of five is a comparison of Presto vs all other Rush albums...against all rock albums, I give it 3/5, because Rush is incapable of making a bad album.  <BR>  I'll never understand why many reviewers call this a 'back to basics' album.  This was the first of a two record series where<BR>Rupert Hine was brought in to co-produce (and sing back-up).  Reportedly, the recording experience was very positive and Rush actually finished a month ahead of schedule.  So what went wrong?  For starters, Alex was pushed firmly to one side on this record, with the guitar parts reduced to complimentary jangles.  Geddy's use of the Wal bass doesn't suit his style...this would be rectified when he made the jump back to Fender.  The lyrics could have benefited from more time spent on refinement.  For example, \\"All of us get lost in the darkness/dreamers learn to steer by the stars\\" is a beautiful verse...but, it's followed by \\"all of us do time in the gutter, dreamers turn to look at the cars\\"  Errr...I know it rhymes, but I don't quite get it...oh, well.  That said, \\"The Pass\\" is still a powerful, well-intentioned song that really comes across live (they still play it in concert).  But as an album, Presto is among their least essential works.  Things didn't really improve with RTB.
B00006JJ51|5.0|What can you say about such an incredible album? Well, first of all if you don't own any N.W.A material you should go out and get this a.s.a.p. This is just like the original album except for a few bonus tracks. However, the bonus cuts arn't really that great, I would of liked to see Boyz N Tha Hood or 100 Miles and Runnin' instead of a bunch of extended mixes. Anyway the poor bonus tracks do not at all take away from the greatness of the actual album. This was truly a historical album and any hip-hop fan (especially of west-coast and gangsta rap) should definitely have this album.
B000002H6C|3.0|Troubles with this album:<br />* Drum sound: horrible. Lars Ulrich is not a great drummer, never will be (but he thinks about himself as a genius, that's for sure! The lord of arrogance)<br />* Jason Newsted was a scapegoat for the pain they suffered after Cliff Burton's death. Hetfield and Ulrich simply erased his bass lines from the album! WHy they did such a thing I don't know.<br />* No great solos by Hammett.<br />The good things:<br />* the last album where Metllica did not play \\"safe\\" and tried to write memorable heavy metal songs.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I got hooked on Incubus last summer with the release of thier single \\"warning\\". Ever since then, incubus has been my favorite band. Morning View is the perfect mix of melodic melodies and hard hitting rock. The second track is by far my favorite: \\"Circles\\". One of the harder tracks on the album, it is an example of classic incubus. \\"Wish you were here\\" is a great catchy pop song with relaxing verses and an uplifting choruses.\\"Blood on the ground\\" is another harder tune: A masterpiece! \\"Mexico\\" is a great song featuring the acoustic guitar. At first, I didn't enjoy \\"Are you in?\\" becuase I thought it was boring and it had no word besides \\"are you in?\\". But please give this track a second listen! It really is a great song and it shows off the skills of DJ Chris Kilmore. Also, the vocal talents of Brandon Boyd are amazing on this album. Buy this CD !!!
B000002B7S|2.0|I used to enjoy Ozzy a lot but, since I've learned some weird things about his business practices, I must admit it became harder and harder for me to distinguish between his persona and his work.<br />Of course I still love BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN (the ones featuring the ORIGINAL bass player and drummer, not the re-recorded trash Ozzy released in 2002. Even BARK AT THE MOON is very good. But to learn that Ozzy , for a great part of his career, did no write EVEN THE LYRICS for his albums is something shocking.<br />In BARK AT THE MOON, free from Kerslake and using Bob Daisley as a last moment replacement, he credited himself as the sole composer for all the songs, that were, in truth, written by Daisley and Jake E. Lee....Amazing.

B00005JM1D|3.0|The last few times I went out to a movie, I saw films that depicted melodrama and violence. \\"Old School\\" was a very good diversion of not only the last two movies I saw, but a distraction from the real world.  We all need it once in a while, for those of us who appreciate silly comedies like \\"Old School\\".  Also, fans of Will Ferrell are going to laugh their butts off while seeing him streak.  Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn also star, and I thought they were all very funny and entertaining in their roles.  As usual, Wilson plays the straight man, but I can't help but adore him.  He is sweet and sexy at the same time.  After Wilson's character, Mitch, finds out his girl, played by Juliette Lewis, is cheating on him with internet buddies, he moves away. The house he is renting is right near a college campus.<br />Ferrell's character, Frank the tank, a newlywed, is still not ready to settle down. When Beanie, Vaughn's character suggestst they start a fraternity in Mitch's house, Frank's marriage quickly dissipates after the Fraternity starts.<br />If you like mindless, dumb comedies with some hilarious cameos, this is right up your alley.<br />I recommend this!! GO have fun...
6305499365|4.0|Office Space will appeal to almost anybody who has worked in the corporate world. Pretty much everyone who has had to work in a cubicle will find something they can identify with in this film. Office Space uncannily recreates and satirizes situations most of us have had on the job, whether it is the ominous threat of a reduction in force, listening to corporate gobbledygook or dealing with a smarmy jerk of a boss. <br />The difference between those of us in the real world and Ron Livingston's character is that he loses all cares about his hated job and actually strikes back at the corporate powers that be. As such, the first half of this film is absolutely hilarious. We vicariously live out our dreams to smash the jam-prone printer, knock out a cubicle wall, and skip work for a day of fishing. Fortifying the movie are quirky supporting characters - a white computer geek who listens to gangsta rap, a perpetually cheery temp, a mumbling weirdo, and so forth. <br />The movie does begin to drag a bit during the second half, as the story moves away from office rebellion, to a floundering embezzlement scheme. Nevertheless, this movie has something for almost everybody who has worked in the rat race, and is just the right thing to watch after a bad day at work. Mmmmmm, yeah.
B000002J1Y|2.0|Man,<br />What a disapointment! Some of the most incredilbly rich music ever recorded live given the &quot;remaster&quot; label and being just about the worst cd I've ever heard. One listen was all I could muster. The music it'self is stellar but it's like looking at a Van Gogh through a veil.<BR>  As the Grateful Dead are proving you can take master tapes from the 1970's and clean them up to cd standards. Who ever was in charge of this needs to be held accountable and this is one cd that deserves a great effort to clean up.<br />Do yourself a favor and look for an old LP. Sounds WAY better on vinyl!<BR>My .02,<BR>W
B00005QGAZ|5.0|THRILLER became the most successful album in history, selling over 50 million worldwide. And its easy to see why. Michael Jackson is simply good at what he does. The music is irresistible, you can't help but dance or sing along. The music is original, like no other music out there. He paved the way for many artists, and its easy to see why people call him a legend, because he is. THRILLER is one of his shining moments in his career, and it proved to be a huge success for him. The &quot;Thriller&quot; short film became famous for its screenplay and film work, and rightfully so, the choreography was excellent and like nothing else. Other big hits from this album include &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; (with Paul McCartney), &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Something&quot;, and more. This version comes with bonus tracks, demo versions, and a lot of interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton. This is a must have, if you don't have it or want to revisit the magic, this one's a good one to buy.
B00005JL96|4.0|In a nutshell, the reason you should see \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is Lilo and Stitch, apparently not so nice girl and very wild animal from the outer space.  In spite of, or to many, because of their wild behaviors, you come to like them anyway.  The film is cute in the 21th century style, which means very edgy.<br />The greatest part of the entire film is the friendship between a lonely girl Lilo living in Hawaii, and the strange creature (and actually an escaped convict) from the space Stitch.  The lonely girl decides to buy this \\"dog\\" despite the advice of her guardian/elder sister Nani.  And as you know, troubles ensue before they finally come to need each other.<br />And other characters are thrown into the story -- a scientist and his assistant who try to capture Stitch, the social worker (who looks like a guy from \\"Pulp Fiction\\" ... and his voice is provided by Ving Rhames who was in it!), but quite frankly, none of them works as well as the central characters.  But as the girl Lilo and Stitch are so believable that we really hope that they finally get what they want.  And that is the crutial point of the film's success.<br />The film's humor is always wacky (and far wackier than usual fares of Disney), sometimes sacrificing the coherent storytelling.  Thus you see Elvis impersonation and mayhems in Hawaiian coasts, but the final effect is rewarding.  This is one step ahead of usual Disney animation, and comprises not just messages and beautiful songs; it also shows wild, sometimes devilish behaviors of kids (and the animal), which give an authentic tone to the film.<br />Also unusual decision is the sisters have no parents; Nani has a kind-hearted male friend, but he is not exactly a boy friend.  In this way, \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" avoids the pitfalls of clithes (and there are NO boys visible.)  Perhaps you should have known \\"Lilo\\" is different when you see the name of child actor Daveigh Chase, still 11 years old, who has been in extremely edgy \\"Donny Darko\\" and unnervingly creepy \\"The Ring.\\"  Oh, and she also gives the voice of the heroine \\"Spirited Away,\\" another Japanese animation film that is far from the usual outings of Disney. <br />The backdrops of Hawaii are drawn with water color painting, of which tender hue and touch suitablly enhance the characters' wacky movements.  And for all the weakness of the story, the two main characters Lilo and Stitch will steal your heart.  Provided it is open, of course.
B00005JKCH|3.0|You'll be able to sit through it, but that's about all.  Weren't you comic fans expecting a whole lot more from this flick?  It's not awful, but it doesn't deliver.
B00005B4GU|3.0|pablo honey, the bends, and ok computer are flawless albums (with the exception of 'fitter happier', which is excusable).  every song is A+.  finally radiohead disappointed me with kid a, which had some flawless songs (optimistic, idioteque, and mps, for instance), but also had just some good songs, and a disappointing 'treefingers'.<br />it wasn't until amnesiac until radiohead really showed me disappointment.  still, the album isn't a total disappointment.<br />Packt Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box - this is one of the most boring songs i've ever heard.  i don't believe in skipping tracks when listening to music, but i can't imagine anybody NOT skipping this track.  D<br />Pyramid Song - this song is incomplete.  thom, when you get done writing &quot;pyramid song&quot;, i would like to hear the completed version.  i think what you have so far has some potential.  B<br />Pull Pulk Revolving Doors - oh god.  i can't believe some people actually pretend to like this song.  thom, i would like a handwritten apology.  actually, i would like for you to write on a chalkboard 50 times, &quot;i will not write any songs as bad as pull pulk revolving doors, even though i know that numerous people will pretend to like anything that i write.&quot;  F<br />You and Whose Army? - finally a good song.  A<br />I Might Be Wrong - even better.  A<br />Knives Out - another great song.  A<br />The Morning Bell Amnesiac - using the same song on 2 albums should be against the law.<br />Dollars &amp; Cents - this song pretends to be good, but it really isn't.  C<br />Hunting Bears - it's a neat instrumental, but it's only an instrumental.  C<br />Like Spinning Plates - huh?  C<br />Life in a Glass House - and it ends with a wonderful song.  A
B00005JKG9|5.0|I saw this movie and really like it, but I was curious about the title. Who is Glen Ross?
B000065MKH|5.0|What can possibly be said about \\"Casablanca\\" that has not been said in essays, documentaries, reviews, books, and websites? Not a whole lot. So I guess I'll just repeat what everyone else has already said: it's one of the greatest films of all time (second, I'd say, after \\"Citizen Kane\\"), it has truly superb acting by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Dooley Wilson, Paul Henreid, Claud Rains, and Peter Lorre, it has a great love story, and some of the best cinematography ever.<BR>This DVD looks sharp as sharp can be, with a brilliant new transfer that has hardly any scratches and looks far superior to fuzzy old videos and TV broadcasts. On the special features front, there's a documentary that's from an old video (with the exception of a newly added epilogue about \\"Casablanca\\" sequels, parodies, and imitations). There's a new introduction by Laurel Bacall (which is actually tacked on at the beginning of the documentary), as well as trailers for \\"Casablanca,\\" \\"Maltese Falcon,\\" \\"Key Largo,\\" and a million other Bogart films.
B000000OAA|5.0|As far as I am concerned, Queen's Sheer Heart Attack is most definitely their best album.  They are my ever so most favorite band in the world, and this album is a perfect example of some of the major reasons why -- all the members were involved in every facet of this album (all 4 had writing credits somewhere or another), and there is so much diversity and ability displayed on the album.  With that being said, let's have a look-see at what can be found on this album:<br />Brighton Rock -- The ultimate concert song.  This has always had a live feel to it, and the song gives the most creative rock guitarist ever, Brian May, a chance to stand alone for a little while and really show off.<br />Killer Queen -- It is not hard to see why this song is one of the band's most beloved and recognizable tracks.  Great musicianship and wonderful lyrics twisted together in an extremely campy sound makes for a timeless classic; one of the best songs to come out of Queen.<br />Tenement Funster -- Roger Taylor really shines on this song.  A classic-style rocker/ballad that is right down the raspy-voiced drummer's alley.<br />Flick of the Wrist -- If you haven't heard this song, then it is easily one of the best Queen songs you haven't heard.  If you have heard this song, then you know why.  Piercing lyrics and great musical effects add up for a wonderful song.  The vacuum effect at the end of this song (or the beginning of 'Lily of the Valley') is truly more genius from one of the smartest rock bands ever.<br />Lily of the Valley -- This song is reminiscent of a petite female:  short but sweet.  Absolutely beautifully done and couldn't have been pulled off better.<br />Now I'm Here -- Another ultimate concert song.  Very powerful beat and lyrics that leave you guessing make this song more than just a hit, for chart position often means too little.<br />In the Lap of the Gods -- Although very unusual, there is nothing wrong with this song, as Queen once again displays its ability tocombine camp and opera-style music with good rock-and-roll.<br />Stone Cold Crazy -- Just drips with energy.  Fast-paced and powerful beat.  It wouldn't matter what Freddie Mercury was singing--it would still be a good song--but as an added bonus the lyrics are quite neat too.  There's nothing like the idea of shooting strangers with a real-looking \\"rubber tommy water gun.\\"<br />Dear Friends -- This may not have the overall lasting feel of 'Lily of the Valley' but the harmonizing on this track is definitely memorable and pretty as a picture.<br />Misfire -- John Deacon is all over the place (barring singing) on this next mini-song (the third on the album that's under 2 minutes), writing and playing, as the liner notes put it, \\"almost all guitars.\\"<br />Bring Back That Leroy Brown -- Basically, I don't like this song, but I must give Queen a hand for pulling off their versatility act once more with a big-band ragtime feeling from this song.  Kinda silly lyric-wise but that's okay.<br />She Makes Me (stormtrooper in stilettos) -- To this day the second half of this song title haunts me as to what it's truly referring to.  As 'Tenement Funster' gave Roger Taylor his moment in the sun and 'Misfire' with John Deacon, 'She Makes Me' is Brian May's opportunity to flaunt his vocal ability and great guitar effects and sounds.  I absolutely love this song to death, plain and simple.<br />In The Lap of the Gods... Revisited -- Much better than the first song in the two-part session found on this album.  Goes back to 'Flick of the Wrist' and its stories of some crooked individual who is cheating people out of money and fame, and actually seems to connect more to that song than the original 'In The Lap of the Gods'.  All in all, an absolutely wonderful piece of work and a deserving finish to such a great album.<br />While Queen II may have solidified a space on the music map for Queen, and A Night At the Opera launched them into eternal superstardom, Sheer Heart Attack made themstars.  You can think of it in terms of the Beatles:  Queen II was like Rubber Soul, A Night At the Opera was Sgt. Pepper's, but Sheer Heart Attack was like Revolver (and the last time I checked Revolver was voted the #1 album of all time on a certain prominent poll).  Sheer Heart Attack was the best in a long line of great albums from a band who often doesn't get enough credit in the U.S. for being as amazing as they were.
6305922756|5.0|It&#8217;d be a clich to write that on a scale of one to ten, this film goes to eleven, but it&#8217;s true. This is the best &#8220;mockumentary&#8221; ever made. Its subtle, biting jabs at the rock and role industry helped pave the way for great comedies like &#8220;Waiting for Guffman&#8221; and &#8220;Best In Show,&#8221; and the performances (especially by Christopher Guest) are true class. Plus, this movie has just tons of memorable scenes (the amp that goes to eleven, the Stonehenge concert, the airport scene).<BR>This DVD is also truly spectacular, and a must for Spinal Tap fans. The new 1.85:1 digital transfer looks a bit grainy, but it always has. The new 5.1 soundtrack is just plain excellent, finally giving us the chance to hear &#8220;Big Bottom,&#8221; &#8220;Hell Hole,&#8221; and &#8220;Sex Farm&#8221; in surround.<BR>There are a ton of extras as well, most notable being the commentary by Guest, harry Shearer, and Michael McKean, who are in full character as Spinal Tap. It&#8217;s as funny as the film itself. There&#8217;s a new interview with Rob Reiner&#8217;s Marty DiBergi, a bunch of very funny deleted scenes, several press conferences and interviews, trailers, TV spots, and even music videos. <BR>This is a fan&#8217;s dream.
B000002J09|4.0|Let me first set things straight that Led Zeppelin IV (or whatever you want to call it) is an AMAZING album.  That being said, I do have a few un-positive comments.  Perhaps its commercial success is the only reason why it seems so, but the album appears (at least to me) to be somewhat overrated as a whole.  Sure, it has timeless classics on it, but, and I hate to use the dreaded word, some of the stuff sometimes feels like filler (there, I said it) material.  Here's some (well actually all) of the material you can find on this classic:<br />Black Dog -- Absolutely raunchy and overly filthy.  That's why I love it so much.  Great mix of blues and hard-rock, which Zeppelin perfected like no other band.<br />Rock And Roll -- One of the band's most recognizable tracks (from endless radio play and Cadillac commercials), it is not hard to see why.  Fast paced, energetic, and well done.<br />Battle of Evermore -- And so we go from two strong rockers to a mystical ballad.  Don't take that wrong, though; this song is as good as any at times, although it can often get swallowed up by fans eager to listen to what is about to follow...<br />Stairway to Heaven -- Perhaps the most recognized (and statistically the most requested) song not just by Zeppelin, but EVER.  Let it be known that there has never been, nor probably ever will be, another song with the legend of Stairway.  Its lyrics have been interpreted many highly varying ways, but one way or another, the song epitomizes the versatility of the band and is no longer a song but rather a symbol of rock and roll.<br />Misty Mountain Hop -- Sometimes victimized by what preceeds, but always good.  Pleasing to the ear with a good rhythm and nice instrumental work.<br />Four Sticks -- Filler, filler, filler.  This song was what I spoke of earlier.  Every now and then an album just flat out has a black sheep, and this is it.  Although the physics of how it was recorded (the name comes from what John Bonham used to play drums on the track) can amaze, little else about it can.<br />Going to California -- I've never particularly fallen in love with this song, but it isn't bad either.  I can't knock Jimmy Page for putting on a great acoustic performance that isn't quite 'Bron-yr-Aur'-esque (by that I mean the instrumental from Physical Graffiti and not the folksy song from Led Zeppelin III), but still one that makes you want to learn how to do that.<br />When the Levee Breaks -- When you want to hear a power blues song from a great rock band, you can stop hear.  Beware, however, as the rhythm, absolutely driven by John Bonham's thunder-fisted percussion talents, could cause heart problems in some.<br />Although it has great songs, namely Black Dog, Rock and Roll, and Stairway, this is NOT, and I repeat NOT, Zeppelin's best album or really even close.  It's not the second best, it's not the third best (check out my Listmania list to see what is though!)...  However, this was easily the first Zeppelin album I got, and will probably be the most common \\"First Zeppelin Album I Owned,\\" as its worldwide sales will show.  However, as my tastes in Zeppelin began to mature, I realized that 'Hey, just because this has hits doesn't mean it's the best!\\"  Perhaps you will do so too, but you should still own this hands-down, and I cannot stress that enough:  BUY THE ALBUM, IT'S GREAT!!!  Just not the best Led Zeppelin album.
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating movies of the twentieth century: a comedic story about a nuclear apocalypse, which was made at the height of nuclear paranoia in the 1960s. At the time, it was the very definition of a tough sell. However, it features simply brilliant performances by Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Sterling Hayden, as well as great comedic writing and Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s always dependable direction (being a comedy, this was quite an unusual project for him). In fact, the movie was nominated for four Oscars (director, picture, actor (Sellers), and screenplay), and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a voice in the wilderness when I say that it deserved to win all of them.<BR>This DVD does justice to the film. It&#8217;s presented in its original full frame aspect ratio and looks nice and sharp. If the blacks appear a little light and there&#8217;s some grain, reflect that it was actually part of Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s artistic vision. In other words, it was intentional.<BR>Now onto the extras. The quality of these extras has put this DVD into my list of the best DVDs of all time. First off all, there&#8217;s the incredibly entertaining &#8220;Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove&#8221;, which covers everything from production to release to deleted scenes. There is a shorter documentary, &#8220;The Art of Stanley Kubrick From Short Films to Strangelove&#8221; that chronicles the early years of Kubrick&#8217;s career. It&#8217;s fascinating as well.<BR>Original split-screen interviews with George C. Scott and Peter Sellers (which were pre-recorded segments sent to TV stations across the country with scripted questions) are included. It would have benefited from newly shot interview material, but the questions are not difficult to figure out, and the interviews themselves are great.<BR>Rounding out the extras are a great original advertising documentary, trailers from &#8220;Strangelove,&#8221; &#8220;Fail-Safe,&#8221; and &#8220;Anatomy of a Murder,&#8221; Biographies, and a Booklet. Despite not being a real extra, but they&#8217;re quite possibly the best thing about this great DVD.
B000003TA4|5.0|What can I say about Nirvana's Nevermind?  I could talk about the cultural significance of this album, but it's already been done.  I could talk about the influence it had on the bands that followed, but I've been beaten to it. I could tell you that this music hit people like me who were in their teens or twenties back in the early '90's so hard that most of us haven't recovered yet, but you already know that.<br />What I can say is that I hadn't heard this album in about 8 years, after I lost my LP copy.  At the end of last year I got around to replacing it with the CD issue.  What surprised me was that 12 years on this material has not aged or become stale with time, but it's as fresh and vivid as it was back in the wild days of '91.  The honesty of the music and the true belief of the band shine through on track after track.  Nevermind must now be regarded as one of rocks finest moments; maybe it's last great fling before old age and the disease of corporate interference set in.  <br />Some will tell you that &quot;In Utero&quot; is Nirvana at their best, but as great as that album was, Nevermind is pure Nirvana before the fame, money and chemicals clouded their vision.  For the new comer this is rock at it's very best and for the old hands like me? Well it's nice to be right now and then!
B000002HH9|2.0|The real shame of this album is that Robert Smith left the best cuts off for B-sides.  Any Cure fan worth their salt should seek out all the B-sides for the singles (Adonais, It Used To Be Me, Ocean, A Pink Dream, Home, etc.) and record your own version, replacing all the hopelessly noxious pieces (Round and Round, Numb, etc.) with the B-sides.  What Bob was thinking when he left these off I haven't a clue - Ocean and It Used To Be Me are absolute masterpieces, and would have fit in with the theme of the album much better (just where are the mood swings, anyway?).  With the B-sides, it's four-star, without two-star.  Too bad he couldn't take a mulligan on this one and start over.
B000002BYD|3.0|Far removed from the emotional charge their early material, This album finds PJ much more laid back - Almost too laid back. At times Eddie sounds tired and off key and the band wander of on quite a number of tracks, trying different styles. This effort is uneven and lacks the great emotional songs of early PJ albums. Its not that I am one of those people stuck at the \\"Ten\\" era and I like mellow music as well, Its just that there is a lack of killer material here to suck me into this one. \\"Long Light\\" and \\"given to fly\\" are the few tracks that stick with me.
B0000524CY|5.0|The concept of good versus evil within the confines of a little girl wasn't the most original idea for a movie, dating back to the Bad Seed but the special effects the language the little girl evokes is what caused such a stir.  The country was also going through a tense time, race relations, Vietnam, the country was beginning to see it's own inherent evil and the feelings of massive distrust for the government and authority became prevalent.<BR>It took me several years and several tries to actually watch this film straight through.  The first time I fell asleep.  Which is no way a reflection on the movie, I was 10 when it came on TV and I fell asleep.  The next time was on cable and it was already in progress, I hate to watch films already in progress, kind of like arriving at dinner half way during the main course---what have I missed?<BR>So I eventually got the tape and watched it and while I agree that it's a great movie, I can see the building on purpose, the tricks that make it great.  Just because there are tricks doesn't mean that the film is bad, just that somone had the idea of how to present something that would be scary.  What really sets this film apart is that the little girl is so blatantly evil and destructive to others.  Thats the shocking part.  Before then the perception of children was much different than it is now and they weren't expected to be \\"evil\\".  Blend that with mood and stellar acting and you have a first rate movie.  Not to mention the whole mystique of the Catholic church having an exorcism branch.<BR>The never revealed footage basically is the cop droning on at the end about the nature of good and evil which really doesn't make sense because it adds a different kind of anxiety to the film's final moments.  Its good for completionists but in no way advances the film or adds a new dimension.  It just shows a sound editing choice.
B000002GK1|5.0|Soundgarden steamrolled into the nineties with their crazed blend of Sabbath-like metal and grunge. Chris Cornells vocal work here is really something else, going from somber and restrained singing to some mighty high notes. Thayills guitar is superb, really showing off his unique Indian, psychedelic and old school metal riffing style. The entire band is mighty fine.<br />Nearly every song is exceptional with: &quot;Rusty cage&quot;, &quot;outshined&quot;, &quot;room a thousand years&quot;, &quot;holy water&quot; and &quot;new damage&quot; my favourites.<br />This album is a timeless hard rock classic from a very creative and interesting band.
B000066C87|5.0|Its a fine line to manage so many different charcters in such a short period of time on film and make anyone stand out, mcuh less a large ensemble stand out.  The great part of this film is that what seems like a small tidbit of nothing information actually rockets forward and comes to mean something by the end.  The very concept of two worlds existing within one world and the secret relationships that permeate both eventually makes this a strong film.  I really liked it this film and heartily recommend it.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I have to admit that I was very skeptical about even watching Smallville. It airs on Tuesday night and I work every Tuesday night. Never thought twice about missing it. One week while taking vacation, I seen my first episode(1st season). And now I record it every week. One would think that its just another Superman movie or series...WHATEVER. No really, it is really interesting how they get into the life of Clark Kent. Not to mention his boyhood babefriends Lana and Cloe. Their relationships get you hooked. Then there is the darkside of the Force, Lex Luther and his equally mischievious father Lionel. Anyway, I don't miss a single episode!!! Its the only TV series that even remotely grabs my attention nowadays. I wish someone would come out with the complete season box sets, that would be way cool. The series gets more interesting as each week passes...unless its a rerun
B000075BFK|5.0|I've been anticipating this release ever since &quot;Until The End Of Time,&quot; and I was still totally stoked from the opening track to the last seconds of the LP (Which were mysterious, to say the least). I hope that this kind of stuff never dissipates;I can't get enough of Shakur's tell-it-like-it-is-isms.  I'd name my favs, but that's pointless, because all of these tracks are rock solid, or, in Tupacs words, &quot;Harder than a f----n' diamond.&quot;
B000069HK2|5.0|The used cd is probably the best cd I have purchased in years it.  It had many meaningful songs some louder than others which is good to have a band out there that is so vercitile.  I have recently been to there concert and it was awsome.  I could tell that the band had worked hard to get to where they are now.  So I am personally just writing this to say that The Used are a good investment for someone looking for a good semi-hardcoar punk cd.
0553579908|3.0|Martin does a fair job of interweaving a complex plot, but I wasn't totally drawn into his world. There are too many characters and not enough character development. I also felt the book was too long--there are long stretches where very little is going on.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Ms Swanson got her close-up on DVD. A classic film noir, but not the usual plot. Interesting for it's nod to the past of Hollywood film and its' starts. Watch for Keaton, Nilsson and the clip from Queen Kelly...the film directed by Von Stroheim, starring Swanson, which didn't go into release. It's a strange film, with a strange plot, but it works, due to the scenery and attention to detail. It opens with narration from Mr Holden, who is face down in an old swimming pool on the estate of a silent film star and slips easily into the story of how a man, driven by desperation walks into a mansion, into a burned out shell of a life and into a prison of his own making. As his life finally begins to take shape and give the character room for redemption and hope, he is confronted by the tragic flim star and her fear of loss and loneliness, driven to madness. Von Stroheim is a gem and made his character both sympathetic and tragic.
0316174483|5.0|Ed Emberley is fantastic, and I was so excited that he had a \\"new\\" book out that I didn't notice the small print. This isn't a new book, but a compilation of the Fingerprint Drawing Book and the Great Thumbprint Drawing Book. <br />I'm not upset, because I love giving these books as gifts and will happily give this one, but I was very disappointed that it was not, in fact, a new book from Emberley.
B00006RIO7|3.0|A terrific soundtrack,  The Cell Block Tango with Zeta-Jones et all is a delight , as is Class and When You're Good To Mama...all in all, an unusually good movie soundtrack, even if it pandered to the hip-hop crowd on the one track.
0553274503|4.0|Curious that \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" has apparently always been billed as a sci-fi novel since its publication in the 1950's. Instead, it is a powerfully human story about an extraordinary scientific achievement put to the test and what it costs its participants. Key among them is Charley Gordon, a bakery worker with an IQ of 68 that qualifies him for the title \\"retarded\\" and the vicious jokes of coworkers. Charley comes to be selected as the first human trial of a scientific-medical procedure hoped to increase the intelligence levels of subjects with low levels. It's already been proven successful in a lab mouse named Algernon. Charley, in the early stages of testing to assess his eligibility as the first human trial, has no real sense of the reason for the tests and instead has as his only purpose to beat \\"that real smart mouse\\" in such things as maze racing. Deemed an appropriate candidate, Charley has \\"the operation\\" and soon achieves has an IQ that gives him intellectual superiority over even his experimenters. But with the higher IQ comes a keener awareness of humanity and the fragility of the human heart, stirred by a lab assistant, and the painful and fleeting quality of love. All too soon, however, Charley's artificially induced intelligence begins to break down, and his preparation for it is nothing less than heartbreaking. In brilliant prose, author Daniel Keyes utilizes a personal diary technique written by Charley, and we are privileged to see his rise from mentally challenged to intellectual giant and back again. That, then, qualifies this true literary masterpiece as a human, not a sci-fi story, and its pure, unbridled power will leave you numb. Promise. The book later was turned into the film version titled \\"Charley\\" with actor Cliff Robertson, in the title role, nailing a richly earned Best Actor Oscar.
B000089RVX|5.0|The majority of bands today have a tendency of adapting other bands' styles to their own.  Not necessarily copying, but taking sounds and vibes and enhancing it to their own.  Very rarely does a band completely invent their own sound.  Recent unique sounds have been very rare, but Evanescence luckily adds to the very short list with their amazing debut album, an album that is by all definitions \\"perfect.\\"  Combining darkwave industrial, new age piano and some of the prettiest vocals since Sarah MacLachlan sang \\"Angel\\", Evanescence sets themself apart from every style of music known to man, creating their own unique sound that was not only experimental...but successful.<br />Everything enriches this band.  The lyrics are some of the most poetic I've ever seen, the combination of haunting choir music and heavy gothic rock is pulled of flawlessly for a very haunting effect, but at the same time will definitly make for some very intense mosh pits when this band starts touring.  <br />All I can add is that whenever a CD comes out like this one, it gives me reason to rejoice.  It lets me know that rock music has not died, and has not fallen victim to screaming and Fred Durst's \\"in-your-face\\" antics that Eminem provides us enough with.  Rock music still has a chance of survival, of going back to the days when melody was a part of this dying breed.  A handful of bands have triumped in this area, namely Sevendust, Incubus and Foo Fighters.  Time to add a new one to the list.   <br />Evanescence...welcome.  We've been waiting for you.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I enjoyed 'Nemesis,' quite a bit. There were some technical problems with the production, but they did not detract from the story (the worst being the rough editing, particularly at the beginning of the film).<br />As to the DVD itself, I just read on startrek.com how the 45 minutes of footage of film that were cut for the theatrical release will be on the disc...as extras. With the exception of one set of scenes (an earlier introduction of Shinzon, which would have detracted from the impact of his first encounter with Picard), the scenes SHOULD have been edited back in for the DVD release. Especially a conversation between Picard and Data at the wedding about life, loss, choices and consequences, which would have made the conclusion considerably more powerful than it was.<br />Fiscally, the film was a failure. It performed horribly at the box office and will likely be the last Trek film, at least for a good long while. After Berman's mangling of the Trek universe, it's probably just as well. Perhaps in 20 years, after RB has been devoured by rabid mutant pygmy goats or some other fitting end to his involvement in the Trek universe, another visionary will pick up the pieces and revitalise this otherwise magnificent idea of the future.
0141186666|5.0|This book is among my favorites. The rabbits are well decribed and personified, yet not to a point that is unimaginable. You feel sadness and anger at some points, and happiness, too. The journey the rabbits make is very perilous, and once you begin reading the end chapters, you'll find the book hard to put down, even though it was hard to put down in the first place! I would not recommend this book for children younger than 11, because of a few curses, and the fact the book is very large. Watership Down is a great book that any animal lover must read!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I absolutely love this album. I think that the music and whole message behind their music is awesome. BUT, I expected more than 8 songs on the album. Track 9-10 is a translation of tracks 1 and 2 into Russian (but they're really good! they sound even better in Russian!) And Track 11 is just a repeat of track 3 only 30 seconds longer. BUT this album is outstanding anyway...
B000002I55|3.0|(quoted from sleeve notes):\\"he plays a three-dimensional solo - rhythm and speed, then melodic speed, and the two together\\"<BR>\\"the emotion he uses liberates the rhythms and metres\\"<BR>\\"...the man who isn't bothered about \\"newness\\" or \\"difference\\" [says that] \\"he sounds like someone crying, talking, laughing\\" is having the soundest sort of response to Ornette Coleman's music.\\"<br />It's music, but not as you know it. If you like free-jazz - give it a shot. If your favourite jazz track is \\"take 5\\" then don't go near it. I found this a very hard album to listen to - and I like Captain Beefheart!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This movie is absolutely hysterical! About a Boy was a box-office smash in England, and went on to charm the world as another fine adaptation of a popular Nick Hornby novel. Hugh Grant is perfectly cast as Will, a self-absorbed trust-fund slacker who tries to improve his romantic odds by preying on desperate single mothers. His cynical strategy backfires when he recruits the misfit son of a suicidal mother to pose as his own son, (which I might add is quite humorous)and proving his parental prowess to his latest single-mom target (alos a classic moment). The kid has a warming effect on this ultimate cad, and what could have been a sappy tearjerker turns into a subtle, frequently hilarious portrait of familial quirks and elevated self-esteem. Heck the kid kills a duck with a loaf of bread, and I garantee your appendix will burst on that scene. All in all there is absolutely no reason that you shouldn't see this film, so BUY IT NOW!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD with the assumption that is would be as good as their hit on the DareDevil soundtrack.  Well, let me tell you, it's even better.  I love the mix of sounds in all their songs, ranging from Violins, Piano, Harmonic vocals, and even a touch of chant vocals.  In my opinion I think their music is a mix of Rifs ranging from Linkin Park to Tori Amos, their songwriting reminds me of Poe.  Overall I was Extremely excited to hear something new, fresh, and energetic.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This movie is just plain awesome. Lots of violence, lots of humor, lots of explosions, what more could a guy ask for? Plot=YES, Good Acting=YES, Good Story=YES, and Great Characters=YES! This is the ultimate action flick, and if you like shoot em' up films, this is definately for you. This movie is about a group of terrorist that take over a building and hold hostages all for the purpose of stealing $600,000,000, except they didn't count on an NYPD being there to spoil the whole thing. This is a wonderful movie, and even now it can apply to us. Defineately a must SEE!!!
B00006JJ1O|3.0|In my opinion I don't think this CD is all that bad.  I have a hard time listening to the whole thing at once.  Their singing (well, yelling) becomes a little aggrevating after some time.  I wish they would sing instead of yelling all their songs.  As for the actual songs...Not bad, they are catchy and provide some great music to mix/dance with, with a little touch of UK sound.
B00005YW4H|5.0|If you are looking for a CD that provides lovely, soft, jazzy sounds that will appeal to any age range or situation, this is the CD for you!  It's soft, sweet, just jazzy enough to be invigorating and the perfect backdrop to any social situation, as well as being the perfect tonic to what may ail you.  Norah Jones continues from where her father, Ravi Shankar, left off, providing easy to listen to and soothing tunes for a variety of age groups.  Buy this CD and I promise you will never regret it!
6303471714|1.0|Well, when i was at college, i seemed to put on alittle weight, as most freshman do.  While home over winter break i scanned Amazon.com for some good workout videos that i could do at school to keep myself trimmed and in shape.  My sister also purchased a few videos, and this video happened to be one of them.  I tried this tape out one day and found it to be horrible.  Every few minutes the camera angle changes making it confusing.  Another thing- While Radu is explaining the moves, Cindy is trying to talk at the same time!  <BR>It seems like it wasn't well thought out.  Instead of making you feel like you are working out along with the tape, it gives you the feel that Cindy just wanted a video tape of herself working out. <BR>As for the actual movements, there are some good moves in this tape, that is what the one star goes to.  However, for most of the moves, it seems like you are just trying to \\"whip\\" around your leg or arms as fast as you can and not really working or toning the muscles- just adding stress to the joints.<BR>If you're in it for camera tricks, scenery and a pretty girl, then you have the right tape, however, as for a workout, this tape is not worth the [money] i bought it for.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|The movie \\"Finding Forreseter\\" is about a young black boy named Jamal Wallace (played by Rob Brown) living in the Bronx of New York going to a poor high school.  Through Jamal's testing they found that he has a brilliant mind and is being accepted to a top of the line high school.  <br />  He has a special talent for writing.  He meats a famous author named William Forrester (played by Sean Connery) he helps Jamal discover his writing talent.<br /> This movie is a very powerful and emotional peace.  I enjoy it every time I see it.  My only regret of the movie is that it is not a true story.

B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee is a great vocalist and the tracks are put together very intelligently.  The piano and eerie tunes make for one of the best rock albums I have heard in a very long time.
B00008AY3L|4.0|Ben Harper (along with his excellent band, The Innocent Criminals) has always been a better artist to see live than to listen to, because of his phenomenal improvisational skills. Seen live, Harper will pull pieces of songs out of nowhere, and create on the spot lyrics that attest to his great artistry. The spirit of these skills have finally been captured on CD with &quot;Diamonds On The Inside&quot;.<BR>Harper went into the studio with his songs written, but unrehearsed, and just let the recording machines run while he and his bandmates (and some special guests) played with structure, tone and instrumentation. <BR>Harper also ventures into a huge number of genres on this recording, again much like his live shows. You get some great funk (&quot;Bring The Funk&quot;, one of the best tunes on this disc), some real down home rock (&quot;Touch From Your Lust&quot;), and an extended jam session that works great within the confines of the studio (&quot;Diamonds On The Inside&quot;). The real gem of this set, in my opinion, is the work that Harper and his mates do with LadySmith Black Mambazo, turning &quot;Picture of Jesus&quot; into a true worldbeat celebration, with Afrocentric percussion and brillliant guitar work.<BR>If you have ever seen Ben live, this disc will remind you of how enjoyable his live shows can be. If you aren't familiar with Harper's work, this is a great point to familiarize yourself with one of our most underappreciated talents.
B00005J6T0|5.0|This album is one of Madonna's finest pieces of work.  Albums of this quality are rare. From the opening moments of &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; to the final lyrics of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, this album delights. Each song desreves futher comments:<BR>Papa Don't Preach: also a great song, controversial for the time, and Kelly Osbourne (yuck) couldn't hold a candle to Madonna's version<BR>Open Your Heart: one of my favorite Madonna songs, the music is great, too good for words<BR>White Heat: Never released as a single, but some of the best &quot;filler&quot; on any album. You'll never skip over it.<BR>Live To Tell: a beautiful, haunting song, one that stands the test of time<BR>Where's The Party: a great, fun song that gives levity to the album.<BR>True Blue: one of my favorites, the beat and lyrics are great.<BR>La Isla Bonita: this is the last great song on this album. it has a nice Latin beat<BR>Jimmy Jimmy: I think the repetition and music makes this song annoying and skippable<BR>Love Makes The World Go Round: good message and nice music, but still not one of my favorites<BR>I have the Remastered version of this album, which includes two great remixes: True Blue and La Isla Bonita.<BR>This is a great album, a must have for all Madonna fans and a definitive pop album. I'd give it ten stars if I could.
B00005MP58|3.0|As a long time fan of this A&E series, I looked forward with some anticipation to the release of the DVD. The acting, filming, and adherence to the original novel are all commendable, and it's a charming series. However, if you'd like to fully experience its quality, best stick with the VHS six tape series. When I received my copy of P&P on DVD, I began watching the first disk (episodes 1-3) and immediately noticed that the scenes appeared hazy and washed. Flicking through the chapters, it became apparent that the entire DVD was similarly colored, with muted grays and yellows, and very dulled greens. The second DVD, however, was of perfect quality, and I assumed there was some problem with the first, so I returned the set and got another edition. Again, the first DVD was of far poorer quality than the second. The outdoor scenes especially suffer, and the general impression is of photographs of a whirlwind tour of rural England, taken with a cheap disposable and over-exposed. Mystifyingly enough, the second DVD suffers from none of these deficiencies, and has the same rich coloring as the VHS series. I was also rather disappointed that this \\"Special Edition\\" didn't actually include anything special, such as cast interviews or the A&E \\"Making of Pride and Prejudice,\\" which would have been a particularly nice touch. Basically, it's the VHS edition blurred a little and slapped onto two DVD's. A pity. At any rate, the series itself is good enough to justify this purchase, if you're willing to endure the whitewashed version of Hertfordshire. If, however, you'd like the full effect, best keep to the VHS.
B00005ASQ1|4.0|Review <BR>for Finding Forester<br />4 stars<br />Finding Forester, A movie about a young boy living in the Bronx who is a prodigy when it comes to writing. Jamal Wallace(Rob Brown) is this young 16-year-old prodigy when it comes to writing. Not only is he a outstanding writer but an incredible athlete towards basketball. He shines right through his test scores and works his way into a private and very highly recognized school in New York. Once there he is faced with a challenge by he is English teacher who thinks that he is not who everyone thinks he is. Jamal then meets a man called William Forrester (Sean Connery) a famous writer for only one printed book who became a hermit in the Bronx. Jamal seeks help from William Forrester through out his first year at school <BR> I believe all stories based upon true encounters are interesting to me, but this one takes the cake for best movie based upon real facts. I thought Sean connnery was very good in this movie. Both him and first time movie making actor Rob brown put outstanding performances in this movie. This movie shows a great deal of prejudice in the American society today. Not only does it show prejudice but shows an athletic story and considering the point of the story of being just a writer and only writing, I didn't lose interest one bit. I was glued to the screen from the moment it started.
0060254920|4.0|I really enjoyed this book because of the great imagination that is in it.  Most little kids are always using there imaginations to dream things up and this book is a good example of a child doing so.  Although some things in this book may have been random, like a boat just appearing out of nowhere, but that is what makes this book so great.  Most of the time children are random and this book is very relatable to them.  This book is goofy and fun and I recommend it to all children.

B000088E6M|3.0|I give much love 2 50 4 getting up there. To really honest, he should have put out of his out albums. This one came up short to me. He had some good tracks on here. But it's not as good as I first intended. If Em never signed him to Shady Aftermath, this would be another 50 Cent bootleg Cd. So, I say get the CD if you wanna fellow everyone who think it's cool to get a 50 Cent cd.
B000089RVX|5.0|The band has high energy without the rock/rap sound. The essence is dark, reminds me of a female ozzy, that has a shot of faith. The lyrics are dark, however, they have an uplifting message. This CD is worth the money, and I will look for future ones to come from this young band out of Arkansas. <BR>This group has the guts to let everyone know who is first in their life.
B00005TT77|5.0|And it's this motley collection of Beatles songs. The Beatles are definitely the most \\"covered\\" band of all time. They are, after all, the single greatest band of all time. If you want to listen to the Beatles, listen to the Beatles! These \\"interpretations\\" are downright great. Nick Cave can hardly sing and he sucks all the life out of \\"Let It Be\\". Eddie Vedder belts out an classic version of \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\" and heck, it's all good. Except for Rufus Wainright's semi-decent cover of \\"Across The Universe\\". The only thing that could have made this a better soundtrack would have been Michael Jackson's version of \\"Come Together\\" or Sinatra's half-asleep cover of \\"Something.\\" I am giving the album an extra star just for not having those songs on it. Buy this ab-luhm right now!
B000089RVX|5.0|WOW is all i have to say for this CD. I purchased this CD after hearing the single \\"Bring Me to Life\\" playing on KROQ. My first reaction was it was Bjork on steriods until the drums kicked in, right then i knew i was in for a treat. And a treat this CD is. Starting from track one of going under, a great track remminiscent of some Linkin Park stuff, through awesome songs like \\"Tourniquiet\\" and \\"Everybody's Fool\\" this CD never stops. They are musically right on, the lead singer has an amazing voice and the lyrics are haunting, disturbing and remarkably clean, what else could you want? A must have for anyone, truly a remarkable CD that i love to death. <BR>-Shadow Wolf
B000002UUX|5.0|To be honest with you, I hated this album when I first heard it. I thought that it [was bad] compared to \\"Peace Sells.\\" Boy, was I wrong! This album kicks ... The guitar solos, courtesy of Marty Friedman, are unbeleivable. Awesome bass and drumming, and Dave Mustaine does an excellent job on rythym guitar. The only problem I have with this record is Dave's voice. This guy has one of the worst voices I have ever heard, but the music REALLY makes up for it. This is the last classic Megadeth album, \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" and \\"Youthanasia\\" are very good albums, just not classics. The other recent ones are pretty bad.<br />Holy Wars...The Punishment Due-The best song on the album, and the best Megadeth song ever! Everything about the song is awesome, from the cool lyrics, to the incredible bass and drums, to the breathtaking solo near the end. Very fast. 10/10<br />Hangar 18- The second best song on the album. Listen to those guitar solos, they are mindblowing! The last three minutes are instrumental. This is a song about Area 51. 10/10<br />Take No Prisoners- This is probably the fastest song on the album. There is killer drumming and a cool five second bass solo on this song, along with a good solo near the end. 9/10<br />Five Magics- This is an awesome song! The bass intro is great, but it drags on for a bit. I have no clue what this song is about, but listen to those solos! Damn! 10/10<br />Poison Was The Cure- A cool song, but it is too short, only about three miutes long. This song also has a bass intro. Very good riffs and a great solo. 8/10<br />Lucritia- Awesome song with a great intro and leads. More cool lyrics. 9/10<br />Tornado Of Souls- Many people say that this is the best on the album, but it's probably my least favorite on the album. (Next to Dawn Patrol.) It is not a bad song, it is great, but I just  never liked it as much as the rest. This does have a killer solo. 8/10<br />Dawn Patrol- Uhh, just a bass line by David Ellefson and distorted vocals.The bass line is cool, but repetitive. The weakest track on the album, but I still listen to it. 7/10<br />Rust In Peace...Polaris- Third best on the album. Good solos, cool lyrics, Dave's voice in the first verse is actually pretty cool. A perfect way to end such a classic heavy metal album. 10/10<br />Your still reading this? Buy it already!
B00003CXXM|3.0|This movie changes some of the basic premises of the book, and not for the better. I can't really say how without spoiling the movie, but trust me -- the book is better. Read it. You won't want to put it down.<br />However, if you haven't read the book and don't plan to, it's not a bad action flick.<br />For a more faithful adaptation of the book, see the TV miniseries with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith.
B000000OAN|5.0|'A Night at the Opera' shows Queen at the height of their careers, and most certainly creativity.<br />While I would not personally class this album as the group's best work, there is no denying that it is a fine introduction to their grandeur.<br />The album kicks off with a venomous rocker -Death on Two Legs- which makes it seem like classic piano and heavy metal guitars were made for each other. Following this is an hilarious little ditty called 'Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon', which quickly is followed by another kick-ass rocker in the form of 'Im In Love With My Car', featuring Roger Taylor (drummer) on vocals.<BR>As no Queen album is complete without your occasional sugar-sweet ballad, this point is started off with 'Youre My Best Friend'. This is followed with the eerie '39; a folksy acoustic number by Brian May (guitar).<BR>Following this, we are again smacked down with some heavy notes indeed, called 'Sweet Lady', ironically followed with another ditty 'Seaside Rendevous'.<BR>Next comes what I consider the finest moment on 'A Night at the Opera': 'The Prophets Song'. This is the quintessence of Queen's opera-inspired era, and some of their finest but also darkest moments will be found in this masterpiece. To give the uninitiated a clue, take 'Bohemian Rhapsody' -which I am sure you've heard- and multiply that idea with ten, and you have 'The Prophets Song'.<BR>More sugar-coated sweetness next with 'Love of My Life', which is a beautiful ballad indeed. 'Good Company' is another 1920-30's romp/ditty, this time with May at the fore. In retrospect, I would say that 'A Night at the Opera' is the Queen album displaying the most of these kind of songs.<BR>The next song, 'Bohemian Rhapsody', needs no explanation. Am I right or am I right?<BR>Rounding off this wonderful album is 'God Save the Queen', which is an instrumental piece of May's showmanship.<br />Finally, a great treat of an album, with perhaps just one too many \\"ditties\\" (as mentioned above). The rockersand heavy metal operatic/progressive numbers are by far the best, as is the case with all of Queen's music, in my humble opinion.
0440539811|5.0|Robert Anton Wilson manages to show us that everything we ever thought we knew or believed is up for grabs.  The craziest of conspiracy theories seems true. The most real evidence seems questionable.  No one is who we think.  Everything is upside down and that's good.  Or maybe it's not.  This is a thinking person's novel. Or maybe it's not.  Maybe it's the truth and we never knew it.  Or maybe we knew it all along but haven't wanted to admit it.  Your head will hurt and you'll never think the same way again.  And that's terrific.  I think.  The guy's a genius and I challenge anyone with an opinion on anything to read this book.
B000000OAC|5.0|Queen's diversity is well-known, and here it shines in perhaps its most successful manner.<BR>Queen rocked and ruled the seventies, and why they chose to become the synthesizer-soaked pop-band of the eighties is beyond me. Perhaps -sad but true- Queen followed the times a little _too_ much to be deemed credible in retrospect. I certainly won't hold it against them, though- in light of this excellent album, for instance.<br />Let's go through the album song by song, which is the way I usually like to read reviews:<br />1) We Will Rock You (6/10): Needs no introduction. I by far prefer the live-version (with guitars throughout), though.<br />2) We are the Champions (8/10): The anthem of anthems, and a sort of definer of the \\"Queen sound\\", although they never really made that many of these types of songs collectively.<br />3) Sheer Heart Attack (10/10): I just love this; it kicks total ...!! Queen at their heaviest, and boy can they be _heavy_! The drum roll leading to the even heavier all-around sound in the middle of the song just smokes!!!<br />4) All Dead, All Dead (7/10): A great tune on the lighter side. You'll be hearing this song in your head after a couple of listens, guaranteed!!<br />5) Spread Yours Wings (6/10): Anthemic rocker of the classic kind. A bit cliché for my tastes, though.<br />6) Fight From the Inside (8/10): Energetic rocker of the Taylor persuation. A kicker!<br />7) Get Down, Make Love (7/10): Mercury gets his say in this funky rocker. Raunchy as hell!!<br />8) Sleeping on the Sidewalk (7/10): Groovy romp with May at the fore.<br />9) Who Needs You (8/10): Great tune that should have gotten more praise.<br />10) It's Late (10/10): Now this is the highlight of this album, in my opinion! Kicks total ... in the Zeppelin vein, and it's got that escalating intensity that I just love. The cost of the album is worth is just for this one. A gem.<br />11) My Melancholy Blues (8/10): Like the title says, this is standard-fare May-inspired blues! Perhaps I rated it a bit too high, but I just _love_ that blues!!<br />All in all, this is one of Queen's most ambitious albums - a real rocker! There is little to complain about here. Buy it today!
B000002IAS|5.0|This album is just a great album of &quot;live&quot; Delaney and Bonnie!<BR>And while all the music on it is fantastic, there is one track on the album which makes the entire album &quot;special&quot;! In fact if this one single track were the only good song on the album, it would have been worth purchasing. Bonnie Bramlett's &quot;That's What My Man Is For&quot;! Her 'lectric blues/soul delivery on this song outdoes even the great Janis Joplin for delivering &quot;the ol' Kosmic Blues&quot;! It has to be heard to be believed. . . and heard and heard again. <BR>I love the entire album and it jumps alive from the moment you put it on. It's a shame they went their separate ways, but we have &quot;this&quot; to relive again and again.<BR>p.s. Bonnie and Delaney recently played a live date together and were joined on stage by their daughter Bekka Bramlett. Let's hope that was recorded for the ages as well.

B0000683DH|4.0|The crew of the Enterprise is back, and they seem much more lively this time around, even though they are growing old.  This is part of the story, though, Kirk realizes he's getting old, especially when he receives a pair of eyeglasses as a birthday gift from Bones.  Story: Chekov has been reassigned to the U.S.S. Reliant which is searching for a barren planet to test out the Genesis device, a device which can create a planet out of a lifeless mass, or any mass for that matter.  Chekov and Captain Terrel, the captain of the Reliant, venture down to Ceti Alpha VI to inverstigate the planet to make sure that it could be used as a host for the Genesis device.  While there, they discover Khan and his cohorts, genetically enhanced humans from the twentieth century.  Khan takes over the Reliant and is bent on killing Kirk for abondoning him on Ceti Alpha, as displayed in the TOS episode &quot;Space Seed.&quot;  Khan and Kirk then begin a game of cat and mouse that lasts until the end of the film, to which Khan acquires the Genesis device, which he intends to use to destroy Kirk and crew.  Spock sacrifices himself, in the end, to repair the war drive so that the Enterprise can escape from the Genesis explosion.  While I do think this is a great film, I feel it is ofter severely overated by fans, hailing it as superior to all other Trek films.<br />The ups: great direction by Nicholas Meyer, superb special effects by George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic, great acting (especially Ricardo Montalban as Khan), a great score by composer James Horner (who would later do such great scores as that of &quot;Braveheart&quot;).<br />The downs: Rehashed images: the Kobayashi Maru sequence uses the same images of Klingon cruisers from Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and the Enterprise approach in the pod is also recycled from ST: TMP.  Also, it seems sill that the Enterprise is sent on a mission with a training crew aboard and that it is the only ship in range to respond to a potentially dangerous situation (wasn't the Enterprise the only ship in range in ST: TMP?  Is the Enterprise like the only ship in Starfleet at this point????).  Also it seems silly to me that Starfleet's stellar cartographers had no idea that Ceti Alpha VI was actually Ceti Alpha V; the Federation would have quarantined the world too if Kirk had perhaps told somebody that someone dangerous was on the planet.ally dangerous situation (wasn't the Enterprise the only ship in range in ST: TMP?

B00005JKHP|2.0|This film has often been called &quot;Star Trek: the Slow Motion Picture.&quot;  It's true; this movie has a very slow-moving story, if there's really a story at all.  While there is a &quot;plot&quot; of sorts, the story never seems to move anywhere.  The acting seems dry from every character, especially Kirk who says an almost embarassing &quot;Oh my God&quot; after the transporter accident (which thankfully on the DVD is a deleted scene....by the way, wasn't there a transporter accident on almost every other episode from TOS?)  Spock also seems even more stoic than ever, which is explained in that he's been off learning more logic (of Kolinar) in the time that has elapsed since the series.  The story involves the newly refitted Enterprise to (stop?) a big &quot;cloud&quot; called V'ger (who has a big, borg-like vessel) from destroying Earth, but there's very little intriguing development other than V'ger is revealed to be Earth's lost Voyager VI probe.  The actual resolution to the story is actually pretty interesting, but at the same time seems pretty silly; just how Decker and Ilia magically fuse as one being right there, and V'ger ship magically dissappears in the process.<br />The ups: The special effects (while very overused) are magnificent (the Special Edition DVD has even revamped some special effects.)  There are some great shots of Klingon cruisers that were barely seen in TOS. The Klingons now have ridges on their heads, and though they look like circus animals at this point, compared to later Klingons, it's still a pretty cool development.  Arguably the best attribute of this film is the score; Gerry Goldsmith's powerful theme is so incredible that it has even returned in Star Trek V, VIII, IX, and X, as well as even being the theme song for the seven seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The score fits the film very well.  The DVD is also loaded with a bunch of bonus material, and more trailers and TV spots than I have ever seen on a DVD.<br />The Downs: Bad directing; Robert Wise was not the man to direct this film; his visions of &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; are ok, but his directing of Trek just does not seem to work for me.  The Starfleet uniforms look like pajamas, their very tight uniforms with bland colors, and sometimes it looks like they even come with &quot;footies.&quot;  The special effects shots are too long; and finally, the characters do not seem to click with each other as they did in TOS.The Downs: Bad directing; Robert Wise was not the man to direct this film; his visions of &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; are ok, but his directing of Trek just does not seem to work for me.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|this is the best c.d. ever. Some people don't think their good just becuase their lesbians that is so sterotyping.All the songs are good and their the best ever
B00006JDVV|2.0|The movie is very slow. It just drags on and on and some of the scenes don't even make sense, or at least I missed it.  The best part about the movie though, is when Matthew McConaughey steps in.  He's sporting this grungy beard and shaved head. He looks tough and its sexy.  He's really buff in this movie too. So if you're a big Matthew McConaughey fan, watch it, otherwise skip it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Simply the best rock album I've heard in recent years.  It opens with the raw and fierce &quot;Going Under&quot; and doesn't let up.  &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; is one of the best songs I have ever heard--the way the vocals and music layer and create this sound that goes right to your soul is just as good as it gets.  <br />This band is the complete package.  Amy Lee has a voice that is equally strong, ethereal, haunting and nothing short of stunning, which is beautifully complemented by Ben's unrelenting guitar work.   A lot of rock music recently has been largely undistinctive but FALLEN bucks that trend--you have to sit up and pay attention.  <br />I've read many of these reviews and some people can effectively put into words why an album is great.  I can't--all I can do is urge you to buy this album because it was the best buy I've made in a long time.  <br />Call it goth rock, call it alternative--it doesn't matter because the most suitable label is &quot;perfection.&quot;  This band should be huge and if they keep making music like this they'll be around for a very long time.
B000089RVX|5.0|all the tracks on this cd are the bomb.  My immortal and hello tracks 4 and 9 respectivly are the mellow songs on the album and they each get 8/10 the others get 9/10 overall this is a must buy.
B00005221M|1.0|I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out so I could finally see the scenes of my favorite characters (Uncas & Alice) that were cut out of the movie and made this couples tragic ending less credible. There were love scenes and more chemistry scenes between the pair that never made it to the film because directors felt this couple was more interesting to people than the MAIN squeeze Day-Lewis & Stowe. OK now the movie is 10 yrs old. Where's all the never before seen footage?? Where's the interviews?? Where's all the cut out lines I've come to know & love?? Where's the making of...?? Where's the bloopers?? Where are any of the special features that I spend money on DVDs to see? I mean my little brother's Spiderman DVD has 10 extra hours of cool stuff and behind the scenes extras for crying out loud! Oh Mann! (excuse the pun) please I beg of you- for all the faithful LOTM fans everywhere, please come out with a collector's edition which includes all the cut scenes and extras. Mann oh Mann, what a shame. This could have been Awesome!!!!

B00008BXJF|5.0|This album truly is unbelievable.  I should note that I am a huge fan of The ConstruKction of Light while I do see where the criticism comes from and think it is definately well-founded.  However, after listening to The Power to Believe for a week now I do not see how any long-time fan would not like this.  Belew's voice is highly distorted again except for Eyes Wide Open, but this time it fits songs like Facts of Life, Happy..., and The Power to Believe II much better than his normal voice would and I can't imagine them any other way.<br />Besides the consistent strength of the songs, the album has a wonderful flow to it, unlike TCOL.  The lilting haiku of TPTB a capella leads into the utter cacophony of Level Five.  This song makes Red seem tame, especially at about the five minute mark where I think Belew comes in with a jaw-dropping solo that sounds ten times more evil and energized than the one he did in Larks' Pt.4  This leads right into the gentle Eyes Wide Open, a song similar to Walking on Air or One Time that gives the album room to breath and relax.  This version of it is similar to that on the Happy EP but done with electric guitars which gives a different atmosphere and a new bridge section that reminds me of the backwards solo in Heartbeat only a little more sweet.  Then it's back to full metal jacket for Elekrik, except unlike Level Five, this focuses as much on Belew and Fripp's melodic interplay as Trey and Pat bang in the background.  Then we have the Facts of Life piece.  All I will say about this monster is that it leaves me absolutely speechless everytime, Belew sounds absolutely possessed and the atmosphere they create is energetic and scary at the same time.  This song should be the highlight of the live show.  The Power to Believe II is a hell of a piece that may take a little getting used to.  Think of the atmosphere of Shogani only much longer, with some awesome searing guitarwork, and a trippy atmosphere that one may feel on parts of PeterGabriel's Passion.  This is unlike anything the Crim has done before and in my opinion it works masterfully, especially when Belew comes in with his haiku (which by the way is much better written than the ones on the Happy Ep).  Then we get Dangerous Curves, another long instrumental that is unique from the others, the previous comment about comparing it to Kasmir is dead on I think.  Happy With What You Have... should be familiar to most but it bears repeating that this song kicks ... with some of Belew's wittiest lyrics and a solo that absolutely kills me each time.  The Power to Believe III is incredible, reminiscent of the Projeckts, it unfolds slowly and by the time it finishes I am breathless everytime.  Mostly instrumental it creaks and roars along brilliantly before leading into pt.IV which is a Fripp soundscape where Belew delivers his haiku for the last time in a manner that could melt the hearts of metalheads alike and ends the album on a thoroughly satisfying note.  The arc of this album is perhaps its best strength and pushes into contention for the best Crimso album.<br />Lastly, I'd like to state that all the musicians play to the best of their abilities and it must be stated that Trey and Pat are nothing less than stunning.  If they can release another album like this in the future than this lineup will become my favorite Crim lineup of all time.
B00005V9IL|5.0|I only recently saw the abyss.  My boyfriend claimed that it was a great movie but since I was never a fan of sci fi movies, I was hesitant. But when I finally gave it a chance, it blew me away. The movie is brillant. It is such a smart movie! The cast is also terrific. I could not give this movie the rating it deserves because it is that great. There is also romance in the story and thats always a plus for us girls. I also highly, highly reccommend the dvd with the original version of the script that James Cameron wrote because that is the TRUE Abyss. The theater version cut out too much crucial scenes. Watch the DVD!!!
B00005JLSC|5.0|This was, by far, the most entertaining musical I have ever seen.  I have been a fan of the \\"old\\" musicals since I can remember and this one made it directly to the top of my list.  In my opinion, beginning with the exceptional selection of the actors/actresses all the way down to the imaginative melange of the song and dance numbers (superbly choreographed, by the way) into the storyline, this movie will most likely become a classic.  Even if you aren't a fan of this type of movie, it's definitely worth the trip (and price).  I can't say enough about it.
6304493681|4.0|I honestly don't.  This movie has gotten reviewed and rated through the roof.  Siskel and Ebert gave the thing two thumbs up for crying out loud!  I have watched it three times now and don't have a clue why!?  First off let me say that I thought it was a good movie, and a great movie compared to a lot of other things I've seen.  However, I can't quite tell why people think this is so amazing.<br />Enough of me blabbering about my feelngs, you probably want to know why I didn't like it.  I am a big Fan on the storyline.  Secondly, I like a few metaphors in my movies and I need them to make me think.  However, I also don't like movies that have really really dense (and questionable)metaphors going on.   Akira made me question my life for a week, Evangelion made me think about my beliefs for even longer, Ghost in the shell made me think about the...dollars I spent on it.  It goes on about how it will make you question yourself and is a great metaphor for how technology is affecting your life, but frankly I didn't find that true.<br />I also don't like movies that don't end (The follwing statement should give you a pretty good idea about what I'm saying: \\"Evangelion has an end; this doesn't\\").  In my Mind, the whole thing is a prologue to \\"something else\\".  Although I've heard rumors about a series over in Japan I don't exactly think this was made with such a sequel in mind.  The ending has more to do with showing the viewers a omen of their lifes with technology to come and then sends them out in the world to change it.  That is a key element to the metaphorical storyline.  However, the story will leave you feeling very unsatisfied where they choose to end it.  If you haven't seen it, I'm warning you now.<br />Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let me end by saying that the animation was beautiful!!  Despite the fact it's more racy than I'd like, it has, just, phenominal graphics and fight scenes that will leave you breathless.  However, you may forget them in your disgust with the movie's ending.
B0000636UN|5.0|I have all of Sheryl's cds but her first.  And this is tied with the Globe Sessions.  Sheryl can rock, she can sing, and best of all, she can write.  Musical talents from all around join her on this album.  The only ones she's missing are the Dixie Chicks.  If you want to go from one emotion to the next with one of the best female singers around, this album is a must.  Believe me.
0767817478|1.0|I'm just now getting to wrtie a review of this horrible train wreck of a movie. I don't know where to start but I must begin somewhere. First of all this was not Godzilla. I do not care how bad special effect wise the original one looked like but at least they could of mad an effort to make Godzilla look somewhat like the original. First it looked like an overstuffed iguana. And second every shot of the \\"monster\\" (I say Monster with tongue in cheek)was half out of frame or so dark you could not make it out. I'm a die hard Godzilla fan and this was a huge disappointment. But this is typical of young, 1990's directors. Which I will now slam. They made Godzilla with \\"a smile\\"....\\"oh no...there's Godzilla...he he he. I could not believe how lame the little jokes from Independence day made its way into this movie. The directors felt they had to add humor to yet another science fiction movie and it tunred out to suck again. I actually fast-forwarded over the last half-hour of the movie because it was so bad and I was so disappointed. But I knew what I was getting into. I was sooooo psyched when I read they were remaking Godzilla. But when I found out it was from the directors of Independence Day it would be horrible and it was. If Godzilla is dead he would be rolling over in his iceberg if he knew how bad this movie was.
B000069AUI|5.0|Put it this way.... I have yet to purchase this bands first album, and i think this one is just amazing.. I never liked Coldplay at first. Now i totally have changed my tune, after listening to this record a few times. It has grown on me.. It gets my vote for album of the year..
B000062X9B|4.0|Though not as compelling or powerful as the original American Recordings album, this is another worthy edition to the series and a must-own for any who liked the first two. This was the first album Cash released after his major illnesses in 1997 -- and it shows. Whereas on the original American Recordings, his voice sounded as rich and pure as ever, here it sounds older, more weathered -- perhaps even a little weary. Let it be understood, though:  this is no detriment to the album. His voice is still unmistakably THE voice -- that is, Johnny Cash's voice -- only souding older and wiser -- all the more appropriate, considering the material that he chooses to tackle on this album. His fine version of Tom Petty's I Won't Back Down seems a testament to the past few years of his life. His version of U2's One is vastly different from the original in delivery, but its emotional equal. I See A Darkness is a masterful interpretation; and, while songwriter Will Oldham sings with Cash on the chorus, one would think this was a Cash song to being with, so incredible is the performance. The David Allen Coe-penned Would You Lay With Me (In A Field of Stone) and Cash's own Before My Time are both beautiful songs -- the former in delivery, the latter in lyrics. Cash's duet with Merle Haggard on the newly-penned I'm Leavin' Now is also engaging and interesting. However, the undisputed highlight of the album (and worth the price of admission itself) is Cash's incredible take on the Nick Cave masterpiece The Mercy Seat. Cash does something here that I never thought could be done:  he equals the original. Though not as melodramatic or forceful as the original, Cash's version is its emotionally emphatic equal, emphasizing the lyrics and first-person narrative even more. It must be noted that, aside from Cash's undeniably awesome performance, the keyboards of Heartbreaker Benmont Tench add boatlods of atmosphere to this song. This song is an absolutely undescribable masterpiece of interpretation that must be heard to be believed. That said, this is not the strongest album in the American series, as a couple of lightweight tunes weight it down -- this is, unfortunately, a problem with most of Johnny Cash's albums. Do not let that deter you, however. The majority of the songs and performances on this album are very good to outstanding, and any fan of latter-day Cash -- and the American series, in particular -- would do well to pick it up.
B000002HRE|2.0|But it still is not a good album by any means. It is simply average - not bad enough to be memorable, but not good enough to stand out. It is just there for the sake of being there.<br />There is a catchy little hook here and there, and lyrically, there are moments where the brutal honesty of the earlier albums shines through. On a whole, though, this is easily Metallica's darkest hour.<br />Although, I will admit that frankly, if some unknown band without the rep that Metallica has to live up to put out an album like this, I probably would be enjoying it quite a bit more. But this is Metallica, and after the musical and lyrical brilliance that came from \\"Ride The Lightning\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", and \\"...And Justice For All\\", it is hard for me to not be sorely disappointed that Metallica put out an album that is as average and forgettable as this one.<br />There are no tracks that stand out on this album - it is all pretty much consistent in its average performance. If you like the many songs from this album that gets played on the radio, by all means, pick this album up, you won't be disappointed. If you are expecting anything more than that, sorry, you won't find it here.
B00004TRD8|5.0|One of the greatest landmarks in film history...
B000002BYD|5.0|Brain of J - A great opening song that introduces the album with almost the same intensity that \\"Go\\" introduced Vs.<br />Faithfull - I'm listening to it right now. Eddie Ved's voice is great on it. A great song with a solid beat<br />No Way - An ok song with cool guitar parts. Stone Gossard is one of the best rock n' roll hit writers of our day. But this song falls short of that title. <br />Given to Fly - Mike McCready's first real contribution to Pearl Jam songwriting. An amazing song. Great live. It was the first single off this album and rightfully so. It is extremely catchy and i love listening to it. Classic Pearl Jam hit!<br />Wishlist - Definitly the best song on the album. The lyrics are very cool and sarcastic. The beat is solid and Eddie's voice can make you cry. Classic Pearl Jam hit!<br />Pilate - A pretty good song with an ok verse but a very catchy chorus. for like one entire week I could not get this chorus out of my head. Jeff Ament is a great songwriter though so you should give it a listen to see waht you think.<br />Red dot - Freaked me out the first time i heard it. I've made a conclusion about these little experimental things Pearl Jam do on their albums. Because they put these dragging weird things it just brings out the rockers more and makes you so happy to hear a song like Evolution after it. Because Pearl Jam puts the experimentals their rockers rock even more.<br />Do The Evolution - A great song with one of Stone Gossards best riffs. I'm telling you he is the best. Ed's lyrics are great too. You've got to give Pearl Jam credit for being able to play a song like \\"Black\\" and \\"Jeremy\\" and then writing a song like \\"Evolution\\" which is almost completely different rock and roll but still rockin. Classic Pearl Jam!<br />MFC - A pretty cool song. Great to drive to. Give it a listen. <br />Low Light - First time I heard it I skipped it. But now after giving it a try I find it is one of Pearl Jam's most beuatiful song. the rhythem is a little weird and you've got to get used to that but overall the song is good.<br />In Hiding - A Great Pearl Jam song! I'm telling you Stone is amazing! The chorus is classic pearl jam and classic eddie vedder wailing. I love it. First time I heard it, I was hooked. Should've been a huge radio hit if Pearl Jam would've just commercialised a little better. The same goes for Wishlist and Given to Fly. Great song Ed and Stone! Classic Pearl Jam!<br />Push me Pull me - experimental. say what you will<br />All those yesterdays - Stone again with a very beautiful song. The Eastern jam at the end is one of my favorite parts of the album. I love it. Give it a listen. Lyrics are very poetic<br />Overall this is Pearl Jam's return to basic Rock n' Roll after the weaker No Code. It was also Pearl Jam's return to stadium touring so they had to create an album that is considered arena-rock for their tour.
B0000025US|5.0|When I first listened to this CD, I was astonished. These three guys are really amazing. This CD is a mix of flamenco, fusion, jazz and classical music, bathed with beauty and compassion. The intermeshing is incredible, technique, feeling, passion, grace &amp; fire. Short, but is the enough. If you like good and inovating guitar trios, this is for ya. Buy it!
055357342X|5.0|Okay many people may consider that this series is overhyped but on a serrious note: Lord Of The Rings is overhyped. So it came out 'first' before a lot of other fantasy books came out and made fantasy popular but that doesn't meen I have to like Lord Of The Rings which was great until the third book.<br />Martin's series seems to be only getting better and I can in good honesty say after reading some spoiler readings for his forth comming book, 'A Feast For Crows' that it will continue to get better. This series is going to be a total of six possably seven books but the seven is debatable.<br />The fact that Martin actually kills characters off makes it entertaining but that isn't the whole reason why I like his books. First off Martin's world is more complicated than simple white and black, it is more based off of shades of grey. <br />Every character is unique, has a unique style to himself. Whats more his series successfuly rises both negative and possitive emotions in me while I can't say this with Jordan: Sorry Jordan fans.
B0000029AP|5.0|This is quite possibly the greatest CD ever! It's non-stop rock! If you like Aerosmith this is the CD to get!

Aerosmiths' Toys in the Attic is a must-buy to any true rock fan!!!
B00000I924|5.0|Jeff Beck is one of the lost heros of the guitar. Many seem to overlook him and not realize the talent that he is and his contributions to eclectic cutting edge guitar.

Its all good on this CD...buy it...I am glad I did.

B00006RIO7|5.0|I saw Chicago two days ago, and drove straight from the movie theater to buy the soundtrack.  I've been listening to it ever since, and the various songs are constantly either playing in my head or escaping from between my lips.  I absolutely love it!  Plus, there's a song on the CD that wasn't in the movie -- &quot;Class,&quot; sung by Queen Latifah and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  It's really a beautiful song, in terms of the melody and the way these ladies put it over -- but the words are hilarious.  It's my favorite song from the CD, closely followed by Cell Block Tango, Roxie, Be Good To Mama . . . oh, heck -- they're ALL great!  If you loved the movie, as I did, you have to have the soundtrack!
B00006CJOY|5.0|i think what really sets this live disc apart is the fact that the songs actually sound MORE fleshed-out and realized in their live versions, their studio versions seem more scrappy in comparison. the opener &quot;Tijuana&quot; is more relaxed and spacious than on record, as is &quot;clandestino&quot;. &quot;Mr Bobby&quot; sounds like an actual song, a great one, not like a bongo-bong remake. &quot;Minha Galera&quot; stretches into a rhapsody, with the crowd joining in, and an accordion. the hey!-hey!-hey! ska rhythm is an acquired taste, but i suggest you acquire it .and i think that if you listen to the crowd you can really hear that this isnt just entertainment-its a movement, goddamit! even if , like me, you have no idea what he's singing about.
B00004T9UF|5.0|... You have to know where he's coming from to enjoy this CD. This CD is the best thing since the early days of Gangsta rap. It's really good due mostly to the creativity and passion of Eminem (and great producing by Dr. Dre). I'm not a rap music fan by any means, but two of my favorite albums of all time are \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" and \\"Straight Outta Compton\\". I know great music when I hear it.<br />I love Eminem's style, he's funny. His rhymes are sung with melody, they sound very good and sometimes don't have to rhyme that well. None many of his lines seem rushed into a beat or anything like I hear so often on other rap albums. The most compelling thing about his album is how he relays his feelings and passions in each of his songs. In most songs he sings his lyrics and doesn't preach them, letting his melody align with the clean beats. If it's an angry song, he's shouting his lungs out and you really feel his anger and frustration, albiet usually misplaced in the case of Kim, for example. <br />This album isn't meant to be taken seriously, just enjoyed for the sake of entertainment. Eminem isn't a spokesman, and I think he makes that clear. Buy this album now!... (that is unless you're 12)he other bangers (in my opinion)  are &quot;B. Please Part II&quot; , &quot;The Way I Am&quot; (kinda has a  2Pac feel to it) and &quot;Remember Me&quot; with tight cameos from Sticky  Fingas and RBX (from the original Chronic). The more traditional hip hop  headz will like &quot;B. Please Part II&quot; since it is a continuation of  Xzhibit's original banger - and Em's impression of Snoop &quot;Oh, no Big  Slim Dawg...&quot; will have jaws dropping.<br />All eyez were on Eminem for  'The Marshall Mathers LP' because he had a tough act to follow after the  first album. He also has a wide cross-section of fans to please, which made  pleasing the record buying public more difficult. Whether he likes it or  not, Eminem is at the center of the controversy surrounding what someconsider the possible takeover of hip hop by White artists since he is the  most successful of the bunch. But, focusing on the music, I find this to be  a good album cuz you can't deny talent, and Eminem has got it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Previous to the \\"Daredevil\\" soundtrack, I'd never heard of Evanescence.  Now I can't help but recommend this incredible album to all my friends.  None of your speakers will be loud enough for you.  This is FAR from a pop, flash-in-the-pan group.  Amy Lee's voice is perfectly suited for the music, and her lyrics are almost too dark and haunting for Christian music.  Describing her death, asking for forgiveness, opening her eyes to the world...  She and Ben Hodges include as their influences Type O Negative and Tori Amos--and it shows.  Any fan of these two MUST buy this album.  Forget MTV, soundtracks, and hype--buy this album for the musical art.
6304509154|5.0|Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams star as Steven and Diane Freeling.  The Freelings reside in a suburban development called Cuesta Verde.  The development was built on an old cemetary, but the bodies were never removed.  Also, the Freeling home has been invaded by a strange para-psychological presence.  Strange and unexplained occurances begin to take place.  At first, the occurances are minor, such as items sliding across the floor, but eventually, the occurances begin to get much more scary in nature until finally the Freeling's youngest daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is captured by the supernatural forces and placed in another dimension.  The family can only hear Carol Anne's voice through the TV.  <br />The family solicits the help of a parapsychologist to help them get their daughter back.  However, the presence has also sensed the efforts to retrieve Carol Anne.  Each member of the Freeling family must summon up their inner strength and put their fears aside in order to help Carol Anne.  Finally, Carol Anne is rescued and the parapsychologist declares the house as \\"clean\\"; but is it?<br />This is a truly scary movie.  There's no blood, but the pure psychological terror will be sure to scare even the staunchest of viewers.  The special effects are what make this movie so special.  They truly hold the viewer's interest throughout the film.  This is a movie that horror movie fans will be sure to enjoy.
B00006HBUB|1.0|There is no word in any language that can accurately describe how bad \\"Scooby Doo\\" is. Well, maybe \\"garmonbozia\\", which means pain and suffering, because that almost sums it up. But pain and suffering on a much greater scale than any other movie I have had the misfortune to see. It makes \\"Batman and Robin\\" look like \\"Seven Samurai\\", it makes \\"The Flintstones\\" look like a documentary. This movie is nowhere true to the old cartoon and is closest to the \\"13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo\\" which would be a horrible thing to base a movie on. The whole point of the orginal cartoon was that there are no such things as ghosts (or the supernatural) and the Scooby Gang always debunked whatever they encountered. That theory is spit on and then thrown out the door in this movie. Who is this movie aimed at? Its \\"humor\\" is so infantile that only 3 year olds who haven't outgrown fart jokes will laugh, but yet there are poorly veiled drug references and gratuitous cheesecake material with Daphne and Velma. Which leads us to extreme miscasting on the part of Fred and Daphne. Lillard and Cardellini did very accurate voices and mannerisms of Shaggy and Velma, but I wonder if Freddie Prinze Jr. and SMG have ever even seen Scooby-Doo. Oh wait, they just have the combined acting talent of an old boot and were only cast because they're hizzot.<br /><br />Do not subject yourselves or anyone else to this piece of dreck. Parents, if you need something to babysit your kids with, get something good like Mary Poppins or Spy Kids. At least the movie did have one positive element: Scooby Doo himself made Jar Jar Binks look realistic and bearable by comparison.<br /><br />Worst...movie...ever.
B000063DHL|5.0|This is the most complete Maiden album ever!  Every song could appear on a &quot;Best Of&quot; album of theirs (which makes me wonder why they don't...) because each song is so full of melody, epic grandeur, and complex musicianship.  Many of Iron Maiden's fans that have been around since the beginning usually mark Powerslave as their last great album, but that's just foolish.  Somewhere In Time is their best album, followed by 7th Son of a 7th Son.  Here is how i rate every song:<br />Caught Somewhere In Time - excellent, fast opening track with lots of synths! 10/10<br />Wasted Years - melodic, beautiful, great solo, great chorus 9.5/10<br />Sea Of Madness - one of Maiden's heaviest tracks! 9/10<br />Heaven Can Wait - this is such a fun song, I can't help but smile everytime I hear it 9.5/10<br />The Lonliness Of The Long Distance Runner - if it weren't for the cheesey lyrics, this song would go down as one of their best ever, but otherwise, it's still a great song 9/10<br />Deja Vu - very interesting lyrics and a slower paced song then the rest of the album...excellent, one of the best! 10/10<br />Stranger In A Strange Land - best song on the album! just listen to that solo!! 10/10<br />Alexander The Great - epic, epic, epic! not only do you get a fantastic epic song, but you also get a history lesson in just 8 minutes! 10/10<br />There you have it, Maiden's finest hour

B0000399WI|5.0|...it seserves TWENTY FIVE stars.   Ok, so you already know how much I like this modern day classic.  I'm not going to re-hash the plot.  However, I did want to make a point on the EXCELLENT novella this movie is based on.<br />SPOILER ALERT: For those of you who have read the novlee, I'm sure you'll know what I mean.  The story actually has 2 endings.  Right after Andy escapes, that's the 1st ending.  Then the story picks up by Red writing in the Diary:  I can't believe that I'm writing in this diary again\\".  Then goes on with the rest of the story. END OF SPOILER<br />Ask whoever saw this movie who wrote this story.  If they don't know that it's Stephen King, they'll be surprised.  I was the first time I read the story.  VERY different form King's usual stuff.<br />WHich brings me to a story I have to relate to you all:<br />I had told a young woman from Australia about this movie.   She later went to the video store with some friends.  She spots this movie and decides to get it because of what I said about it.  Her friends didn't want to see it because of King having wrote it.  She didn't listen to her friends and rented it anyways.  Well, she said that after watching the movie, her and her friends talked about the movie.  They ALL liked the movie (no big surprise there!)  And this woman said that the movie was TOO SHORT!!!!  True story<br />One last thing I need to say about this movie:  I need 3 hours when I see it because after it's over, I like to just sit back and enjoy the feeling I get after watching it.<br />If you want a emotionally fulfilling movie, BUY this movie, don't just rent it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is the kind of film one should come to expect from the Grand Master of Animation. Miyzaki sensei has created yet another wonderful film full of the rich story telling and character development we saw in Princess Mononoke. Along with the adventerous spirit of Kiki's Delevery Service. As with Kiki, Chihiro's/Sen's discovery of a new and unfiamilar world is somewhat frightening at first. But as she adjusts to her new suroundings, Sen begins to see her new world in all its intracasess.<br /> The films PG rating is right on the money. It is not for real young kids. So, parents should use their own judgement. Although I would consider this film to be something that everyone would enjoy.
B000007MVD|4.0|The Beatles 'Live at the BBC' is an excellent historical document that captures their early energy in 'live' studio recordings.<br />The sound quality is sometimes less than great, and the performances are sometimes less than perfect, but this set is full of raw energy and enthusiasm, and the Beatles could were pretty tight as a unit. It's certainly worthwhile to hear them live without the legions of screaming fans and general poor sound quality of other live offerings.<br />Many of the early classics by the Lennon/McCartney team are here, such as \\"Thank You Girl,\\" \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" \\"I Wanna Be You Man,\\" \\"All My Loving,\\" \\"Things We Said Today,\\" \\"She's a Woman,\\" \\"I Feel Fine,\\" \\"I'm a Loser,\\" and \\"Love Me Do.\\"<br />There's also an unreleased original \\"I'll Be On My Way,\\" that has kind of Buddy Holly meets \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" feel to it, with nice harmonies by John and Paul.<br />There are also little interview snippets that offer a glimpse of the Beatles' wry humor, and one can imagine them cutting it up in the studio. The real highlight is the number of covers that were never put on any of the studio records. These songs show us the various R&B, early rock and roll and rockabilly influences that the Beatles drew from to create their music.<br />They play songs from Elvis, Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry, The Shirelles and Buddy Holly. They also picked from the catalog of the great songwriting teams like Leiber/Stoller/Barrett and Goffin/King.<br />\\"I Got a Woman\\" was a hit by Ray Charles and also recorded by Elvis. The Beatles play a faithful rendition here.<br />\\"Some Other Guy\\" captures an early example of Mersey Beat and the Liverpool sound.<br />\\"That's All Right (Mama)\\" is another Elvis tune, with Paul on vocals, and a tasty country twang, although the sound quality lacks on this cut.<br />\\"To Know Her Is To Love Her\\" was a big hit in the States, and the Beatle harmonies really shine here.<br />\\"Memphis Tennessee\\" by Chuck Berry has a loopy guitar line and lead vocal by John.<br />On \\"Lucille\\" Paul does some great belting in Little Richard style.<br />George pulls out an obscure nugget in \\"Nothin' Shakin'\\" with some cool rockabilly twang.<br />\\"The Hippy Hippy Shake\\" was a hit for the Swinging Blue Jeans in 1964, and resurfaced on the soundtrack for the Tom Cruise movie \\"Cocktail.\\"<br />There are also versions of covers that appeared on Beatle records, such as \\"Baby It's You,\\" \\"You Really Got a Hold On Me,\\" \\"Long Tall Sally,\\" \\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy,\\" and \\"Slow Down.\\"<br />This is a fine collection with plenty of early rock gems.k Berry has a loopy guitar line and lead vocal by John.<BR>On \\"Lucille\\" Paul does some great belting in Little Richard style.<BR>George pulls out an obscure nugget in \\"Nothin' Shakin'\\" with some cool rockabilly twang.<BR>\\"The Hippy Hippy Shake\\" was a hit for the Swinging Blue Jeans in 1964, and resurfaced on the soundtrack for the Tom Cruise movie \\"Cocktail.\\"<br />There are also versions of covers that appeared on Beatle records, such as \\"Baby It's You,\\" \\"You Really Got a Hold On Me,\\" \\"Long Tall Sally,\\" \\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy,\\" and \\"Slow Down.\\"<br />This is a fine collection with plenty of early rock gems.
0804115613|5.0|Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe is a long title for a wonderfully creative and enchanting book.  The book is almost like a book within a book because there are actually two stories that are being told throughout.  Evelyn Couch, a woman going through a sort of midlife crisis, meets a spry Ninny Threadgoode at a nursing home.  Ninny begins to tell Evelyn the story of her hometown of Whistle Stop and the people there, focusing mainly on Idgie and Ruth, who owned the Whistle Stop Cafe.  No person was ever shamed for being who they are at the Whistle Stop Cafe; they even served blacks and hobos at a time that that just wasn't done. Fannie Flagg focuses on the intimate nature of the relationship that Idgie and Ruth share, as well as the intimate relationship of Ninny and Evelyn.  There are many laughs and even tears between the covers of this wonderful work as the reader is drawn into the world of Whistle Stop.  This is a charming book with wonderfully colorful and diverse characters.
B000063DHL|4.0|One of Maiden's best.  Re-mastered with a lot of skill.  Nice thick booklet of lyrics and photos and of course the best cover art of the lot.  Best track, Stranger In A Strange Land but there's not really a weak track on the album and Bruce's delivery is simply outstanding.  This and Seventh Son have to be their finest hour.  The enhanced features are good too and even if you have the old edition this is well worth getting for the truly great digital remastering.  Go, on!  Stop reading this and buy it now!
B000066NW0|3.0|16....  <BR>y'all who are slamming this should remember that fact.  Did any of you have this kind of opportunity at that age? <BR>No this isn't punk ... and Avril agreed in a recent interview I read.  <BR>It does sound a little bit country. <BR>I like the down to earth image  Avril portrays and am glad teens have a pop option to Britney etc.  <BR>The vocals are very good and emotionally expressive, good lyrics.  <BR>The band could and should be better. <BR>The production should center more around the music <br />and not just the vocals for this to be considered anything but teenybopper music  <BR>and maybe in upcoming, more mature albums it will.
B00001MXXH|2.0|There are some classic scenes in this film, but over time, the movie as a whole has lost its charm. Review it again and you'll know when and where the film falls.  This reviewer hates the scene when the two punks...er.. car attendants take a joy ride with Cameron Frye's(Alan Ruck -SPEED, SPIN CITY) Dad's prized sports car after he has just handed the keys over to them to park the car. Then, of course, when the car falls out of the house and into a ravine. Now, was that necessary in this upbeat movie. Okay, okay, everything else is great.  However, Jeffery Jones' performance as principal Ed Rooney doesn't hold up after multiple viewings.  Yet, who can forget Ferris (Matthew Broderick) lipsinking Wayne Newton's signature song &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; and the Beatles' version of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; during the parade and Charlie Sheen's classic cameo scene with Jennifer Grey. A modern day ROMAN HOLIDAY type movie which is deemed a classic with great location shots (i.e. Wrigley Field) and good production values, and a hot looking and young Mia Sara... but watch it in bits and pieces. Note: Paul McCartney was quoted as being annoyed when they added a brass section to &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; when the parade band was playing along with the song.
B000089RVX|5.0|This band is incredible!  Their music is one of kind.  It is a dark, engrossing music that is truly epic in scope.  This is not your normal fluff rock that is out nowadays; it has deep lyrics that have meanings that really speak to you along with the great music.  This CD is pure perfection from beginning to the very last track.  This is the CD to buy. Please support great music and go buy this CD.
0452282152|3.0|This is a fairly interesting novel from the standpoint of portraying what it was like for a great artist to work in 17C Holland, that is, Vermeer. The frame of the story is from the point of view of a maid, whose family has fallen from relative affluence and hence she was forced into degrading labor in spite of her considerable intelligence.<br />The sensibility is extremely delicate and prosaic, in that what the maid worries incessantly about are everyday battles for status within the household with children, another maid, and Vermeer's spoilt and narrow-minded spouse. Indeed, the maid's world, while complete in all its distressing detail, is petty to the point of boredom for the reader, or at least for me. Because her personal freedom and possibility were so sadly limited, I could not identify beyond a certain point with her anxieties and hopes as she was forced into a succession of servitudes and humiliations. Moreover, there is not a single jot of humor. Nonetheless, late in the book, her relationship with Vermeer becomes very interesting indeed, as he puts her into a painting as a model for a rich patron - the psychology is subtle and far-reaching. The reader also gets some perspective on the tensions between Catholic and Protestant groups that persisted even in the tolerant cities of Holland.<br />Recommended, but tepidly.

B00005JKGI|4.0|Michael Caine plays a thief named Charlie, recently released from prision.  Quickly he meets up with some of his old mates and things get going.  It's time for a new job, a job in Italy.  The staging is magnificent as outside forces contend against Charlie and his crew.  Will he pull off his elaborate heist?  Gotta see the film.<br />The film's tongue-in-cheek approach was perfect. The film never takes itself too seriously, but it never goes too far.  The characters are great, quirky, and often outrageous. I think this is my favorite Michael Caine performance.  Also, there is a car chase in this film that is about as good as any I've ever seen.<br />Okay, so I was't deeply moved, but this movie is so much fun.  In a way it sort of reminded me of Guy Richie's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, or at least the influence can be seen.  I loved this movie and I loved the ending.  I will be adding The Italian Job to the library.
B0000029GA|5.0|If you haven't heard or actually understand what Nas is dropping on this LP then you done missed out on everything that hip-hop is all about.

B00001QEBQ|4.0|Another fine animated triumph from the Walt Disney Co., &quot;Mulan&quot; follows the struggle of a young girl during her country's time of war.  Determined to fight on her family's behalf, Mulan pretends to be a man and uses her brain to fight warriors much bigger than herself.  Along the way, she's accompanied by a crazy dragon named Mushu (voiced by Eddie Murphy).  Murphy does a great job, very close to as good as Robin Williams in &quot;Alladin&quot;.  In addition, the usual love story is woven into this tale, complimented by a sound track that includes Christina Aguilera, Stevie Wonder, and 98 Degrees.  A good movie.

B000002UA5|4.0|If you're a hardcore Pink Floyd fan, and you enjoy some of their earlier recordings, then this is a must-have album if only for this one song:  &quot;Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict:&quot;<br />Yes, that's the title.  It's something you have to hear to believe.  I used to play it during Halloween to scare children.<br />The other reviews will go into depth regarding the rest, and who wrote what.  Suffice to say, if you're a fan of The Wall but think earlier Floyd - especially pre-Darkside recordings - are just &quot;okay&quot; then this is NOT the album for you.<br />However, if you are like me and think that just about everything the Floyd has done after The Wall is mediocre, and that the early stuff is awesome, then you will like this album.  It's offbeat, weird, jarring, and experimental, just like the times in which it was recorded.  If you'll notice, a lot of the movies made during that time period are the same.
B000063DHK|4.0|I am a huge Maiden fan. They have been my favorite band for nearly 15 years. But this live album from 1985 is the most overrated thing in their collection. Don't get me wrong it is a great album and worth buying (especially since they reissued it in its proper format with the two cd set instead of the atrocious one cd version they had released initially), but some of it falls short. The most glaring weakness of the album can be traced to one thing: Bruce Dickinson. His voice often sounds way too raw and wavering during this album. He cannot reach the highs that the studio versions have, and instead just yells these peaks. A similar thing happens on Pantera's live album when doing Cowboys From Hell era material. But this is a small price to pay (even though it makes me take off one star) for an otherwise excellent live album. Especially great are the versions of Hallowed be the Name and Phantom of the Opera. Some parts are sped up and some of the solos are more improvised. So I would say this is worth it, but keep in mind the vocal problems that must have been plaguing Bruce on these nights.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|no its in every song cuz its on my cd too
B000060MWU|1.0|the picture quality looks like they took it from a very used copy of a vhs and the sound is not 5.1. I am very disappointed.
B00005RFVL|4.0|Ok. Let's get one thing straight - Robbie Williams is not a jazzer. I can say this with some degree of confidence as I have been brought up with, studied with and am a jazz musician. This, however, does not mean that Mr. Williams is not worth his weight in gold when it comes to entertainment value. So often we (I?) see people try and be something they aren't and a few, maybe, get away with it. Robbie has realised that there is no way he can undo Sinatra's sandle straps (if you will allow me to get biblical for a moment) when it comes to recording these classic tracks, but what he has done is mixed them with a little of his own magical personality, and the result is fantastic.<BR>The first track opens the album beautifully, stating something about the album straight away - originality. Ok most of the tracks are, for the want of a better word, 'covers' but they to in their own way are original. 'I will talk, and Hollywood will listen' is a great song which shows two things. a) that Williams' voice is as smooth as clotted cream where necessary and excitingly red blooded where the music dictates it must be and b) the orchestra is incredibly versatile. The big band in some of the other tracks is also electric.<BR>Away from all this excitement we have a small number of pure musical gems. None more so that my favorite 'One for my Baby'. This makes me want to be a singer. In fact I have murdered this song in cold blood recently in a karioke competition at a local PH. The subtle balance of piano and occasional orchestral support (not forgetting a superb sax solo) really bring the words to life and Robbie seems to just float along on top of it.<BR>I would recomend this album to anyone who just wants pure listenability. Don't expect Robbie to pretend he's Frank because he won't. Just listen and enjoy it. MH
B00005T7IA|5.0|This movie is extra long, but I didn't really notice. The extra intensity of this movie keeps you wondering what will happen all the way to the very end. I learned about corporate misdeeds and also about the terrible poisons that nicotine holds. This is one of the best &quot;whistleblower&quot; movies I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. Al Pacino was his usual awesome self, but Russell Crowe REALLY gets the award. The acting job he did was stupendous! I was truly amazed at the way this man morphed into his character, he even had some odd tics that could only come from this character's stress level &amp; personality type.
B000088E6D|5.0|I am a fan of &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;. when I heard Michael Buble sing, it just took me back to the melodic days of Mr.Frank. He (Michael) has the soothing, cooning sound that will make you melt. <br />I also heard that Extra will send a free latest CD of Michael Buble'.This was announced late night of 03/09/03. My address is 405 coopers Ridge Dr., Kannapolis NC. 28083.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This collection of Fleewood Mac far surpasses the original &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; release, that album was thought of as a &quot;keeper&quot; because of it's fine representation of the group's hits, save for the exclusion of &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; and until the release of this collection, the nearly forgotton hit &quot;Love In Store, &quot; which I remembered when I heard the opening bar and first verse. It was an &quot;Oh yeah&quot; moment. <BR>The mastering of this collection makes me short for words.  The people at Rhino are genuises at handling vintage material and when you think they can stop proving themselves, every release gets better and better. Rhino, we all know you're good, relax now. <BR>Fleetwood Mac released a boxed set a few years ago, the mastering of that set was then state of the art, it still stands the test of time and outside of &quot;Go Insane,&quot; the studio versions of the live tracks and the album versions of the singles can be found there. <BR>What most if not all we Fleetwood Mac fans wish is the remastering of watershed albums such as &quot;Rumors&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot; complete with a bonus track or two, remastered, of course, by Rhino. This is the part where I tell you to buy this set, there is no disappointment.
6301763041|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was a little girl and I fell in love with it.  Almost every week  I would make my mom  go and rent it for me at that video store.  I could say every word as the movie went along. In my opinion this is the best movie that could have ever been made.  I would suggest it to anyone that wants to see and teenage romance with a lot of high school action.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This set nicely assembles the bulk of Elton's hits, as we all know this set could have been three discs, the other reviews that preceed this one give an accurate list of songs the could have been included. The selection of songs are presented chronologically and both cd's are programmed to seventy nine minutes. The mastering of this set is awesome, it makes me wish they would rework &quot;To Be Continued.....&quot; to this updated mastered sound.  I truly enjoy all Elton's work and usually find one redeeming track in all his albums. The one track that I'm happy to own in this updated mastering is the original version of &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me.&quot; <BR>For the casual fan, this is an excellent collection of Elton's smash hits, the one huge hit not here is &quot;Blue Eyes,&quot; which is available remastered on &quot;Love Songs,&quot; another excellent collection for the casual fan.  For the money, this collection is well worth it.
0783225857|5.0|Everyone who has ever taken high school English classes will no doubt be familiar with Harper Lee's time honored story. As is mentioned in the accompanying DVD, Fearfull Symmetry, it is second only to the Bible in the hearts and minds of U.S. readers. This is probably also the most often-shown film in said classrooms. No need to reshash the story-line, then.<br />  This DVD set offers an excellent transfer of the famed black and white cinematography of the prolific Russel Harlan. It's a real treat to hear from so many of the people who were involved in the production, from the producer, Alan J. Pakula, to the now grown actors who played Scout and Jim. The audience gains great insights into what made this film so special, not only to the legions of its admiring fans, but to everyone involved in creating it. We learn the scenes that Horton Foote, the screenwriter added from the book to advance character development (the scene showing Atticus putting Scout to bed and her questioning Jim about their mother as Atticus overhears them from the porch, was not in the book, for instance). We get to hear from Elmer Bernstein talk about the genesis of his unforgettable soundtrack. Due credit is also given to Stephen Frankfurt, for his highly creative and original title design, which sets the tone so beatifully for the rest of the film.<br />  There is no question that this is director Robert Mulligan's greatest film, nor that in his portrayal of Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck found the role most perfectly suited to his character and rock-solid persona. This is a film about integrity, essentially, and there is not a false moment in the film. This compilation should be included in any film collector's library. I hope it continues to be shown in English classes until time immemorial. It's message and its relevance to the human condition will never go out of style, one hopes.  Major Praise to Universal Studios and to all those involved in assembling this perfect DVD special edition.<br />BEKbr />BEK
0060512806|4.0|I enjoyed this book, as the author demonstratd a solid grasp of good sarcasm on many fronts. His research into the parallels of information and deception during WWII and the present global age were put to excellent use.<br />The one character who we should have gotten into the head of more was Ari. He has such a pivotal role in the present time, crafting the (shifting) strategic development of the company. But I feel that he is as aimless as the modern Shaftoe character, even though he is not.<br />I could not give this a 5 star, because the book still left me wanting at the end. I have high hopes for his next venture in this area.

From beginning to end I was unable to press stop.  It is a must buy.  It has classical Johnny and then some new stuff that really shows his versatility.  Buy it now!
0316666343|4.0|This was the first book I've read by Alice Sebold.  I felt the book was good, and it intrigued me to read more.  There were parts that dragged on towards the end, and could possibly have been omitted.  I think Sebold's description of the murder was graphic and powerful.  Her description of the killer gave me the creeps, and demonstrates the strength of her writing.  She provided information on his childhood to clue readers into what type of environment produced him.  Reading about the murderer and his crime made me nervous since I'm a parent.  Sebold did an excellent job of showing how deeply and differently grief can impact a family.  I thought her descriptions of heaven were original and creative.  The part of the book about Susie falling to earth was taken straight from \\"Ghost.\\"  There were also elements in the book that reminded me of the movie \\"City of Angels.\\"  These concepts weren't completely original, but then, who is completely original?  Overall, the book is well written, and held my interest.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I saw this movie on cable and liked it okay, but what I'm really looking for is the &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; music video by Lil Kim, Pink, Agulara, and Mya.

0689835604|5.0|This is an adorable and accessible lift and flap book.  Very well costructed, (not a tear yet), and done in a peek-a-boo fashion.  This book is great for learning basic body parts, (belly button, hands, feet, etc.).  My son, (16 months), looks at this book nearly everyday, and has for about 9 months now.
B00004Y62T|4.0|Ok - The plot is deep. This is a well-thought thriller and could have been far more successful than it was...with a few alterations. Jude Law &amp; Gwenyth Paltrow shine (as ever) Philip-Seymour...whoever also played a good part as the slightly freakish friend of Law's character. The big let down was Matt Damon - Now I am not a fan of his...I think someone else should have been cast in his place as for me Damon has no sparkle in films whatsoever. Blanchett was wasted in her role - for such a high profile actress it was a shame not to see that much of her (especially after watching her light up Elizabeth!).<BR>Overall this is definately worth watching - if you like well-thought thrillers with real depth then this is for you...if on the other hand you like shallow flicks then I would advise you don't watch.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I enjoyed listening to the songs from Incubus Morning View Album.  The songs are phenominal, unique, romantic and great!  The songs are meaningful, interesting and outstanding at its best!  The band members play the instruments remarkably awesome!  Brandon Boyd has an astounding, upbeat and likable singing voice in all the songs that he sang!<br />Especially, the song that I liked is &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; plus the other songs.  &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is about a young boyfriend who wishes that his girlfriend would be there with him at the beach watching the glittering stars in nightsky, ocean and sand.  Or about a young man who wishes that aliens in UFO's from another planet do exists, counting UFO's and wishes that they were here; but signaling them with his lighter and he is happy!<br />                    This is the half of song:<br />                    I lay my head onto the sand...<BR>                    The sky resembles a back-lit canopy<BR>                    with holes (stars) punched in it.<BR>                    I'm counting UFO's.<BR>                    I signal them with my lighter, and in this<BR>                    moment I am happy...happy.<br />The songs are astonishing and poetic!
B00005OAIE|3.0|Ive given this a 3-star vote, only because John Mayer is decent for what you hear on the radio these days. Though Im really here to say that hes not that good. Hes Top 40 Radio good. Entertainment companies are continuing to take away your ability to choose what you can hear and see. Pop artists that you hear on the radio and see on MTV are those who have contracted with corporate labels and been molded for the general listening public. John Mayer, Celine Dion, Britney Spears, Pink, Creed, Avril Lavigne, Jennifer Lopez and Justin Timberlake are on the radio, not because they have great talent. Its because they make money. How long are you going to let corporations choose your musical tastes while bombarding you with advertising?<BR> <BR>If youre truly a music fan, why limit yourselves to the radio? Theres great music to be discovered and enjoyed OFF THE AIR. There are talented artists that, simply put, arent sell-outs. They have integrity and passion for their music and they sign with labels that allow them to have artistic freedom. Theyre not focused on becoming rich. They find success no matter what size their audience happens to be. They represent what it is to be a true artist. Some of these artists become famous on their own merit (i.e. Beck, Bruce Springsteen, Tori Amos); most do not.<br />Im not going to tell you whom I listen to. That would be pompous for me to think you care or would like the same music that I do. But why not turn off your radio and see what else is out there? There are great music magazines and websites to use as resources. Check out samples here on Amazon and explore the recommendation pages (i.e. editors picks). Download some MP3s. Check out the listening station at your local independent record store. Go see a live show at a local venue. Share new music with your friends. Bottom-line, turn off your radio and television.
B00000IU6X|4.0|This set of assorted short tracks is hard to avoid if you want to create a track layout of even an intermidiate size. The male-male and female-female pieces will provide a dramatic increase in the number of layouts possible as you can now overcome the problem of curves returning to the starting position.<br />This is a must-have for any Brio enthusiast.
B000002LOE|3.0|I got into this album because I loved the mandolin filled classic, &quot;Losing My Religion.&quot; Well, when I popped in the CD for a first time I would have to say that I am a little bit disappointed. In my opinion, &quot;Out of Time,&quot; was still alright but I thought that it did not have enough songs that held my attention, I either thought they were a bit over the top, &quot;Shiny Happy People,&quot; or a bit dry, &quot;Endgame,&quot; &quot;Belong,&quot; and &quot;Half A World Away.&quot;<br />   There were some bright spots in this CD they include; <BR>   &quot;Radio Song&quot;- a great catchy tune, although the rapping part is way out of place.<BR>   &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;-still a great song, the best on the CD<BR>   &quot;Low&quot;- a slow graceful song, with a great instrumental part<BR>   &quot;Me In Honey&quot;- a very catchy song, a good way to end the album<br />   The other songs I didn't mention; &quot;Near Wild Heaven,&quot; also   <BR>&quot;Texarkana,&quot; and &quot;Country Feedback,&quot; weren't really bad or good and they just kind of blended into the album and are not very memorable.<br />    Overall this CD is worth listening to, maybe burning but I would not buy it. Not R.E.M's best. I give it a B-.
B000069AUI|3.0|In the year 2000, a British band called Coldplay released their debut album, Parachutes, to major label Parlophone. Brits quickly fell in love with melodic and beautifully simple singles like \\"Shiver\\" and \\"Spies,\\" and eventually earned recognition in America with the quietly rocking \\"Yellow.\\" They've been called a baby U2, this year's Travis, the new Radiohead, and have even been accused of making \\"music for bed wetters.\\" (This from a former friend whose band didn't make it to the Mercury Awards while Coldplay did.) The band tried to throw off these stereotypes with their recently released sophomore attempt, A Rush of Blood to the Head, which is an interesting blend of emotional melodies and experimental tracks, but lacks the mellow brilliance that made Parachutes so widely appreciated.<BR>   The album's opening track, \\"Politik,\\" features monotonous guitar and drums over lead singer Chris Martin's banging piano accompaniment. This song bears relevance to world affairs and the possible war with Iraq, with Martin crooning lyrics like, \\"give me love over, love over, love over this.\\" The band performed `Politik' at the 2003 Grammy Awards.<BR>   A similar track is called \\"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face\\" and isn't worth the breath it takes to say. Martin, who showed incredible vocal range on Parachutes, sounds almost whiney over a repetitive guitar. This track has nothing like the beautiful simplicity or strong melodies that make Coldplay such a unique band, and could even be called too experimental. <BR>   Amid boring and repetitive tracks are a few exceptionally lovely songs. The albums second single, \\"Clocks,\\" features a lively piano melody and Martin's fragile vocals. \\"Clocks,\\" like most of the good songs on A Rush of Blood to the Head, is about love gone wrong and questioning one's place in the world. It almost follows the same musical and lyrical concepts of \\"Don't Panic,\\" the opening track of Parachutes.<BR>   Two other brilliant songs on A Rush of Blood to the Head are \\"The Scientist,\\" a sad-sounding piano ballad, and \\"In My Place,\\" a lovely song that sounds more like it belongs on Parachutes. Both of these tracks have less melody than any song on Parachutes, but more profound lyrics. Both seem to reflect Martin's self-proclaimed \\"failure\\" at relationships. <BR>   Even if many of their new songs are a lacking in the concepts that make Coldplay a brilliant band, they are still worth seeing live. Martin's wavering vocals and random seizure-like movements at his piano are always worth watching no matter what songs he plays. University City High School students may be lucky enough to see them when they come to San Diego in June. However, fans should hope that the next Coldplay record is better than their most recent, which would only receive a 5 out of 10, for being too average and not enough Coldplay.
B00005JM1D|5.0|This movie is a must-see, it's hilarious!! From beginning to end, you will experience a whole range of laughter.. From little giggles, to the laugh out loud, to the laughing-so-hard-you-cry-laugh.  Will Ferrell rules the movie by playing a hilarious character that only he could pull off sucessfully. He teams up with Sean William Scott in the funniest scene in the movie (I couldnt stop laughing during this part.) Go and see this movie, it'll sure put a smile on your face ....
B000089CJI|5.0|I dare say this is the best album I have heard so far this year. Having not have heard any previous material by any of the people involved with this project, it really was a true breath of fresh air! Even though i've only owned it for a few days i'm suprised my cd player hasn't burned a hole in it yet. <br />Every song is a unique little gem unto itself. I normally listen to artists like skinny puppy, autechre, broadcast etc, and at first it really caught me off guard. I wasn't used to hearing such well crafted little electronic ditties that were not only pop conscious but didn't have any watered down substance to them at all. The lyrics are fantastic and the melodies are simply amazing. Almost like a cross between ladytron and they might be giants at their best.<br />All the songs are written with vintage synthesizers and drum machines, which adds an even more unique vibe to an already wonderful listening experience. All the songs are straight up verse/chorus/verse and so forth, but I am still struck at how ... catchy they are! If these guys don't own a summer home in malibu by the time this album has been out a year, I think i'm going to boycott the music industry for the rest of my life. MAKE MORE!
0446677450|1.0|I am Utterly amazed that this Rich Dad will not go away. Robert Kiyosaki  says the same thing in book after book.  The advice is absolutely wrong many times. You cannot deduct items like gold watches and sports cars as  deductible business expenses!  <br />The books are fun to read..most fantasy novels are, but don't take financial advice from the Rich Dad Books.  Read or study a good book, one on discounted cash flows for instance, then use something like this for mental candy if you need to.
B00007ELEL|5.0|One of the funniest films I've ever seen.  It not only holds up under repeated viewings but actually gets funnier each time you watch it.
B000005JA8|4.0|ok folks - most of the reviews here are half right. This is always held up as a &quot;classic&quot; album. It's weird and messy and avant-garde, and it's classic status means an instant &quot;square!&quot; branding if you happen not to like it. Some here have claimed Trout Mask Replica's long-lasting reputation is nothing more than a case of the Emperors new clothes, and perhaps they have a point.<BR>I first heard this album aged 15, and I was well aware of just how hip liking this album was capable of making me. That's why I tried so hard to get into it - to be cool and interesting. It was a hard slog! But now, many years later, I find myself returning to this album and actually - get this - genuinely enjoying it! It takes a lot of effort to appreciate this album, this is true. And it must be said that I listen to his more accessible records much more often (the genius &quot;Clear Spot&quot;, for example). This record...generally resides nearer the bottom of my music pile than the top, if I am truthful. But perhaps just once a year, there comes a time when nothing else will do. There is a great feeling of playfulness in this record which I have never come across in quite the same way anywhere else. Just remember - if there is a joke here - it's not on you.
B00005QW4K|2.0|First of all, let me start off by saying this is one of the best B-movies ever put on film. Raimi made a solid movie with a limited budget, forcing him to use cheesy stop-start motion for some of the battle scenes and had to resort to his patented camera tecniques. The story is an original, and Bruce Campbell, no matter what he does in the future (Spiderman 2?) will be forever remembered as Ash, the cocky anti-hero battling for the Book of the Dead. <BR> That being said, lets talk about the DVD. There are way too many versions out there (at least 5 that I know of), which is upsetting for collectors trying to decide on which one to purchase. I chose this one because it contained the director's cut, with over 15 minutes of cut footage and the original ending. Then I watched it and was horrified. Its fairly easy to tell where these cut 15 minutes occur within the film because they still look unfinished. Grainy would hardly describe how poor the picture quality is. Have you ever watched deleted scenes from any DVD and noticed how the film is darker and unrefined? That's what some parts of this DVD resemble. I won't give away the original ending, but I was also dissapointed with it. If you are a fan of this movie, save yourself some money and buy the Broomstick edition, its a much better investment.
B000003AEB|5.0|Without a doubt this is the best Snoopy D O double album ever created. With the help of dope production skills courtesy of Dr.Dre long time friend. Also the helpfrom if long mates NateDogg and DJ Warren G. Let's not forget lady of rage, kurrupt, and dat .... daz. Together all these artists created the dopest west coast ganagsta rap album of all time. It has no comparison to any of Snoop's other works to this date. That's just my opinion I could be wrong.
B00000I9P0|5.0|Great workout music!  I had it on tape earlier, and it was starting to wear out.  This kicks!
B0000630BT|5.0|This album got me from the first drum beats of the title track and quickly became one of my favorite albums. It's so over the top you can't help but love it. Pretty much all the tracks are winners. I love it when Rob Halford uses his high pitch voice for the whole song and he rips on Painkiller, one of his all-time best tracks, and does a lot on Metal Meltdown also. Scott Travis is a lot better than Dave Holland, who was good. The solos are very inventive. I've never noticed problems with the lyrics but I've heard about them. This started way back with British Steel when Priest streamlined their sound and image for mass audinces. THis sounds the least dated of any of the Judas Priest albums. It's as great today as when it was first released.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I like a variety of music from alternative to some metal to some hip-hop to classical. During recent years, it has been very rare to find a CD where I actually enjoy more than 2 or 3 tracks. I'm afraid to buy any CD for that reason. With this CD, I actually enjoy most of the CD. I often mess up on what genre some music officially belongs to, but I consider most of the tracks to be dance music. ...very danceable. &quot;Stars&quot; and &quot;30 Minutes&quot; are more mellow but still enjoyable. <br />I first heard &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; during the season/series finale of Bird of Prey and was instantly hooked. I originally bought the CD for track 2. I was really surprised when I found myself just letting the CD play instead of repeating that one song (or the Russian version of it) over and over. <br />I do have mixed feelings about their cover of &quot;How Soon Is Now.&quot; I'm used to the original version so this version took a little getting used to. If you're not too picky about how close a cover song is to the original version, you might enjoy it. <br />The CD includes two QuickTime files - one of which is the music video for &quot;All The Things She Said.&quot;
0060516402|5.0|As shared before, my review methodology is to give a book some time so I can accurately comment to the degree of which it impacted my life.  In the case of \\"Built to Last,\\" I am writing a review a full 3 years after completing this most excellent book.<br />I am not exaggerating, then, when I say that this is among a select group of the most powerfully influential business books I've read. There is something about the methodology, the way the conclusions are presented, that makes it stand out as an excellent read.  The content is, as some would say, quite \\"sticky.\\"<br />Take, for example, their selection criteria for what constitutes an \\"Visionary Company.\\"  The company had to be in business something like 60 years, so they can see how a culture had \\"outgrown\\" their genesis business model (think about that!!!).  They had to be outstanding market leaders, so there is some tie to the bottom line, and so on.  Personally, these metrics have become ingrained, such that I repeatedly find myself gauging where my organization is relative to these metrics.<br />Secondly, the book expands upon each attribute of a \\"visionary company,\\" such as having \\"big hairy audacious goals (BHAG's),\\" or having what some call a \\"cult-like culture.\\"  Each section expands upon each with direct examples of how the identified companies espouse these attributes.<br />For example, there is much discussion on how firms such as Boeing is famous of undertaking aggressive projects (BHAG's), or how Nordstrom's culture is so powerful it's akin to oil and water (the right people just fit; the wrong people are self-ejected).<br />I have found it fascinating, however, to watch the featured companies since completing the book.  HP, for example.  Why in God's name would HP chose to get into the PC business?  This barely appears to align with \\"The HP Way.\\"  And for a while it appeared that Boeing no longer attacked BHAG's when they rejected the notion of a super-sonic passenger airliner, although their involvement in the Joint Task Force Fighter project certainly appeared in-line with their culture.<br />Finally, I have noted many books whose authors were influenced by this book.  Either the book itself was directly referenced, or the ideas were clearly gained from its reading.  My recommendation: buy it and read it.  I doubt you will ever forget it.ement in the Joint Task Force Fighter project certainly appeared in-line with their culture.<br />Finally, I have noted many books whose authors were influenced by this book.

0749336501|5.0|This book was absolutely incredible, but it was definitely not as easy to follow as some people are making it out to be.  If you've never read a British novel, you may have to read this one twice before being able to fully comprehend it.  I was one of those people, but it was definitely worth it.<br />Trainspotting is one of my favorite novels of all time.  I'll spare you the details, but if you can, make the time to read this book.  You'll become a HUGE Welsh fan, just as I have!
B000067CPX|5.0|Ok, Ive been looking at online reviews and ratings of all Chili Peppers CDs, and let me tell you this - this CD doesn't get as much credit as it deserves.  Obviously the person that rated this CD as a 1 star has no idea what they're talking about.  This CD is nothing like Californication, which is way more heavy and funky.  This CD is laid-back and one of the best CDs I've ever heard, not just from the Chili Peppers, and all I can say is I can't wait til the next RHCP album is out.
0385658710|5.0|Last november, I trusted a friend's recommendation and starting reading the 'Outlander series' from Diana Gabaldon. I quickly became addicted to the series, especially &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot;. I would read it whenever I had a spare moment. If you loved the first novel, &quot;Outlander&quot;, you will love this one as well! Between the two, I don't know which one I enjoyed more. I recommend that you read the series in the order they came out before reading this one. Enjoy!
B00006RIO7|5.0|CHICAGO has finally made it to the big screen, after years of broken deals and broken promises.  And it was worth the wait!  This CHICAGO stays faithful to the original Broadway show (and the Encores! revival) without losing much information in the transition.<br />Catherine Zeta-Jones is a powerforce as Velma Kelly, the vaudeville star who kills her sister Veronica, while Renee Zellweger displays her musical talents for the first time, playing a coy yet knowing Roxie Hart, the vaudeville wannabe who sees her murder charge as a way of hitting the big time.<br />Richard Gere is wonderful as the suave and slick lawyer Billy Flynn.  Gere croons his numbers with a vocal style that was very evocative of the 30's but adds that 90's cynicism which brings his character to life.  Queen Latifah eats up her role as Matron 'Mama' Morton and belts out her big solo \\"When You're Good to Mama\\" for all its worth.  John C. Reilly is a plaintive and heartfelt Amos Hart, the cuckholded husband of Roxie, who sings a wonderful \\"Mr Cellophane\\".  Christine Baranski is fantastic in the slightly-condensed role of Mary Sunshine.<br />Producers have also cleverly cast some of the actresses who have appeared in the Broadway revival as inmates of the Cook County Jail.  Theatre fans will delight in spotting Deidre Goodwin, Denise Faye, Roxanne Barlow and Susan Misner, with Taye Diggs (a recent Broadway Billy Flynn) as the Bandleader.  There is also a wonderful cameo from Chita Rivera, the original Velma Kelly.<br />This wonderful soundtrack to the film features the brand-new song for Velma and Roxie entitled \\"I Move On\\" as well as Anastacia's CHICAGO-themed \\"Love is a Crime\\".<br />Theatre fans will want to get this CD to add to their collection.
B000088E6D|5.0|From beginning to end a truly remarkable recording. The orchestration is beautiful too. And Bubl, what can I say, is incredibly gifted. His is a sound so unique, so rich, so smooth, just sooooooo right for this music. <BR>I really took an instant liking to this fellow's tones and delivery. I immediately thought &quot;That's All&quot; was destined to be everyone's favorite wedding song and &quot;Put your Head on My Shoulder&quot; is pure magic. This is a really good recording that deserves applause and accolades. <BR>Mr. Bubl, when can we see you perform live?
B00006CXSS|5.0|Simply an amazing accomplishment!  Showing this miniseries to High School history students would make them appreciate more the sacrifice of what Tom Brokaw has called the greatest generation.  You can't go wrong with a movie produced by Stephen Speiberg and Tom Hanks.  They are both obvious World War II buffs and only World War II buffs could have made such an amazing miniseries!  Worth every penny!  Every teenager in America should have to see this film!  I loved it!
0671042858|3.0|I found that The Girl That Loved Tom Gordon was very similar plot-wise to Gerald's Game.  I do think that TGTLTG was a much better telling of the story though.  Even though the plot is pretty straight-forward and predictable it kept me wanting to continue reading.  The ending was kind of abrupt, I was hoping for &quot;Extra Innings&quot; :)  All in all a suprisingly good effort for a re-hashed plot.  In contrast I think I gave Gerald's Game one star.
B000002C25|5.0|For reasons I will not embellish upon here, Oasis' third album, Be Here Now, is, while I agree not their best (Morning Glory holds that distinguished honor), my favorite by their group.  This concept may be difficult for some to grasp, but I can clearly see why (What's the Story) Morning Glory? Is the better album, however, I enjoy Be Here Now so much more.  I will admit, it is entirely overproduced, but at the time I fell I love with it, it was the only album I knew, by them, or by anyone for that matter.<br />The album fits as whole, an important factor when putting together any compilation of music.  Every song seems to fit in its designated spot, flowing right along with its predecessor into the song that follows.  It hits several climaxes, as I can see; the first being in the unforgettable opener D'you Know What I Mean?  The second arrives during the fourth track, Stand By Me, and a final one during the tenth track, All Around the World.  The best song on the album, and the greatest zenith it reaches is the eighth track, Don't Go Away. It not only gets better as it plays (it is nearly perfect when it begins and entirely so as Noel strums the last chord), it also gets better every time you play it.  Each underlying note and audible chord fits together perfectly.  The album closes on a symphonic reprise of All Around the World, leaving the listener only to want to listen to the entire album once more in its entirety.
0385335482|5.0|Becky Bloomwood is truly a kindred spirit! I loved her wonderous shopping sprees and ever so brilliant reasonings with her bankers. I was delighted to see how Becky dealth with the splendor of London shops. Her financial logic with her banker (and she's a Financial Consulant?!) kept me laughing and thinking... hmmm???  Don't make the mistake of thinking this is just another &quot;British-girl&quot; book. Becky Bloomwood is truly someone special!  I think she's my new best friend... or my long lost twin sister.
B00000JCB2|1.0|This is one of the worst albums I've ever had the misfortune of having to sit through. Actually, come to think of it, I listened to two tracks and turned it off in disgust. Fred Durst can't rap for his life, I can probably rap better than he can (and I can't sing or rap full stop). Don't degrade yourself with this. Good day to ye all.
B00004SU5J|5.0|I just picked up both Tourist and Paris Under A Groove. Both albums are taking the new fusion of electronica and various funk and jazz stylings to new levels. Tourist is more jazz based than Paris Under A Groove. But both are new trendsetters with the trademark electro jazz sound that dominates the electronica charts in Europe. <br />I find that rarely can an electronica track be more soothing than on \\"Sure Thing,\\" \\"Rose Rouge,\\" on Tourist,and \\"Affinitees,\\" and \\"Le Perif,\\" from the gloriously eclectic Paris Under A Groove. Other highlights on Paris Under A Groove - Stylistique include \\"Prelusion,\\" by St Germain, Funky housy Hoover, Spleen Part 1 by, Florian, and Battery Vox, by The Bottle and Mantis, by Versus. Tourist and Paris Under A Groove provide a soundtrack to days gone by and nightlife to come. <br />These albums can be played for months and years to come. I am quite happy to sit at home with some friends and create my own club/ lounge experience with Paris Under A Groove and Tourist. It is the easiest way to return to Paris for a brief trip.
B00004ZD69|4.0|Even though the name of the band contains the word \\"speed\\" and \\"Black Emperor\\", Godspeed you Black Emperor! is NOT a death metal band.  That was the impression that I got when they came up mysteriously one day on my Amazon recommendations.  Although I was perplexed and curious as to how I would have gotten such a suggestion, I have learned from experience to listen to my Amazon recs.  Just a little research piqued my curiosity about this moving and rebelliously original group.<br />More of an instrumental \\"collective\\" than a band, they claim anywhere from six to nine members in the band at any given time, although they generally boast a string section, multiple guitars and percussionists.  Even though they undeniably fall within the modern \\"rock\\" medium, Godspeed You Black Emperor! composes in a very  symphonic soundscape.  They strongly recall late 20th century minimalism in that they value dynamics, texture, and interplay above singable melodies.  Because of this, fans of melodically-driven music will most assuredly not appreciate the best attributes of \\"Lift yr. Skinny Fists...\\".  Almost all melody is executed in instrumental ostinato riffs, rather than proper melody.  Some people believe that music without melody is without worth, but I believe that one of the basic tenets of music is the creation of tension through harmony and dynamics, and the eventual release of that tension.  This is the realm that Godspeed You Black Emperor! heriocally explores. Minimalistic patterns in the style of Phillip Glass interweave into textures that crescendo, explode, and then recede into almost imperceptible whispers on strings and cymbals.<br />\\"Lift yr. Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven\\" is largely instrumental, but occasionally textures will subside to reveal  dialogue delivered in a man-on-the-street style.  Presented like an undercover news reporter, these vignettes make clear social and political statements that paint a politically aware and vividly humanistic picture.  Some of these taped conversations are more obtuse in their meaning than others, but all are interesting in their ability to convey cognitive ideas in the musical framework.  One of my favorites is the \\"They don't sleep on the beach anymore\\" segment.  In it, an older man tells of his recollections of Coney Island in its glory days, and how times have changed.  It's actually quite touching, and the underlying atmospheric texture enhances its feelings of intimacy.<br />Sonically, the best reference that I can suggest is to King Crimson's more atmospheric work from the 70's (in particular, \\"Starless and Bible Black\\"), without the technical chops that band boasted (perhaps like Pink Floyd al la \\"Ummagumma\\").  The use of the string section may be responsible for this, filling the dual role of David Cross' solo violin and the ever-important mellotron texture that Crimson was using at the time.  Combine this with sheets of organic electric guitar and aggressively melodic bass playing and you have a psychedleic sound that is both contemporary and retro, like an analog version of \\"Kid A\\".<br />At two CD's basically tracked as one song, focused listening can be admittedly difficult.  While it is obvious that there is musical structure, it is fascinatingly difficult to say how much of the music is structured and how much is improvised.  I suggest listening while indulging in a period of zen-like activity, like driving on a solitary road trip or doing menial housework, when you can allow your attention to wander in and out of the music.  You will find that parts of it grab your attention, while other parts insidiously allow your attention to wander.  Soon, you will get an idea of how the piece works as a whole, and the logic of its teleology.<br />So why not a perfect rating?  Although \\"Lift yr. Skinny Fists...\\" is a fascinating album, a very good argument could be made that the repetition of the crescendo-to-explosion-then-start-all-over-again formula tends to become just that: a formula.  I will wager, however, that this group is a spiritual experience in a live situation, and that this human connection is lost on record.  It is always a challenge to capture this aspect in a studio situation, and even more so within the adventurous genre that Godspeed you Black Emperor! is working in.  They may be able to do it, but I'm not sure if they quite do it here.<br />The lowdown: A brutally honest and beautiful recording that will either move or bore you, depending on what you are into.  To really appreciate \\"Lift yr. Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven\\", you must allow yourself to be mesmerized by it.  It's the soundtrack to your most gut-wrenching personal tragedy, but it also blossoms into a hopeful flower.  It represents nameless emotions, like a color that you can't describe, or a feeling that you don't want to.  However, if you are looking to get blown away during the first listen, you might have varying degrees of satisfaction.hat: a formula.

B000002KKX|5.0|&quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot; got lots of radio play.  I liked it but didn't like it enough to buy the album.  But when I heard &quot;Sailing&quot; in about May of 1980 I decided to buy it.  I probably remember listening to this album throughout the summer of 1980 more than anything else that happened that summer.  &quot;The Light is On&quot; is another one of the best songs.  This album really grabbed me.  I could listen to it over and over without getting tired of hearing it but I finally did.  I hadn't heard an album I enjoyed this much in a long time.  Christopher Cross is an excellent singer.  Don Henley sings background vocals on &quot;The Light is On&quot; and Eric Johnson plays solo guitar on &quot;Minstrel Gigolo&quot;.  The drummer, Tommy Taylor, went on to play drums for Eric Johnson.  If you like to hear beautiful music this album is for you.

He also seems to be able to use the force<BR>to dodge bullets.<br />At the same time, some of his experiences lead him to<BR>question the things he has been taught all this life,<BR>about the basic realities of his world, other people,<BR>and the universe.<br />The betrayal of himself by his society, and the path<BR>that leads to his awakening as a person and a veangeful<BR>response is strictly fantasy, but really seemed to reach<BR>something in the theater in which I saw this movie, as<BR>well as it seems about 100% the people here who took the<BR>time to review this movie.<br />I do not want to be too specific, but suffice it to say that<BR>if you at all enjoy movies like \\"The Matrix\\", or \\"1984\\",<BR>\\"Logan's Run\\", \\"THX-1138\\", that sort of thing, or extreme<BR>action movies, and movies about the human spririt, albeit<BR>in this case pretty far out and fantastical, you will<BR>undoubtedly enjoy \\"Equilibrium\\".<br />If you do see this movie, and you enjoy it, I am afraid you<BR>will have to be watched for the rest of your life though, it<BR>may be too subversive! ;-)
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's \\"Room For Squares\\" is the best CD i have EVER listen to, It's a feel good CD filled with songs that i can relate to. John's voice is soo great and his talent as own songs. If you don't have this CD GET IT!! It's worth your money and time to listen. He is a real artisit who believes in what he can do and write as a singer/song writer.
B00005JM93|4.0|This is one hell of a movie: difficult to watch (in the extreme), extended use of shakey cam, overall an uneasy movie-going experience. But if you can get through all that, I think it's worth it to see this flick. There are few films like this out there, or made, ever. Irreversible is an exercise in agit prop by Gaspar Noe, whose previous film I Stand Alone was along the same lines though not as extreme. <br />Irreversible prods you into thinking, but more strongly into feeling. You should look away during the horrendous and very bloody scenes but you can't (at least I couldn't, and I'm squeemish). I'm glad I saw this film and I'm glad it was made. I should warn you, however, that the film may stay with you for a while after you watch it, it did with me. I was upset in a low-level way for a few hours after viewing it. So be warned.<br />This is one of the few films I will never see again; there's no need. The bottom line: I would see 20 films that were as bloody and violent and visually assaultive as this one than huge Hollywood hits like Bringing Down the House. Gaspar Noe had a real personal reason to make this film, and it comes through every brutal frame.
B000069HK2|5.0|I realy love  this genre  of music known as \\"emocore\\"   because of all the great bands such as \\"thursday\\" , \\"at the drive in\\" ,\\"glassjaw\\" , \\"fugazi\\" , and the emo sounds of Jimy eat world which all are amazing bands!! Now, \\"the used\\"  is a great band that plays a very classic emocore sound with a dysfunctional guitar riffs as well as depressing vocals which all makes it great when it comes to emo and i cherish every emo band  and their albums !!! The best song here is \\"a box full of sharp objects\\" , \\"maiby memoris\\" , \\" the taste of ink\\" , and \\"noise and kisses\\" realy realy awsome songs !!!...
B00008IAMD|5.0|Anyone can relate to this CD, as the mix of songs covers nearly every genre of music.  Each time I listen, I hear something different, ranging from amazing to wonderful; from wondering to knowing; from great to greatest.  The Man In Black has surpassed himself in the best of the best.  The DVD - &quot;HURT&quot; is termed a bonus...well it's more than a bonus.  It's by far the very best music video I've had the opportunity to view.  All generations can reflect and relate to the honesty so obviously displayed.
0375410341|5.0|I've picked up this book a million times and have been mesmerized by flipping through the pages. Some pages only have a few words, others are written upside down, others have inset squares of blue. An appendix has strange pictures, sketchings, and writings. The cover itself contains a strange collage. The book looks disturbing and at the same time enticing. So, when I found it at a used book sale for next to nothing, I had to get it. And boy was I in for a wild adventure! This is the type of book that you can get lost in -- really get lost in. Maybe you'll never make it back out quite the same way as when you entered.<br />So the story begins. Johnny goes plundering through the belongings of a dead blind man and stumbles upon a pile of papers. The papers appear to be research collected about a film documentary of a house that is larger on the inside than it is on the outside. It documents the journey made into the dark labyrinth of the house and the affects it had on the people who ventured into it.² Johnny's life becomes a wild roller coaster ride as he reads these papers. Although he can't find any proof that the \\"house on Ash Tree Lane\\" and it's \\"five-minute hallway\\" ever really existed, he gets caught up in its power. HOUSE OF LEAVES is a haunting tale of genius and not a story quickly forgotten. You'll probably never find another book even remotely like it.<br />_________<br />²The book itself is written as a labyrinth through the use of footnootes and creative word placement. The footnotes take you through twists and turns and lead you to dead ends and to satisfying surprises.
0307120007|5.0|I am 26, but I think that the first time i read Pat the Bunny, by Dorothy Kunhardt, was when I was 2 years old!!!  And as I have continued to be an avid reader throughout my lifetime, I will never forget this classic!!  The simplistic yet interactive book comes to life for a child's eyes and mind.  It really gives the child a chance to feel like they are \\"part\\" of the book.  Even though we are so far into technology and children spend time on computers, Pat the Bunny is a favorite because of its' appeal to old fashioned reading!!!
B00005K3O4|5.0|Dude, this is one of the greatest movies of all time. Just buy it.  It's awesome.  The added short-films that the writers created as kids was pretty sweet, too.
0425170349|5.0|excellent. Grabs you and doesn't let go.  Realistic plot and action packed story.<BR>A must read.
B000083C49|5.0|This movie makes the original bare-bones, and much more expensive DVD release of Star Trek IV, obsolete.  While the original film is there, the new commentaries, and bonus materials make the film much better.  Gone is the old Leonard Nimoy intro tacked onto the so-called \\"Bonus Materials\\" section (it was made for the Paramount Director's series VHS/Laserdisc Release), here is more and much better bonus materials.<br />The Voyage Home is my favorite out of the series.  It's a delightful romp that places our heroes \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\".  The movie puts our heroes into the 20th century, where they are so out of place.  But they still manage to solve a problem. Highly recommended, even if you're not a trekkie.
B00008BXJF|4.0|In an era when most bands with a history as long as Crim are resting on their laurels, KC moves further into the 21st Century with music to match. Owing little to previously incarnations of the band, The Power to Believe demonstrates the strengths of this particular line up very well: Belew's fractured lyrics and soaring vocals continue to amaze even filtered through various devices; Fripp rips into a number of songs with power and imagination; Gunn brings to mind Tony Levin's powerful playing without imitating it; Mastelloto's precise playing helps drive many of these songs to their conclusion.<br />Believe is a stronger, more cohesive album than the criminally underrated ConstruKtion of Light but this isn't the masterpiece this version of the band is capable of making. There's still a lot of potential to be realized. Belew's pop instincts (frequently criticized rarely praised) is, as always, an asset to KC; the tension between Fripp's prog pretentions and Belew's pop melodies make the music more interesting. As a big fan of many of the line-ups, I've come to believe that the Fripp-Belew pairing has been the best thing to happen to the band. Their  solo and songwriting collaborations have made the later Crim line ups more challenging and powerful. It's improved both the songwriting quality and the performance of the band. That's not to knock other line-ups; all of the Crim line-ups have their own unique qualities. Fripp has never had a better foil than Belew and vice versa.<br />The music ranges from startling to gentle. The harsher metallic sheen that graced the last couple of efforts is here as well just shined to perfection.
B000007R13|5.0|This is an excellent live DTS mix.  After reading some of the reviews, I was initially a bit skeptical.  However, the sound is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Incredible!  The discreet distribution from each speaker makes you feel as if you're at the concert.  Hearing Duane Allman and Barry Oakley's guitar through the rear speakers gives you a better appreciation of their fine musical abilities.    <br />I must say, 5.1 surround is a big change from stereo and you may have to acquire an appreciation for the newer technology. They didn't design surround sound to have only audience clapping and cheering from the back speakers.
B000089RVX|5.0|I usually purchase musical theatre soundtracks.  When I saw Daredevil, I immediately fell in love with the song My Immortal.  This is my first non-musical theatre soundtrack purchase in over five years and even though I only got it on Sunday, I have listened to it ten times.  I love the mix of the sharp acoustic sound with the ethereal voice of Amy Lee.  I love every song on this CD, but especially the piercing poetry of My Immortal.  WOW!
B00000258J|5.0|Passionate, expert playing and Muddy as only Muddy can be...his ever so cool asides to the players (&quot;that's it!&quot; at the end of one cut) are a cherry on the top...
6304698623|5.0|\\"The Secret Garden\\". I rented both this version and the 1939 Shirley Temple one. I didn't much like the latter, since I can't stand Shirley Temple. However, the 1995 Warner Bros. version is superb. As Sara Crewe, Liesel Matthews is perfect for the role whereas Shirley was NOT. Unlike Temple's overrated and overly cutesy presense, Matthews comes across as a real child in this version, and never resorting to showy, shrill theatrics to get her emotions across. She's very believable, as well as quite attractive-looking. The 1993 \\"Secret Garden\\" film is also superior to Margaret O'Brien's campy 1949 version. The 90's versions of \\"Secret Garden\\" and \\"Little Princess\\" are among only a handful of remakes that improve upon the original films. This is because they have higher production values, beautiful cinematography, and they do NOT use the latest popular child stars to carry the roles of Frances Hodgson Burnett's immortal child characters. How can you say that about other remakes?
B00008AY3L|5.0|Ben Harper is a master musician who is able to blend many different styles and make them his own.  This album, in my opinion, is his best.  Over the years Ben has been refining his style.  This is his most upbeat album with the widest musical styles represented.  His muscial background is in folk music but his music has evolved  into a blend of folk, blues, country, rock, and funk.  Its very fun to listen to, not to mention deeply moving and spiritual.  Another oustanding point for Ben Harper's music is his strict attention to his lyrics.  Ben is one of those artist who truly believes that music can change the world.  A listener can pick up on this immediately through the complex and beautifully crafted lyrics.  If you are looking for a singer/songwriter whose music truly elevates the bar for modern music, then check out this album.  It is definately worth a look.
B00006RU5B|5.0|If you like rock, this is a great rock album to get.  I especially like 'Like A Stone', 'I am the Highway' and 'Getaway Car'.  All the songs are great, and the lyrics as well.  If you like Chris Cornell, then I recommend this album and Soungarden.  Both are awesome!
0792162803|5.0|This movie I like the best I would watch It all day if I could so funny  My sister always gets mad at me cause I watch it constintly. If you like comedy you should by this movie The dance that she does with the hole school Is so funny I know the whole thing well My point is this is the best movie that was probably made in 1999 Thats all for today <BR>Morgan
B00004SCX6|1.0|....how many people will listen to this ... just beacuse she looks good!, fine she's cute, but this music stinks. repetative. Prerecorded sound tracks, she doesnt even play an instrument ladies and gentleman! neither does her band (if that what you call it - i call it a 4 track record with music on it)
B00003XAVA|4.0|&quot;Wind on the Water&quot; was the second album that David Crosby and Graham Nash recorded together, coming after the first CSN&amp;Y reunion tour tour (how many have there been now?).  This 1975 album is on a par with their self-titled first effort, but is not quite as good as the stellar solo albums each produced during that time.  Crosby and Nash always had the virtue of bringing out the best in each other and that is the case here.  Their two-part harmonies work, from the opening track &quot;Carry Me&quot; to &quot;Homeward Through the Haze&quot; and &quot;Naked in the Rain.&quot;  Of course, there are also background vocals from the likes of James Taylor, Carole King and Jackson Browne, which just goes to prove the more the merrier.  &quot;Wind on the Water&quot; is nicely bookended by the two most substantive songs in terms of the lyrics, &quot;Carry Me&quot; and  &quot;To The Last Whale: A. Critical Mass and B. Wind on the Water.\\"  This is just a solid little album of rich melodies and solid vocal harmonies.
B00006F83Y|1.0|I tried and tried and tried. No matter how many times i listened to this I thought it sounded like a drunk singing!! the songs were boring, not catchy and down right droll!! Only good song is the one m-tv is beating to death. There is way better new bands out there than this, if yea like light new rock, try the Donnas!
B00000DGUG|5.0|When you've hit `play' you are immediately greeted with a demonic warbling, as the opening track is a dark one, obscure, that sticks in any listener's head due to the distinctive and varied background beat. This opener is the first part of the story and it reflects Alanis' state of mind at this stage in her life. For `Jagged Little Pill' fans, (Alanis' debut album) be warned: this is nothing like any of Alanis' previous work or indeed like anything you've ever heard before. Her voice is more mature, as if it has ripened over the years and is technically very good as the range of pitches varies greatly. It is finely tuned but the song itself is openly jarring:<br />\\"Slid into the ditch/ I have this overwhelming loss of ambition/<BR>we said let's name thirty good reasons/ why we shouldn't be together/<BR>I started by saying things like \\"you smoke\\" \\"you live in New Jersey (too far)\\"<br />It's starts off as a conventional lyric and song but ends up rather like `I was Hoping'. I think this refers to her partner at the time (surprise, surprise) and how much she didn't want to break up with him.<BR>However she makes no mistake; this album is very listenable due to her distinctive style. As the first track concludes, you realise this is something original to taste. This feeling continues throughout the album as Alanis constantly plys the listener with estranged tracks that are totally and thoroughly related to her. <BR>It is Alanis' second co-produced album with seventeen characteristic self-penned tracks. This was no easy feat for Morissette, as fans had to eagerly wait two years before it was completed. This album allows self-doubt to get a look in; it is not commercial in the least, as was JLP, but it doesn't need to be for the intelligent listener. During the second track, her idiosyncratic guitar makes a welcome appearance as Alanis takes to this album like a duck to water.<BR>`Sympathetic Character' is where it all gets strangely exciting. Many people think that thisis a mis-matched string of odd phrases that do not make sense; quite simply Alanis was slated for it at every available opportunity. However, I think that the unpredictable melody and the tempo of her vocals with Alanis, make this the distinguishing track of the album:<br />\\"I was afraid of verbal daggers/ I was afraid of the calm<BR> before the storm/ I was afraid for my own bones\\"<br />I think that most people in her situation will be able to identify with what she is saying here. It is a very rushed song but it includes all of the characteristic features of domestic abuse. It borders on the hysterical side as the pitch of her voice suggests that she is slightly frantic perhaps even uncontrollable; she needs to get the words out. Even the very obvious gasps at the end of each lyric when she's drawing breath, don't matter - in fact it adds to the frenzied approach to the subject of domestic abuse.<BR>Track no. six `That I Would Be Good' epitomises the nature of the whole album; a song about how, if she lost everything tomorrow, it wouldn't matter because she feels she has achieved what she wants and she'd still feel happy. <br />`That I would be good even if I gained ten pounds/<BR>That I would be fine even if I went bankrupt'<br />This song says that she has found true happiness that isn't in the form of money etc. Many people will be envious of this song and what it means and wish they could say this at least once in their lives.<BR>At first listen the song feels like it shouldn't be on this album, due to the slow, methodic tempo and the volume and pitch of the lyrics - like it doesn't qualify for SFIJ. It is only when you analyse the lyrics after that you realise just how important this track is - without it Alanis' message wouldn't get through.   <BR>`I was Hoping' is a stream-of-consciousness style of writing and is extremely fast-paced yet still has a clever rhythm. Alanis is even sometimes out of breath because of the fast tempo. <br />`As we were talking outside it was cold we were shivering <BR>yet warmed by the subject matter/ my wife is in the next room we've been having troubles you know, please don't tell her or anyone<BR>but I need to talk to somebody'<br />This is a story-telling song that is purely her thoughts off the cuff and original. It is almost a part of her diary it is that personal.<br />It is only now that you realise that the huge grinning smile on the cover indicates that Alanis is once again happy and self-fulfilled. The nakedness on the c.d. suggests that perhaps more importantly, she is happy with her body and the way she looks (which is a big turn-around considering she has admitted to eating disorders in the past).  It is almost a pictorial metaphor for exposing her inner and outer self.<BR>Then, it's only as you place the c.d. back in its case, do you realise that this is not an odd choice of colour or pictures etc. it is purposely chosen for its lack of colour and attractiveness. Whereas Jagged Little Pill was a happy-ish but accusatory time in her life, the second album represents a dark period that's very abstract. For this is not an album made to make money, her main purpose is to share her story with her audience. To Alanis, if this album sells one hundred copies or one hundred million copies, it won't matter as long as she's told her story.
B000002UY5|1.0|Maybe I just never \\"got it\\" When this band was big, people loved them, I despised them. I think this guy cannot sing, and people say he was the best at it? I found death metal singers that didn't grate on my nerves as much as his voice does, and that fat bee girl pisses me off too. This is way to hippy dippy for anyone.....shame on all you!
B0000636UN|5.0|tHis album is awesome. Sheryl has a great voice, and all the songs are good. If u liked her singles, soak up the sun, and steve mcqueen. then ul love this album. theres a great mix of really upbeat fun tracks, and slower, more dramatic ones. my fave songs were, soak up the sun, safe and sound, abeline, and it's only love was also really good.there really isn't a single bad song.all the songs r great, i promise.sheryl writes her own music and lyrics, and she's one of the best arists out there.if u havent gotten this album yet, ur missing out.
0792839749|5.0|I don't remember that many movies from when I was a youngster, probably because not that many stood out as anything special. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang however, is one movie I remember vividly.  The sense of excitement, the colour, the music is all woven together in a spectacle of movie making that we seldom, if ever see these days.  This way out fantasy is aimed at children but is none the less great entertainment for the entire family.  Dick Van Dyke gives an outstanding performance and displays talents that are rarely seen in actors these days.  The simple theme song is a classic that many baby boomers would easily be able to sing along to.  It may be difficult to cultivate as much excitement as I had for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, with kids nowadays.  They are conditioned to movies of a different ilk.  If you have young kids however, I think we owe it to them, to introduce them to the movie so they can see for themselves a movie made in the old fashion way, which focuses on fun and adventure.  Highly recommended.
B000066NW0|4.0|i think this is a cool debut. avril has a lot of talent, and its ok that her music isn't punk, cause she never said it was, and its still good.its really catchy and fun, and avril has a great voice 4 her age.the singles r great, but got overplayed on the radio, and on mtv.the best songs on the album  are losing grip(a really fierce rock track),tomorrow(a sweet song,mellow),and things i'll never say, which is catchy as hell.as long as u can take this album 4 what it is, then u can enjoy it.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|It's not very often we see a World War Two Naval movie.  Being a fan of this genre of movie it was with a degree of nervousness that I watched U571, hoping that the Director could pull it off.  I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed.  It isn't a classic but it is an enjoyable and entertaining movie that is a little different to most of the war dramas we see these days.  The story line is interesting if not pretty basic.  Capture a deciphering machine for decoding messages that can alter the direction of the war.  The sets used to depict the submarine are believable.  There is plenty of action to keep the adrenaline pumping and the tension is steady throughout the movie.  The acting is sound if not overly spectacular and there are no real twists in the movie.  World War Two enthusiasts and those who enjoy a slice of action should enjoy the movie.  Recommended.
0517122707|5.0|I loved this book. The only thing I disliked is that there is no more to look forward to. Toole's understanding and usage of southern dialect is impeccable. If you love southern novels, you will love this!
B000068TPN|4.0|Mel Gibson's `We Were Soldiers' is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed.  It's not one of those special movies that seem to stay with you, but for what it was, an action packed war drama with some interesting angles, it carried itself very well.  The action scenes, and there are plenty of those, are convincingly done.  The acting is solid throughout the movie and Australian actor Gibson puts in a typically good performance.  I applaud the movie's portrayal of both sides of the conflict.  It was refreshing to see the Viet Cong depicted as soldiers no less human than their US counterparts, and not vilified for being the enemy. The story of the wives back home running parallel to the main battle was a nice touch which provided welcome relief from the horror of the battlefield, but in it's own way was a stressful part of the movie.  Overall I give the movie the thumbs up.  I don't see myself watching it again in the near future, but 6 months down the track I think `We Were Soldiers' will deserve another viewing.  Recommended.
079073804X|5.0|This movie grew on me!!  I was scared to watch the film as a kid and my mother would not let me go see it.  When I finally saw it as a teenager, I laughed at the incredible special effects.  Now, after watching the movie for the fifth time, I thought William Friedkin's movie was a stunning masterpiece.  Probably the scariest movie ever made.
6305280762|4.0|Irwin Allen's apex was \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\".  \\"The Towering Inferno\\" boasts bigger stars, more elaborate sfx (including the dress worn by Dunaway that she managed not to \\"pop\\" out of), and a more complex score from John Williams.  However, the script could've used a few more rewrites to erase the lapses in logic.<br />That withstanding, the movie does what it was intended to do: provide a couple of hours of escapism.  Sadly, the scenes of flames shooting out of the side of the lumbering edifice are frightening reminiscent of the short glimpses of fire from BOTH towers of the late, great World Trade Center.<br />Who would've thought that an image from a 30-year-old film would foretell a horror unthinkable to most Americans?
B000002MFN|5.0|THIS COULDVE BEEN HER BIGGEST CD EVER BUT HER PUBLIC LIFE AND BAD MOVIES OVERSHADOWED THIS CLASSIC ALBUM. ME BEING A HUGE FAN OF CLUB/HOUSE MUSIC I WAS ESTATIC WHEN I HEARD THIS WAS A DANCE CD. THIS CD ACTUALLY GOT SOME PRETTY GOOD REVIEWS WHEN IT WAS RELEASED BACK IN 92. THE ALBUM ITSELF IS WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME AND IN MY OPINION IS A BETTER \\"DANCE\\" CD THAN RAY OF LIGHT. I LISTEN TO THIS DISC 11YEARS LATER AND AM STILL AMAZED HOW GOOD IT IS AND HOW FRESH IT SOUNDS. THIS IS A MUST HAVE.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a rare jewel by all of the new artists coming out this year.  This is a very good cd in my opinion.  The lead singer has a beautiful voice and it seems that everything goes together very well for this artist on this cd.  Pick it up now.
630218021X|5.0|I must say this is about the best movie I saw that I never knew that it existed.  The whole thing is a masterpeice from beginning to end.  Never a dull 5 minutes and always stays interesting.  Perhaps the best &quot;under-the-influence&quot; movie ever made!  Can't wait for the DVD release!  *crosses fingers*
0141439513|5.0|And the Penguin editions are always the nicest!
6302787556|3.0|Lee should have stuck to the book, which is superior to the film<BR>as an inspirational story, as pure entertainment,and as a message piece about race relations. As it is, he insults the intelligence of his audience....<br />PS: Denzel is OK. Spike's ego gets in the way of the vulnerable, sort of inept Shorty vibe (as Malcolm and Alex Haley wrote him).
0780626966|5.0|This set provides the essentials, the movies one through seven. However the Encyclopedia disc is simply PACKED with extras. I think there is nearly 2 or 3 hours of extras. With that, any Nightmare lover can see the entity of this movie in so much depth and detail. You'll also find, if you haven't already, that Robert Englund and Wes Craven are \\"Bloody\\" genius'. There is a reason why A Nightmare on Elm Street is simply the BEST horror movie franchise in existence, and this collectors box set gives you 8 reasons why. Unlike it's rivals, the Nightmare series travels, it covers so many aspects of the evil inside (without embarassing itself by traveling to space!). <BR>                If there is one thing I truly respect about this series is the sequels. Although parts 2-6 were not really scary, they did deliver what would become the quintessence of Freddy. The sarcastic, sometimes hilarious demon anti-hero who you can't help but cheer for. Also, it does something that no other horror movie franchise has. It's final part leaves the viewer just like the first one: terrified. I really feel that New Nightmare was so overrated yet so very well done.  <br />        If you love these movies, BUY THIS SET! Well worth the money!
B000002H33|5.0|Yep i totally agree with 100% of reviews.. AWESOME ALBUM! Along with this album you should also get ONE (best 3 guitar riff ive ever heard) and Ride The Lightning. Forget The Black album, these are MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better. Trust me.
B00004W52U|4.0|I was originally the only person who gave this album 1 Star, but I gave it a second chance and it started to grow on me. Definately something to be treasured. It's the only ska sounding album I own. They have to be one of the most cultivated bands in the history of music.<br />This was my original post:<br />This album features probably the worst guitar tone I have ever heard. (presented by Tim \\"Lint\\" Armstrong of Rancid fame.) This album is very politically driven and has some good notions, but for the most part gets tiring. The singer sounds terrible even for a punk band. Well if your into bad musicians and poor audio quality pick this baby up. If not, don't make the same mistake I did.
B000002H6C|5.0|Absolutely amazing album!!! ONE sticks out like a thorn in your side. A-MAXING song!! In my oppinion the best ever metal song for a number of reasons. Kirk Hammets brief but kickin' solo, and the AWESOME 3man riff from 2:30 until the end of the 7:24 song!<br />Crank this one up loud!!!
B00008AY3L|3.0|Diamonds on the Inside is a very inconsistent album.  On his earlier albums, Ben Harper did a masterful job of melding his genre-bending styles into a cohesive whole.  That aspect is noticeably missing from this album.  It definitely has its moments, and simply based on Harper's amazing musicianship, this album is better than 99% of the stuff out there today, but for an artist with his talent, it leaves a lot to be desired.<br />Nonetheless, as Harper sings on this album, &quot;When it's good, it's so, so good.&quot;  The song that lyric comes from, &quot;When It's Good,&quot; is a nice bit of raw blues.  The title track sounds like it could have been written by Elvis Costello (which is a compliment).  On its own it is a nice pop song, but like most of the tunes, it is performed in such a different mood than the rest of the songs that precede and follow it, it feels a bit out of place.  Ballads &quot;When She Believes&quot; and &quot;Amen Omen&quot; are as beautiful as anything Harper has written and translate better to the recording studio than the more upbeat songs.<br />The best song on the album is the 4th track, &quot;Touch From Your Lust,&quot; a regal rock anthem that captures Harper at his best.  The song is beautiful in its desperate longing and features his most inventive work on the Weissenborn since &quot;Ground on Down.&quot;<br />While there is enough to satisfy most Harper fans, Diamonds on the Inside is just not as strong as his prior albums.  Some tracks are barely listenable, including his failed piece of funk &quot;Bring the Funk&quot; and the overlong opening track, the reggae-tinged &quot;With My Own Two Hands.&quot;<br />As a side note, this album has a strangely 80's vibe to it.  This is neither positive nor negative, simply interesting.  It often evokes Paul Simon's Graceland, amplified by the fact that the album is called &quot;Diamonds On The Inside&quot; and includes an a cappella track with Ladysmith Black Mambazo.<br />If you are a hugeBen Harper fan, go ahead and get this album.  It certainly has its moments and no doubt the faster songs will translate very well to his live performances.  If you aren't a big fan though, I'd recommend buying one of his earlier albums or better yet, his fantastic live album &quot;Live From Mars.&quot;
B00004Z459|5.0|We're now in the year 2003, and this cd has been out for over 2 years, and it still gets massive air play and mass attention. I won't go into the reasons why everyone should love it, there's enough reasons for that, just listen to it.  But this CD is excellent for those who love to rap or rock out.  My best bud and I have a ritual, if we're on the way home from somewhere, at least once a week, we perform a duet.  He raps, I carry the &quot;singing&quot; and choruses.  It's just a fun cd, plus, there are some songs that I can totally relate to, they're a great band, and I know some critics gave them a harder time then they should have.  Let the audience speak for them, cause they seem to have a very large one!
B00003CXSP|4.0|It is a great movie if you don't compare it to silence of the lambs.  The two movies are entirely different.  It is very engrossing (and gross as well at times).  Not too much mystery to it, but enough to keep you going.  You just might not want to eat for a few days afterwards though....
B000089RVX|5.0|&quot;Fallen&quot; by Evanescence is by far the best cd purchase in over a year for me.  The are absolutely fantastic, and Amy Lee has a beautiful voice with a great act for song writing.  I said it before, and I'll say it again and again, this is a FAN-friggin-TASTIC cd, it's the best!  The &quot;rock-like&quot; songs have an excellent pace, the instruments are played to perfection, and the beat is undeniably great.  The songs touched my heart, especially the slow songs.  &quot;My Immortal&quot; is a beautiful song, that has yet to get old with me.  The first track of the cd (&quot;Going Under&quot;)sets the tempo for the rest of the cd, and it's my favorite song on the cd.  &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; was a great choice for the first single, and it's incredibly popular, however, the rest of the album completely backs that song up, with powerful lyrics and fantastic vocals, such as I said before.  This band by far, is not a &quot;One-hit-wonder,&quot; because all of their songs are worthy of becoming singles.  Everyone must purchase this cd, it's perfect for those who love rock and alternative music.  If you want to be pumped up, listen to Evanescence, because they will make you feel completely energized and fulfilled.  Evanescence is by far the best band to come around in a very long time, and I believe they are here to stay, so purchase this cd, you will not regret it.
B000003S0B|5.0|FOR ALL PROGRESSIVE ROCK FANS, THIS IS A MUST BUY.  A GENERAL REPEAT BUT MORE CONTROL THAN ITCOTCK.  THIS IS MY MOST FAVORITE CLASSICAL ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME. I, A PROG ROCK FAN MYSELF WHO ENJOYS LISTENING TO MUSIC WITH INVENTION, FEEL THIS ALBUM DEFINITELY CONTAINS A COMBINATION OF ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT FORM THE AMBIT OF ROCK...FROM PROGRESSIVE TO SOFT.
B000089RVX|5.0|Like many others my first exposure to Evanescence was watching Daredevil.  Their music style fits both the mood and message of the movie perfectly.  I was a little disappointed Fallen hadn't been released yet and impatiently awaited March 4th to come around.<br />Wow!  I consider an album to be good if it has 4-5 good tracks, great if it has 7-8.  Fallen has 11.  No joke.  The band shows a fantastic range from ballads like &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; to all-out rock pieces like &quot;Whisper&quot;.  My personal favorite is &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;.<br />If I had to describe their unique sound I would characterize them as Linkin Park meets Sarah McLachlan, only better.  Amy Lee has an incredible voice and uses it very effectively throughout the album.<br />I'm fortunate I live in the Salt Lake Valley and was able to attend one of their first concerts following the album release.  My only complaint is that as a live act they haven't quite yet figured out how to feature Amy's voice nearly to the extent it's done in the studio.<br />If Fallen gets the deserved airplay nationally it wouldn't surprise me if Evanescence gets a Grammy nod for Best New Artist.  If it were up to me I'd even nominate it for Album Of The Year, it's that good.
0156421178|5.0|I have not read any of Orwell's books, besides Homage To Catalonia.  It's a great book, often funny, often not.  I have never read a single thing on this war, i've heard of it.  It's never came up in any of my classes, probably because of it's anarchist-communist fighting facism. Well, check this book out.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OKC is perhaps the best musical achievment in the nineties. The band created an escape from reality. Yes, it was made with alot of computers and digitizing, but I think that is half of the point of the alblum. If you sit down and listen to it, no one should have to explain why it is the best alblum of the nineties.
0887307280|5.0|I am 28 years old and I discovered the E-myth when I was 24. At the time I only knew the Nightengale-Conant tape series, but it had a profound impact on my mind and my business. <br />Today, solely because of this book, I have written three financial books of my own and have a successful private investment firm, liverpoolgroup.com, entirely based on the fundamental principles found in Mr. Gerber's books.<br />The reality is that the &quot;franchise prototype&quot; that Mr.Gerber discusses is a fraction of his message. He really shows you how to set aside your fears and seize the brass rings that reside in your ideas. He takes you psychologically from the mundane to the infinite, by opening your eyes to the limitations that you have placed on yourself. <br />He also forces you to confront your value system. This is a brilliant book and is a must have for any person that is contemplating their own business. It is also perfect for those that are in business, but somehow forgot themselves along the way.
B00006V9A0|2.0|...Not to say that the creatively titled album isn't good. All the songs are among Nirvana's better work. And you shouldn't really vent out your frustrations on this CD just because you were expecting a \\"new\\" Nirvana album of unreleased songs. I'm not sure about the order they were put in, but a CD with a couple of the best songs from each of Nirvana's main albums can't possibly be that bad for a fan.<br />That said, it's what this album could've been, not what it is, that gives it this 2 star review. Several of the key songs are missing, and Dave Grohl, and Krist Novoselic were seemingly not involved at all. Like a reviewer before me said, one can simply look at \\"The muddy bands of the Whiskah\\" to see what this could've been.<br />I'm young enough to look at this as just a greatest hits album from a band when I was fairly young, but even so, I would rather that it had looked something like a studio recorded \\"Muddy Bands of the Whiskah\\" with insightful notes by the existing band members, some commentary, pictures, and a CD that was put out with a lot of care and as a fitting tribute for Nirvana. ...
B00008AY3L|5.0|I love this new album.  I went right after school and picked up a copy.  Best thing I've done in a while!  Every song is COMPLETLY different.  Ranging from Funk to Rock to Gospel, this album has it all.  While in comparison to his earlier CD, this one is not quite as good as some of the older stuff like from &quot;Welcome To The Cruel World&quot;, but it is still better than all the stuff out there today! If you have the means, I highly reccomend picking up one :)
B000075BFK|5.0|2pac is the best rapper there is n ever will be .. and this cd proves it! Its a 2Disc set and every single song is great! Coming from a HUGE 2pac fan, this is the best cd yet! My own personal favorites are \\"U can call\\", \\"They dont give a ... about us\\", \\"Fair Xchange remix\\", \\"My Block remix\\" and \\"Street Fame\\". But they're alllll great! I HIGHLY reccomend this cd to any one that likes 2pac and enjoys rap music! This is the ULTIMATE cd of 2002/2003 ! He is the most creative artist there ever was, besides eminem, they both are popular in their own time! I definitly reccomend this to EVERY ONE ! It's worth the money, trust me! * 2 p A c * rEst iN PeAce - LiVe oN!!
B00005JLSC|5.0|\\"You know how some guys just can't hold their arsenic?\\" BAM! Ladies and gentlemen, for my next sentence this evening, about Chicago, I'd like to quote Velma upon being sworn in for court, swearing to tell you the whole truth... \\"and then some!\\" With that said, I'm telling you that CHICAGO is a KNOCKOUT! If it sweeps the Golden Globe and/or Oscar awards, it \\"had it comin'\\" to quote the infamous Cell Block Tango. Don't believe the negative hype other reviewers may give this exceptional piece of cinematic vision. Let's see them snag a role in ANY movie that sells out consistently (in Portland, Oregon, CHICAGO has SOLD OUT every show with applause after several numbers and more applause at the end!) And then let's see these arm-chair critics act, sing, & dance... and All That Jazz and see how they rate, huh? CHICAGO ROCKS! The negative hype is just jealous that they're not in this awesome HIT! They're ill-informed that there was an actual limited release (I've seen it everyday during its first weekend--I'M HOOKED!). CHICAGO'S A BLAST! Although a few numbers were cut from the theatrical release, I've heard that \\"Class\\" will be on the DVD (I hope this rumor is true). So, okay boys, \\"how's about two partin' shots?!\\" If you like \\"all the things we hold near and dear to our hearts,\\" then this Chi's for you. Any more negative hype about this KILLER thriller-diller should take the advice of the Silver-Tongued Prince of the courtroom, who had this to say about similar \\"dumb, common criminals:\\" \\"Long as you keep 'em way off balance, how can they spot you got NO TALENT?\\" In this case, CHICAGO will Razzle Dazzle anyone who CAN spot superb talent. And for my last sentence this evening, I'd have to quote Roxie and Velma again, saying, \\"here's some advice, direct from me to you:\\" Buy CHICAGO!

0374172897|1.0|how in the world did this book win the pulitzer? must have been due to its political-correctness. the atmosphere is one of cloying paranoia and excessive emotions, welling in every character at every encounter. the plot mires in the--granted, well-written--trope-laden, cynical, omniscient perspective: tropes of characters' perceptions that are not really enlightening (and therefore distracting, _because_ they aren't applicable), just admirably elaborate and detailed.<br />these flaws are, i think, alluded to by the author in a couple of revealing asides: \\"Richard produces a novel that _meditates exhaustively on a woman (a fifty-plus-page chapter on shopping for nail polish, which she decides against!)\\" (page 126, picador q.p.b.); and \\"It feels like it's about ten thousand pages long. _Nothing happens_. And then, _bam_. She kills herself. . . \\"You're in perfect agreement with almost every critic. _They'd waited all that time, and for what_? More than 900 pages of flirtation, really, with a sudden death at the end. People did say it was beautifully written.\\"(page 130, ibid.) (emphases mine, except for the \\"bam.\\") in the case of _the hours_, the chapter is a 26-plus-page chapter on shopping for flowers, which she decides _for_; as for _the hours_ being \\"beautifully written,\\" i'll concede that some of the amazingly out of place tropes are.<br />but, _the hours_ has gay, lesbian, and AIDS-positive characters (most, of course, wildly successful in their own--or others'--professional lives). it's just all too pat, and all too p.c., and . . . the _pulitzer_, for god's sake.
B000003N7G|5.0|Put this in the category of essential music.  Kind of Blue seems to be the barometer of everyone's measure of what great jazz is, so is this better than Kind Of Blue?...Well I don't know, its really unfair to pit one up against the other, they are both brilliant in their own right. One thing I am certain is that this recording is intense, I don't know that I've heard a jazz recording with the sheer power I feel from this one.  Has Coltrane ever soloed better than he does in Part 3-Pursuance?  He and McCoy Tyner work it up to a feverish intensity that leaves the listener in awe, I'm not kidding it is that good, jaw dropping stuff. Can't comment enough on how good McCoy Tyner is on this disk either, he is amazing.  And if that's not enough Elvin Jones and Jimmy Garrison are clicking on all cylinders too. They are so good that it is just as interesting to take your ears off Coltrane and Tyner for a while and just listen to what the drums and bass are doing.  Part 2-Resolution has to rank up there as one of the best tracks in all jazz, another track that builds up and takes the listener to new levels.  This disk pretty much takes all of my concentration every time I listen to it, it takes over.  My only complaint is that it is too short, but otherwise perfect, and it is a must have in any collection.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I want to thank the Media for airing several specials on Michael Jackson recently, because they just reminded me how great this man is! I think the Media had it in mind to destroy MJ, but I fervently hope they don't succeed. I can't tell you how much I love this CD. I love every song..just can't decide which one I like the best at any one time. JAM - fantastic beat, great to dance to! IN THE CLOSET - wow. I didn't know Michael was this hot.Who is the mystery girl? BLACK OR WHITE - great song with impacting lyrics. GIVE In TO Me- great guitar..different for MJ. I wish I had bought this CD years ago. And MJ wrote all of the songs..now that's talent.
B00006G8HX|4.0|After the successful Star Trek II, Harve Bennett once again produced, but Nicholas Meyer declined to participate in Spock's rebirth. This, however, allowed a good idea: giving Leonard Nimoy the reigns in what is a clearly transitional film for the series. Many fans believe in the \\"odd-numbered curse.\\"<br />I myself do not believe in it. This film's not perfect, but it's a good solid Trek adventure from start to finish. I think III is often overlooked because of its very serious tone; there's only a few scenes that are humorous (like Sulu's \\"don't call me tiny\\" schtick). However, what we have here is a great sci-fi/drama with great performances (especially Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon commander). James Horner produces another good musical score (albeit it's not nearly as ambitious as his score for II) and Leonard Nimoy does a good job in his first directorial outing, which would be perfected in the next episode of the series, The Voyage Home. This movie's no Wrath of Khan, but it's solid proof that the odd curse doesn't exist. It's a well-rounded Trek adventure and it paved the way for IV.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I've heard it said that after 'Thriller', Michael Jackson's CDs have all gone downhill. That may be true as far as number of copies sold of each, but it isn't true musically. I loved 'Thriller', but 'Bad' is better than that. MJ gets a more mature sound with every new effort. My favorite songs in this CD are 'Another Part of Me' (great rhythm), 'Man in the Mirror'(a part of MJ revealed?), 'Dirty Diana'(sexy, edgy), and 'Smooth Criminal'(a story with a great beat). But also realize that the other songs are good, too. Has Michael EVER recorded a bad song??
B00005V9IK|4.0|awesome! It starts out slow showing the moon and the giant mother ship flying over head then it picks up speed when it goes to earth and shows the scientist getting the warning signal. Then it really picks up speed when it shows the destroyers start to enter earths atmospfere. The really awesome part is when the destroyers fire that energy bomb and blow up the biggest cities and it goes on showing the americans and other contries fighting the aliens. But then it just slows right down when it shows Will and Jeff go and delevier a giant nuke to the aliens. Why does the heros always have to win?! Why can't the bad guys win one in awhile? Any way this movie is great i recommend it!
B000089RVX|5.0|Mostly I listen to Hip Hop but I come from a background of metal. This album is the best thing I heard in a couple of years. I recommend this album to anyone.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I loved this movie!!  It has phenomenal special effects and the sets and costumes are incredible- only enhancing the storyline!!  Leonardo DiCaprio gives a moving performance as Jack Dawson, a dreaming and scheming lower class young man who falls in love with a confused upper class young girl (Kate Winslet).  The original score adds to the emotion of this classic love story while making the sinking of the ship even more tragic.  This 9 time Academy Award Winner is worth the 3.5 hours!!
B000002J20|1.0|Let me dispel any suspicion up front that my about-to-be-expressed contempt for this flatulent dinosaur (which belongs with Tormato and Union in the delete bin) is driven by a lack of sensitivity to or \\"understanding\\" of Yes: I am an absolutely partial fan of what I consider to be the *real* Yes: the band that roughly 30 years ago proved through stellar achievements like CttE and Relayer that interesting things could indeed be done with rock beyond the banal 3-chord monotony of teeny-bopper rock n roll: I LOVE Yes at their best.<br />Unfortunately, this is Yes at their most embarrasingly banal worst. What we have here is a bunch of newly rich rock stars who were given too much latitude by themselves and their record company - even to the point of bringing hay and wooden cows into the studio to emulate \\"country living\\", a true Spinal Tap-ism - and they proceeded to make a mockery of themselves with futile references to non-western philosophy and a whole pile of pretentious, airy-fairy musical poot. I have tried several times to approach this music with an \\"open mind\\" but each time I have I ended up getting suddenly violently angry at the scale of this monumental ripoff, usually ending up with me ripping the LP/CD/tape out of its playback device and practially ripping the thing to bits. Then I reach for John Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" and I feel better.<br />From listenting to TfTO I know where Johnny Rotten got all his sneering, angry energy from. Now I know why he stuck himself with razor blades and what-not. This album makes me feel like doing so myself.<br />What a shame: the same guys who bring us to such heights of exileration with sides like \\"Siberian Khatru\\" and \\"Gates of Delirium\\" reward our loyalty with this god-awful pointless exercise in ...-noodling.<br />Word to the wise: AVOID THIS MONSTROSITY AT ALL COSTS!
B00005LC4B|2.0|Martin Scorsese remade a very good movie and made it into a dark, ugly film. They say this was just an updated version of the original but to think that every person in this movie is not just flawed but so unlikeable that you really don't care if they make it or not.<BR>      Nick Nolte play's Sam Bowden a lawyer who is cheating on his wife and seems to care nothing for his family. Jessica Lang is Bowdens wife. You really never get the feeling that her and Nolte really care for each other even if they are married. Julliette Lewis plays the daughter. She is so annoying and whinny that she is impossable to care for. Finally Robert DeNiro takes over for Robert Mitchum as the ex-con Max Cady.<BR>      After being released from prison Cady seeks out Bowden becouse he blames him for his loosig his case for him by hiding documents that could have swayed a jury.<BR>      Unlike the first movie where Cady's return seems very scary<BR>becouse the man who testified agianst him (Bowden) just did what we all would like to think we would. This time you actually feel for Cady, and for this I think that Scorsese made his biggest mistake.<BR>     Sam Bowden is really unlikeable as is his wife and tramp of a daughter. Nolte's Bowden is a far cry from the reseved Peck. <BR>     Robert DeNiro grabbed an oscar nommination for his role as Max Cady but his Cady is so crazy and out of control at time's that you never get the feeling that he is the same person and for that I found it very hard to believe him in the role. Mitchum was so menicing in the original role that I think DeNiro felt that he had to take the charactor in a differnt direction, it just didn't work.<BR>      You would rather be defended by Gregory Peck Than Nick Nolte, and you would rather have DeNiro casing after you than Mitchum.<BR>      In closing this was not a very good film. It took one of the best elements from the first one, implied violence, and showed you just how mean Cady could be, and as we all know nothingwe see can compare to what we think is happening. <br />P.S. Robert Mitchums Max Cady would beat the living hell out of Deniro's.

0671042858|5.0|I read the book, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by Stephen King.  I enjoyed this book and its many twists and turns.  This book has very vivid details which make you feel as if you are Trisha, lost in the woods with a creature you made up out of your own personal fears.  Although the fears of Trisha McFarland may not be your own, you absorb her pain because of the way the author portrays her fears.  One of my favorite details is,\\"She could hear the sough of the wind through the big old west-countrey pines, she could hear the sqwuak of a jay and the far-off hammering of a wood pecker digging his mid-morning snack out of a hollow tree, she could hear a couple of freshley arrived mosquitoes(they were buzzing around both ears now)but no humans.\\"(p.g 28)  Another breath taking moment in this book is, \\"\\"The world is a worse-case scenario and I'm afraid all you sense is true,\\" said the buzzing wasp-voice.  Its claws raked slowly down the side of its head, goring through its insect flesh and revealing the shining bone beneath.(p.g 145)<br />  I think this books theme was very clear.  Although this book can be seen in many different ways, about a girl lost in the woods, creatures in the woods, or a girls obsession with a base ball player; I believe that the theme of the book and the message the author was trying to get across was to never give up and to keep the important things in life close to you.  He shows this by again and again putting Trisha through horrible situations, although because of her strong love and compassion for Tom Gordon her life time idol, she chose not to let go so she could one day meet him.<br />  This is one of my favorite books I have ever read.  It is breath taking and chill giving.  I reccomend this book to every one.  It is something that will keep you on the edge with suspense, but at the same time teach you the true meaning of hope.

B00005R2IS|4.0|This is not the best of the Mad Max movies, but they had to start somewhere. It amazes me to know that the original &quot;Aussie&quot; voices were dubbed over when this film was originally released in the USA, as if they speak a different language or something.<BR>The stunts in his movie is what keeps it watchable.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|If you are a Fab Four neophyte, you should get a hold of this collection of &quot;number 1&quot; singles. This by no means showcases the Beatles best work. It's just a glimpse of it. I don't know why they excluded &quot;Strawberry fields&quot;, &quot;Day in a life&quot; or &quot;In my life.&quot; But what you've got here is some gems.
B000084T18|3.0|Props to 50.  The album works for what he's trying to accomplish............GETTING RICH.  The radio friendly cuts like \\"Wanksta\\", \\"In Da Club\\" and if my ears serve me correct the next single \\"21 questions\\" are just what an artist needs to collect the dough.  As a club DJ, I think these three singles rock the party but even with production from the Great Doctor and the Great White Hope, it's a prime example that Hip Hop has lost its way.  His flow is a little off and the constant \\"gun talk\\" gets a little old.  We know he got shot 9 times and we're glad he survived. Compairing 50 to Pac or Big is outrageous.  He's a rapper but the two formentioned were EMCEES!  Big difference.  Real Hip Hop heads (like myself), 30 and older understand what I'm talking about.
B000066NW0|3.0|You won't get anything much from this album.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good.  It's just that nothing really  breaks any new ground here.  If you like the songs they've played on the radio you'll dig this album.  And no matter what you've heard THIS AIN'T PUNK.  Then again, hardly anything is anymore. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Avril goes the same route that P!nk went and that her second album will be more along the lines of what she really wants to do.  If you don't like pop music stay away from this (and what are you doing reading reviews on this album anyway?)<br />Bottom line:  Good album full of catchy tunes.  <br />If you're looking for female fronted punk check out Tsunami Bomb, Sahara Hotnight, or the mighty Devotchkas.
B00008HCCF|3.0|After hearing so much about Norah Jones (largely due to the recent infatuation the music industry seems to have with her), I picked up this DVD.  As a first exposure to Norah's music, I liked the soothing, understated mood of the group and the song selection.  I wonder what it would be like if Norah released some more of her own content, although the &quot;classic&quot; material is deserving of more attention.  My only complaint, again based on first impressions, is that Norah seems a little too passive, almost tired, at the beginning of the show.  A little more energy wouldn't hurt the performance, although it is still enjoyable.<BR>  The DVD itself is a little underwhelming, at 67 minutes and few &quot;special features,&quot; it makes a good budget-priced DVD, and is good for those who (like myself) want to hear what all the Norah Jones buzz is about.  The picture and sound quality are excellent, and really help transport the viewer into the House of Blues atmosphere.  However, on my 5.1 system, I had to turn down the bass in order to hear Norah's mellow voice over the accompaniment.<BR>  All in all, a good performance and DVD, but I honestly expected better of an artist who has received so much critical acclaim.  However, the potential is certainly here for Norah to become a truly great performer.
B00008HCCF|1.0|Somebody told me that Kylie Minogue would make a guest appearance on this DVD.  Wow, were they wrong.  Instead, it's the overrated Norah Jones, a five time Grammy winner singing superbland jazz-countr-folk-pop garbage that works if you're 12 and under.  This DVD is bad beyond belief.  Get it only if you have insomnia.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Dr. Strangelove is certaintly a cinematic masterpiece. The humor is both slapstick and dry (sometimes very dry) and the acting is excellent. Like all films, this one isnt perfect, I personally prefer 2001 to this, and occasionally the film lumbers. But still, thats all compensated for by brilliant acting by everyone, the interesting and frightening beggining and end and some friggin hilarious moments- the president talking on the phone with the prime minister of russia, arguing that he always says good morning when he calls is hysterial and the last scene, where dr. strangelove is rambling on about his ideas for humanity while trying not to slaute hitler is also one of the funniest ever commited to film. I'd definitely recommend, though you may have to be a certain age to really appreciate this film. Rated pg, contains mild profanity and some violent images
B00006LLLN|5.0|My husband bought me this CD for Valentine's Day.  He wasn't sure if I was an Alison Krauss fan, and to be honest I probably wouldn't have picked this up on my own, but I am really glad he got it for me.  It is amazing.  I have always respected Alison Krauss and her talent, and I have her &quot;Baby, Now That I've Found You&quot; album from the mid-90's.  I guess being that I bought that during my &quot;crazy&quot; college years I didn't take to enjoying it like I did this one now.  It is an incredible live performance -- there are instrumentals, other musicians pick up the vocals on a few tracks, and the musicians are all such outstanding performers.  You will enjoy this album!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I don't usually buy scores but after seeing the movie, &quot;The Hours,&quot; I knew that I had to buy this one. The movie is a revelation and this wonderful score by Phillip Glass helped to add intensity to the beauty and sometimes overwhelming emotions held within this breathtaking feature. If you're not into thought provoking and out of the ordinary movies, then you most likely haven't seen &quot;The Hours.&quot; However, if you have seen the movie then you know that this album, which brims from beginning to end with inspiring melodies, is definitely a must-have.
B00005JKZT|3.0|\\"...I have never been able to understand why motion-picture people insist upon throwing away something of proven appeal to substitute things of their own creation...  Readers of a dearly loved book will forgive omissions if there is an obvious reason for them; but very properly, they will not forgive substitutions.\\"<br />Thus wrote David O. Selznick to Alfred Hitchcock concerning \\"Rebecca\\", a film based on a novel by Daphne du Maurier.  Selznick's advice was not heeded by the writers of \\"The Two Towers\\", a film which provides an exciting and memorable three hours at the movies but is a disappointment as an adaptation of the middle volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".<br />The many critics and moviegoers who seem to prefer \\"Two Towers\\" to \\"Fellowship\\" as a movie, considered apart from its source material, are arguably correct.  \\"Two Towers\\" provides a more intense rollercoaster ride than \\"Fellowship\\".  It has more of everything:  more characters, more storylines, more special effects, more battle scenes, even more themes in Howard Shore's superb score.<br />\\"Two Towers\\" also has more scenes than \\"Fellowship\\" in which Tolkien's story has been altered for dubious reasons.  Why should Theoden be possessed by Saruman when he is merely debilitated by Wormtongue's whisperings in the book?  Why do Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli have to fight off the men in Theoden's hall to allow Gandalf to walk up to the King if no such thing occurs in the book?  Did Peter Jackson and company think the scene couldn't be exciting without a little fighting?  Why are the refugees of Rohan attacked by Warg-riders when the only remotely comparable sequence in Tolkien's \\"LOTR\\" occurs in \\"Fellowship\\" and was rightly omitted from last year's film as unnecessary to the story?<br />Meanwhile, east of the Anduin, Andy Serkis' performance as Gollum is garnering well-deserved praise.  But Gollum's character arc is radically distorted by having the sympathetic Smeagol think he has banishedthe evil Gollum personality from his mind for part of the movie.  No such development occurs in the book.<br />The presence of Elves at Helm's Deep bothers me somewhat less than the other changes; the controversial depiction of Faramir bothers me almost not at all due to the nobility with which David Wenham invests the character.  I must comment, however, on the Ents.  As visual creations they are beautiful and convincing.  Their presentation in the script, however, is not fully effective.  Treebeard makes his first entrance killing an Orc; although the Ents' dangerousness is certainly emphasized in the book, the overall impression Tolkien gives of them is of peaceful, gentle guardians of nature who must be roused to their awesome and deadly wrath.  The atmosphere Tolkien carefully builds up in the chapter \\"Treebeard\\" is largely absent from the film's Ent scenes.  As Treebeard carries Merry and Pippin hither and thither through the forest, the scenes fail to pull their weight with respect to the film as a whole.<br />In Brian Sibley's \\"Lord of the Rings Official Movie Guide\\", Jackson is quoted as saying, \\"...almost without exception, all those things that are memorable and vivid from reading the books are there in the movies.\\"  Apparently Jackson considers none of the following things \\"memorable\\" or \\"vivid\\":  the fact that Theoden is debilitated simply by being convinced he is too old to fight; Sam seeing one and only one Oliphaunt in his life, not two; Faramir learning Frodo has the Ring because Sam blurts the fact out; and the arrival of the Ents and Huorns at Helm's Deep at dawn.<br />I disagree.<br />I have great respect and admiration for Peter Jackson.  As a Tolkien fan, I am deeply appreciative of the effort he has put into his \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films.  I did find \\"The Two Towers\\" an enjoyable experience, and I remain hopeful that \\"The Return of the King\\" will be of such excellence that the complete Trilogy will be a cinematic masterpiece and a superb adaptation of Tolkien.  The fact remains, however, that in my opinion Tolkien's \\"Two Towers\\" would be one of the world's great fantasies even if the rest of the trilogy did not exist.  This is not true of Jackson's \\"Two Towers\\".
B000065VB9|4.0|I would not say that this album is dark....There are incredibly dark songs on the album...Intruder, No Self-Control, Lead a Normal Life, and Biko...but over all I do not feel that the album is dark...One thing I would like to mention is that the collaboration of Gabriel and Collins is the greatest part of the album....Being that they are the two greatest singers of all time, and Collins is the greatest drummer of all time, it brings such excitement to the album to see the two of them back together on this great album....I also feel that Collins even does backing vocals all over the album even though he is not credited...I would love to know if he did or did not....Over all great album!...Biko is one of the greatest songs of all time!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I love her voice. Norah Jones could sing me to sleep anytime her heart feels like it! She has a wonderful tool at her disposal and this is a great way to kick off a career. The only drawback I have heard in this release is that the tempo is pretty much the same all the way through the album. I would have liked to have seen Norah and her producer put a critical ear to the collection and realize that they needed a little more variety. Not that I want to hear her leading a few AC/DC tunes or anything, just a little different tempo and vocal variation. I can't wait to hear the follow-up to see if she can overcome the musical sophomore curse.
B00005V9IJ|2.0|The title says it all, so I will be brief; as a FedEx (and a little bit of Dr. Pepper) commercial, this attemp very powerfully describes the dedication of a courier worker. (At least I got - the otherwise rather subtle - message: Tom Hanks character struggles to survive not only to be with his loved one again, but also in order to be able to deliver at least one parcel.) As a movie, it is unoriginal with a boring a demagogue ending. Nevertheless, there are also a few good moments (seconds, to be correct), thanks to Mr. Hanks - and a couple of whales.
B00007JMCX|4.0|A thin, pale, androgynous David Bowie is THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH -- Special Edition (Anchor Bay), a two-disc set of Nicolas Roeg's film.<br />Previously available on DVD, this widescreen (enhanced for 16x9 TVs) edition looks sharper, the clean DTS surround sound is THX approved and there's a new, interesting 24 minute featurette, &quot;Watching the Alien.&quot;<br />Slow moving and beautifully photographed, this movie adaptation is faithful in theme to Walter Tevis's novel. An alien being, disguised as a human, comes to earth to seek a way to save his home planet from turning into an arid wasteland.  He funds this project by designing inventions worth gazillions and becomes bigger than Bill Gates. Unfortunately, he also becomes contaminated by our earthly ways and sinks into a mystical malaise of depression and alcohol. A sweet and chirpy Candy Clark lures him into an affair that, strangely, doesn't help.<br />This hypnotic and provocative film long ago achieved cult status.  More than anything, it's a visual meditation about an outsider, stymied by material success, who is on a journey back to a home that cannot in fact be reached.  (Hey, who can't relate to that?)<br />Fully restored and uncensored (there's full frontal nudity), this new digital transfer is from original materials. Recommended.

B0000844I8|3.0|STARGATE - Ultimate Edition is the third version on DVD of this visually striking and sometimes hokey tale about an ancient artifact that can zap explorers to a distant Mars-like world.  It's a little misleading to call this the &quot;Ultimate Edition) as it merely transfers  the director's cut of the film from the previous &quot;Special Edition&quot; (but now in anamorphic and not letterbox widescreen) which includes nine additional minutes cut from the theatrical and subsequent first DVD version. Got that straight?  Cool extras abound, however.<br />There's a spooky documentary in which Erich Von Daniken discusses his &quot;Chariots of the God's&quot; theory of extra-terrestrial visitations in ancient times. The sound on the feature has been remixed in a thunderous 6.1 DTS ES track. There are commentaries and a nice 23 minute making-of featurette.

B00005JL78|5.0|Tom Cruise, his celebrity often makes us forget what a good actor he is.  He's a Cancer to boot!  This film is a nice departure from the normal action fair in that it moves fast through a possible future.  A future where the possibility of crime is precog-seen doesn't quite come off perfectly in the film.  Its murky as to how the precogs see and then transmit the information and why it prints out on a wooden ball.  Other than that the film moves along at a nice clip as Cruise pursues why he'll become a murderer, convinced that he's being framed.  There are a couple of twists here, one that he isn't being framed in the way that he thinks he is or why he thinks he is or that this frame has been going on for such a long time.<BR>Though the film goes into Max Von Sydow being a a very complicated victim, Spielberg has created a world around Cruise's character.  And like Julia Roberts, Cruise has been supplanted into the mass consciousness that even a film as complicated as thsi draws you in.<BR>I personally find Cruise infectious in the sense that he's so gung-ho to his choices in work and takes a deliberation in being in projects that are different enough to show a growth as an actor.  And that is what makes thsi film really, really good, I would call it one of my favorite of the year.
B000001GQT|5.0|Like other reviewers have noted, there is no conductor for Strauss like Karajan.  They are suited in temperament, technical ability, intelligence and outlook on life.  Both are wedded firmly to the lost Romantic world of melody and passion.  Strauss has been called a &quot;modern&quot; composer but his structure, melody and demeanor screams Romantic.<br />These are stupendous works that I once collected in LP format.  I had the entire collection and played them until the discs were worn.  Hooray for the CD!!  An air of authority permeates this recording and the sound is both lush and refreshing, the operative word being &quot;refreshing&quot;. There is something to be said for a recording of a familiar piece that sounds &quot;new&quot; and that is exactly what Karajan has achieved with His instrument, the  unsurpassed Berlin Philharmonic. <br />Don Juan has fire and passion as does Also Sprach.  Both are dramatic works that tell a &quot;story&quot;, although I bet Strauss never thought his melody would soar in space.  Like the others in this series, this is not a luxury but a necessity of life.

B000002VTE|1.0|This album is, simply put, awful. Everyone in the chatroom of a popular British music weekly magazine were drooling over this release back when it came out, so naturally, I went and purchased it. Being that at that time I was on painkillers for a dental procedure, it was interesting. But then reality kicked in several days later. I really and truly feel that they put bricks on random keys on the keyboard and leave them there for long periods of time while Jason Pierce lies around shooting up, mumbling random things. If you want 'trip' music, go buy The Verve's \\"Storm in Heaven\\" CD.<br />Do yourself a favour: Do NOT fall for the hype like I did with these simps. I wasted money on not one, but TWO of their discs.
B000089RVX|5.0|No doubt, this is a great album!  I have come across an Evanescence song titled &quot;Missing&quot; but don't see if on any of their cd's.  Could it be a hidden track somewhere?  To me, it's the best song I've heard, but can't find it anywhere.  Help!
B00002R0MC|5.0|Bob Marley's music makes you feel a hundred things at once. When you try to express them in writing, it's impossible. Bob makes you aware of how cruel this world can be for people without hope. Bob makes you happy. Bob makes you feel loved and want to love. Bob pries your eyes open and forces you out of naivity regarding war and the general incongruity there is between the so-called 'developed world' and the third world.<br />I first discovered Bob Marley for myself when I was 10 years old, picking up a poorly-mastered compilation from a bargain bin at a department store in my small town. The music I heard changed my life, literally. I wore that tape out and still have it to this day. So imagine my excitement when I finally got my hands on these 4 discs that span Bob's entire career, from his early days to his tragic and unfortunate end. If you have never heard Bob Marley, please, do yourself a favor and pick this set up...you will be GLAD that you did.<br />One Love !!!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's 1st CD. It is awesome. They blend several different types of music(ex. Rap and Rock etc) and put it into a song to make it a smash hit. Yet, they do all of this without cussing once. I would go so far as to say it could have been the album of the year. Keep your eyes open on March 25, 2003 for their new CD, Metora. I think we can expect great things out of them.
B00005QDW5|3.0|If you want a decent introduction to the diverse music of Pink Floyd, look no further. This compilation has a nice selection of tracks, from albums spanning the band's entire career. Start here, and if certain tracks grab you, buy the albums those tracks come from - before long, you'll be hooked.<br />For the fan, though, this is a frustrating compilation. You've got to give them credit for trying something inventive, arranging tracks thematically rather than chronologically (chronological compilations often just make you wish you were just listening to the actual albums). And they've done a nice job subtly tweaking the mixes, edits and segues of the tracks. But the simple problem is that you can't cram a fair selection of all of Pink Floyd's music on to two CDs. And it shows.<br />Let's start with the omissions. I never cease to be frustrated by the fact that `More', `Ummagumma', `Atom Heart Mother' and `Obscured by Clouds' seem to have been painted out of the band's history - not just on here, but in interviews with band members, and also in sizeable parts of fandom. I know these four albums aren't the most critically acclaimed, but they've got some great music on them, and they represent important parts of the whole `first band in space' experimental era.<br />Still, I guess I should be grateful that `Animals' and `The Final Cut' - both of which tend to get short shrift from everyone in the band except Roger Waters - get a small look-in here, with one track apiece (`Sheep' and `The Fletcher Memorial Home', both great songs). Also, the hard-to-find (but very good) song `When the Tigers Broke Free', which was originally used in the soundtrack to the film of `The Wall', is included here - which is a bonus for the completist. And `Jugband Blues' - Syd Barrett's apparently-happy-but-in-fact-very-very-sad final song with the band, from `A Saucerful of Secrets' - is another welcome inclusion.<br />To be fair, some of the edits and segues work really well. `Hey You'/'Marooned'/'The Great Gig in the Sky' form an unlikely but perfect suite, which I now listen to often. The original `Marooned' instrumental, on the `Division Bell' album, went on for too long and got dull. But the shortened version used here is just the right length, and flows perfectly into the opening chords of the sublime `Great Gig in the Sky'.<br />Another thing that works well is making `Shine on You Crazy Diamond' parts 1-5 flow straight into `Shine on You Crazy Diamond' parts 6-7. This replicates the arrangement of the song played on the `Division Bell' tour, but uses the studio originals to do it - a naughty-but-nice bit of revisionism. Admittedly, they've lopped off `Shine on You Crazy Diamond' parts 8-9 to do this, and I do miss them - it would be great one day to hear the entire song assembled as one. But what they've also done is segue part 7 straight into `Time', which in turn runs straight into `The Fletcher Memorial Home', and this flows perfectly. Again, I listen to the resulting (lengthy) suite often.<br />Not every edit on the compilation works this well, though. Going from `See Emily Play' into `The Happiest Days of Our Lives' is too harsh a contrast. But the absolute worst thing they've done on here is significantly shorten `Echoes'. And even though they've tried to be as subtle as they can doing it, it just doesn't work. I adore `Echoes' - it's an epic, perfectly constructed piece of music that represents a pinnacle in the Punk Floyd's career. But shortened, it just comes across as an amputee. It's like the King Crimson `Frame by Frame' box set that came out in the early 90s, which was full of stark edits and butchered classics (fortunately, subsequent King Crimson compilations atoned for this). I can't bear to listen to this version of `Echoes' - as soon as it comes on, I have to dig out the `Meddle' album and listen to the original.<br />The packaging of `Echoes' is the usual high quality you'd expect from Storm Thorgerson of Hypnosis, who's beenworking with the band for over 30 years now. And this is something of a culmination of the partnership - the cover design cleverly incorporates graphics from each of Pink Floyd's albums. It's obvious that Thorgerson used the previous live album/box with booklet `Is There Anybody Out There?' to try out the fonts and layouts used here.<br />Another bonus of this compilation is that these are the best mastered versions of these tracks that have been released to date - the sound quality is great. But even this is a mixed blessing. `Wish You Were Here', `Dark Side of the Moon', `The Wall', and to a lesser extent `Animals' and `The Final Cut', are among the best produced albums in music history. Audiophiles seek these albums out and use them to road-test state-of-the-art sound systems. Even on the cheapest systems, these albums sound great.<br />`A Momentary Lapse of Reason', on the other hand, is produced in a way that screams `dated cheesy 80s' at you through a loudhailer. (Follow-up `The Division Bell', although itself not perfect in the production department, was a significant improvement.) Which means that this compilation takes you from sublime 70s recordings, that (especially with this latest remastering) sound like you're in the studio hearing the band play in front of you, to recordings (`Sorrow' and `Learning to Fly') that sound like you're watching `I Love the 1980s' on your television.<br />So for the newcomer, this is a great introduction with a rich diversity of music on it. But for the fan, while this has a few new suites that'll knock you out, it also has a limping, mutilated `Echoes', harsh contrasts in production, and some omissions that'll have you running back to your original Pink Floyd album collection.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm most impressed by the stunning range of Amy's voice  -- at times it is angelic, pure and clear -- yet at others she sounds slightly gravelly and a touch angsty, almost like Shirley Manson (of Garbage).  I can't think of a single other singer whose voice possesses the purity of someone like say, Sarah Maclachlan as well as a more Manson-like rich, textured sound. Incredible versatility.<br />The instrumentals and arrangements are also excellent. <br />The rock/guitar riffs at times are truly invigorating -- the opening/guitar theme to 'Whisper', the guitar interlude towards the end of 'Imaginary'<br />Ethereal pads/effects, angelic background vocals in many songs provide a nice contrast to the metal-rock basis of the band.<br />There are some extraordinary piano moments also, such as in 'My Immortal' and 'Hello'.<br />'Going Under', my personal favorite, is pretty pop, and undeniably catchy...expertly mixed, with breathtaking contrast between the harsh/glorious moments of the song, as well as the fantastic opening which reveals the sexy depth of Amy Lee's voice.<br />'Tourniquet' has some beautiful electro-industrial moments reminiscent of Garbage, as well as hauntingly dark lyrics. I find myself wishing there were a bit more of the electronic touch, as these moments are usually breif, both here and in 'My Last Breath'.<br />There is an obvious spiritual undertone to many of the songs, which some might write off as 'Christian Rock' -- this would be a grave mistake, however. The spiritual message in Evanescence's music is refreshing -- englightening without being preachy. And because the spiritual songs in the album are sung in the first person, a personal psychological and spiritual journery is implied rather than proselytism.<br />All around, fantastic album and superbly talented group.
B00008AY3L|5.0|I just got this album today and it's amazing I have listened to it four times already.  There are some really beautiful songs on it and man I can't really think of any words to describe it except maybe incredible...I think Ben Harper is one of the best musicians out there right now and this may be his best, definately one of the best albums of the year for sure.
B000084T18|3.0|When 50 Cent's How to Rob landed in 1999, the hip hop community couldn't believe its ears. Here was a cocky young unknown from Queens blowing up about how hes was going to rob and mug every respected rapper in the business. So what happens? 50 Cent has been the target of anger and ineviltably, murder attempts. On the flipside, this got the attention of Eminem and Dr Dre, who decided that 50 Cent was someone who they could work with. But 50 Cent is set to be this years most talked about rapper. And there are moments on Get Rich or Die Tryin' which show that this hype maybe be as much about music as mayhem. 50 Cent has a great flow, his rhymes wrapping themselves perfectly around booming Dre beats (Da Club for instance). I think 50 Cent has a fine take on thug-life drama (Many Men) and a kool edge on hip-hop playas and pretenders (Wanksta). Tough, rough and  add it to your collection.
B00008AY3L|3.0|This album is best understood in the context of his other albums. Fight for Your Mind, very raw (Oppression, Ground on Down), but heartfelt (Give a Man a Home, Power of the Gospel, By My Side). Welcome to the Cruel World, increasingly funky (Mama's got a Girlfriend), but still touching (Walk Away). The Will to Live is a little harder (Faded) but still with a conscience (Jah Work) sometimes combined in the same song (Roses from my Friends). Burn to Shine is almost too hard for my taste. It's sad the only track from it to make the radio is Steal My Kisses, which is good but not great (eg. Please Bleed is better though not sappy enough for current mega-corp radio). So Mr. Harper has been getting increasingly edgier with each album, but it seems with this one he's mellowed out. On a first listen many of the songs are internally repetitive. There's some good stuff (the first Marley-like track and the one featuring LBM), but it didn't immediately impress me as some of his other albums have. Hopefully they will grow on me, but I know this isn't going to be one of those albums I listen to straight through regularly. <BR>   If you're looking for a first Ben Harper album go for any of his first three (Cruel World being my favorite, though by the smallest of margins). If you're a die hard Ben Harper fan, you'll probably buy this album no matter what I say. Fortunately, you shouldn't be too disappointed.

0226264211|5.0|This is a new edition of Milton Friedman's classic 1962 capitalist manifesto. As such, it was ignored, spurned and hated for decades by the intellectual, post-Keynesian establishment. In the 60s, Friedman once found himself debating a liberal who attacked him by simply reciting Friedman's views of the proper role of government. This was working rather well with the audience of college students until he quoted Friedman's opposition to the military draft. Friedman suddenly found himself awash in the unexpected cheers of students. Perhaps it was a foreshadowing of his career. Friedman won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976, and his ideas gained some degree of mainstream acceptance in the Reagan years - although many of his thoughts remain controversial. To the extent that Friedman debunks myths about the Great Depression that are widely accepted as fact, perhaps he has a point about the semi-privatization of education. We from getAbstract strongly recommend this volume to those who seek a deeper understanding of government's role in a free-market economy.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|With all due respect to the traditionalists (I was one, I grew up with the original being one of my favorites), this movie is better in my humble opinion.  The story is more compelling, Pearce is more believable as the main character and the special effects allow me to completely \\"suspend disbelief\\".  I have watched this movie several times and enjoy it more each time.

Friedman won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976, and his ideas gained some degree of mainstream acceptance in the Reagan years - although many of his thoughts remain controversial. To the extent that Friedman debunks myths about the Great Depression that are widely accepted as fact, perhaps he has a point about the semi-privatization of education. We from getAbstract strongly recommend this volume to those who seek a deeper understanding of government's role in a free-market economy.
B00005AQF7|5.0|this album is from back in tha days when snoop was still a G, and represented, but now i feel like his a ranker, cuz when he was faced with trial and slipped by being innocent, he totally changed, he wasnt as crazy no more. i want this old snoop d o dub to come back, but i can only dream i guess. he will no longer represent Eastside Long Beach like he did during this time, this c.d. is a must have.

B00006NSGX|5.0|Phenomonally spectactular, unbelieveably infectious, bring a smile to your face while you cry performance. This performance is why I love &quot;live&quot; music. The whole band is second to none. Steve Gadd especially stands out to me.  I have read some not so flatering remarks about this DVD/CD. I'll start by saying I saw the DVD first and then bought the CD. This may explain why some reviews were anything less than spectacular. Nevertheless, anyone with any inkling of an idea about music and/or musicianship would not rate this anything other than incredible. This level of performance is rarely seen. I say its a most buy....both CD and DVD.
B000002HIK|5.0|I have been listening to this album for some time now, but to see an average rating of one simply appauled me.  Whether you are able to grasp James' insane take on music and reality is one thing.  To no be able to realize that this really is one of the the most influential electronic albums ever is another.  Aphex Twin all but created the genre, so whether you like it or not...have a little respect.

B00005OC0G|3.0|I first became an admirer of Anne Sophie Mutter with her first recording of the Beethoven Violin Concerto--done when she was 16, with von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic--so it was with both excitement and trepidation that I put the CD of this new recording on. Trepidation because for a few years now, Mutter's playing has become very affected. While to the artist herself this \\"more dramatic\\" style reflects her newly found freedom and spontaneity in musical expression, to some of her listeners the rubato and quirky phrasings just strike our ears as mannerisms.<br /><br />A first listening calmed my fears somewhat. There are a few stunningly beautiful passages that show Mutter's ability to create sounds that cut into your soul. But the mannerisms are there. Rubato occurs all too often, to the point that this listener felt a little \\"out-of-breath\\" when towed along by her erratic tempos. Notes are unexpectedly stressed. Sharp contrasts are also found in the dynamics, with a languid, hollow-sounding pianissimo passage followed by a gruff outpour of forte playing. No doubt Mutter is trying to create \\"colors\\" in the music.<br /><br />After listening to the new recording a couple of times, I went back to playing the CD of the 1979 recording. The earlier recording with von Karajan is violin playing in the grand style. Tones are full, vibratos are full-throttled, whole bows are generously used. Yes, it is a very controlled kind of playing. But the solidity and expressiveness of such playing can dwarf other more wiry styles. This solid style of early Mutter was well-suited to the Beethoven Concerto because it brought out the stately elegance of the piece and, in particular, the \\"stillness\\" of the second movement. It was amazing that the then 16-year old prodigy could deliver a performance that was so bold and unsentimental. What Mutter achieved was a beauty that was restrained, aristocratic, and, at times, transcendent. The Beethoven Concerto is known for being ramblinglymelody-less; it's essentially made up of a series of arpeggios. The young Mutter made this \\"rambling\\" captivating. The most striking passages in the 1979 recording are the ones in which, after a seamless dialogue with the orchestra, she takes an inward turn as if she is singing to herself.<br /><br />Yes, the control in that earlier performance can get to you after awhile, and in retrospect one suspects that much of the control and stately grandeur may have a lot to do with the conductor, von Karajan, and his authority, his control. In an interview included in the liner notes of the current CD, Mutter pays tribute to the conductor's mentorship. She talks about how von Karajan decided when she was \\"ready\\" for Beethoven and how they worked on the piece together, but her tribute also makes you think whether the young Mutter, brilliant as she was, was playing the good pupil and whether the older Mutter is now signaling that she is her own person. She is determined to show her individuality.<br /><br />If the earlier recording lacks coloring or emotional nuances, Mutter is so determined to add colors to her playing these days that--to this listener at least--she's overdoing it, and I'm not sure she is making the music more emotionally compelling. A comparison of how one aspect of Mutter's playing has evolved is helpful here, for it shows what's been sacrificed for the sake of coloring. If there was one thing that I absolutely loved about the early Mutter, it was her pianissimo. Nobody could do a pianissimo like Mutter's. Usually a violinist achieves pianissimo by applying less strength to the bow. But the effect is often a drop in intensity, whereas the music is calling for MORE intensity when it becomes quieter. In a large part thanks to her Carl Flesch training, which advocates for the use of less bow to create pianissimo instead of less strength, Mutter was able to create the effect of increasing intensity while losing volume (the word \\"volume\\" is both revealing and misleading, for it reveals that we usually associate loudness with strength, and softness with softness, whereas what Mutter did was precisely the opposite: she decreased the \\"volume\\" but maintained the volume, the \\"muscle\\" of the sound). I notice that in the new Beethoven recording, those same inward-looking passages that call for an intense pianissimo have become flimsy; instead of applying a soft but strong, aria-singing voice, Mutter is making a hollow sound created almost without vibrato. This may create more qualitative contrast between the soft passages and the loud ones (and hence more \\"colors\\"), but it totally destroys the intensity that makes the music emotionally gripping.<br /><br />I hope that Mutter's exaggerated, mannered playing these days marks only a transitional period, during which she has to stroll as far away as she can from her \\"good student\\" days in order to find her \\"personality.\\" Hopefully, with her considerable skills Mutter will in time find an individual yet balanced style that both reflects the taste of a mature artist and communicates the vision of the composer. Indeed, alongside our desire to see more personality on the part of performers, our very view of how music of the Classical period should be played is evolving as well. Back in 1970, the music critic Harold Schonberg already talked about how Beethoven should be played with more rubato. He referred to the eyewitness accounts by Anton Schindler, a pupil of Beethoven, who described that during a performance of the slow movement in the Second Symphony, the composer made multiple tempo changes within 20 bars! Perhaps, if nothing else, Mutter's erratic take on the Violin Concerto helps to broaden our view of how Beethoven music can be played. We don't mind being jolted a little from our listening habits, only listening to Mutter playing now feels like a roller-coaster ride.
0553579908|3.0|The series is pretty good so far, but I can't get into some of the stories like the dragon lady.  I liked the style in the first book of a different character for each chapter, but now it is getting annoying when I get to characters I dont care much about.  <br />I have read each book so far in less then a week, so they are excellent at keeping me interested.  The first book was the best for that.  One thing I do not like is the foul language.  I would love to fully recommend this book to anyone but because he is so gross and disgusting in many ways, I have to try to decide if the person I'm talking to can handle it.  It would have been even better without it.  He also goes on and on sometimes (yes the food, I could care less about), but I love the Starks and the gimp, I hope he does not kill them all... I'm almost afraid to read the next book, but of course I have to know what's going to happen.
0517201658|3.0|While this 50-year look at a family's loves and losses is interesting at times, McCullough spends too little time on the most interesting characters and relationships and too much time on mundane details or on her attempts at being poetic and/or artistic. In the end, this novel is just not as well executed as it could/should have been. Several passages about love and/or lovemaking are labored and unnatural, and McCullough lets interesting people like Frank and Luke practically drop off the face of the earth. While Meggie and Ralph's relationship thrilled me at first, it became annoying after Meggie had Dane. Ralph was far too self-absorbed and his suffering seemed far too superficial for him to be a truly interesting character. Most of all, I wanted to learn more about Justine and Rainer, whose relationship received a light treatment though it is the true finale for the book.<br />Had the quality of writing been a little better, the characters and relationships been a little more developed, and the observations of people and life been more astute, the engaging storyline could have carried this novel into greatness. Instead, it kept me only semi-satisfied right up to the last page.
6304712936|5.0|Come on people...this is by far and away one of the best movies of all time! I firmly believe that no matter what the other reviewers say, this movie is spectacular! It is not historically accurate. It wasn't intended to be. This movie is fiction based on the life of Mozart through the eyes of a jealous Salieri. I myself am a professional classical musician, and can tell you what the music history books say. Please see this movie as what it was intended for. <br />This is a brilliant masterpiece, from the impeccable musical score (that is sure to send chills up and down your spine!) to the actors splendid performances. It is entertaining and witty, and gives you some insight into the world of a genius. It is a joy to watch over and over again.

0316236535|2.0|I checked this book out at my library because I thought it was the cutest, cleverest book.  When I read it to my son who is nearly three he loved it so much that we had to read it five times through.  Later he woke up screaming and crying and is terrified of monsters now.  Even though I tried to use language from the book totell him that he can make the monster GO AWAY!, he is still frightened.  He wants nothing to do with the book now.  I think he is having trouble because we had always told him before that there were no monsters and now he has a strong image of a monster in his mind which terrifies him.
B000002N2N|5.0|Bottom line---a scorching live set from one of the most influential guitar bands of all time.  And one of the best live albums ever.  More ripping than the 1st three studio Lps (though once yr hooked you should buy them too).  No flaccid wanking solos nor drawn-out audience-suck-ups---just three-chord shred heaven.  If you wondered whatever happened to great pop music, this is the document.  No sappy hormone poster-kid drivel written by scrim-shadowed middle-aged A&R fat boys, no borrowed mom's Noxema to take Polaroids in the cemetary gothic stuff,no faux-angst rage against the biscuit noise, just real raw music.  Simple, yes.  I once went to a flea market where there were some admittedly amatureish pottery things offered for sale.  There was a sign above them that said, \\"Yes you could, but did you?\\"  That's The Ramones.  I interviewed Joey Ramone in 1985 when they played at my school.  I have heard every (to my knowledge) legimate release.  I am not a blind-flag-waver.  The latter live albums available (licensed and otherwise) are a burnt-out version of the band & are for fans only.  If you buy ONE Ramones albums to represent them in your collection, this should be it. You will not be disappointed.
B00005JM1D|5.0|This movie was a very refreshing comedy, something to take your mind off of well.... whatever is on your mind.  It's more of less a guy movie, though I think the ladies can enjoy it as well.  Story line goes pretty good with what you see in the previews, no side plots, just the main angle, 3 guys starting a fraternity.  It's a great movie with a lot of laughs.  I highly recommed this movie to anyone.

Soul kitchen was magnificent as were 20th century fox. <BR>i saw the film of the doors and Break on thru to the other side i remembered from that, and have wanted that track since then. Now i have it.<BR>It was such a shame that Jim Morrison died so young, he would today be one of the top performers in the world as would the doors.
B000089RVX|5.0|Okay, let me first say that this album kicks arse.  I mean, wow. This is the only CD that me and my brothers agree on.  I though that it would have to be the apocolypse before my brothers and I would agree on anything, much less music.  But this CD is spectacular.  My Immortal is obviously the best song on the album, followed closely by Tourniquet.  I hope this band makes it into mainstream and continues to bond families everywhere! (okay, maybe not).  But buy this CD! You won't be disappointed.
B0000041Q3|1.0|How anyone can say Sutherland is a \\"10\\" Turandot and Nilsson an \\"8\\" Turandot is beyond me.  Sutherland is anemic when compared to Nilsson.  Also, Sutherland never sang the ice princess on stage.  Nilsson did many times.  The rest of the cast and the conductor are great.  This set loses only because of the miscast soprano in the title role.

B000006NUW|5.0|I'm a die-hard vinyl man and still consider myself so in my heart. However, November 1992 rolled around and I caught a review of this set in the Washington Post (how we learned things before the Internet, children) by Richard Harrington on Nov. 8, 1992.<br />With this, I finally had to capitulate, and start dropping the pointed hints that I wanted a CD player that coming Christmas. What cinched things was the information that this set comprised all original MONO single versions of 104 Motown titles. It was the only thing that made it worth it to now deal with music that slid into a drawer, and you couldn't 'watch' playing. I've not regretted it.<br />Is it perfect?  No -despite my five stars. What's here is fantastic. There's a clear purpose in the selections to include many lesser-known hits (Elgins, Monitors, Shorty Long, Carolyn Crawford). But there's the equally clear drive to rein-in the set from becoming top heavy with Supremes. The first effort is sincerely laudable, the second lamentable.<br />\\"Where Did Our Love Go,\\" is the June 1964 release that made the Supremes a household word, and put the group and the company on the map. If necessary, even \\"Come See About Me\\" should have been dropped for \\"Where\\"  its as essential as \\"My Girl,\\" \\"Heat Wave,\\" \\"Shop Around\\" or \\"Please Mr. Postman.\\"<br />But it's only the beginning where missing Supremes are concerned - number 1's like \\"Back In My Arms Again,\\" \\"I Hear A Symphony,\\" You Keep Me Hangin' On,\\" and even their signature \\"Stop! In The Name Of Love\\" are not included here.<br />The 104 songs that are, are flawlessly presented and sound as wonderful as the first time you placed the virgin 45 of any of them on a turntable. So the entire set is indeed recommended without hesitation - it just should have gone to about six discs instead of four.<br />The finest description I've read of Berry Gordy's ultimate contribution to American art is \\"the building of a musical Mt. Rushmore in Detroit.\\" And the awe he struck in the hearts and souls (not to mention ears) of baby-boomers on up, has failed to dim. I understand Mr. Gordy is over 70 today, and copes with high blood pressure. Now, who do we lobby to see that he's among the  group of honorees at the next Kennedy Center Honors?hearts and souls (not to mention ears) of baby-boomers on up, has failed to dim.

B000084T18|4.0|The mixtape culture on which U.S. hip-hop thrives has been in overdrive of late with an ongoing feud between Eminem and Source magazine co-owner and emcee, Benzino, encouraging a string of increasingly imaginative disses to be traded between the two. It's hurt neither career but has prompted Benzino's magazine to run editorials which question the dominance that Eminem holds over mainstream hip-hop and just why it is that his nasal style has translated into such phenomenal sales. <br />Meanwhile, the mixtapes have featured more and more cuts from an artist that was dropped by Columbia and then picked up by Eminem's Shady imprint (along with Dre's Aftermath) for $1million. 50 Cent comes pre-packaged for U.S. hip-hop stardom, having paid his mixtape dues, reportedly been shot an alarming number of times and, last but by no means least, having the support of the genre's two foremost powerbrokers, Dre and Eminem. In its first, truncated, week on shelves this album broke sales records. Listening to the above average 'gangsta' concoctions of 'Get Rich...' European audiences may well find themselves forced to ask quite what it says about America in 2003.<br />Let's start with that cover: we see an image of 50, all sinuous muscle and macho threat, pictured through a window shattered by a bullet. Then there's the fondness for the click and snap of guns as chambers are loaded and shots let off throughout this casually malevolent record. Add to this a sprinkling of misogyny and the dull repetition of violent threat and it begins to add up to Dr Dre's most cynical concept since N.W.A..<br />Then there's hip-hop's insistence on refusing to allow Biggie and Tupac to pass away peacefully. As Eminem rightly points out, 50 Cent's dopey flow is equal parts Biggie and 'Pac with a little Big L (presumably a tribute to his talent for freestyle) thrown in for good measure. It leads to a frequently uncomfortable fit when the stripped back steely menace of Eminem's beats try to find some chemistry with a style that apes artists always best paired with the crackling funk loops of producers like Easy Mo Bee.<br />50 Cent's skills are better suited to the nagging digi-loops of inevitable smash single 'In Da Club', the steel drum roll-out of 'P.I.M.P.' and '21 Questions' - perhaps the track most like something that you might have found Tupac or Biggie at work on in their prime. And, even if it is against your best instincts, you'll find these and plenty more like them hard to resist. Likewise, his tendency to half-sing choruses adds charm and pathos respectively to the lazy style of 'U Not Like Me' and 'Many Men'.<br />By rights Dre's latest project would sit in the shade of recent albums from Common, Talib Kweli, possibly even Nas, but these are indeed dark times to which hip-hop's response appears to be divided roughly into two camps: that of otherworldly transcendence and soulful psychedelia or the stark brutality on offer here. To those in the later camp, 50 Cent represents a street survivor who miraculously pulled through an incident in which he took no less than nine bullets, his legend cementing right there in the ambulance. Even if you're of the former camp, you may just find that, as 50 says, you'll \\"love it way more than you hate it.\\"
B00007E8O5|5.0|This album should be rated up there with some of the greatest of all time. I bought the shortened original format and enjoyed that, but the extended version rocks. I have loved Chains since I got a copy of We Die Young from my cousin who lives in Seattle, and i must say that Degredation Trip 1&2 is the only answer out there for Chains fans. When I heard the opening vocal line for Psycotic Break, I was amazed, but nowhere as amazed as I was with the break down in Spiderbite, right after the \\"...spun monkeys on a railroad track.....\\", then it crushes you with this KILLER vocal harmonization that is totally reminiscent of Chains.<BR> Jerry is definitely the most under-rated songwriter and guitar player. Too bad Roadrunner decided against pushing this album harder than they did. Tell your friends to get this.
B000084T18|4.0|GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' is 50 Cent's major label debut with Eminem and Dr. Dre at the helm of producing. The set is pretty solid; however some songs definitely sounded like filler material like LIKE MY STYLE, 50 QUESTIONS, and POOR LIL' RICH. Some songs are just downright solid bangers like IN DA CLUB, PATIENTLY WAITING, and P.I.M.P. This is the first time I've heard what Eminem had to offer as a producer, and its awesome!

0140434135|5.0|I approached this book somewhat warily, knowing that Northanger Abbey was to some degree a satirical take on the immense popularity of Gothic romances such as Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, a book I dearly love.  Happily, Austen's means of poking fun at Gothic horror literature are far from mean-spirited and, as a matter of fact, can be delightfully humorous indeed.  Her heroine, Catherine Morland, is by no means the type of heroine to be found in the giant tomes of Radcliffe and her indulgent imitators, as Austen tells her reading audience directly from the very start.  \\"Almost attractive\\" on a good day, this unintellectual tomboy has reached her fifteenth year without inspiring a young man's fancy, nor would she be able to delight him with musical skill or even draw his profile in her secret notebooks if she had.  Having encountered no strangers who would prove to be a lord or prince in disguise, her heroic ambitions seem stymied at best until fate steps in and grants her a stay of several weeks in the delightful town of Bath.  Making her transition from naïve girl to equally naïve young lady, Catherine almost immediately falls quite in love with young Henry Tilney, while at the same time she becomes intimate friends with an older young lady named Isabella, whose inconstancy as both friend and intended beloved of Catherine's own brother eventually brings her much pain.  To her intense delight, however, Catherine is invited by General Tilney, Henry's father, to spend some few weeks in his home, Northanger Abbey.  Her joy at spending such private time in the company of her beloved and new best friend Eleanor Tilney is immense, but equally exciting to her is the chance to spend time in a mysterious former abbey of the sort she has read so much about.  Such Gothic romances as Udolpho have been the source of her recent heroic training, and she is wildly desirous and fully expectant of discovering hidden passages, dark secrets, frightening circumstances, and possibly even incalcitrant perfidy in the halls of her beloved's family home.  Her overactive imagination runs wild in Northanger Abbey, bringing her a fair share of embarrassment, but the very sweet and tender sensibilities that fuel her fire for Gothic mystery make her all the more endearing to me.  Catherine is remarkably innocent, and as such she is absolutely delightful in my eyes.<br />Much of the story does fit in with your typical Gothic novel, but the frightening and dismaying things Catherine eventually discovers are of a far from supernatural sort.  Ever so gradually, a true monster slowly coalesces from the pages of this remarkable novel.  I, like young Catherine, was somewhat overenthusiastic concerning the Gothic qualities of this adventure I feel I shared with her, and the truly despicable thoughts and actions of the book's villain did not immediately strike me as forcefully as they should have; the afterword by Elizabeth Hardwick included in my Signet Classic copy of the book, however, served to make me fully comprehend its import.  Greed, selfishness, pride-these are the horrors of Northanger Abbey, and it does deeply hurt a reader of romantic sensitivity to stand idly by, unable to aid and assist a sweet young lady such as Catherine in her time of despair and emotional suffering.<br />Lovers of Gothic horror or literature in general will surely find nothing but delight in the pages of Northanger Abbey.  Austen's critique of Gothic literature is quite subdued, and I actually find immense pleasure in the overindulgence the author sometimes employs in her attempts to satirize it.  Written by Austen at a tender age (though not published until the year following her death), Northanger Abbey features incredibly human, complex characters full of wit and charm.  The hidden motives of seemingly delightful friends is brought to light, teaching young Catherine as well as the reader a painful lesson in real life, yet romance stands at the ready to right thewrongs of self-interest, deception, and greed.  I absolutely adore this novel and everything about it.e wrongs of self-interest, deception, and greed.  I absolutely adore this novel and everything about it.

B00000I8BX|3.0|This is what a lot of people call FF's signature record. I tend to agree with them, it's very ingenious and follows a unique structure then most records. The whole album is like a short story, each song continue's this story with it's lyrics. A great Idea that was executed pretty well. The record as a whole is a mix style between heavy metal and alternative, ok, I guess you can call it alternative metal w/ a flair of industrial poured all over.<br />Now the album starts off great with Shock and Edgecrusher, and continues with songs that weren't as good but still good themselves like Smasher/Devouer, and Securitron Around the middle of the record is where the songs become stale and pretty boring; The album's title track Obsolete (track 8) was a Godawful song. I swear it sounds like it was written by a 13 yr old amateur guitar player. It's nothing more then a very simple guitar riff repeating over and over to a very simple bassline, ho-hum drums and half assed lyrics. Definitely a filler song, skip it. What seems to make these few songs so mediocre is that they seem to try to make it good using only the chorus but not the rest of the song. During the verses the vocals are growling and during the choruses the vocals are melodic. The melodic vocals in these chorus's are bland, simply holding a tone, trying to sound like it has rhythmic quality. Holding a tone isn't what makes something sound good, and this is where this record falls a little. (FF seems to do this a lot unfortunately, and luckily they have made it sound good MOST of the time)<br />Then came track #9, Ressurection, aptly titled because this is where the album resurrects itself. Now FF definitely has seemed to pour their heart into this one song, because may I say it is a GREAT GREAT song (probably the best FF song ever made) and worth the purchase price alone. Ressurection is FF at their best. Afterwards comes Timelessness, a great slow song filled with heart that puts a great ending to a good record.<br/>Then there are the 5 Bonus tracks. These aren't worth all that much, the first 2 (Remake of Cars, and 0-0) are the only good ones, then the rest is somewhat fitting to the stale, boring songs in the middle of this album. I definitly think you should still pick up the bonus track edition if you were to buy this album, 2 extra good songs I think is worth an extra 2 or 3 dollars.<br />FF seems to definitly have put a lot of time and effort into this album as a whole (except the few middle songs) and they seem very proud of it, as they should be. I enjoyed it, and I would think any FF fan or fan of hard rock would. But if you're into more thrash-metal bands like Slayer and older Metallica, or Opeth, you will probably find this album not as fulfilling in the musical talent department. There are no solo's on this one (FF seems to never like to do solo's) or any great harmonic guitar. This is simpler and more straight to the point.
B000069AUI|5.0|I picked up the first Colplay album what seems like years ago and all I can say is their Sophmore album is a perfect follow up to a band that I prayed would stay in the flow. Musically this group is a revival to my spirit in a time when real musicians seem few and far between and all the crap that seems popular falls on MTV. This album should be issued to the masses!
0743455967|5.0|the focus dives in and out of the drive to write and the experience of his own books. interesting approach and a nice touch that he shows the foundation of a good learning and teaching experience that helped shape his methods even if they were rejections and critical examinations of his work. the point he shows that to continue even thru adversity is of utmost importance.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Its hard to guage how popular Queens of the Stone Age are in America, but I know in the UK, MTV dedicated a whole weekend to them. This included QOTSA's live performance of 'No One Knows' at the Glastonbury festival. This televised performance was the first time I'd seen them perform and I noticed something going on in the crowd. As the song started, the crowd seemed pretty indifferent. Not really getting into it, kind of blase. As the song progressed, I know for myself, I started yelling at the TV crowd saying, 'You do all realise this song kicks, don't you?' It seemed they realised this when the song was practically over, how actually good it was, melodically, creatively and in energy. What took them so long I don't know. It confirmed to me that sometimes bands are so good, the crowd doesn't always deserve them.<br />I bought this album with no hesitations. I knew I was not going to be disappointed. The follow up to 'Rated R' is more of the formula, but its a great formula. It insists on talent in writing the material, which wins out over any formula you hear in the Top 10. Josh Homme is a great vocalist. There's something deep, dark and disturbing in his vocal style, and some people may say WHHHHHHAATTT? but I swear Hommes's style reminds me of Ben Orr from The Cars. You know the guy that sang 'Moving In Stereo' and 'Candy-O'? Something about Hommes's vocal style reminds me of that. Melodic, distant, totally in control, slightly cold, but sung over catchy, gritty music.<br />God Is In The Radio is my particular favourite on 'Deaf...', but I can't say there is any song on here that I don't like or thoroughly enjoy. From start to finish it just reeks of class, and makes what else is on offer out there look slightly inferior. An album for definite purchase, along with 'Rated R' if you have the extra cash.
B000002UAO|5.0|Just another awesome album by the Beatles. Every track is very good, and several are exceptional. Wait, Nowhere Man, and Michelle are, in my opinion, three of the best songs the Beatles have ever written. It's hard to list all of the best Beatles songs, because there are just too many that are really great. Nowadays, you could tell whether you'll like a band or not when you see them getting Beatles comparisons. So many bands seem to earn this comparison without corroborating it. If you're tired of seeing millions of bands being compared to these gifted men, just listen to the archetypal band themselves. They won't let you down.

B00005B36H|5.0|By far the most amazing album I've ever experienced.  It's an album you can sit down and listen to and just lose yourself in, but it's also an album you can put on first thing in the morning while you're washing up and just casually enjoy it.  It's got a little something for everybody, and I haven't yet met one person who's listened to the album and hasn't liked atleast a couple songs on it.  If you're a fan of old angry/anti-societal Tool, this album still has something to offer.  The vocals in The Grudge just blow any other angry song I've ever heard... he doesn't scream everything at the top of his lungs but his voice is still deeply filled with a heart-felt kind of rage.  Then there's also Ticks and Leeches, which would be the most amazing, mind-blowing song I'd ever heard if it wasn't for The Grudge.  The first time I listened to it, I sat there the whole time tingling, not knowing whether to bob my head and rock out or burst into tears because the song is just so powerful.  The last line, &quot;I hope you choke,&quot; is probably the most powerfully angry line I've ever heard in any kind of music.  Then there's Faaip de Oiad, for your anti-societal/conspiracy theory track, where the voice speaking on the other end suggests that aliens have invaded Area 51 of the military and the government isn't doing anything to move the major population centres to other areas because they want those major population centres to be wiped out so that the few that are left will be more easily controllable.  Kinda gives you a taste of some older Tool, with songs like Opiate and Hush which also pointed out the problems in society.  Not exactly the same, but if you're an old school Tool fan, you'll probably like it.  Then there's melodic, peaceful tracks.  Like Eon Blue Apocalypse (the intro to), The Patient, Mantra (the intro to), Schism, Parabol (the intro to), Parabola, Lateralus, and the trilogy of Diposition/Reflection/Triad.  Most of them are fairly optimistic and offer somehope for the future, but still contain some catchy and complex beats, and some great rock-out moments that just make your skin crawl.  A few of mine were the hard instrumental in the middle of The Patient, the third verse of Schism (I won't give it away, I'll let you figure it out), the instrumental connecting Parabol and Parabola, the last verse of Parabola, the 2 lines in Lateralus when Maynard heartily shouts &quot;Reaching out to embrace the random/Reaching out to embrace whatever may come&quot; and the repitition at the end of the song.  And the whole Triad track is a great adrenaline track... completely instrumental, it clocks in at over 6 1/2 minutes, but not one second of it is boring or monotonous like some other instrumentals.<br />I'd just like to add a little bit to the metaphysical reference in The Grudge.  I'm not arguing because I've already done my research and I know the philosophical significance of it, but when I first heard &quot;Saturn ascends/Choose 1 or 10,&quot; I thought the &quot;Saturn ascends&quot; meant that one had to finally confront oneself and make a choice.  And I thought the &quot;Choose 1 or 10&quot; meant double or nothing.  For example: Choosing to let go of your grudge, knowing that if you keep it, it'll continue to burn you from the inside.  Or: Choosing to keep your grudge, thinking that you've held it and clung to it for too long to let go of it.  And as far as the 2 videos are concerned, Parabola is just full of references to the metaphysical, but difficult to wrap your head around.  I've had it for 8 months and I'm just now beginning to comprehend it.  This whole album seems to be about hope, divinity and sanctity of life, evolution into a higher state of consciousness, and reaching out to a higher power or a higher realization of being.  It really is beautiful if you can fathom the whole thing.  Be patient, don't try to take it in all at once.  It'll come gradually.  And I think the most beautiful thing about this album is that every time I listen to it, I notice something new that I hadn't seen before.  A faint whisper, or an irregular time signature, a vocal effect, or something of that nature.  You really have to have a musician's ear to notice everything in this album.<br />With that said, put yourself in a comfortable, yet vulnerable state of open-mindedness, and proceed.
B0000042H4|5.0|I'll be very brief:  I have about a dozen give or take Ring cycles.  This was my first, and it remains the best.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I consider Myself an addict. Not to heroin or alcohol or any drug for that matter (especially after this movie), but rather an addict to the emotional rollercoaster lived through this movie. When i first bought the movie, i watch it every day for two weeks, sometimes twice a day, and each time i watched it i smiled less and less. I am famous for a never ending smile, but when this movie is shown I cannot. I can  no longer watch this movie out of fear of what might happen. I even fear typing the name, but why did i give it 5 stars. This is the best movie ever made. EVER. Never has there been one movie that can deter soemone from their normal happines. The movie completes its purpose in terrifying people and saddening people, and completely taking advantage of every emotion people control. How horible is this movie? not horible at all. In fact the movie is so perfect that it is undescribable. Every aspect of addiction is covered so well that people find themselves horribly addicted to the movie itself. I personally believe this movie should replace the D.A.R.E. program in detering kids from drugs. People laugh at the way i treat this movie, but when they see it they realize its true power. I suggest everyone see it for themselves. I guarantee Columbian druglords suggest otherwise.
B00004TLN3|3.0|Though below the standard of any other Austen film I've seen (I haven't yet seen Persuasion) in terms of quality and acting, this film version of Northanger Abbey is strangely satisfying - or perhaps I should say - not completely dissatisfying. After hearing so many terrible things said of the music and dream sequences I was expecting something far worse - something entirely laughable. What I've found is that with such low expectations the film did alright. <br />Before one watches or reads Northanger Abbey it is almost vital that one reads Anne Radcliffe's masterpiece, The Mysteries of Udolpho. The reason for this is that NA is consistently referring to the book and is often a direct parody. What was obvious from this film, is that the filmakers had never read Udolpho and didn't understand Austen's jokes. What made it quite clear that Udolpho had not been read were the strange fantasy sequences, as they did not have anything to do with the book or Radcliffe's style at all. What is portrayed in the film is far more graphic and horrific than the book Catherine makes reference to. As a result, the fantasy sequences are over the top and even make Catherine seem a bit mashochistic, which is completely different from Austen's intent. If you haven't read Udolpho, you shouldn't notice these issues at all, however if you have, the filmmaker's approach will seem rather bizarre.<br />Aside from that, one of my main complaintd is that the music does not fit the film whatsoever and did at times become a distraction. The chanting celtic sounding voice may have sounded better without the synthesizers and St. Elmo's Fire saxophone playing with it. The rock guitar that occasionally flared up was much easier to stomach than the lusty saxophone that played at the most unusual times. On top of this, there were some unnecessary changes made to explain the character of Major Tilney and further create the Gothic suspicions that Catherine harbors. I thought this actually lent her actionsmore credence instead of making them more ridiculous (and hilariously stupid) as they are in the book. The filmaker's need to validate Catherine in this way really removed hilarity from many of the greatest scenes. It was strange to see the BBC and A&amp;E of all people, do this to a piece of literature. However, the changes were not so strong as to entirely change the story. <br />Casting also plays a key role in the quality of this film. Isabella is twice as annoying, maybe thrice, as in the book. The actress who plays her smiles in such a large and ghastly way that her attractiveness to men is entirely unbelievable. Her brother, Catherine's unwelcome courter, is better cast, however the scriptwriters portray him as more of a scary abuser than an awkward baffoon as he is supposed to be. Mr. Tilney, our hero, is at times perfect in his role, and then awkward, but in the most important moments, pulls off his character perfectly. Northanger Abbey itself is an historical inaccuracy, as they use a castle - and assume we don't know what an Abbey is. Major Tilney is perfect, and one of the better actors in the film. However, it is Catherine herself that made the film worth watching for me. She was the embodiment of everything Austen described her to be and I can't imagine another actress in the role who could have done better. She had the awkwardness of Catherine, yet at times could be unbelievably beautiful, and at all times maintained the innocence you would expect her to have. I would very much like to see a remake with this same girl in the role, however, I'm sure she's much older now.<br />Oh, and one more thing, this may be the only film in which the filmmaker's were ever allowed to use the actual waters at bath built originally by the Romans. It is remarkable to see how they were used. Men and women actually climbed into the waters fully clothed, hats and all, and stood around and talked. In this film, the showed the actors with some sort of floating plate tied around their necks. It looked like the plate was covered with flowers or something that was possibly an aromatherapy type treatment. Very interesting for history buffs and likely never to be done again.<br />In summary, this film is worth watching if you are a true Austen fan. However, if you aren't, the whole thing may come off as some strange Saturday afternoon made for tv movie gone wrong. If you aren't familiar with Jane Austen or films of her books, don't start with this one. However, if you are getting to the bottom of the pile for Austen things to read or watch, this is worth the effort.

B00008AY3L|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Ben Harper and he continues to amaze me! This album is brilliant, every song is unique and different. The style of this music can't be fit into one genre. My favorites are &quot;Touch From Your Lust,&quot; &quot;Amen Omen&quot; and &quot;So High So Low,&quot; though the whole album is great. I definitely recommend it!
B000008ER9|5.0|This album pulls the listener in from the beginning with the powerful song &quot;Shake Dog Shake&quot;. &quot;Birdmad Girl&quot; is fun and whimsical, &quot;Bannanafishbones&quot; is just a fun song with crazy lyrics and psychedelic keyboards.  Other songs are haunting and eerie, such as &quot;Wailing Wall&quot;, &quot;The Empty World&quot;, and &quot;Give Me It&quot;.  &quot;The Top&quot; is a beautifully disturbing song. The more I listen to this album, the more I like it.  This album is close to being a solo effort by Robert Smith and offers a wonderful glimpse into his unique and twisted psyche.
B00007LTIG|5.0|Everyone knows the Dead were a live experience, and that their studio albums are generally thought to be a pale reflection of their concert glory.  Well, I never saw the Dead live, but this first album struck a chord with me when I heard it back in 1967, and it's remained one of the most enduring albums to come out of San Francisco during that heady psychedelic era.<br />Until this reissue was available, the only CD I'd heard was a pale-sounding 1989 release.  While adequate, it certainly wasn't up to modern standards, and was way overdue to be remastered.<br />The new disc sounds incredibly good, particularly when you remember how long it's been since these recordings were made.  Not only do the original tracks sound fuller and richer, more alive, but there's some additional material that's actually worth the purchase price.  A lot of CD reissues have extra tracks that are mere filler, but these newly issued songs sound good enough to have merited inclusion on the original record.  I have some mixed feelings about the long live version of &quot;Viola Lee Blues,&quot; which runs more than 22 minutes and is obviously an attempt to capture the famed Live Dead experience.  To me, it sounds like you really had to be there.  Either there are mistakes by the band, or it's poor editing, but it doesn't add up to a great jam.  (Compare it to Fleetwood Mac's live renditions of &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot; on the Boston Live discs and you'll see what I mean by a great jam.)<br />Four of the tracks are extended; instead of fading out as in the original edits.  After listening to this record for the past 36 years it's a bit jarring, but the extra minute on &quot;Goodbye Little School Girl&quot; is worth listening to, as is the pyrotechnic close to &quot;Cream Puff War.&quot;<br />It's great to have one of my all-time favorite records brought up to date, sounding fresher and more powerful than ever.  Too bad I never caught one of their shows...
B0000797IO|3.0|The GOOD GIRL is a very conservative movie in that it shows the danger posed by people who don't think out their actions.  The title is really a question, because the audience can go back and forth as to whether Jennifer Aniston's character is truly an innocent person in a bad situation or the product of her own bad decisions.  She is one of those people you know who always have bad luck but when you break it down they really just make poor choices.  You never know whether to tell such a person that they're to blame or to just let them vent.  In THE GOOD GIRL, I rooted for Aniston early and felt that she was in a bad situation, but as the movie unfolded and we saw her make many bad decisions and eventually those decisions seemed like a life pattern.  The movie is really funny in a dark way, but also sad in that she doesn't really learn any lessons from her experiences.  She does a lot of harm throughout the movie but barely recognizes it.  I liked it a great deal because it was clever and real.  The performances were great and Jennifer Aniston is certainly not Rachel this time.
0451191153|5.0|Great book. Good read. Strong ideals. Rand writes with authority and conviction. Objectivism seems to be perfection to an atheist. I am not an atheist so I dissagree somewhat with her ideology but still highly recommend the book. (It's the only book I've read twice.)
B000002KFJ|2.0|On \\"Sabotage\\", Black Sabbath seem to be very uninspired, and the material is at best average or mediocre. The opener \\"Hole in the sky\\" together with \\"Symptom of the universe\\" and \\"Thrill of it all\\" are alright in comparison the other not-exciting songs. The production suffer from the muddy unclear sound that is recognizable on many of the bands album. This is mainly for dedicated Sabbath fans, others will find much more pleasure in a \\"best of\\" album.
B000002H97|5.0|This album no matter what old school metallica fans think, is a more than spectacular album you can ever purchase! maybe its not packed in with speed like 'Lightning' or 'Puppetz' but overall, its an album that i enjoy listening anytime of the day! it is much different than 'Justice' but thanks to this album, i got into metallica and i now currently own every single album. why do you think this album got #3 in the top 100 heavy metal albums of all time in the HIT PARADER mag???<BR>well, in case you want to know who got #2, it was 'Appetite for Destruction' by Guns'n'Roses which is another great album. #1 was Led Zeppelin's IV!!! <BR>I just want to point out that if you don't own this album, you are missing one of the best and most classic hard rock/heavy metal albums of all time!!
B000026258|5.0|This recording of Reich's most canonical piece is perfect.  &amp; the music is absolutely brilliant.  It has everything Reich did with compositional structure to that point; rests are gradually replaced with notes over a thick, juicy fabric of repetition.  The musicians phase.  There's also a new idea for him in this piece: music determined by the length of human breath, as the woodwinds periodically pulse a note, &amp; each player pulses it just until s/he runs out of breathn.  The music also is incredibly beautiful, in a way exceptionally modern &amp; also eternally emotional.  Get this cd.  It's an absolute must for any Reich or minimalist collection.
B000002KB8|2.0|The self title debut from Black Sabbath was an important release for its contribution to heavy metal as a music genre. The material is overall slow and heavy with Osbourne's voice cutting right through everything in its way But the songs are not that great, with the exception of the title track \\"Black sabbath\\", \\"The wizard\\" and \\"N.I.B\\". The rest is nothing to be excited about. I can't see why this release is so highly praised.
6305508550|4.0|I believe that for anyone who has had to work in a cube environment you will not only be able to relate to this movie and empathize with it's characters but I almost believe that this movie could be considered therapeutic. If you haven't worked in a &quot;REAL&quot; office environment then I could see how some people might have jokes go over their head. This is a movie that I believe is equivalent to Charlie Chaplin's movies of working life during his times. It is poignant and is a must for anyone who enjoys a movie that not only has good comedy but can also be an insight into the follies of what was and is considered a good working environment. ...and to think there was a time without cubicles...<br />Yeah...I'm going to have to ask you to come to work on Saturday...thaaaaaaanks.
B00000JBFW|5.0|\\"Perfect strangers\\" from 1984 was Deep Purple's come back album, and the first one since 1973 featuring the classic line up with Ian Gillan on vocals. Time apart form each other was obviously necessary  and I'm happy to say that Deep Purple sound very fresh on this release. The dreadful L.A. metal scene had thankfully not gained any success yet, and the music climate was rather healthy. Gillan, who had spent some time with doom rockers Black Sabbath (recording the awful \\"Born again\\"), seemed to be in need of redemption. All these things together resulted in a very strong album, on which both Blackmore and Gillan did their best (something that has not always been the case). Memorable songs are the opening melodic rocker \\"Knocking at your back door\\", the groovy \\"Perfect strangers\\" and \\"Hungry daze\\"; the fast pair \\"Nobody's home\\" and \\"Mean streak\\"; the beautiful ballad \\"Wasted sunsets\\". Well, it's top quality from the beginning to the end.<br />After this masterpiece, Purple somewhat failed with the following \\"House of blue light\\" - indeed a good album but not comparable to \\"Perfect strangers\\". After that, Gillan and Blackmore couldn't stand each other...again, and Gillan left Deep Purple for the second time. The band got Blackmore's old pal Joe Lynn Turner on vocals and recorded a Rainbow sounding album with the title \\"Slaves &amp; masters\\".
B0000009SG|5.0|...but that still doesn't say too much, as this still contains traces of Frank Zappa's absurd humor laced with complex, virtuosic and tasteful musicianship, but more succint and balanced. You can find a nice serving of jazz, country, classical and rock on some of these tracks.<br /><br />\\"Camarillo Brillo\\" starts the disc off in a tasteful country-rock fashion. Frank's guitar playing in particular is tasty. Also, in my humble opinion, he does a good job on his vocals. To take it a step further, I think Frank had a decent enough voice to hold a good note, without needing to resort to hiding his vocal insecurities behind the façade of a comedic vocalist. That's just my hunch, but I could be wrong. Many may think I'm crazy for thinking all of that, but, that's fine. \\"I'm The Slime\\" many people may know, as it opens with a fabulous guitar solo. Funny, but somewhat accurate lyrics on what effect television can have on the mind. \\"Dirty Love\\" is a short, playful number. \\"50/50\\" (or Fifty-Fifty) is a hilarious number featuring the screechy and grating vocals of Ricky Lancelotti. Should provide many listeners with an appreciation for absurd humor plenty of laughs. There's also an extended instrumental jam section near the end. Frank in general is playing some accomplished guitar solos. \\"Zomby Woof\\" features some bizarre, mind-twisting musicianship. To say it's impressive would be an understatement. \\"Dinah-Moe Humm\\" is the controversial track on the album. While funny, it can be considered downright nasty and offensive, as the sexual lyrics are fairly graphic. \\"Montana\\" is the number discussing a guy moving to Montana and raising a crop of dental floss. Not sure what the significance of this was, but I do find it funny, as well as enjoying the unpredictable twists and turns, musically speaking.<br /><br />The thought of something from Zappa being considered accessible may turn some Zappa purists off. However, it's still weird, and Zappa has not lost his knack for virtuosic composition and instrumentation, as they both can be found scattered throughout the album. Absolutely worth having for fans of Zappa's humor and musicianship, as this serves as a perfect balance of both.nstrumentation, as they both can be found scattered throughout the album.

B000002KIK|3.0|Many people claim that Never say die (1978) is the worst album by Black Sabbath. I dont agree. Its no secret that there was a lot of tension in the band, especially between Osbourne and Iommi, and this was also the last album from the original line up. This album features the rather melodic (at least by Sabbaths standard) title track Never say die, which is one of the bands better songs. At this time, Sabbath allowed themselves to be musically more diverse than before, and a lot of the songs have an interesting approach. During the time Ozzy Osbourne was the singer, Black Sabbath released 8 studio albums, and this one should be ranked somewhere in the middle  better than the debut Black Sabbath and Sabotage but not as good as their finest effort titled Sabbath bloody Sabbath.
B0000067X1|5.0|I'm not even sure how to write this review. This was my introduction to the German phenomenon known as krautrock. But, more importantly, this is some utterly transcendent, ecstacy-inducing and otherworldy music - which has me spellbound, and in love.<br />There's not an easy way to describe the music found on _Tago Mago_, but here's a slight stab at it: Imagine a proto-Radiohead (the vocalist reminds one of Thom Yorke at times) with tasteful psychedelic/jam elements slightly reminiscent of Cream, The Grateful Dead, The Yardbirds and others of that pantheon - added with an ambient aesthetic foreshadowing some of the ambient/dance music that became large some decades later (this was released in 1971.)<br />This is just a taste of what you'll find on this album, added with many other elements. A track by track overview:<br />&quot;Paperhouse&quot;--A 7 1/2 minute psychedelic workout featuring some tasteful guitar noodling, an addictive rhythm and some sensual vocals from (then) Oriental singer named Kenji 'Damo' Suzuki. I just love that sensual accent. The first day I got this, I listened to this track alone 23 consecutive times (non-stop), which came out to 2 1/2 hours. It can get very addictive (as well as the rest of the album.)<br />&quot;Mushroom&quot;--A proto-ambient/dance number. To be honest, some of these tracks could mislead you from believing this came out in 1971, because they don't sound too dated.<br />&quot;Oh Yeah&quot;--Another ambient number. This time, with some bluesy licks and some eerie keyboard textures. Once again, the underlying funky, tasteful rhythms can become very addictive.<br />&quot;Halleluwah&quot;--A mid-tempo number which manages to keep the same rhythm for 1,107 seconds (with the exception of a quiet break somewhere in the middle) without sounding like it drags. By the way, the time limit is 18:27 folks, if you were confused by the &quot;seconds&quot; sentence. Once again (sorry if I sound repetitive), the grooves &amp; rhythms, the guitar/bass interaction and the vocals are so tasty, they can get addictive.<br />Now, the second half (or second disc, if you own the vinyl) is where it gets VERY challenging and inaccessible - depending on your point of view. These next few tracks are intense, relentless and uncompromising excercises in experimentation.<br />&quot;Aumgn&quot;--If you pay close attention, you'll notice the opening for &quot;Paperhouse&quot; is the way this track begins - and elaborates more on what was left behind in favor of the duration of the aforementioned track. Listen to this in the dark, with eyes closed and scare the daylights out of yourself. Listening to this is probably even scarier than most of those cheesy horror flicks. Ominous, slithering keyboard textures, creepy vocal atmospherics and some disturbing, relentless percussion &amp; drumming can be found, which gives this track an aura of exorcism (I'm not joking.)<br />&quot;Peking O.&quot;--Sounds like a prototype (along with Frank Zappa &amp; The Mothers Of Invention) for the type of thing Mr. Bungle does. This track features moments that will scare you, warp your mind, and make you laugh out loud. Underneath all the demented vocal shoutings (some sped-up) and ultra-bizarre, abrupt switches in dynamics, is an unlikely amalgamation of ambient, reggae, ragtime and fusion.<br />&quot;Bring Me Coffee Or Tea&quot;--Probably not as inaccessible or wild as the previous two tracks. This time, it's a slow, meditative number featuring some haunting chords, tasteful instrumentation and some exotic percussion that reminds one of the type of instrumentation King Crimson would revel in during their 1973-1974 period. This also probably sounds the most like a prototype for Radiohead.<br />To prevent (further?) embarrassment, I'm going to end this review, because there isn't much more I can say, except that this album is EXCELLENT. I don't consider myself someone who uses big terms very often, but, if there's a new discovery that deserves such big praise - this would definitely come to mind. Recommended to adventurous music listeners, as well as those progressive rock fans that want a little more than the usual Yes, Genesis, ELP, King Crimson stuff (and I'm not degrading these bands, as I love them all as well.)<br />(Side note: I found out from a second read through the credits, that most of this stuff is actually improvised.)eserves such big praise - this would definitely come to mind.

B000002KET|4.0|\\"Sabbath bloody Sabbath\\" is the best (overall) album with Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Compared to other efforts like the debut \\"Black Sabbath\\" and the poorly produced \\"Master of reality\\" this is so much better. The band have clearly put a lot of energy into the song writing, and it shows on tracks like the rocking \\"Killing yourself to live\\" (the best Sabbath song ever?), \\"Sabbath bloody Sabbath\\", \\"National acrobat\\", and \\"Sabbra cadabra\\". Many of the songs are very appealing and not as dark as a lot of their previous efforts. Although Osbourne is a limited singer, he's doing a great job on these unforgettable tunes. This is a true classic, and by 1973 measurements it's heavy!!
B00000DCHD|5.0|(4.5 stars) After breaking through commercially with his smash hit The Stranger, Billy Joel went back into the studio seeking to prove that this success was no fluke.  The resulting album-52nd Street-contained a diverse array of rockers, ballads, and infectious pop songs but had a more jazz-oriented flavor.  The record-buying public responded enthusiastically to the album, sending it to the tops of the charts and making hits out of a number of its singles.  Eventually, 52nd Street went on to win the Grammy for Album of the Year.  Rather than appearing as if he'd exhausted his best musical ideas on his previous effort, Billy Joel demonstrated emphatically on 52nd Street that he was just hitting his stride.<br />The album gets off to a strong start with the raucous (if somewhat bombastic) \\"Big Shot.\\"  This rocker tells the tale of an egomaniac whose insistence on being the life of the party leads her to engage in Bacchanalian excess, which ultimately proves too obnoxious for even her closest acquaintances to endure.  The song features bone-crunching guitar riffs and a punishing beat, leavened by flourishes of saxophone.  \\"Bigshot\\" was definitely the hardest rocker Billy Joel had done up to that point in his career and remains one of his most popular songs. <br />Following that adrenaline-filled beginning, Billy downshifts and delivers one of his most melancholy yet affecting ballads-\\"Honesty.\\"  You have to wonder what sort of traumatic personal betrayal he must have experienced that led him to write lyrics like \\"I don't want some pretty face/To tell me pretty lies/All I want is someone to believe.\\"  Regardless, \\"Honesty\\" has a very appealing melody and never becomes ponderous or bathetic.  It ranks as one of his finest ballads, in the same class as \\"Just the Way You Are,\\" \\"She's Got a Way,\\" and \\"She's Always a Woman.\\"<br />The album then launches into what is perhaps Billy Joel's finest song-\\"My Life.\\"  Simply put, this is a perfect pop song, chock full with hooks andpuckishly defiant lyrics.  \\"My Life\\" is McCartney-esque pop at its finest.  <br />After this impressive three-song flurry to begin the album, Billy turns his focus towards jazzier, more soulful sounds. \\"Zanzibar\\" is reminiscent of late-period Steely Dan and includes a terrific trumpet solo by Freddie Hubbard.  \\"Stiletto\\" starts off with the mournful strains of a saxophone, then accelerates into a piano-driven, jazz-inflected ditty.  \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\" combines Steely Dan influences with a mellow Latin feel to create a breezy, appealing sound.  A `60s-style R&B groove, complete with a beefy horn section, pervades \\"Half a Mile Away,\\" while a more grandiose, slow-burning atmosphere surrounds \\"Until the Night.\\"  The album concludes with Billy doing a soul-cat turn on the title song.<br />On 52nd Street, Billy Joel displays his uncanny ability at combining his prodigious pop skills with multifarious musical styles.  Thus, rather than merely producing a pale imitation of The Stranger, he further expands his musical palette and delivers another album full of delightful surprises.  52nd Street shows Billy Joel riding the wave of the strongest three-album stretch in his remarkable career (the other two being The Stranger and Glass Houses).  It is a must-own for any Billy Joel aficionado.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's hybrid theory was the best debut album I have heard in a while so great I joined there street team. This cd is great for people just starting there collection or already have a large collection. The mix of rock and hip hop is just perfect so that it appeals to all music listeners. Some of my favorite tracks are \\"Cure for the Itch\\", \\"Points of Authority\\", and \\"By Myself\\". The band members Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, Brad Delson, Joseph Hahn, and Phoenix  are really dedicated to putting out the best possible sound out there.<BR>If you already Have this CD I would highly reccomend \\"Reanimation\\" or \\"Meteora\\" also by Linkin Park  <BR> <br />If you are into Linkin Park and would like to join the street team go here ...

0743244249|5.0|I read \\"Cosmopolis\\" more as another part of DeLillo's body of work than as a stand-alone book, because, almost immmediately, I noticed the tight thickness of the prose and felt that he was trying to capture and convey the same kind of depth he did in \\"Underworld\\" but on a smaller scale. This novel is full of perfect sentences that can either enhance or erase themselves after considered reading. The setting and characters are wonderfully suited to the method, a frontier world for the new language DeLillo is still drafting.

And on top of your fee, you'll be involved artistically (dancing on your bed and singing in the car).<br />So exciting, I couldn't help but stop and cheer. So delighting, it will run for fifty years (permanent spot in my CD player). <br />Elephants, Arabians, Indians and courtesans, Acrobats, and juggling bears, exotic girls, fire eaters! Musclemen, contortionists, intrigue danger and romance. Electric lights, machinery. Oh the electricity. <br />If you love the film, you'll adore the soundtrack. Get the collecter's edition. You won't regret it.
B00005JKJA|4.0|This is classic David Lynch, visually attractive, unfathomable plot, we were talking about this for days afterwards.<br />After watching it several times and talking about it, we still couldn't follow the entire plot, so I resorted to the web. But you know what, it looks so good and the actresses (Watts in particular) were so believeable, that I didn't care about not knowing what was going on.<br />The whole \\"no chapters\\" issue, is because David Lynch doesn't _want_ you to jump around the movie, he believes it needs to be watched one way. Would I like chapters, yes, and also a directors commentary to help work out what was going on. But I'm not going to mark it down because it dones't have them...
B0000262QW|5.0|When I heard this album, I was amazed by Chick Corea's piano skills. I already owned Hymn Of The Seventh Galaxy, which is more of a jazz fusion album than jazz latin, so I didn't really know it was Chick Corea when I first heard it. This album features some wonderful musicians, my favorite being Stanley Clarke, who was what, only 21 at the time?! Joe Farrell shows his amazing verstality of playing both flute and soprano sax. Flora Purim and her husband, Airto Moreira both show musical talent to its maximum. \\"Return To Forever\\" is a great insturmental, with excellent melody lines. Corea's solo electric piano breaks lead the song from one section to another. I would say \\"Crystal Silence\\" is the weak point of the album, only because of no bass or drums. Just Corea, Farrell soloing on sax, and percussion appearing occasionally. \\"What Game Shall We Play Today?\\" is a great song, and I bet it could've topped the charts as a single. Farrell and Corea's melody line flow into Purim's excellent vocals. \\"Sometime Ago-La Fiesta\\" shows Corea and Clarke's soloing abilities in the beginning. It's basically free time until around the 7:30 mark. \\"Sometime Ago\\", which comes in around 15:30, is great work from the whole band. Clarke locks in a solid bass line from the beginning on his double bass, and Purim's harmony with Corea's electric piano is excellent. Farrell's flute is excellent when it appears. \\"La Fiesta\\" I think is the highlight of the album. Corea and Farrell's soprano play the fast melody, while Clarke still keeps the another solid bass line in a flamenco 3/4. Bottom line - this is a must buy album. Definatley on my top 25 albums.
B0000033P0|4.0|I didn't realize I was a prog rock fan until all the groups whose LP's I filled my orange crates with started showing up on lists of famous \\"progressive rock\\" bands; Tull, YES, Genesis and, of course, ELP. The Moody Blues had taken me out of my musical infancy and given me a solid direction that I knew was \\"me\\". And then one summer day in '71, after I'd graduated high school, I heard \\"Stones of Years\\" on my best friend's father's console stereo radio. Where the Moodies had appealed to my notions of compassionate wisdom, Keith Emerson's Hammond C3 spoke to a part of my soul that had been forming in the dark, despite the presence of all the other prog bands in my life. The towering, flamboyant keyboard passages of \\"side one\\" illuminated, like lightning, castles and ramparts in my mind that had just been waiting for someone to turn on the lights!   Nothing puts noble and powerful glory in your heart quite like ELP at the height of their greatness.These musicians seemed to have trained all their lives for this collaboration, which illuminated the power in the hearts and minds of so many of their fans. This, to me, is the whole point of art. Tarkus single-handedly opened up new territory in my internal landscape.

B0000025DR|5.0|Someone did me a favor by stealing my earlier copy of this CD. I ended up buying another one from Amazon.com, and this time around is better than the first time!<br />While ELO was becoming a huge commercial success, but just before they quite figured out how to make a big orchestra rock and roll, that's when Face The Music appeared.  The album had elements that would appeal to fans of ELO's earlier music (including the famous reverse-tracking intro to \\"Fire On High\\"), several songs that were clearly pop-oriented for mass appeal, and a handful of lovely but seemingly gratuitous short string interludes between songs.<br />The net effect was rather like meeting another family one time while on vacation somewhere. Afterward, overall, you may have vaguely pleasant recollections of them, if reminded of a few specific details about how the kids behaved or how the mother fixed her pasta salad or how the father loved to tell stories about his career in grocery wholesaling...but their last name just never springs to mind in the course of a typical day.<br />Face The Music is like that.  There's no way you can ever forget hearing \\"Evil Woman\\" or \\"Strange Magic\\" or \\"Poker\\" or \\"Night Rider.\\"  But you may forget that they were all on the same album, along with other excellent material like the painfully beautiful \\"Waterfall\\" and \\"One Summer Dream.\\"  There wasn't a clinker in the bunch--with the possible exception of \\"Down Home Town,\\" which must surely be an acquired taste.<br />So...why am I glad someone stole my first CD of this album?  Because, for largely incomprehensible reasons, when CBS released Face The Music on CD the first time, they butchered it!<br />The intro to \\"Fire On High\\" was gone.  So were those seemingly gratuitous orchestral interludes...which, once made conspicuous by their absence, actually turned out to be the glue that held the songs together as a unified whole.<br />Fortunately, between those Dark Ages and now, someone prevailed upon CBS Records to put back the missing material.  It's now the same album as when it was originally released by United Artists way back in 1975, lovingly transferred to digital form.  It's been made whole again!<br />The only drawback to the CD is that you can't truly play it backwards on average CD players, and thereby listen to the supposed secret message that seems to have so terrified the CBS executives.<br />For those who haven't heard it and don't have analog means of reversing the track, you're missing things like footsteps running backward down a hallway, and a pingpong ball eerily bouncing in reverse time. Then comes a warning--seemingly intoned by Peter Ford-Robertson, although not credited--that says: \\"The music is reversible, but time is not. Turn back. Turn back. Turn back.\\"  (Which is the meaning, from Greek, of the word \\"repent.\\"  Not exactly a satanic message, if I read my New Testament correctly!)  And in the old days, of course, if you didn't turn back right then, the needle would drop off the end of the groove.<br />This CD is the best opportunity to hear Face The Music the way it was meant to be, and the way you remember it being.  Just like traveling back in time to get reacquainted with those nice folks you met on vacation once upon a time...
0767817478|1.0|This is the only film I have ever felt totally ashamed to have contributed to their theater take.  Honestly, folks, this is one stinker of a movie whose excellent DVD features cannot ever fully atone for.<br />We all grew up watching the badly-dubbed Godzilla films from Japan, and many of us actually liked the campy, poorly translated flicks with a guy in a rubber suit stomping on model tanks and buildings (and then later protecting the Earth from all manner of evil mega-monsters).  Unfortunately, this film is everything that the Japanese films are not.<br />Produced in the middle of a series of intentionally-made \\"blockbuster\\" movies (following such fine fare as Independence Day and anticpating the awful Armageddon and Wild Wild West), this movie intentionally tries to go in too many directions to succeed--is it a campy monster movie of the 60's presenting ecological warnings, or perhaps an action/science thriller a la Jurassic Park, or even a special effects extravaganza?  Godzilla never seems to make up its mind.<br />The action sequences fail to thrill as they come across as contrived and artificial, many looking to be made for prompt conversion to video games.  The acting, too, leaves much to be desired; Godzilla will stand always as a blemish on Matthew Broderick's career.  The movie goes on about an hour longer than it should, forcing audiences to endure the death of Godzilla only to face her (!) babies, CG near-clones of velociraptors from Jurassic Park that chase our heroes around Madison Square Garden.<br />Godzilla has the distinction of being one of less than a handful of films I've shouted at in the theater--here, when said title monster chases a helicopter through downtown NYC, I literally shouted, \\"GO UP!\\" ... but apparently helicopters can only fly horizontally and get run down by a hungry monster.<br />I would like to recommend this film for a \\"bad movie night\\" or for inclusion on any future episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but then I'd be indirectly contributing to the film's financial gains.  Watch this for a laugh or a groan if someone else has it on hand, but don't waste your own money.indirectly contributing to the film's financial gains.

B000001FRY|5.0|In 1980 a little know group by the name U2 released an album that 20+ years later still remains one of their best and perhaps one of the best debut albums by any band.<br />U2 is best known for their meaningful music and lyrics which really thrust them into the spotlight with War and as reached an Apex that has yet to decline with The Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, and All That You Can't Leave Behind. Yet, it is hard to say that they were any less of masters at their art when one listens to Boy.  Boy merely shows the group at a young age singing for their beliefs and feelings as they always have and continue to do.  It shows strong conviction and their youth.<br />I Will Follow perhaps sets the theme best.  It is the story of a boy forced to grow up due to the passing of his mother.  The album continues of the theme of growing up and does it well from Twilight (another great song) and A Day Without Me. My favorite song on this album besides I Will FOllow is An Cat Dubh and Into the Heart which might as well be one song.  This song is a reflection of young love.<br />I think perhaps the most interesting aspect of this album is that when looked at over the span of their career, it is seen that the quality of the music and lyrics has not changed only the maturity. Boy is definitely a must have for any U2 fan and even for non U2 fans who like the U2 of old.  I feel it is their best album from their early years including War which is great, but I just feel this is more solid effort though in reality it is hard to say which is better.<br />So I would say this album is best for people who like War or even only know the famous songs of those early U2 years. It is also best for people who appreciate the evolution of U2 and the fact that U2 now sounds so different yet so similar to that debut album.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Do you remember back to the last years of childhood, when adulthood was just around the corner and so yearned for yet the simple joys of childhood still at hand?  Based on Stephen King's story \\"The Body,\\" Stand By Me masterfully captures the essence of that critical period in life.<br />Stand By Me tells the story of a group of boys about to grow up in more ways than one, carefree and looking at the end of summer for one last adventure as they set off on a hike and camping trip to find the body of a local boy gone missing.  About to enter Junior High and decide what they really want to do when they grow up, the boys must confront the end of their own youth by realizing the reality of death.<br />Set in the 1950's, this film will not only resonate with baby boomers nostalgic for their own childhood but also with nearly anyone who can remember that turning point in their own lives.  Classic early rock hits like \\"Lollipop\\" and \\"Mr. Sandman\\" and campfire-side chats about Annette Funicello well-place the setting for even those born years later.<br />Never in recent history has there been a group of young actors with such chemistry together on screen.  Wil Wheaton delivers a wonderful performance as a sensitive would-be writer who cannot live up to his tragically-killed football star brother's image; River Phoenix plays a tough kid from a bad family but with a good heart; and Corey Feldman acually shines in a film as the son of an abusive World War II vet.<br />I cannot say more to recommend this film other than that it is one of my all-time favorites and certainly one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story (on par with The Shawshank Redemption).  If you haven't seen this film yet, make no delay!

The kind of book I looked forward to getting back to everyday. Until near the end. It got quite contrived. (Not wanting to ruin it for anyone else...)The chapter with the physical scene with Ray & \\"Ruth\\" felt tacked on. Almost like Ms. Sebold was told she needed to spice it up a little in case they made a movie of it. ... On the whole though I enjoyed the book. She handled a delicate topic well with interesting views.
B000056N8X|2.0|The concept: reunite Connor MacLeod of the original Highlander movie and television series pilot episode with the TV series icon Duncan MacLeod.  Capitalize on both the popularity of the original film and the more fully-developed world of the television series.  Pre-production rumors and the promise of a film to make up for Highlanders 2 and 3 made this a highly anticipated film for all Highlander fans.<br />The problem?  The film simply doesn't execute on its idea at all.  Understandably due to abrupt changes and budget cuts during production, the final product leaves much to be desired.<br />The opening scene, with its raid by machine-gun wielding immortals on a secret facility run by the mortal Watchers group, promises a thrill ride of big screen proportions.  Soon we see the familiar faces of Duncan's watcher Joe and the oldest immortal of them all, Methos.  The bad guys seem ready to break all the rules, from fighting on holy ground to teaming up against the good guys in forbidden 2- and 3-on-one fights.  Most of the back story presented in flashbacks is good as well and does a decent job establishing the backgrounds and relationships of the main characters.<br />The door is opened for Duncan and his mentor Connor to unite in an epic battle to save the world from yet another K-named villian, yet that is where the movie falls flat.  Being good guys, they apparently cannot break the rules and join forces, which leads to Connor challenging Duncan so that one or the other will gain the strength necessary to defeat their foe.  The interesting cadre of villians is reduced to one following a basically unexplained slaughterfest by the chief bad guy--what a waste of great potential.  It was as if the movie simply lopped off the heads of all its promising plotlines to reach an abrupt climax.  And whatever happened to Joe &amp; Methos?  They simply vanish from the film as if the producers forgot to pay them to finish it out.<br />The DVD does offer a few interesting features, including an alternate ending that will leave TV-show fans scratching their head over Duncan's new love interest.<br />If you enjoyed the TV show, you will likely get something from this film, albeit more a feeling of a two-part TV movie snack than a proper cinematic feast.  If you are a fan of the films (or even simply the first one--dislike of the others is rather excusable), then you won't enjoy this movie.res, including an alternate ending that will leave TV-show fans scratching their head over Duncan's new love interest.<br />If you enjoyed the TV show, you will likely get something from this film, albeit more a feeling of a two-part TV movie snack than a proper cinematic feast.

Her words are painful and hilarious, but always ring truthful. The story of her very determined parents and the struggle the entire family experienced is amazing. These parents are not the hand holding gentle souls who cant bear to worry their children, they are blunt and strong and serve as examples of people who are surviving in a very difficult life and often-brutal country. The family lived on several farms trying to make a living on inhospitable land where guerrilla fighters were lurking in the bushes and camping on the farmland during the nights. The truth was they loved Africa, and were determined to stay there.<br />During all of the years of civil unrest, her father was often away serving as a soldier for the government. Her mother was a very emotional, but strong woman who tried her best to hold on even when she saw her children die and she had to continue to run the farm alone while her husband was out fighting. Everyone carried guns and the children were taught how to load a gun as soon as they were agile enough to do it.<br />Alexandra, called Bobo by her family gives us this remembrance that she had from the age of three.  Mum says, Dont come creeping into our room at night. They sleep with loaded guns beside them on the bedside rugs. She says, Dont startle us when were sleeping. We might shoot you. Oh.  By mistake. Okay, I wont. replied Bobo.<br />I didnt want this story to end and hope that the author writes another book and gives us an update on her remarkable family.
B0000640S2|5.0|The sequel to the critically acclaimed First Blood, Rambo is a film that delivers with intense action from start to finish.  You can't be a fan of action movies until you have seen Rambo!<br />The movie begins with Colonel Troutman (played by the late Richard Crenna) visiting Rambo in hard-labor prison to offer him the chance of a pardon should he return to Vietnam to investigate claims of POWs still held there.<br />Though asking if \\"they'll be allowed to win this time,\\" Rambo accepts the mission.  Once on the ground, Rambo does find and rescues a POW only to find the political motivations of his mission did not include actually finding anyone.  Abandoned by this own men, Rambo must fight out of the jungle with the help of Ko, a pretty young Vietnamese intelligence operative hopeful to leave the war behind against an entire army of Vietnamese soldiers and their Russian allies.<br />Cold War action at its best, Rambo puts its title character in an impossible situation and lets him shoot, knife, and muscle his way out of it.  When he finally returns to base in Thailand and confronts the men who abandoned him in the jungle, he tells Troutman, \\"I want what they want, what every other guy who came over here and spilled his guts and gave everything he had wants: for our country to love us as much as we love it,\\" the plea of every Vietnam vet who went to a war they didn't want but did the best they could.<br />Directed by James Cameron before his mania for the Titanic, Rambo is sure to thrill.  Great from one end to the other!
0783230621|4.0|This isn't Shakespeare, and it isn't &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; What it is, is a solidly-made disaster film that makes you believe all this is possible, and it's believable because the film-makers did their homework. The picture also benefits from solid work by Pierce Brosnan (who proves he can carry a big action film even when he's not playing Bond) and Linda Hamilton (who it's nice to see playing a regular woman for a change). The special effects deliver the goods, but the most suspenseful sequence is the boat crossing the lake. This picture just wants to entertain you, and it does what it sets out to do.
B000089RVX|5.0|The lead singer Amy Lee has a beautiful voice, which is clearly heard throughout the CD Fallen.  This CD is dark and mysterious, while at the same time very uplifting.  Evanescence will provide rock fans with a refreshing new sound.  The CD has slow melodic songs like My Immortal, then proceeds into heavier rock tracks such as Bring Me To Life.  It's a good all around CD, and you won't find yourself skipping over any songs.
0743244249|4.0|Like many of DeLillo's novels, Cosmopolis is characterized by incisive, playful prose, a taut plot arc and a host of well-put questions about the postmodern condition. The story of capital-magnate Eric Packer's simultaneous demise and ascent (depending on whom you ask) is presented as sleekly as the notably allegorical uber-limousine that provides much of the novel's setting. Its exploration of the theme of isolation amid the crowd of Manhattan is perhaps the most poignant written since Melville's \\"Bartelby, Scribner.\\"<br />If there's a downside to the novel, it's that Cosmopolis falls prey to the Kundera Syndrome: its players have a tendency to wax philosophical with a frequency and intensity that becomes somewhat grating. Much as DeLillo's thinking is engaging and topical, it's a little much at times and, worse, tends to detract from some of the moments of poignant surreality by cerebralizing them, shifting them from fascinatingly visceral aberrations to intellectual playthings.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is one of the best punk cd's to ever come out.Many old Blink fans bash this album for being successful and getting the music out to people.That is NOT a good reason to bash them.A reall fan would stick with them ,no matter how wide of an audience they have.I had never heard of Blink before Dude Ranch,but I'm no less of a fan than any one from San Diego.So now that I've said that,we'll get on to the album.Dumpweed-GREAT start.A perfect Blink song-great guitar,drums,bass-10/10.Don't Leave Me-Not the absolute best but purty dang good.The chorus is probly the best part- 7/10.Aliens Exist-HOT DANG does this song rule!!!!!Everything about this song rules-10/10.Going Away to College-Decent song but not as good as it could be.Great song anywayz-9/10.What's My Age Again?-One of the best songs Blink has come out with.Funny,great work instrumentally,and great lyrics-10/10.Dysentary Gary-Another good song.Gets a lil bit annoying after you've listened to it a lot though.-7/10.Adam's Song-Probably the second best song IMO.It's about a fan who commited suicide.Best lyrical work on the whole album.-10/10.All the Small Things-Played on the radio and tv to death,but still great if you ask me.Definitely not a skipper.-10/10.The Party Song-I can never follow along with the lyrics but it has a nice beat.-9/10.Mutt-This is one of the best on the album.I'm surprised they didn't release it as a single,because it's good enuf to be.-10/10.Wendy Clear-Great punk song.Good song all around.-10/10.Anthem-THE ABSOLUTE BEST SONG ON THE WHOLE HOT DANG THING!Wonderful lyrics,wonderful guitar,bass,drums,everything is awesome!If every other song on the album sucked except for this one,I'd still buy it.ITS THAT GREAT!

0671646788|5.0|`The Magic of Thinking Big' is really a gem of books on motivation and self-help.  I really enjoyed reading this book and felt 300% motivated.  I believe Dr. Schwartz has explained in details on how you can \\"Set your goals higher and exceed them\\".  I found a new me after going through the covers of this book - I found myself full of energy, motivation and confidence.  I put the leanings from this book to a test and voila! I got a new job with double the salary!  This is a wonderful motivational book. Even today, I flip through the pages of `The Magic of Thinking Big' to get my dose of energy and confidence.  Thank you, Dr. Schwartz.  I highly recommend this book.

B00008AY3L|5.0|Definetly one of his best albums.  He stretches from reggae to country to rock and it all combines beautifully. The reggae version of &quot;With My Own Two Hands&quot; is an excellent way to start off the album because you really get into his groove and he keeps you there until the CD has finished. I highly suggest adding this one to your collection.
6305736650|5.0|Despite its fame, despite the fact that we all seem to know too much about this film, CASABLANCA still shocks by its enormous ability to entertain.  I have now seen this about seven or eight times, but, if anything, I enjoy it more upon repeated viewings rather than less.<br />The movie remains enjoyable for a host of reasons.  The cast is as good an any in the history of film, not just the leads, but a host of minor characters.  The actor who plays the croupier, for instance, was Marcel Dalio, who only three years earlier, in France before being forced to leave, starred in Jean Renoir's great classic THE RULES OF THE GAME.  In fact, knowing that many of the cast members had been forced to flee Europe because of the spread of Fascism, including those portraying Nazis, gives the movie especial power.  There are a good fifteen or sixteen memorable characters, giving this film an unusual depth.  Nonetheless, the film is carried not by the supporting characters, but by the tremendous performances by the leads, most notably Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains (interestingly, the latter two would later appear in one of Hitchcock's greatest films, NOTORIOUS).  Even the rather wooden Paul Henreid does a decent if less than stellar job.  Contrary to popular rumor, no one was ever considered for the lead role other than Humphrey Bogart.  Conrad Veidt, whom we all love to hate as the detestable Major Stasser, was, in fact, a bitter opponent of Hitler and the Nazis, and was well known for his opposition to everything that was happening in Germany in the thirties.<br />I am a complete sucker for movies where all the dialog consists of impossibly witty repartee, and this one ranks near the top.  Even if the central plot weren't excellent, this movie would be a classic because of the awesome talk, especially any conversation featuring Bogart and Claude Rains.  For instance:<br />Renault (Rains):  What in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca? Rick (Bogart):  My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.  Renault:  The waters?  What waters?  We're in the desert. Rick:  I was misinformed.<br />There are dozens of superb moments in the film similar to this.  Although the script was famously a complete mess, with the writers literally working on it as they were filming, nearly every line is a masterpiece.  Great plot overall, great dialog, and great scenes.  It may have been a mess at the time, but the result is sheer genius.<br />But at the heart of the film is the story of a great love, in which two people set aside their great love for one another, the love of a lifetime, for causes bigger than themselves.  The film is the ultimate paean to self-sacrifice.  Best of all, it is a phenomenal film, and rightfully celebrated as one of the greatest ever made.health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

B0000640VO|4.0|I wasn't sure if I'd like having to read sub-titles, but this movie is so good that a few minutes into it I forgot it was in French and that I was reading anything at all.  It takes you on a journey of positive and meaningful events, and you finding  yourself sitting there smiling at what is being shown to you.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Having seen this film during an existenialism through modern cinmetography lecture, where I first expereinced this truely monumetally life changing experience I was forced to purchase this work of art.<br />The first time I was lucky enough, and I do sincerely feel blessed having seen this film due to the way it has altered my perseption of society, I was so blown away that I found it almost impossible to leave my darken room for 3 days due to the way that it rocked the foundations of my belief structure.<br />Never before have i born witness to such existentialist neo-facist post-modern reivalist impressionistic cubism.<br />I feel that the final irony created by this, surely once in a life time experience, was that I manifested an addiction for it and the way that it was able to alter my perceptions in much the same way that drugs altered the characters.<br />In conclusion I would like to thank all of the people involved in the production of this film for allowing my eyes to be opened, I truly now feel that I can begin to live. Thankyou for unleashing eternal liberation on my soul.
B00000FCBC|3.0|If you are a Metallica fan like myself who loves their early stuff, you will be unimpressed with the cover songs they have done on Disc 1.  It's just not the same Metallica sound regardless of James Hetfield's powerful voice as it was back when the Garage Days Re-Revisited $...LP came out.  The songs on Disc 2 are a more authentic Metallica sound and a good collection to have, especially if you want to hear them as they were when they were at their best.
0345333853|5.0|\\"The mists of Avalon\\" is a something everyone should read. Marion Zimmer Bradley has poured her soul into this story and through the extensive detail and raging passion throughout, it shows. This book has something to offer everyone, even those who are skeptical of the ability to bring forth a new light to the Traditional Arthurian legends. That is exactly what has been done, it picks you up and never lets you go as you travel through a girls life and the struggles of religion and discrimination between the sexes that takes its tole on her body mind and soul! READ THIS BOOK!
0312954468|5.0|This book was a very informative on the culture and ideas of the ancient Egyptians. The book is some what based on true events. Fine archeological discoveries are in the making according to the original source that inspired this book. I thought that the first half of the book was more entertaining than the second half. Lord Inter makes an outstanding sinister character. The plot was realistic since both good and the bad people can bite the dust. Taita the slave is full of virtue, though not without some silly ideas concerning freedom and human anatomy. The front cover features a representation of Tutankhamen and his Queen in case anyone is interested, since the book does not mention it.
6305508550|5.0|If only everything that Jennifer Aniston did were this funny. About ten times more humorous than Friends, this movie delivers the laughs consistently and heartily. If you've ever wanted to torture the equipment in your office or tell your boss ...off, this is the movie for you.<br />Funny, funny, funny!
B000002MTR|5.0|This album was extremely under-rated when it was released. It didnt do nearly as well as blood sugar. Even I thought it was a bit weak untill I listened to it about 6 months ago. I couldnt believe I had overlooked this. The songs are great, some of the best they have made. Deep kick is probably the best song on the album, warped comes close and the rest of the songs are great.
0812550706|4.0|This book rocked. I don't feel like getting into an indepth review, but i'll put it this way. If you liked Dune, or Star Wars, or Lord of the Flies, or even Startship Troopers (the book),then you'll love this book. It's very well written, with engaging characters and great environlment, loads of battle scenes and quick pacing. So read it, okay.
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is much better than Californication. It stands up to repeated listening. Its one of the best albums they have released. I think to say that they dont rock anymore is absured. this album musically is brilliant. They have moved in a different direction and why not. Who wants to hear the same stuff over and over.
B00005JLXC|3.0|Studio execs knew exactly what they were doing when they gave this mediocre film it's unpopular February release date. At least it now has a chance to tread water for a while before drowning.<br />I just don't get it. Why is it that Hollywood still can't get it that comic book adaptations don't need to be mucked with to have a chance on the big screen? It's no coincidence that the most successful comic book adaptation (and 5th highest grossing film of all time) was also the most faithful to the comics. There is not one instance of a mainstream (or non for that matter) comic adaptation that was anything beyond mediocre when Hollywood twisted it from it's original pages into the barely recognizable mutants that we end up seeing on the big screen. Why? Why didn't Spider-man teach them a lesson? Why if they have so little respect for the original do they want to adapt it in the first place?<br />Daredevil the movie isn't just different than the comics, it's also far less interesting and far more shallow. One knows that this movie isn't going to be great when the creators found it fit to change every single character they extracted from original pages. Making main nemesis the Kingpin black was the most obvious, but pulling off the lame Batman-rip-off and making him the killer of Matt's father was worse than being innaccurate. It was unoriginal. Next was making Bullseye a crazy-on-the-verge-of-silliness irishman who's bald but otherwise dark haired, has a brand of a target on his forhead, and doesn't have a costume, though he wants one. Bullseye in the comics is none of these. Then Elektra, Daredevil's foe/lover is reduced to nothing but a daddy's girl who happened to train with sensei's from all around the world soley so she \\"wouldn't be a victim\\" only to become a victim. Hello? Where's 'Elektra: Assassin' in this movie? Why does Matt have dark hair but Elektra have blond highlights?<br />The director finds it fitting to put in subtle name references to famous artists and writers of the original comics. Kevin Smith and Stan Lee actually have cameos. It's a worthless ploy to please fans because fans would much rather you show respect to those creators by capturing their work in the film. Indeed, the biggest insult is when the film copies direct scenes from Frank Miller and John Romita's masterwork Daredevil story, \\"The Man Without Fear\\" only to completely omit or worse, rewrite what happens in between. In Daredevil's true origin, he is tought by a mysterious mystic martial arts master known only as Stick (who is also blind). The movie completely rewrites him out of the story and expects the audience to believe that Daredevil mastered martial arts completely on his own. And in this movie, Matt Murdock, the hero who doesn't take lives, is turned into an aggressive vigilante more reminscent of The Crow than Daredevil.<br />The problem with movies like Daredevil, is that they try to downplay the fantastic in favor of realism. Superheroes in their skin tight costumes would look silly in real life which is why Daredevil is the only one who has a costume. Even it looks more like a leather sport bike riding suit than anything else. When your trying so hard to create a world where costumed heroes are silly, how can they look anything but?<br />Besides all these problems that will annoy fans, people who haven't read the books will still find nothing more than a mediocre action movie with poor fight choreography that's all too often hidden in close-ups and that will remind you of a Batman sequel.

B000001E2W|3.0|I want to be real honest here; this is not a four or five star album.  I'm a huge Anthrax fan and think this album is a lot of fun.  But four or five stars should be for excellent or essential albums and this just isn't up to that level.<br />Produced to fullfill contractual obligations with Island records, this live album captures some of the fun of the band just prior to Joey Belladonna leaving the band.  So if you want to hear Anthrax live with Belladonna and Spitz, then this is for you.  The first 2/3rds is a live venue in California and the sound quality is merely good - not perfect.  The last four songs are from a live in the studio session for a radio program.  Sound quality is better on these.<br />This is not bad! If you already love Anthrax then don't hesitate!  But it's not a good selection for the first Anthrax album you buy.  For that, I'd recommend, Among the Living, Spreading the Disease, Persistence of Time or Sound of White Noise.
0446530573|5.0|The stories and recipes are both wonderful!  Some may claim this to be a Soprano's rip-off, but I say, \\"Lighten up, it's only a book.\\"  The purpose of reading is to learn and to be entertained.  You'll do both with this.  Pop open some vino and enjoy!<BR>Also recommended: NO ONE'S EVEN BLEEDING and DELANO
0316666343|4.0|Lovely Bones was such a great book, unlike other I have ever read. It is full of intelligence and thought and you really have to admire the author for putting that much thought into it! It was really interesting to read about death from another person's perspective and then to also get the perspective of the characters in the book! My only complaint is that some concepts in the book were not explained enough, such as the whole idea of Susie \\"breaking through\\" for the first time, and the concept of accepting her death and moving to another level in heaven. It was a complex thought process by the author, but maybe after a few more reads it will become more clear! I really recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a thought provoking and orignial read. Guaranteed, it will be different than anything else you have read recently.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Chris Cornell has one of the most awesome sheer rock voices ever, and when backed up with years of hard rock experiece from the rest of the band, they sound amazing together!  Every song on this album is great!

0451167716|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the Godfather. A number of my questions were answered as to why some of the characters developed the way they did. However, a number of things are not explained. Puzo went into too much detail on minor characters; Jonnie Fontane, Lucy Mancini-Sonny's putana. Something like 5 chapters are devoted to this. Yet we don't get a reasonable explanation on why Michael Corleone transforms from college boy to Mafia Don. Fredo is also left out; Why is he such a wimp? The Sicilian background story with Michael in exile is very interesting because it gives some insight into the background of the Mafia. For me, the best part of  the book. <BR>Definately worth having. Ciao.
B000089RVX|5.0|Great CD all the way around...If you liked the track from Daredevil, you'll enjoy this CD.  All the music is close to the same theme...I can't wait to hear these guys in concert!!!
0792165020|1.0|The entire time that I watched this movie, I thought, \\"what is this getting to?\\" The end FINALLY came, and I thought, \\"Oh, it came to nothing.\\" There was no point to the Talented Mr. Ripley. The entire film was boring, giving the viewer little to no excitement. I couldn't get into it. I didn't really know what was going to happen next, but I didn't really care! The performances were fine, and the visual design was excellent. It was a very colorful movie. It was just stupid. Matt Damon portrayed Mr. Ripley, a gay con artist, murdering psychopath who tried to live several identities and got himself into some serious trouble. Let that sentence be enough, because that pretty much sums up a waste of two hours and twenty minutes. Don't see this movie expecting thrills. Expect yawns. The R rating is not the heaviest of them all. Mostly for some violence. There was also a meager amount of profanity, and some brief nudity. I wouldn't recommend The Talented Mr. Ripley to anybody.
B000084T18|4.0|the cd is ok.but before u buy this cd just think of the kind of rapper 50 is.To me he has bout 4 hot joint,6 that's ok,and 6 that is garbage.He needs more songs with EMINEM cause the G-UNIT click ....BUT anyways the cd is hip hop material, and the way he talks about JA RULE is just incredible(BETTER NEVER SAY NOTHIN BOUT JAY-Z).If you are a slim shady fan u need to buy it.<BR>HOLLA.
B00005QIPH|2.0|ADMITTEDLY 2 EXCELLENT TRACKS BUT THE REST IS BARELY AVERAGE. I JUST DON'T GET THE HYPE SURROUNDING THIS MEDIOCRE  RECORD - CONSIDERING THE MULTITUDE OF POSITIVE THINGS I HAD HEARD I REALLY PERSISTED BUT JUST DON'T HEAR ANYTHING OF INTEREST HERE . NO I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BORROWING FROM THE PAST OR RECYCLING OR OBVIOUS INFLUENCES OR WHATEVER - NEARLY ALL MUSIC GOOD OR BAD DOES IT TO SOME EXTENT. THERE IS SIMPLY JUST SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING MUSIC  AROUND PAST AND PRESENT THAN THIS. DON'T BE FOOLED INTO BUYING THIS. MAYBE IT IS ME -  EVERYONE  ELSE SEEMS TO THINK IT IS GREAT.
B00005JKJA|4.0|good stuff. not great, but definitely good. No, I don't get it; kind of a Lost Highway kind of mind-blast.<br />No chapter stops and no director's commentary: those of you familiar with Lynch should know that this is how he likes his releases. He doesn't like people skipping about in his films and doesn't like to provide interpretation.
B000002B1M|4.0|Nas is one of the most talented lyricists out there, but the problem with many of his efforts is that his talent isn't shown to its 100% potential. As is the case with It Was Written. <br />However, don't get me wrong. This CD is hot. The first taste of Nas i ever had turned me onto his other albums (Illmatic, Stillmatic, Gods Son) Surprisingly the most well known track (if i ruled the world) is merely a mediocre track on this solid from top to bottom effort.<br />If you are a fan of Nas, or lyricists with poet's minds pick this up. Not to the level of some of the albums but hardly subpar
B000089RVX|1.0|The heavy metal diehards at MTV have outdone themselves! They must have thought \\"Can we get any heavier, any more brutal than Linkin Park? Can it be done? Is it possible? YES! Of course! Let's inject it with estrogen!\\"<br />And so we now have what is probably the most terrifying, offending, gut-wrenching piece of goat-praising brutality EVER released! The vocals are so tortured, so heartfelt, so moving, the synthesizers so lush, so spooky and haunting, and the guitar work so bone-crushingly heavy, that you'll be clenching your teddy bear 'till the very end. Do not pass up this masterpiece of metal!
B000002KBA|4.0|This is the album where Purple decided to step up to Zeppelin and crank their amps to 11, no make that 12, in the faces of all their supposedly \\"heavy\\" competition. Forget about subtlety, Purple bashes away all those bands like Sabbath and Zeppelin not only with sheer volume, but with unmatched virtuosity. Yeah, progressive rock bands like Yes, ELP, and King Crimson could go up against Purple from a virtuosic standpoint, but no guitar band could equal them for the raw gusto they displayed at their best. And you'll definitely find Purple at their best on this classic. Its a funny thing when people say Zeppelin II is as unsubtle as the hammer of the gods, because In Rock is certainly less so. So then, what is more unsubtle than unsubtle? Blackmore and Lord's blast furnace lines, their guitar and organ lines are so heavy yet light on their feet, Gillian expressing so much emotion, from subtle(yes subtle), nuanced phrasing to deafening, in-key screams that NO ONE has matched because Gillian has a throaty roar that never thins out. Oh, yeah going back to Blackmore and Lord for a moment, who else were as exacting in their discipline(such as sounding cleanly dirty)in hard rock in those days? And as far as inventiveness goes, it seems damn-near all the rock players from one generation into the future on up either sound ridiculously amateurish or play very precise but without the depth of feel and/or ideas that Blackmore(guitar) and Lord(of the keys) had, and probably still do. As for Glover(bass) and Paice(drums), the best way to put it is, Beware: viscious rhythm section ahead! If you're not ready to rumble, then do stay clear because Glover's a fast Chinese water torcher(spelling intentional)with his incessant pick attack who means business and Paice will brutally pound your a$$ to puddy. Its senseless to go into the songs. I mean, Speed King, Bloodsucker, Child In Time, Flight Of The Rat, Into the Fire are exhillerating! I recommend buying the anniversary version of thiscd because it includes the killer Black Night(listen to that Blackmore whammy, just listen)plus rimixes, bonus tracks, and is REMASTERED. So, jump \\"into the fire\\" with this album if you haven't already. You won't get burned. Perhaps singed...
B00005QXDD|4.0|O.K, O.K...  there is no doubt this is a funny album, but lets not EVER forget where this concept came from.... Cheech &amp; Chong!<BR>That said, I still highly recommend this album for its great songwriting and sense of humor, that pushes the boundaries of explicit content.

B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's debut album just shows how rock has evolved in a positive way.  This is the PERFECT album in my opinion.  Every track has its own unique sound... you just want to listen to it over and over again.  It's one of those special albums that is really worth your hard-earned [money].  You dont wanna spend [money]for a CD with only 3 or 4 good tracks... this one is good the whole way through.  I can't wait for their follow up CD.
0312305060|5.0|e-mail:....com.br. Michael Cunninghams book, The Hours, struck me as an extremely clever parody of a masterpiece. When I say parody, I dont mean a humorous imitation of a text, intended to ridicule it, but a re-creation of a previous work of art, especially a canonical one, in a way that helps the parodist deal with that legacy of the past, mainly, when this leagacy seems to be daunting for the new artist. A parody bypasses the gap of time and space between two writers and their work. And this is what, in my opinion, Cunningham does in his book. He weaves his story by mixing up scraps of information on Virginia Woolfs life and suicide, obviously with no intention of writing another biographical book on her (a fact that leaves him plenty of room to revisit or reinvent the events preceding her death), her characters (above all the main character) in the novel Mrs. Dalloway and characters of his own design to address mostly the same topics that pervade Mrs. Dalloway, namely the inexorability of time, the elusiveness of sheer happiness, the futility of life, the fine dividing line between life and death, love and sex, and, especially true love and sexual attraction. These issues have been the concern of philosophers and artists throughout the times and no definite solution has been presented. When re-working the metaphysical dilemmas that affect the characters in Mrs. Dalloway and obviously Mrs. Woolf herself, Cunningham suggests different alternatives and choices. Homosexuality, for instance, is addressed more openly by Cunningham. Whereas Woolfs Mrs. Dalloway remains heterosexual according to most definitions, irrespective of a sudden impulse in her youth that made her kiss her girlfriend once, in the The Hours, Clarissas ever lasting love for Richard and vice-versa is based on the fact that they do not get married and both have homosexual preferences. Even so, Clarissas partnership with Sally works out perhaps precisely because theres no true love between them. <br />There is a certain coherence, and predictability even, in the way both Cunningham and Woolf treat the death drive which Virginia actually gave way to in her life. Madness haunted Virginia and another spell of the illness was foreshadowed by her and she made a choice for self-termination. In The Hours, Richard is the one who is losing his grip and fluctuates between consciousness and fantasy. Richard had written a novel, the character of which is a blatant reference and homage to Clarissa, and it seems, is named after her. Unlike the two other Clarissas, in Richards novel, his protagonist commits suicide. As a matter of fact, almost all characters in both books experience some kind of self-destructive impulse, and they all court life and death. Each one makes a choice, and each choice may be understood. All these characters seek to find a meaning to their lives, and Cunninghams Clarissa realises that the memory of one single elusive moment of sheer happiness makes life worth it.
044022165X|2.0|I was mildly dissapointed by this book. I was expecting something suspensful, a thriller, at least something that kept your interest. The meandering storyline was bland at best, with very actual storyline. The only half-way interesting part was in the last three chapters. Everything else in the book is basically just a day in the life of a unsuccessful lawyer. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who's looking for a thriller.
0345448898|5.0|I read a lot, but this trilogy was by far the best I have ever read. Mt first attempt to read the Golden Compass wasn't very successful. I gave up after 10 pages because I was bored. Big Mistake. Once you pass the 2nd chapter, you can't stop anymore. It is absolutely amazing. An original idea in a reading that you can call as good as it gets. I was disappointed with the 2nd book. It was like a transition to the Amber Spyglass. However, it was an enjoyable weekend reading as well. The last book was very good. But I would say that it is oriented to a more mature audience than teenagers.. Whatever your ages is, I am sure you will pick up the appropriate information for yourself and spend the next couple of weeks reading something very interesting and well written. Don't hesitate to buy it.
0446310786|1.0|In our most humble opinion we think this book could use some work. Half the book dose not appeal to the readers eye, but on the other hand the other half of the book is completely different from the first half.  This is a story that may have touched the hearts of some, but for the many that don't understand it. We agree with them because it doesn't make any sence to us.  Two of the only good parts are when Tom gets convicted of a crime he didn't commit and when Mr. Ewell tries to kill Jem and Scout.  Granded, we do commend you for the winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and also winning Academy Award winning for the film which is also a classic.
0671027344|5.0|I adored this book.  It was so touching.  Charlie is so innocent when he writes about the things that he witnesses. You can't help but have this overwhelming amount of compassion for the guy.  I especially enjoyed the heartwrenching poem about the guy who grows up.  I would DEFINATELY recommend this book to people who enjoy books that deal with such deep issues in such an innocent way.
B000002IJL|5.0|I'm not much of a '50s rock fan, but &quot;Stand By Me&quot; is one of my favorite movies, so I had to get this soundtrack. The music on here is ok, but the main reason why I gave this CD a &quot;5&quot; is because of the memories I have of certain scenes. These scenes are enhanced by songs like &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; by Jerry Lee Lewis (Ace and his friends playing mailbox baseball in their car), &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot; by Shirley and Lee (Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern flipping coins in the junkyard), &quot;Lollipop&quot; by The Chordettes (Teddy and Vern singing this song on the railroad tracks), &quot;Everyday&quot; by Buddy Holly (the four guys walking on the tracks, just moments before the infamous train scene), and, of course, &quot;Stand By Me&quot; by Ben E. King, the song this movie was named after.<br />&quot;Stand By Me&quot; is a remarkably short soundtrack--it's just under 30 minutes. This is mainly due to several songs being omitted that played during the movie, like &quot;Rockin' Robin&quot; (at the beginning of the movie, in the tree house), &quot;Book of Love&quot; (Ace and his friends hanging out, scarring each other with razors), and &quot;Come Softly to Me&quot; (the background campfire song), just to name a few. Why these three songs weren't included is beyond me; they're really good. Even so, this is still a good soundtrack and worth a listen if you're a fan of the movie and/or love pop/rock music from the 1950s.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Absolutely a joyous movie for both kids and adults to watch; and not one scene that would embarrass kids if they watched it with their folks.  That's a rarity for Hollywood.  This movie was funny, especially the way the monsters perceived humans.  The little girl was just adorable.  A great movie to add to your children's movie collection.
B000002L3P|2.0|I defy anyone to tell me that &quot;While we cry&quot; is not Pearl Jams - Yellow Ledbetter.  I mean..its the same exact song, he just took the words out.  You can sing the exacy lyrics of Ledbetter along with it.  Not only that but the Melody is the exact freakin same.  He does it well, but its not his<BR>   Covers are cool...but don't be a theif!!
0312305060|4.0|Michael Cunningham's novel is a beautifully written and highly engaging narrative. Though readers of Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway might take extra pleasure in charting the connections bewteen the 2 novels, Cunningham's Hours stands entirely on its own. If you enjoy smart, well-crafted and emotionally/intellectually satisfying fiction for grown-ups, then this is the novel for you. Of course, if you're of the mind --like other reviewers here--that a novel w/any lesbian or pseudo-lesbian characters is automatically &quot;agenda fiction,&quot; then you'll probably want to take a pass. The only &quot;agenda&quot; Cunningham seems to have here is providing us w/complex, multi-faceted characters who are trying to figure out who they are and where they're going in a world determined to constrain and confound them... and he does so with tremendous grace, compassion, and intelligence. If you like to expand your world--rather than narrow it--then The Hours is a book you'll want to read. You might also want to check out Robin Lippincott's Mr. Dalloway, to see another gifted writer working with the legacy of Virginia Woolf's amazing novel.
0688156819|5.0|Funny, clever, original, charming, sweet, cynical, endearing, intriguing, fascinating, and purely wonderful. There are little poema and random thoughts with wonderfully charming illustrations <BR>This book fits every mood and, like his films, it transports you into another world and that is what reading is all about.
0446608955|1.0|Nicholas sparks is one of the rising American propegators of Modern Romantic literature and has earned himself quite a name, as well as having several Novels turned into Highclass Hollywood motion pictures.<br />This is the only book I have read from him and to say the truth, Sparks has the literary potential of a three year old.<BR>The Novel is is so shallow, cheap, and unformed that it is a wonder that it did not join those coloured romances you can buy<BR>at the counter of every supermarket, where there is always a bare chested muscular man at the front page, passionately kissing a woman who gives the image she could have been the first playboy bunny of the 19ths century.<br />The characters are as undeveloped as egg yolk, and the only tender feeling we get is the satisfying emotion of reaching hte last page. The romance consists of an immature bratt, with the narrative power of Donald Duck, who can never go above communicating above \\"I am Tarzan you Jane\\" style, and his emotions for the girl, who seems more a Guru then a suffering emotional teenage girl, belong to the world of wishes, where the desperate Reader prays for the writer to finally have mercy and give up writing, like the Nomad prays for rain.<br />The usual clishee of Romance is used here in a way, which is abusive to all Human emotion, especially the one which makes us Human beings... love. If you want a good romance, in the same plot style, watch Titanic or read Gone with the wind. This deserves to collect dust on some lonely shelve,forever.
1573225517|5.0|Maybe it is because I lived in London amoung a bunch of music freaks right at the time this book was set but I thought it was hilarious.  Even if you don't really care about London or music particularly, if you have ever had a crush on someone, you will relate to this insightful narrative.<BR>I have been dating for a  long time and have had my share of  boyfriends but when I read this book I said to myself, \\"I finally understand men.\\"<BR>Nick Hornby has gone  on to write some fantastic books but this book stands alone as a real classic.
B000084T18|5.0|This is an excellent album.  Eminem and Dr. Dre has take part in the CD.  The lyrics are great.  It's all about ganster life.  If you like Eminem, you should listen to this CD as well.  This is one of his best album.  All of the song is excellent, not just the one on the radio and MTV.  Other tracks are very good.  This is a must have CD.
B000060P79|1.0|Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this cd.  They played at the green day concert, and they are quite possibly one of the worst attempts at a punk band ever. I would give it zero stars but it won't let me.
B000003S09|5.0|You know, it's hard to believe this album came out in 1969.  This sounds like nothing from it's time.  This was one of the first and most influential progressive rock albums, and is necessary if you want to get into the genre.  <br />Robert Fripp is an outstanding guitarist and composer.  His solo during \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" is absolutely mindblowing.  Greg Lake plays some pretty mean basslines.  His use of scales and perhaps some improvisation on \\"Schizoid\\" are really fantastic.  He's a great singer too, and very diverse.  He would later join Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, and they rocked too.  Miles Giles is an excellent drummer, especially displaying nice jazzy technique.  <br />\\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" is about the most insane song I've ever heard, and I don't just mean from the time.  With it's heavy main riff and distorted vocals, the first few minutes almost remind me of Black Sabbath.  Then it goes into a crazy fusion-type instrumental section, with one of the best guitar solos ever.  The musicianship after the solo is incredibly tight, especially for the time.  I got this album about 5 months ago, and until then, I had never heard anything like this.  Anyway, that song is the biggest highlight of the album for, but the rest is quite good too.  \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" is a pretty ballad, and a needed breather after the first track.  \\"Epitaph\\" is a powerful ballad, with some fine lyrics.  \\"Moonchild\\" is often slagged off as pretentious and self-indulgent, but I don't mind it.  The verse of the song is very good, and the 10 minute instrumental fooling bit can be boring, but sometimes I actually enjoy listening to it.  The title track is a good slice of symphonic prog.<br />If you are interested in prog. rock, I highly recommend this album.  Also, if you just like hard rock with elements of jazz, pick this up.  You really shouldn't miss this one, it's really awesome.
B00005T30L|5.0|I loved this movie especially because of the humor, darkness, a real-to-life plot, and mysterious ending.  Thora Birch was excellent for this role.  I also must comment on the music, very well done.
B000089RVX|5.0|Anyone familiar with Fallen's feature song &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; should be able to appreciate that, if nothing else, Amy Lee lends great vocals to a genre where real quality singers are few and far between. But beyond this, a quick sampling of the rest of Evanescence's music reveals that there is a lot more originality to be found beyond mere vocals. The music is edgy, carrying a uniquely chilling tone. The music's powerful instrumentals and aggressive lyrics can be likened to groups like Linkin Park and TRUSTCompany, but when coupled with a voice as captivating as Amy's, the effect is more likely to evoke an emotive response. The music has incredible depth to it--and as a result I think it will be a long time before I tire of listening to it.
B00006V9A0|3.0|this cd is ok. it's the first Nirvana cd that i've ever heard, but i liked it. i am going to get some of there other cd's now.
B00006J9OV|5.0|After hearing both the Von Karajan and the Kna performances, but never seeing the Opera in person I bought this DVD after reading the varying reviews listed here. While it is true that both the Von Karajan and the Kna performances are utterly magnificent, they are both different. THIS performance is also magnificent, but again, different from the other 2. <br />Regarding the tempi, I do not find the tempi too slow, but rather find it a very creatve interpretation and courageous. <BR>The second half of the first act is magnificent musically. True, Jerusalem sort of just stands there, but I prefer to accent the outstanding musical interpretation and ignore the flaws in the acting.<br />The Second Act is breathtaking. Franz Mazura (Klingsor) is marvelous and the whole scene is just magnificent. The spontaneous clapping at the end does not bother me since I wanted to stand up and cheer too after that act. I guess the New York audience is less conservative than a typical European audience, but I found it wonderful to see an audience reacting with such excitement. <br />I find the beginning of the Third Act a bit slow after the excitement in the Second Act, but this is personal. The end of the Third act is stunning.<BR>Jerusalem is a wonderful Parsifal and manages to portray the &quot;child&quot; image well. Weikl is a great Amfortas. While he didn't sing like he is in pain, but looking closely his watering mouth and sweating face, he portrays his condition well. Moll is fantastic as Gurnemanz, and of course Meier is a an outstanding Kundry.<br />The sound and the sets are really fabulous. <br />Perhaps some of the other reviewer have already seen a performance of Parsifal. I never had that experience. I wat not disappointed and I constantly watch sections that I especially enjoy over and over. <br />I highly recommend this DVD set. If you have heard another performance, you might need to keep an open mind because this performance is different and does not try to be Von Karajan or Kna. However, this performance holds its own as being no less magnificent then the other 2.
B00004Z459|5.0|When I heard \\"Crawling\\" on the radio, not knowing who sang it, I immediately found out who it was and it became my favorite song of all time.  After hearing \\"In the End\\", I had to buy this album.  When I bought it, I was blown away to say the least.  Hybrid Theory is incredible!!!!!!<br />1.Papercut(7/10)-Pretty good rap verses, but I wasn't feelin it as much as the other ones.<br />2.One Step Closer(8/10)-At first I didn't like it, but later I fell in love with it.  By far the heaviest metal song on the album.<br />3.With You(7/10)-Another heavy metal song, and very good, but the chorus isn't nearly as good as the verses. Mike's raps are amazing.<br />4.Points of Authority(6/10)-The worst song on the album. Kind of pointless.<br />5.Crawling(12/10)!!-Simple:the best song ever!!!!<br />6.Runaway(9/10)-Chester shines on this one. Very catchy and very well produced.  One of the sloer ones.  Excellent guitars in this one.<br />7.By Myself(9/10)-Amzing metal song.  Mike's raps are a little different on this one, but I love it. Chester and Mike blend hip-hop and rock very nicely on this one.<br />8.In the End(10/10)-This song put Linkin Park as one of the most popular bands today.  At first, this song was genious, but got overplayed.  Different than the other songs.  Very gloomy.<br />9.Place for my Head(9/10)-Mike's raps remind me a little of the skills of Eminem. Excellent music and blending of rock and rap.<br />10.Forgotten(10/10)-Very similar to #9, just a little heavier and better.<br />11.Cure for the Itch(8/10)-Not a song. Music is ok, but I always skip it. Pointless.<br />12.Pushing me Away(10/10)-Very similar to Crawling, kind of slow. Very catchy lyrics and an excellent wrap up of the album.
0316666343|4.0|Once i started to read this book i could not put it  down. alice sebold did a wonderful job showing the readers the victims point of view. this book has moment that make you cry and laugh, which makes the book all that better. i don't know why people are writing bad reviews for this book, maybe they should read it again?!?
B000001ESN|5.0|While the songs &quot;Working Man&quot; and &quot;Fly By Night&quot; got Rushed noticed, and &quot;2112&quot; made people stop and take further notice, &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; solidified Rush as a major player in the Rock arena and defined their sound/place in music history.  Riding the crest of super stardom, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; proved that Rush (via Permanent Waves) wasn't a fluke and showed that Rush can keep themselves &quot;pedal to the metal&quot;, and they haven't let-up since.<br />Permanent Waves, though short in quantity of songs, goes over the top and the extra mile in quality and playability.  This album is great from start to finish, and, when you're at a point musically that you need a Rush &quot;fix&quot; for your mind and ears, this is the album you'll always pick-up first and play to get yourself back into a Rush groove.
0446608955|5.0|The book I have recently finished is called A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks.  This was a remarkable experience to have read a book with such a sweet plot and has drawn me inside the story.  The characters Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter are such interesting individuals with unique qualities and characteristics. Although there is a movie about it, there are some different settings to it.  I personally enjoyed the book more than the movie itself.  The book clearly describes the true meaning of the title in a more detailed manner.  There are different scenes that I really enjoyed and made it more worthwhile to me.  In page 237, it says It was, I remembered thinking, the most difficult walk anyone ever had to make.  In every way, a walk to remember. These lines really express the title and the true depth of the meaning more than the movie, which did not include these details.<BR> I think theme of  this book is that miracles can happen.  On the last page of the book, page 240, it reads I now believe, by the way, that miracles can happen. I thought this was a perfect way to end the nook that left you a sense of great happiness.  I agree with it because the book really focuses on this theme in an ironic way.  Although the book is fiction, I still believe this considering that the author expresses it in a way that it couldnt possibly have been written without experiencing it.  I believe that miracles can happen because I have experienced this myself.  Perhaps since I have encountered miracles that it touched me more deeply.<BR> I would definitely recommend the book to others because it is such a heartwarming story that it is hard to pass on a book like this without reading it first.  I would recommend this book because I believe it will touch others as it has to me. This book is filled with love and hope that you won't soon forget. It is a spiritual story and I recommend this to anyone willing to open their hearts to a lovely story of romance.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This is one of the tightest soundtracks that I've heard in a long time. I thought that \\"Wanksta\\" by 50 Cent, \\"Lose Yourself\\", \\"8 Mile\\" by Eminem, \\"Rap Game\\" by D12, \\"U Wanna Be Me\\" by Nas, and \\"Love Me\\" by Eminem, 50 Cent and Obie Trice were the best songs on the CD.<br />I think that the soundtrack is a perfect companion for the movie and that it definitely should be in every hip-hop fan's collection.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I can't say enough good things.  Norah's voice is zowie!  And the music is very piano bar/smoky/late night.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Saw the movie and was thrilled. Then bought the CD and I play it every day going to and from work.  It is the greatest and I am amazed at the talent of Zeta-Jones, Renee, Richard and Queen, plus John Riley. Wonderful, wonderful CD.
B00000IOSU|5.0|A must for Sarah fans.  First disk is superior to the second.  All live versions of songs are unique and addictive.
B00008977N|2.0|Make no mistake about it, this is a fantastic concert by Peter Gabriel.<br />The only problem that I have with this DVD is the picture quality - it is not much of an improvement over the video.  The sound is good however I was expecting a clean film transfer for this movie - they obviously did not go through this trouble.<br />Pity though, I can't give this DVD 5 stars - the picture quality is poor.
B000002UEB|5.0|this is an extraordinary album.  queensryche combine art rock style with techinal wizardry and progressive music but with enough commercial appeal to create a spectacular story of a man manipulated.  in the interim you get songs of love, drugs, paranoia, comments on society and politics, revolution and it is all on a backdrop of beautiful music.  this is their finest work ever.  i do not think they wil ever top this although i hope they do.  <BR>     i see some negative reviews of this album and i do not understand them.  this album is brilliant.  appealing to the ear for the casual listener and yet holds enough musicianship to appease the progressive fan/musicians.  geoff tate has a phenominal voice.  chris degarmo and michael wilton are amazing guitarists.  some of their chord progressions and playing just make me weep.  <BR>    scott rockenfield is such an amazing drummer and inspiration to me as a drummer for many reasons, one of which is that he really grooves with bassist eddie jackson.  whata great rhythm section.  all totalled up, this album is truly a must own for fans of good music and fans of great bands.
B0000669JL|4.0|This is a great collection, don't get me wrong, but anyone who wants to get into marley any deeper than just playing the well known stuff should look into his albums. One steller album not represented at all on Legend is Survival, which I think is marley's best by far. A good introduction, yes, a comprehensive collection, no. Also, if you're looking to diversify your taste in reggae past bob marley, check out the sountrack to the movie The Harder they Come, a great introduction into other non-marley reggae.
B00003CXXM|1.0|First of all, I could barely follow the storyline.  Secondly, Matt Damon executing all those perfect self-defense techniques?  Please.  Ladies, you know who we would rather see in a role like this, right?  (I'll give you a hint, his first name is Arnold)<br />This is actually a remake, and the earlier version is sturdier as far as the storytelling goes.  But this movie simply does not do justice to the novel.  I know, it's a common complaint, but never truer.
B00005JKJA|5.0|If you like David Lynch, you will love Mulholland Drive.  This movie is very similar to Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, but better.  It is about 2 young women who are trying to discover their identities.  Beyond that, it is really hard to describe.  There are a lot of scenes that are unexpectly funny, like the scenes with Billy Ray Cyrus.  The soundtrack is great!  It features the music of Angelo Badalamenti and a lot of oldies.  This movie also introduces some fascinating characters like \\"The Cowboy.\\"  The characters in this movie are so strange, you will be really entertained for the full 2 and 1/2 hours.  When you are through watching it, you will want to watch it over and over again.<br />I will admit, some of the sex scenes are a bit much.  It can get a little uncomfortable when watching with a group of people.  Also, this movie will not be for everyone.  If you like a movie that ties up all the loose ends at the end of the movie, this may not be the movie for you.  But if you are a David Lynch fan, by all means, this is your movie.
B00005JL78|5.0|I'm not kidding, this is hands down the best motion picture that Mr. Spielberg has delivered us yet.  It eclipses his previous best, which of course was &quot;Close Encounters&quot; (hey, being second on that list is like being above first on anyone elses list!).<br />I'm told that there are tons of special features on this edition.  Those familiar with my reviews already know this:  I don't give a shucky-darn about DVD features.  Give me the movie with the best picture and audio quality possible.  Does &quot;Minority Report&quot; succeed on these levels?  Without a doubt.<br />Tom Cruise hasn't been this good in a long time.  Samantha Morton was robbed of an Academy Award nomination for her work here as the main 'precog'.  Don't know what a 'precog' is?  You need to see this movie!  The effects will boggle the mind of even the most jaded moviegoer.  You've never seen anything like this!  With &quot;A.I.&quot;, Mr. Spielberg was said to be channelling the spirit of the late Stanley Kubrick.  True, but equally true here.  No, the late Mr. Kubrick had nothing to do with this film, but the influence is simply undeniable.
0440236738|5.0|When an author ventures out from an established pattern, fans can be both disappointed and curious.  After Tell No One, I remained curious but not disappointed.  With Gone for Good, I am fully convinced that the author has succeeded in demonstrating his ability to leave Myron and Win at home and let us meet new and exciting characters.  Gone for Good both mesmerized me and allowed me to let my imagination run wild with guesswork on what awaits on the coming pages.  A fun and innovative writing style ensures a craving for the next work by Mr. Coben.
B00008RH3L|5.0|There's no use saying Miller's Crossing is better than Godfather.  It is more nuanced, with more irony and quirkiness, but simply doesn't have the scope of that classic.  Frankly, even though they are both mafia movies, it's rather like comparing apples to oranges... where the Godfather is an epic view from the top, Miller's Crossing is a morality play seen from an outsider's perspective.  Where the Godfather is straightforward storytelling, Miller's Crossing has symbolic humor, multiple layers, and an intricate plot.  <br />You can watch Miller's Crossing over and again, and take something away from it every time.  I would even go so far as to say it is the best thing the Coen brothers (Raising Arizona, Fargo, O Brother...) have ever done.  In the simplest terms, it is brilliant.  Enjoy.
B00006472M|5.0|Some movies are made to just be fun and this is one of them.  Both of my kids and I have been watching this movie for years and we absolutely love it.  It has become a ritual to watch it especially during Halloween.  I'm buying it just so we don't have to wait for Halloween to roll around...
0618001905|4.0|This was a really enjoyable book to read. It is well written and easy to follow, particularly for someone who is not a rigorous academic historian. By means of comparison, I found it considerably easier to follow and more enjoyable to read than Pakenham's cumbersome \\"A Scramble for Africa.\\" The historical period he describes is both fascinating and disturbing, as the atrocities committed by the Belgians and their cohort in the Congo were beyond belief at times. The book focuses only on affairs in the Congo and, as a result, will not give the reader a broader overview of the colonization and exploitation of Africa, in general. Nevertheless, it depicts an important historical event and does so in a clear, concise, enjoyable manner.
B00005JLWN|5.0|It's true, this is the movie no one's heard about but should've gone to see. It has actoin using swords, guns and this weird martial arts style called 'guncata'. It's soo great you must see and buy this movie!! I don't know why this movie wasn't promoted but it deserves more than it's seen so far. I kept my movie ticket as proof that this movie existed since none of my friends ever heard of this movie. But you must see this!! it thee best action movie i've seen, matrix- style action without looking like a [imitation]. It can definately hold it's own against the matrix trilogy.! ^_^
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Excellent filmography and cinematography.  If your the scholarly type, this movie will be motivating.
0064407667|1.0|My  ... son received this book as a gift for Christmas.  We read the book together in about a week.  We both were very dissappointed in the whole story and the gruesome characters.  This is not a book for children.  The book states it is for children 10 and up and even that is not appropriate.  The book is downright strange.  I agree with the Children's Librarian review ....  She has nailed this book right on the head.  This book is a complete downer.  It's amazing to me how it ever made it to the New York Times Bestseller List. ...
B00006690F|5.0|I hafta admit, I didn't think Em could top 'The Marshall Mathers LP.' I thought it would been better if he just stopped on top. But when I first heard the 1st single \\"Without Me,\\" on the radio b4 the album came out I knew em had topped himself. And he did. All the songs are hot, but my 5 favorites are \\"Superman,\\" \\"Soldier,\\" \\"Till I Collapse,\\" f/ Nate Dogg, \\"Bussiness,\\" & \\"Sing for the Moment.\\" Em's lyrics r more deep and this album turns out 2 be more of a serious one with the acception of \\"Without Me.\\" If u have liked Eminem's previous releases pick this one up! Pick up 2 or 3 copies! It's THAT good! Even if u don't like eminem, pick it up, he delivers! Good goen Em!
B00006RIO7|5.0|I agree with most of the reviews about the last two tracks - I haven't listened to them but once myself. Everything else is well worth buying the CD for. &quot;Cell block Tango&quot; and &quot;We both reached for the gun&quot; are my personal favorites-I visual the scenes in the movie hearing them.Can't wait to see &quot;Class&quot; on the DVD love that song also.I was  signing these song after seeing the movie and had to have the soundtrack.  The movie deserves to win all the Oscars it can.
B000003S2M|5.0|This cd isn't Brian Eno's most successful in terms of unobtrusive ambience, but it is incredibly beautiful.  When I listen to it, I'm aware of where each of its pieces begins &amp; ends (if not so much how they go), so this cd won't just be as vaporous as some other great Eno music.  I do, though, regard it as among the most beautiful music he made.  Very silky.  For me, the 6th song especially, composed mostly of a slow delivery of 2 notes, is one of the highlights of...life.  Put this cd on, turn the lights off, &amp; look out the windows of your spaceship to the stars.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Beck really never fails to impress, but he rarely does completely suprise, this being one of the exceptions (to the latter). Take something like Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots or OK Computer and strip them of everything but emotion; that comes close to describing the beauty of this effort, but not quite. I never thought I'd see something rival Nick Cave in the heartbreak record department, but Beck rises to the occasion nicely. Some songs have similar sounds and get a little repetitive, but the music is so intricate anyway that you don't really notice until you listen to it on an hourly basis, and by that time you really don't care. In any case, it's great. Nick Cave fans that aren't familiar with Beck need to hear to this.
B00007GZVR|5.0|The movie begins with a narration by \\"The Cowboy,\\" voiced by Sam Elliot. Perfect choice. It's never really explained who he is or what he might be. God or guardian angel? That's alright, though, it works just fine. The introduction to the main character, The Dude, is so appropos of who he is, strolling thru a grocery store in his bathrobe and writing a check for 69 cents. Jeff Bridges is The Dude aka Jeffrey Lebowski. He and John Goodman along with Steve Buscemi are a trio of friends. They become involved in a money extortion/kidnapping plot due to there being another Jeffrey Lebowski. The writing is excellent and the actors deliver; their performance of the material is first rate. Maude Lebowski is quite a character in her own right and Julianne Moore does it just right. If you've never seen this movie and enjoy a well written and conceptualized comedy this is more than worth the price of a rental. It's laugh out loud funny in places, especially the dream sequences. I think it's among the Coens' best work and some of the shots are fantastic.<BR>I also want to congratulate Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame for having the good taste to appear in not only this film but also Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas the very same year!
0321127420|4.0|I've enjoyed reading Martin Fowler other books.  I've enjoyed this one as well.  I did have a hard time reading this book at first because of the organization of the book.  The book starts with discussions about patterns and their trade-offs.  I was familiar with the architectures presented, but I was not familiar with the pattern nomenclature that was being used.  I was easily thrown off track because of that.  Luckily, Martin Fowler's web site ... has a nice catalog of the patters with short summaries that helped me understand the definition of the pattern name.  After spending 1/2 an hour on his site, that the discussions were easily understandable and enlightening.<br />With that said, I'm disappointed at the structure of this book.  I would expect the definitions of the patterns to appear up front, and the discussions to appear after the pattern definitions.
B000089RVX|5.0|What an exceptional album... Amy Lee's vocals are mesmerizing, and the band lays down just enough crunch and heaviness to drive the music to new levels.  I've listened to this disc several times over, and it sounds just as new and vibrant with each replay as it did the first time.<br />If you are a fan of heavy bands with female vocalists (i.e. Lacuna Coil, The Gathering), do yourself a huge favor and pick this one up.  It's an excellent listen!
B00005JKNC|5.0|I just finished watching &quot;The Majestic&quot;.  Wow!  What a powerful movie....  The acting in this film was fantastic.  This is a keeper movie.  My eyes filled with tears as the characters drew me into the story.  I just can't say enough about how good this movie was.  Isn't it ironic that the same &quot;Keep your mouth shut about politics&quot; is rearing it's ugly head in Hollywood once again.  Guess the contract really does keep getting re-written when it suits best.....
B0000013G9|5.0|This album is amazing! The best selling rnb album in the world and TLC's greatest work. Every song is brilliant and could be a single - out of all their discs CSC and 3D are the only ones I can listen to in full. I recomend this CD to anyone, especially people who are getting into TLC since the release of 3D - you have to hear this album - it's sexy and it's cool and in places crazy but where's Left eye? A few more rap numbers could have helped but here's my review: (All songs out of 5)<br />(1)Intro - great beat - best intro out of all their albums (5)<BR>(2) creep - this song rocks! Tionnes voice is incredible - it's sexy, you can dance to it or just chill to it - great song (5)<BR>(3)kick your game - nice to hear from Left eye on this track, which is quite good - good to dance to but not their best (3)<BR>(4) Diggin' on you - love this track - very chilled out and smooth - the girls sound very sexy on this one, especially T-Boz (4.5)<BR>(5)case of the fake people - love the beat and has a good message, kind of like a more mature part 2 of 'what about ur friends.' (3)<BR>(6) interlude-Love the beat...(5)<BR>(7) red light special - what can I say? This track is amasing! It's probably one of the sexiest songs ever written and T-Box is perfect for it - she sounds so damn sexy, this track just puts you totally in the mood and Chilli sounds good on it too. The guitar bit is great - (6!)<BR>(8) Waterfalls - need I say anymore - the world knows that track is an rnb classic which made TLC what they are today and Lisa's rap is so inspiring, so famous and so perfect - (6!!!)<BR>(9)interludeJust the same as the intro basically - great beat (5)<BR>(10) lets do it again - this track is really good - very sexy, makes u feel alive and happy - the end just gets better and better and Chilli sounds really good on this track - she has a great voice (5)<BR>(11) if i was ur girlfriend - it's not like TLC to do a cover but thank god they didn't screw up - good song but not one of the better ones on the album (3)<BR>(12) sexy interlude - very funny<BR>(13) take our time - nice track but not amazing (3)<BR>(14) interlude - it's okay but another track should have filled its space (2)<BR>(15) switch - the worse song on the album, although Left eyes rap is quite good (1)<BR>(16) ...this way comes - great song with a great message, a great rap and a great intro by Dre of Outcast - nice way to end the best album of the 90's (in terms of rnb anyways) If you don't have this album get it - it needs to be in ur collection - you can't call yourself an rnb fan if it isn't.
0440236738|3.0|Not too shabby a story... but there's<BR>one thing I don't understand: the main character,<BR>Will Klein, was a self-confessed 'coward' who was<BR>always avoiding confrontation and violence<BR>In one part of the book, he was assaulted in his<BR>own apartment after someone had broken into it.<BR>Then much later into the story, he got attacked<BR>again IN HIS OWN ROOM.<BR>Hadn't the thought of putting up steel bars at<BR>the door/windows, or installing a security system,<BR>or just getting a dog ever crossed his mind after<BR>the first attack?

0446677450|3.0|Kiyosaki did an amazing job teaching people about money.  He uses simple language and understandable examples that anybody can understand.  He has taught me so much about how i can become wealthy.  All we need to do is become financial literate and not be scared to take a risk.  Most people are scared to lose money and work for money.  We must be like the rich and let money make money for us!
B00000IQUT|4.0|One of the most controversial and notorious movies to come out from the 1970's was Meir Zarchi's I Spit On Your Grave.  Jennifer Hill, a New York writer, decides to go to a cabin in the country to finish her novel.  Much of the plot is already given out on the back of the video box.  She is sunbathing in her boat out in the lake when two locals in a motorboat, the blond Andy and dark-haired Stanley, lasso her boat to the shore and chase her through the woods.  They are joined by two of their friends, Johnny, the local gas station attendant, and Matthew, the nerdy-looking half-retarded grocery delivery man who has a crush on her.  She is stripped, raped and beaten bloody three times, twice in the woods, once in her cabin.  Having survived this traumatic ordeal, she gets a well-deserved revenge on all four of them.<br />The way Jennifer is attacked and chased is the way one would treat a hunted animal, especially as Andy and Stanley yell like rednecks in heat, adding to the fear she felt.  Hunting is probably one of the pastimes country hicks like them enjoy, and to them, she is no different from any deer.<br />There are some issues still relevant today.  One is the motivation of the men who attacked Jennifer.  Johnny thinks she was asking for it, as she showed up at the gas station walking back and forth in her summer dress, showing off her legs, and later, when she was in her bathing suit.  This is the \\"she's asking for it\\" defense.  In fact when he and his friends are out fishing at night, he says that women from the city come to the country for one thing...sex.  While I far from condone rape, there is something to be said for Jennifer's cut-offs and other revealing clothes.  Perhaps the men felt exploited, being turned on like that.  It's the same argument used in selling adult magazines and videos:  doesn't it exploit men as well, since they are the target market and they have to pay for it?  Similarly, I'm not advocating that women wear chadors as in Iran or burqas in Afghanistan, but something more middle-of-the-road.<br />This was also the time that most women did not report rape because of the ensuing humiliation of a police investigation and the myth that it was her fault--hence her taking the law into her own hands.  The attacks on Jennifer are unflinchingly graphic and unsettling, which may lead many to believe that the film glorified rape, but in fact, the brutality of it serves to justify her revenge.<br />Camille Keaton pulls in an ace performance as Jennifer in an agonizing role.  Her slight resemblance to Tori Amos reminded me of how the latter was assaulted as well.<br />Apart from the ordeal and the revenge, much of the remainder are lulls in the drama, such as the scene at the camp sight and diner.  The only other thing I quibble is the title.  Surely, the original Day Of The Woman would have been better?qas in Afghanistan, but something more middle-of-the-road.<br />This was also the time that most women did not report rape because of the ensuing humiliation of a police investigation and the myth that it was her fault--hence her taking the law into her own hands.

B000089CJI|4.0|take the electronic genius of DNTEL's Jimmy T. and the voice of death cab for cutie's Ben G. and you get the postal service.<BR>The songs on here are great and very electronic and dancy. It has this huge 80's feel and you can hear a little NEW ORDER, or NO DOUBT's current single. Lots of bleeps and blips. This is starting a whole new genre of music, LABTOP POP. 80's house with indie rocking.<BR>A big complaint is the lame whiny vocals. They are very catchy but at the same time they are very whiny and they scream teenybopper. you know that typical whiny emo sound that is so sugary sweet that by the last track you'll have to check your teeth for cavities. its only a matter of months before every get up kid, dashboard confessional loving 15 year old puts these song on a mix cd for their love intrest.<BR>that is just how good the songs are though. too good to stay underground.
B00005JLXC|3.0|OK--so there was X-Men, Spiderman, and now, Daredevil, the blind superhero who has an enhanced sense of his surroundings due to biochemical material splashed inside him.  When the future hero's father, a boxer on a comeback, defies orders to take a fall, he is killed, and from then on, Matthew becomes a fighter for justice, basing his costume on his father's red cape and his nickname of \\"devil.\\"  Costume-wise, think of Batman in a brick red outfit, with a cane that has a grapple attachment.<br />By day, Matthew Murdock becomes a struggling lawyer whose kindheartedness is causing a cash-flow problem.  He took a whole bunch of fluke from a Chinese merchant whose case he won, and that drives his partner crazy.  By night, he is Daredevil.<br />So, as this is the era of CGI and digital technology, in what areas is this used?  Answer:  the glowing blue outlined forms that serve as Daredevil's perceptions of his surroundings.  That works best when we see his view of Elektra, the daughter of billionaire Nikolaos Natchios who is about to be set up by the villainous Kingpin, the city's crime boss.<br />As much as I liked Ben Affleck in Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Good Will Hunting, he fails to plow any new ground here.  Jennifer Warnes as Elektra--she's the one to watch, playing a tough, hard-edged beauty who shows moments of charm when it's brought to the surface.  The scene of their martial arts demo in the playground is supposed to make the viewer go \\"Ooh!\\" but so what?  And Colin Farrell  as Bullseye would be more enjoyable if he didn't look so much like Andre Agassi.  His response to an irritating airline passenger is laudable, however.  Michael Clarke Duncan plays the Kingpin with a menacing edge, made so with his bass voice and enormous bulk.<br />Oh, and there are two guest cameos.  One is by Stan Lee, who is an old man at a crosswalk.  The other, playing the pathologist on duty, is a big Marvel Comics fan, and he has a few lines more than usual in his screen appearances.  Hint:  can anyone say Silent Bob?<br />Maybe much of the film's appeal was based on the fact that I didn't read much Marvel Comics when I was young.  Anyone who has no previous knowledge of the character would see this as another boy becomes superhero, undergoes great loss, fights villains, falls for a girl, etc.  In the end, Daredevil's not the film it could have been because of a lack of appeal, not much action or character development, and that while dark, it lacks the stylish goth of Batman.  All I can say, let's hope this summer, The Incredible Hulk and X2 will surpass this misfire.  Overall rating:  2.5 out of 5, rounded to 3.Hint:  can anyone say Silent Bob?<br />Maybe much of the film's appeal was based on the fact that I didn't read much Marvel Comics when I was young.

B00006LWSF|2.0|I love Em and the only good songs on this album are the first one and the last one.  The rest just seem like filler.
6305949980|5.0|If I could rate this movie more than 5 star- I would! I have cherished this movie ever since the age of 4. I was not a particularly tough or hard-to-scare kid, but I knew that \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" wasn't the least bit scary. You may have heard the this is not a children's movie-IT CERTAINLY IS! It is whimsical, comical at times, and a great movie to put on for your kids while they play in their playrooom. It is not referred to very often as a musical, but it is. There are songs in practically every scene, and each lyric holds special meaning, that would make you want to say out loud, \\"I know just how you feel!\\"-whether the song is sharing Jack's longing for something new, or Jack's merry interest for Christmas. I guarentee that this movie is 100% fabulous. Even though  believe I am this movie's number one fan, you can ask anyone else who isn't as obsessed with it if they liked the movie, and that person will most likely remember their first time watching it, and give you a fond smile, and nod 'yes.'
B0000027RL|5.0|When I first got this cd, I basically got it for the big four (Even Flow, Alive, Jeremy, Black). But when I turned it on, I was blown away. Nothing can compare to the first time you here 'Once.' I bought it for the famous tunes, and love it for the other ones. 'Ten' gets my vote for best album of the 90's.
B000084T18|3.0|This album was probably the most hyped album that I can remember being around for. Others like Pac's \\"all eyez on me\\" and big's \\"life after death\\" were perhaps more hyped, but i was too young to remember. I went on out and bought this album the first day it came out, and although it is a good album overall, i was somewhat dissapointed. The album does start off with a band as the first 2 tracks are some of my favorites, but as the LP moves on, so does my skip button. I am not knocking 50's skills or anything, but given all they hype, i expected more, thats why i give it 3 stars.But 50 has potential to be as big as tupac and biggie, just not with this album, no matter how many radio hits he has or copies of \\"get rich...\\" he sells
6305291446|3.0|First off let me state that I have seen all of the Halloween movies excluding # 6(in which I hear that that may be a good thing) and that I am a big fan of Michael Myers. When I saw this movie I couldent help but cringe alittle: This is what every big time Michael Myers/Halloween fan dreaded, its becoming one of those Teen movies! Yes. Instead of the first few originals, where John Carpenter had a vison on making a actual scary movie and he didnt care about the people who were in it or anything, these last few r trying to change the whole entire vision of the Myers legacy and turn it into some Cosmo Girl movie! Like if u notice this movie has big  shots like ll Cool J and Josh Hartnett! There trying to take these movies and crush them and warp them into all of the other horror movies that we have today. Also as u can tell, the role and story behind the Halloween movies r changing into the Friday the 13th kindof movies with the \\"Killer chasing around young virgin ... teenagers and killing them.\\" Plain and Simple this has to change in the near future.<br />P.S. Look at my review on Halloween Resurrection and u will notice that I brought up the very same kind of points.
0060254920|5.0|I thought that Where the Wild Things Are was a great book.  I think it is a great book for kids because Max, the kid in the story, has such a great imagination.  I think that kids would enjoy this book because they usually have very good imaginations.  I also liked the illistrations in the book.  Especially the monsters.  They were drwn with great detail.  Overall this book is great and I think anyone at any age would enjoy it.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I enjoyed this CD alot from the two great songs like Cochise and like a stone to all of the others on the cd they were great. My only problem is that, hearing that there would be people from Everclear and Rage against the machine I thought there would be some more loud, rock music, but i can live withoput it and sacrafice it for this CD
B00005KB9R|5.0|This album is his ultimate work. Brilliantly orchestrated and emotionally evocative, Marley created a timeless work that appeals aesthetically and philosophically. Marley calls the listener to participate from the first song, begging us to move both to the music and to the message. There is a rawness to this album that harkens back to earlier Marley and appears in the sound of Hallelujah Time. <BR>Tracks 4,5,6,7,8 are the most powerful in the Marley cannon. Kaya is maybe the only album that juxtaposes such brilliance. The cool and reserved genius shows that Marley can move both subtly and peacefully. Small axe warns of the toppling of the power structure, but does it so harmoniously and beautifully that it exudes a wonderful irony. <BR>This album is the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of any Marley collection or music collection for that matter. It is almost impossible to fathom the immense genius that Marley had, but it is slowly apprehended and revelaed by listening to this album over and over, and then some more.
0440236304|5.0|The only other World War II novels that can compare with this one are Burgett's 3 ohters.  Very truthfull and gives the reader a real feel of what a paratrooper went through at Normandy.
B000000HSU|5.0|I am one of those unlucky bastards that did not hear this album when it came out in mid 1983, albeit,I knew it existed and always wanted to hear it.Back then (1983)I was a metalhead into bands like Priest and Maiden and Motorhead,thinking that they were the apex of heavy music.Fast forward to 1998,when I finally got the chance to purchase \\"Rock For Light\\" and I was literally blown away by its sheer ferocity,break-neck-speed and unrelenting musical attack.This is one of the most visceral rock albums ever,brimming with a power that will make a lot of Nu-Metal clowns ... in their pants!Although modestly produced (the guitar sound is weak, to say the least, by today's standards, and the drums are not as loud as they should've been)it still manages to enthrall the listener with unapologetic attitude.Songs like \\"Riot Squad\\",\\"Joshua's song\\" and \\"How Low Can a Punk Get\\" are an all-out thrash fest, that would certainly have appealed to early Metallica and Slayer fans, while \\"At The Movies\\" and \\"I And Survive\\" show the more musical style of the band. The latter song is a Dub/Reggae jam that manages to remain appealing to me; even though I'm not a big Reggae fan, I must confess IT is a good, catchy song, with a mesmerizing chorus that sounds dark and sad. For those who prefer the heavier,speedier side of Bad Brains, then look no further, as \\"Rock For Light\\" is basically an all out hardcore album, with just 3 or four detours into Reaggae/Dub...and even those detours sound cool amidst the rage and thrash of the rest of the songs.Fans of Minor Threat, early Hsker D and fast Dead Kennedys, this IS the album to die for!
B000002H6C|5.0|this is the second best metallica cd.i have three words about this cd.........IT KICKS...I think the best song on this cd is defintly one.it starts off slow then at the end u can hear a machine gun sound......how can u be a metallica fan and not like this song.......one last thing buy this cd.......
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is one of the greatest pure rock albums that has been produced in nearly a decade. It reminds me of old grunge but with the extotic flare and pouncing guitar riffs of Rage. before i heard this album, I honestly thought Cornell's lyrics would sound out of place with the distinct guitar playing of Morello. In actuality, the intoxicating voice of Cornell blends in well with Rage's signature guitar-playing. It sounds great. The more and more you play it, the better it sounds. I'd have to say that it sounds a bit more like Soundgarden then Rage, but aspects of both groups are visibly powerful. I'm happy to see experimentation like this, otherwise music gets boring. Obviously, there can be no replications of old Soundgarden as well as Rage; so I'm happy to see artists take bold moves musically... and luckily, this experimentation was golden. Great CD, one of the best rock cds of late.
B000002HMH|2.0|worst metallica cd.....when cliff died they defintly changed i think.....im only into the old stuff so i dont really like this cd
B00006JJ1O|1.0|The music of Tatu is great ... but be warned that the CD they are selling is not actually a music CD at all.  The CD I received is labelled as [ENHANCED], and apparently that means no music.  All my CD contained was a Music Video and some Behind the Scenes content.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is probably the best movie out there, its a great story and a lot of fun to watch.<BR>  theres laughter, sadness, and suspence.<BR>           ITS GREAT!
B000063K2W|5.0|This is a movie that every woman must see.  Each character in this movie reminds me of someone in my own life.  There are absoultely no men anywhere, yet they are talked about everywhere.  Norma Sheer is a wealthy housewife with what seems as the perfect type of life.  She has a little girl, and of course friends prone to gossip.  Joan Crawford is the wicked shopgirl who begins to have an affair with Norma's husband.  Like many of us, Norma leaves her husband, who then marrys Joan Crawford.  Its ending is just and happy.  I love this movie, it has humor, love, drama, everything you could ask for in a chick flick.  Even though it is made in the thirties, nothing has changed in the last seventy years.
B00004T0US|1.0|I am a 12 year old music fan from Lucasville Ohio. My mom has the original blue album of this. I would say along with In person at The International Hotel Las Vegas Nevada and the Jailhouse Rock Soundtrack and the Sun Records songs. This is one of Elvis' best. Moody Blue is like a country/rock/disco song. Everyone has heard Way Down. Unchained Melody is better than The Righteous Brothers version. He'll Have To Go is a great Country Song originally by George Jones. I am saying all these great things about this album. Why Did I Give It 1 star? The best song on the album is the live version of the Olivia Newton-John song Let Me Be There recorded in Memphis Tennesee. This song RCA didn't bother to put on this CD It should be between He'll Have To Go and Way Down or on the record or cassette- the end of side 1. Anybody who gave this 5 stars has not heard the original album which is 1 million stars. I don't mind a few bonus tracks but what you mainly buy the album for is the album not bonus tracks. There is a version avaidible without bonus tracks if you would like to hear the best song on the album. I ordered that version from The Record Shop yesterday. By the way I did not buy this version.
B00006M183|5.0|I love this album. It has some of the band's best songs ever. It's also experimental, but the results are oh-so satisfying. I love how the band keeps growing, keeps simplifying and yet getting more mature. It's artistry we're listening to, infused with the earnestness and excitement that defines Pearl Jam.<br />Buy the album, it's one of the best of the last few years.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I can't say any more than anyone else about the great music on this CD. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger and Queen Latifah are each fabulous! But I do have to add that I was not so turned off by the extra tracks on the albumn. I agree, that they are not the same genre, but the rap version of Cell Block Tango, especially, is quite good! Anastacia's number is a bit of pop fluff, but not offensive or terrible or anything. I don't know why everyone complains about their inclusion. I kind of enjoyed having something a bit different to listen to, as well as the absolutely stunning numbers from the movie. (The snipped movie number, &quot;Class&quot;, however, is probably my least favorite song on the CD. I can see why it didn't make the final movie cut.)
B00005JLSC|5.0|Every once in a while an unknown director comes along who serves notice of extraordinary talent, such as Orson Welles with \\"Citizen Kane\\" or Francis Ford Coppola with \\"The Godfather.\\" It's hard to say how Rob Marshall's career will turn out, but he serves notice with \\"Chicago\\" that his name can be mentioned without embarrassment in the same sentence as Welles' and Coppola's. In a time when movie musicals are a nearly moribund art form, \\"Chicago\\" is one of the very few ever made that approaches the excitement and immediacy of a musical live on stage. Movie musicals notoriously offer myriad pitfalls for bathos, usually involving stars who can't sing or dance or directors who don't know how to stage a musical number. Marshall, a choreographer by training, wrings every inherent drop of excitement and pizzazz from every number, and he takes care to hire stars who CAN sing and dance--most notably Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both perfect for a musical set in the Jazz Age. They look like Clara Bow and Louise Brooks reborn, they sing wonderfully, they dance with elegance and panache, and they have more than enough sexiness and charisma to be proclaimed the \\"It Girls\\" for this generation. And what characters they get to play: Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, two murderesses sharing the same unctuous lawyer (Billy Flynn, played by Richard Gere) and the same uncanny instincts for survival and publicity. Coming less than a decade after the O.J. Simpson trial and in the midst of the \\"Reality TV\\" craze, this smart, funny, scaldingly cynical film has much of importance to say about the vicious triviality of American celebrity culture. If you can take your eyes off Zellweger and Zeta-Jones--and that is, admittedly, very hard--you will note the abundant excellence of Queen Latifah, as venal jailhouse matron \\"Mama\\" Morton, and John C. Reilly--perhaps this generation's finest character actor, and with an unexpectedly lovely singing voice--as Zellweger's sad-sack hubby, Amos. As for Richard Gere, much has been made in the press of his being snubbed by Oscar. No one besides Gere could have made the brazen dishonesty of Billy Flynn so engaging, and he acquits himself well in his song-and-dance numbers. But whereas Gere is very good and memorable, the others--Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, Latifah and Reilly--are mesmerizing and unforgettable.s for Richard Gere, much has been made in the press of his being snubbed by Oscar.

B0000029DD|5.0|Like many people, I bought this CD for one song only, &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. But it was worth every penny I paid for it, and then some, and I have grown to love almost every single track on it. At first I was put off by Grace because of how different each and every song is from the one before it. But now that is one of the things I love most about it. Buckley's style is indescribable, and showcased perfectly on this too short recording, only 10 songs. <br />I have heard people describe this album as the best of the 90's, a well deserved title. Who knows what he would have brought us in the future? It is impossible to predict, given his diverse song writing capabilities. But be careful, this CD is NOT for someone who doesn't truly appreciate well written and performed music. It takes a special kind of someone to love this CD. If you do buy it, it is worth it for the following songs: &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; - the only single ever released, although I rarely hear it on the radio anymore. This song just builds and builds. &quot;Hallelujah&quot; - this song is perfection. I don't have anything else to say about it. You'll see what I mean when you hear it. &quot;Lover you should've come over&quot; - my new favorite on the CD. This is about the most perfect piece of music I have ever heard, and Jeff's voice is AMAZING, especially on this haunting song. I have never heard a male singer sing with such passion and raw emotion...it literally sounds like he is crying on many of the songs. <br />Do yourself a favor and get to know Jeff Buckley, and you will be sad once you grow to love this CD and realize that we will never hear more from this talented, beautiful man.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|It seems puzzling to me why many people regard the Beatles as the greatest band that ever existed on Earth. I personally can't see what all the fuss is, or was, about. To these jaded ears, this just sounds like whitebread, soul-stripped rock 'n roll crossed with the stuffy easy listening crud you'd find on your AM dial back in the early '60s. Sorry, I'll have to pass.
0316666343|2.0|This book got great reviews so I was quite excited to read it. As I read I felt that it was at best good, but as I neared the end I couldn't believe the bizarre turns the book took and I found myself skimming paragraphs. Had certain parts of the book (e.g. most of the afterlife) been omitted and the characters been developed better this book could have been very good. I'm truly surprised that many people could have enjoyed it that much.

B00005OAIE|1.0|I borrowed this cd from someone who actually bought this.....and this person was actually an adult! I can't understand what anybody sees in this kid, but they must see something as this has sold a couple million copies.  This muzak is so bland and soul less.....that it's almost unbelievable.  It's never good when a music academy brat attempts to bare his soul.....under the guise of singer/songwriter.  There is nothing distinctive here......except the parts when he sounds autistic.  The guitar playing, topics and lyrics are so generic......when listening it seems you are stuck inside of a advertisement for the Gap or Abercrombie and Fitch.  I don't recommend this cd to anybody over the age of 15...
B00006RJHG|5.0|man, that was the creepiest phone call i ever heard.  i remember i went to see this movie with my cousins, and we were all so freaked out after.  as soons as we get home, our phone rings, and our cousin is fooling around crank calling us like the guy in this movie, totally freaked us out,  5 stars on this side !
B000084T18|5.0|best rap cd i've heard in a long time. every song is good. get it..you wont be dissapointed. don't listen to the ppl that are dissin it. cant wait for the g-unit cd this fall and new 50 next november.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I think people have to take stock of the obvious: that this movie is a real blast and unending fun... if you're ten years old or less.  I was ten years old when Star Wars came out.  I loved it.  I was obsessed with it, as was every other male kid in my class.  We spent all our time drawing tie fighters and x wings.  We couldn't get enough of it.  Now, Episode One is out and my two older children love it.  They are four and two.  I must admit that there is a certain nostalgic, time-warp savor in seeing my four year old son walking around in a Star Wars T shirt.  And for him and his two year old brother, Episode One is fantastic.  So for me to say that the movie is terrible and the characters are wooden and the accents are arbitrary and fly-by-night, that Liam Neeson should be publicly horse whipped just for being Liam Neeson, that whoever heard of a 6 year old kid making intricate carvings, much less flying a space buggy... all this is not to the point.  It would be like trying to inhabit a doll house and complaining that the cups and saucers are so frigging small.
B00005ARDC|5.0|From start to finish this album is exemplary.  It rocks when it needs too, and slows up when it needs to; there is just a great flow to this album.  Don't let their name scare you off, this album is every bit as good as White Blood Cells, The Strokes, Veni Vidi Vicious, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, or any other rock album I bought this year.<BR>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000084T18|3.0|Get Rich or Die Tryin' was one of the most successdully marketed and hyped albums in a very long time. Well, it's here, and quite frankly, it's just another average album. The production is really nice, but 50's lyrical skills leave a lot to be desired. There are a few really enjoyable songs here... \\"Patiently Waiting\\", \\"21 Questions\\", and \\"Don't Push Me\\" are my personal favorites. I don't know who put this album in the same class as Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, and Ready to Die, but it's nowhere the level of those CDs... those are classics, and this is no classic by any means. It's an album to have because it's hot, but will they be talking about this album the way they do the aformentioned ones 10 years from now?  50's hot right now, but how long will it last?
B00006GA4C|5.0|Great second album. Not quite as good as &quot;on Time&quot;, but very heavy. I highly recommend it.

0440237688|3.0|This book \\"The Giver\\" was a weird but interesting book. It was mainly about a boy named Jonas who lives in a society with no feelings, inequalities, hunger, and pain. Each member of the society is given their future occupation at the age of only twelve. Jonas is very scared for his Ceremony of Twelve. He ends up becoming the reciever of memory. By working with the Giver Jonas realizes the truth about his society and what everyone is missing out on. The ending of The Giver is very interesting, it was not what i had expected to happen. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so just read the book to find out!!
B000077VR3|5.0|I've seen this over 30 times (so far), basically it is a rock version of the La Traviata story, with a wonderful choice of music (60's-90's rock/pop classics), wonderful acting and singing, a visual treat and moving story and music. Chill out, have a glass of good wine and give yourself to the experience... <BR>I love it, it is a wonderful experience, I'll probably watch it 100 times more. IF you get and love the music of Queen, Nirvana etc. then you'll love the music, otherwise you won't, the music is a medley of some of the great rock/pop songs of the last 50 years. If you don't love ROCK you won't get it. RAVE ON!<br />Now many reviewers say I'm wrong for enjoying this?! How silly. My experience is the only one valid one for me,.. (the fact that I have a Ph.D. in music and philosophy are not detriments that prevent my enjoyment of a simple story). I'm in ecstasy watching this musical... if you don't get it fine, don't watch it. But to say it not a great experience for others is as outrageous as saying that it is silly to cry in the Disney movie when Bambi's mother dies.. after all, it's just a cartoon! Those are the people who will never get this, and need it the most. I'm glad I don't live in that Reality.... in mine there is romance, imagination, joy of living, and eternal love. I'll watch it again tonight and join the rave at the Moulin Rouge!
B000062Y98|3.0|I love thrash and power metal. A Night at the Opera (why did they choose such an un-original title?) falls within a different music category. It's somewhat unique, which is the reason I give it 3 stars. It's fast, aggressive, sometimes melodic and well played throughout. The singer's voice is very particular, and the album is filled with many sounds different from the conventional power metal category. <br />HOWEVER, I think Blind Guardian tried so hard to make a different album that it came out totally over played and very noisy. After the third song the screaming vocals start getting pretty annoying. There is so much going on at the same time that it doesn't let the music breath properly. It ends up being a very overwhelmingly noisy album threading in the edge of cacophony. I will continue giving A Night At The Opera a chance, but I cannot make it after the fourth song without changing the CD and reaching for an aspirin.

078322608X|5.0|Why do I consider this my favorite movie? Because its one of the few intelligent sci-fi movies. The time travel elements are very well thought out and there isn't really a hole in the story. Willis' character isn't trying to save mankind by going back in time, its already happened. Once Willis goes back and saves mankind, the virus ceases to exist and thus Willis creates a future where mankind does not need to be saved, so there is no reason for him to travel back in the first place. But by creating a scenario where mankind is sick and needs the antidote, this paradox is cleverly avoided and the classic \\"go back in time to save the future\\" plot is left in the dust. Many paradoxes such as this are discovered when constructing a story around space time. For example, if a sadistic evil character goes back in time and murders his parents, then he creates a paradox because he was never born to begin with. The script intelligently attempts to avoid paradoxes such as these and presents us with a very interesting story. Brad Pitt is AMAZING in this movie and Willis is perfect at playing another average joe character, just like his breakthrough character in Die Hard. One of the other things I love about this movie is the questions it raises. Does pyschology help MAKE people crazy? Willis states \\"I am insane and you are my insanity\\" and Willis allows himself to become convinced that he is crazy so that he may live in a world without the virus, where he and the psychiatrist can be in love... and people thought memento was clever? Bah. Some other questions it raises are, are we too quick to dismiss the strange and paranormal? The boy in the well is the perfect allusion to this. Many of us have a faith which lies bound with the beliefs of a prophet who spoke the word of God, yet if someone were to come along and speak prophetically to us in this day and age, we would call them crazy, such is the case for Bruce Willis' character, and its ironic that the \\"boy in the well\\" is whathelps make the psychologist believe Willis, because the boy in the well represents the irony of our quickness to judge Willis' statements as crazy, but our swiftness at believing that the boy is actually trapped in the well. Once you cry wolf enough for a given situation, one begins to question what is true and what is false in relation to that situation, and this suggests that we as humans are very gullible, but it is the lies of others which come later which cause us to question what we hold to be true. We know of no instance where a boy lies about being trapped in a well, but we've seen many lunatics spout out crazy statements and prophecies. Then we have the concept that Willis' character actually plants the idea in brad pitts mind, this opens up a whole new area of thought. The ending is simply amazing, its tragic, but we realise that through the time travel, willis' character is living on in another dimension, moving towards his final destiny in an infinite reoccurring battle, and the ending manages to be both tragic and happy at the same time, due to the last scene with the scientist and the image of willis still alive as a boy. This really is a beautiful movie with great acting, a great story, and it also raises some intellegient questions, that's why its easily my favorite movie.
0380789035|5.0|Wow. This book is just great. I read it for hours on end, and when I wasn't reading it, I kept thinking about it. This book is Gaiman's best book to date. I've read most of his other books and even some of the Sandman graphic novels, and this is his best work. It's about what happens to gods from the old countries once the people who worship them come to America. What happens to these American versions of these gods? That's one of the main questions tackled in this book.<br />The protagonist is Shadow, a man who is released from jail after 3 years of doing time. His wife dies (very disturbing how) and he flies back for her funeral. He meets a Mr. Wednesday and from there the adventure starts. Full of sadness, happiness, humor, and horror. This book is destined to be a classic. Though it is a bit longer than the usual book, it is definitely worth it.
B00006LHYC|5.0|Let me just say that if you buy this CD, you will not be disappointed.  I can't imagine how anyone could not like this album (then again, I am a huge fan of her Italian and Spanish work).  This album has incredible variety, from the sweet, heartfelt ballads to the up-tempo pop songs, to the R&B-influenced songs.  My personal favourite songs are: \\"Without You\\", \\"You Are\\", \\"I Do To Be\\", and \\"I Need Love\\".  Her voice is incredible, as always, and it is easy to forget that English is not her first language.  Anyway, I recommend this CD %100.<br />Cet album est absolument fantastique, et je le recommande sans réserve.  Sa voix est très belle, et les chansons sont diverses.
068981528X|5.0|This book is hilarous.  It is another classic example of a flip-sided nursery rhyme.  This particular book makes the Wolves play the role of the innocents trying to get a home started, while the piggie is no longer a cute little protagonist.  From step one, the little wolves can't seem to avoide the evil piggie, who always seems to have some way of getting at them.  As the wolves get progressively high-tech, the pig grows progressively more insane.  This book is full of laughs no matter how many times you read it.  The pictures are amazing as one funny thing leads to the next.  The writing style remains delightfully cheerful, and fun to read over and over.  Definitely worth cracking open again.
1573225517|4.0|High Fidelity is a glimpse into the way REAL relationships work. Throughout, the narrator, Rob, contradicticts the reality of love with the fantasy that he always thought love was.  There are the mundane details of the break-up and the move out, plus the &quot;lets still be friends&quot; attempts that never work.  Occasionally Rob seems like a bit of a dolt, and this observation makes one not always totally sympathetic towards him.  His life seems to be drifting along and he doesn't seem to care either way.  But this is the character and at least he is honest.  I wouldn't call High Fidelity a &quot;page turner&quot;.  But it certainly is an easy read and a good one at that.
B00005RYL9|5.0|This movie had it all. Good story, good swordplay and great special effects. Christopher Lambert does his best role here and he is backed up by an already-old but outstanding Sean Connery. The Queen intro song is excellent, so is the rest of the music. <br />This is the best of all the Highlander movies, the sequels are mostly weak and doesnt compare with the first one. <BR>there ya go people! its really worth to buy!
0679882820|5.0|Welcome to the wonderful world of whimsical, wacky writing, and crazy, colorful caricatures - \\"He can sound like a clock, he can TICK, he can TOCK.  He can sound like a hand on a door KNOCK, KNOCK.\\"  \\"Dr. Seuss's Mr. Brown Can Moo!  Can You?\\" is an inspired introduction to sounds through rhyme and alliteration.  The text, format, and images have been adapted from the original to accommodate board book standards; yet, the prose still flows.<br />I am flabbergasted by the lack of enthusiasm for the revised board book editions of Dr. Seuss's (and others) beginner books published by Random House.  I am thrilled to have the opportunity to offer my infant son a CLASSIC narrative, by means of a board book, even in its ADAPTED form.  These magical miniatures are entertaining for little babies, who enjoy the positive interaction of cooperative play through reading.  The objectives of these small books are to appeal to newborns, and very young children with short attention spans who are not attentive enough for the full text versions, they are NOT meant to replace the originals.  Moreover, these pocketsize gems are fashioned for effortless travel to the market, on a plane, in the car, or on a train.  Hee, hee.<br />I own a lot of Dr. Seuss's first editions, in addition to a few of the board book volumes, and agree that the original \\"Bright and Early and the Beginner Books\\" are just that - ORIGINAL.  They are more amusing, entertaining, and educational, but are in fact more appropriate for older children, 3 years and older.  I believe introducing infants to creative works, such as these, only encourages listening and learning from an earlier age.  In summary, if your child is two or older purchase an original version, otherwise think of introducing your infant to the shorter, travel-anywhere format, and procure the original at a later date?  The marvelous, magical magician, who was Dr. Seuss is worth it!  Birth and up.
B000056N8X|3.0|This one was not made to be a sequel, because they wanted everyone to understand the story and the legend well. It disturbs me that Christopher Lambert look so old in the movie, but he looks young on the cover. However, that doesnt make the movie bad. This was the first movie I saw Donnie Yen. His remarkable choregraphy of the martial arts scenes made me start watchng other of his movies, but in this one he only has a minor role. This is supposed to be the end of the highlander legend, which has been on forever it seems. all three sequels follows only the first one, not each other.<br />Best sword fighting scenes of all the movies, and the added martial arts gives another star. The only thing that I wonder about, is if Kate survived? in one version, she dies and in the other she survive. Whats the real truth?
B00005A46T|2.0|Got that right. I'd give this heap of jagged noise 2 and a half stars at best because of Left Behind (a truly amazing track), and mediocre songs like People=****, The Shape (good and creepy), I Am Hated (barely makes the list), Disasterpiece, New Abortion (a neat little ditty) and My Plague (but a shame that whenever I hear it I think of that stupid worthless movie Resident Evil). Note that Heretic Anthem doesn't make the list because of it's [horrible] chorus. So what's the verdict on this recycled, dry, geriatric mess? Let's face it, they had a lot to live up to. Their self-titled album was almost perfect. It was inevitable that the follow-up would be a travesty. Maybe the fools panicked after launching into the mainstream and didn't want to fall into that nu-metal-bear trap and become a typical mallcore band like so many others before them, so they tried to make their next album as \\"brutal\\" as possible? What a cruel joke. Oh, and the chant \\"if you're 555 then I'm 666\\" is beyond petty and ridiculous. It basically crosses over to shamefully embarrassing and pitiful. This is not brutal. This is not heavy. This is not death metal. <br />Thrashy at best... and for that, it's tolerable.
6304981635|2.0|Thanks to this ... were \\"The Game Of Death\\" never finished by Bruce. The only scene worth to watch in this one is Bruce's incredibly fast backhand when he competes with Bob Wall. Otherwise its a bad martil arts movie and doesnt even compare with \\"Way Of The Dragon\\", Bruce Lee's best.
B000069AUI|1.0|Overrated too. These guys are lame. I've heard maybe 5 songs by \\"Coldplay\\" and they were all slow, dry, boring, withery, flakey, coagulated, bitter, lifeless and forgettable. Well, not totally forgettable, cuz everytime they come out with a new single, it just reminds me of the last one. They're an extention of eachother.<br />It's amazing what becomes the talk of the town these days...

B0000844MS|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about 5-6 years old, and I remember telling my mom not to rent it because it looked scary, but she did it anyway and I am thanking her to this day for doing so! I love this movie so much that I am writing a sequel to it. This movie is so captivating  that you will want to watch it over and over again it never get's old! Everyone and anyone can relate to the story, it's great for kids and adults alike, I have bought this movie at least 6 times and everytime I borrow it to someone they steal it, that's how good it is! It touches every possible genre (excuse the spelling), it's action,adventure,to a point horror, suspense, drama, romance,comedy,fantasy and a musical all rolled into one great film. I now own it on DVD for the first time, The extras are great especially the making is very interesting. The movie itself well I haven't seen a plot so well written and imaginative in a long time. For first timers out there it's really neat to see Jennifer Connelly back when she was a young girl, and to see David Bowie in those form fitting tights : ) hehe he is just so beautiful,mysterious and magical, ladies will fall in love with him over and over again. And if you are anything like my friends and I you'll find yourself not wanting to come back to reality. ha ha!  It's a must see the only down fall to this movie is that it ends.
0066214122|4.0|Crichton has once again managed to scare the hell out of us with his latest novel PREY. As usual his characters are carefully crafted and his science is flawless, if not a little much. This one will keep you awake at nights with its nasty little predators and rollicking storyline!  Crichton didn't let us down!  You can't go wrong with this one...treat yourself to a great ride!
B00004YA66|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was amazed.  Well written, well plotted, well acted movies are distressingly rare in Hollywood these days.  But just when you've given up all hope on Hollywood, a movie like \\"Frequency\\" comes along to change your mind.  In the movie, father and son learn they can communicate over 30 years, to just before the father was killed.  With warning from his son, dad avoids dying in a warehouse fire, and he changes history.  Within the new timeline, however, the wife/mother is killed.  Now father and son must race to protect her, by catching a killer in two time frames at once.<br />This movie is a solid thriller.  Combining edge-of-your-seat drama and suspence with heartfelt moments, Emmerich and Hoblit weave a wonderful tapestry of film.  The time travel concept, which is difficult to pull off, works wonderfully well, and the filmmakers keep the science perfectly consistent.  Often, inconsistencies can ruin a science fiction film, but \\"Frequency\\" succeeds admirably in that department.  Dennis Quaid once again proves himself as one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood.  If you don't believe me, see \\"Far From Heaven.\\"  (2002)  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.<br />The DVD is full of the usual extras.  Nothing extraordinary, but all the standards are here.  The commentaries are interesting, and the deleted scenes are standard.  The standouts are the documentaries about the science of the film.  All in all, a solid DVD.
B000066NW0|3.0|Listen. i don't have a problem with avril, except she does not follow her image through, whats this CO wrote nonsense? who cares if she CO wrote the album, she should have bloody done it herself, i don't think at 16 that she should have oppourtunites like these, there are some really hard working musicians out there who are good ant punk, metal, pop whatever, and never see the light of day, just because shes thin and \\"pretty\\" she gets a deal? the world is mad.... i have listened to the whole album twice and all it is is watered down alanis. <br />it angers me to see all the kids thinking that avril is the first and only female punker, even though she is nothing but a pretty little girl who has had everything handed to her on a plate....well i for one have had enough of this manufactured punk of the week nonsense, just wait in 3 months time, there will be a half dozen avril clones in the charts, all claiming to be \\"punk\\" or \\"metal\\"singing about \\"real\\" issues, the only issue avril has had to deal with is with what colour she should paint her nails today......<br />once again if you like this sort of thing...great but just don't call it rock or punk, because it's not, if you want real punk there are plenty of real punk/rock bands out there, immerse yourself....
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is really beyond words.  Out of my entire music collection, and that amounts to more than one hundred CDs, I've never before had a CD where every single track was so distinct and engrossing.  The lyrics can induce extensive though, and the music, combined with the phenominal vocals are just above words.  This CD is going to be in my CD player for a very long time.
0440180295|4.0|The book is good to read in spare time. It is intertaining and has lots of changes. The author makes the reader change the thoughts in the book so often that it is simetimes hard to fallow. This book I would highly recomend to read.

B00005JKCH|4.0|I know that a number of my closest friends have complained about the acting.  They focus primarliy on the relationship between Parker (Maguire) and M.J. Watson (Kirsten D.).  I have to constantly remind them that this is a movie based on a comic book.  And these are two teenagers.  Kids are not smooth, and I found the naive behaviour authentic and realistic.  The movie is character and story driven and not just a special effects show.  Oh yeah, the effects are sweet.
0060254920|5.0|I think the Book, \\"where the wild things are\\" is an excellent children's story. It really shows you how foar a kids imagination can go. The kid in the story has different images then other kids. He doesn't really use people, he makes them up to what he thinks they look like. It helps kids get creative. Which tells them that they don't have to think of things that happen in real life. This story is very interesting and i think kids would enjoy reading it.
B000002JR8|5.0|Not just the heaviest album to debut at #1, but probably the heaviest album, ever.  It's nice when deserving music like this and Radiohead's &quot;Kid A&quot; can debut at the top.  Like Radiohead, Pantera were pushing the bounds of hard, fast music with this one, and they succeeded admirably.  It's hard to imagine that an album can get any heavier than this one, without degenerating into mush.  How does Vinnie Paul keep up that double bass onslaught on &quot;Strength Beyond Strength&quot; without collapsing.  I get worn out just listening to him.  Elsewhere, Pantera shows why they are one of the few bands in history who could never be accused of &quot;selling out.&quot;  After I listen to this CD, I always have to put on some nice mellow jazz to come back down from sledgehammer city.

B00008BXJF|5.0|34 years after their classic debut, 1969's &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King,&quot; the veteran prog-rockers King Crimson are still going strong. The band, comprising founder/guitarist Robert Fripp and Whoever The Heck Fripp Wants To Work With, are rock monsters that can easily shred wallpaper with full force. But they can also dip into dreamy psychedelic soundscapes, take off into the wild avant-garde, and, with the inclusion of singer/guitarist Adrian Belew since 1981, they also have a fine pop sensibility. Their latest album, &quot;The Power To Believe,&quot; gives you the best from all of Crimson's worlds, as Fripp &amp; company blend a modern sound with a great throwback feel to the band's experimental early days of &quot;In The Court Of...&quot;, &quot;Larks Tongues In Aspic,&quot; &quot;Red,&quot; etc. Diehard Crimheads everywhere should totally dig this disc.The band tear through incredible instrumentals like &quot;Level Five,&quot; &quot;Elektrik,&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; with tremendous intensity. &quot;Eyes Wide Open,&quot; the only real radio-friendly track on the album, is a terrific song---I'm sure it would do very well on modern rock radio stations. &quot;Facts Of Life,&quot; and the tongue-twistingly titled &quot;Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With,&quot; are great Crimson rockers. And the band ingeniously break up the title song into four separate sections that are spread throughout the album, each featuring a haunting vocal from Belew, and each one given a slightly different arrangement. It works wonderfully. Robert Fripp, now in his late-50's, still plays a lean, mean, slithering electric guitar. Adrian Belew's excellent vocals &amp; guitarwork also stand mightily tall. Trey Gunn brilliantly plays a monstrous Warr bass guitar, and drummer Pat Mastelotto is a pure powerhouse on his &quot;traps and buttons&quot; (according to the CD booklet). &quot;The Power To Believe&quot; is an astounding King Crimson album, one of theirbest. May this Crimson line-up rock for many more years to come. :-)
0786867973|5.0|I bought this book after seeing Nigella on tv. I read some of the reviews listed here and frankly, the people who claim their recipes did not turn out, something must have gone wrong - because every recipe I have made has turned out perfect and delicious and wonderful. I made the 'Chocolate Chestnut Cake', which was perfect. A light and wonderful cake, with a unique texture and not overly sweet taste. I have also made the 'Carrot Cake cupcakes' Which was a hit at the party I attended. Moist and flavorful - it was the only dessert at the party to completely disappear! The snickerdoodles were different from the American version, but simply delicious anyway. And her frostings and cake adornment suggestions are wonderful. She's not afraid to share short cuts and tips to make your life easier. She usually tells you exactly what she does and then tells you several things you could do if you don't want to do it her way. She is a wonderful cook and this book showcases some simple, and delicious recipes as well as her delightful sense of humor! I Highly recommend this book!
0679746048|5.0|I like this woman...I think I really like this woman.  Kaysen has given me a blueprint for my own memoir.  It's well written and it tends to give you her point of view on things, which is very, very good...&quot;normal people&quot; have a hard time understanding us strange ones, lol.

B000001FKY|5.0|I would seriously rate \\"Hysteria\\" with classic rock albums such as \\"Sticky Fingers\\", \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", \\"Kiss Alive!\\" and \\"Michael Bolton's Greatest Hits.\\" Seriously, this is GREAT stuff. From the groovy, space-agey \\"Woman\\" to the thumping drums and bass of \\"Rocket\\" to the mournful baying of \\"Animal\\" to the ultimatel depressing break-up song (\\"Love Bites\\") to the stompin' 80's classic \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" to the crpytically titled \\"Armageddon It\\" (what DOES that mean?) to my least favorite tracks, \\"Gods of War\\", \\"Don't Shoot Shotgun\\", \\"Run Riot\\" (they can't all be classics) to a return to form with the slow ballad \\"Hysteria\\", the catchy \\"Excitable\\" and the absolute greatest closer, \\"Love and Affecton.\\" \\"Hysteria\\" is just a great album that stands alone even compared to other Def classics such as \\"Pyromania.\\" This is GOOD stuff.
B00006FDCD|5.0|if youre burntout on all the same horror dvds u might have forgotten this 1 it has extras not seen in the tv version it to me is much scarier than the shining its about 5teens who fought a clown/demonic force the lived in the sewer in a small town called dairy adults couldnt see it and it went around causing children to vanish when the clown pops up youll jump seeing it on dvd is alot scarier than regular tv the colors of balloons for example stand out with an eerie red and everytime you see 1 youll get chills knowing the clowns nearby this movies long and u have to flip the disc over to continue everybody i know who has seen this agrees it is 1 of the better film versions of a king novel like stand by me and belongs in any king fans collection
B00000JPYQ|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD ALL OVER. NOT ONLY IS IT ONE OF THE BEST LIVE ALBUMS EVER (NEXT TO FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE) BUT IT IS A PIECE OF WORK THAT NEVER GETS OLD. I THROW THIS CD INTO THE CHANGER EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS AND LISTEN TO IT FOR A WEEK STRAIGHT AND AM ALWAYS AMAZED AT JUST HOW GREAT THAT THIS ALBUM IS. IT BLENDS EVERYTHING YOU EVER NEED TO HEAR IN AN ALBUM TO MAKE IT IRRESISTABLE. THIS ONE HAS IT ALL...GREAT SOUND, GREAT SOLOS, GREAT VOCALS, GREAT SONGS...IF I WAS TO PICK 10 ALBUMS TO HAVE WITH ME WHILE BEING STRANDED ON A DESERT ISLAND FOR 5 YEARS, THIS WOULD DEFINITELY BE ONE OF THEM!<BR>UFO REMAINS ONE OF THE GREAT UNDERRATED BANDS OF THEIR DAY...<BR>BEST TRACKS...ROCK BOTTOM, ONLY YOU CAN ROCK ME AND LIGHTS OUT
B00005JKED|3.0|wasnt the great movie everybody made it out to be hokey rapstar level acting but not even good for that genre denzel is the only decent actor and even he isnt that great in this beware u might fall asleep
B00003CXDG|1.0|This movie was mass-produced garbage with the only interesting aspect being the Matrix-derived fight scenes. Such effects also stolen for \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,\\" \\"The One\\" and other horrible asian cinematic nightmares. \\"Mission Impossible 2\\" shares their fate in being about as original as Milli Vanilli. The studio must have paid A LOT to get Sir Anthony Hopkins and Tom Cruise to appear in such generica. I cannot stress how poor and cliche every seen is in \\"M:I 2.\\" The Matrix-like fight scenes were both the best and worst of the movie. Best example of over-use of a recent cliche, and worst example of quality, accuracy, and originality. Even in the motorcycle scenes, Woo made no effort to hide that they drastically changed the tire design from one scene to the next. Sound like a small detail? Watch for it in the movie, it takes away credibility (not that Woo even makes an attempt to create any). Also, the Lisa Gerrard-like music (Gladiator) screamed cinematic pop cliche, and unoriginality. The quality of John Woo's work should have him making McDonald's commercials, rather than film. I doubt his commercials would even be effective though, as he lacks style, and even more so, taste.

B0000640VO|5.0|this movie is so wonderfuly written, and Audrey is so charismatic, sweet, and great.  she really makes you enjoy the movie
0783116934|5.0|Combining the harsh, frustrating and highly-complex realities of Soviet bureaucratic existence with the passionate desire and efforts of a highly intelligent, methodical, no-nonsense forensics-expert-turned-detective to stop a criminally insane indivdual from killing Mother Russia's children, Citizen X is an intellectual masterpiece in every respect. It is a true story. This film is not for everyone, however.  Because this superb film is not a conglomeration of high-speed auto chases, absurd explosions and fireballs, blood, guts and gore, and the inevitable single individual who saves mankind from the clutches of evil, the typical American will in all probability not like this film nor be able to fathom its tremendous significance.  Had this film been released through the normal Hollywood avenues, it probably would not have been a box office success for the reasons already mentioned. If, on the other hand, you are a person of reason and intellect who appreciates the struggles of human existence, you will enjoy this great HBO film.
0312305060|1.0|Reading the positive reviews makes me think there must be two totally different versions of this book released with the same cover as some sort of bizarre performance art stunt. The polar dichotomy of the reviews is another clue. I'd hate to live in a world with people who could praise the piece of garbage I read. My only hope for humanity is that they read some other book that looked the same on the cover as the tripe I read. I know that sounds mean, but it really was that mind numbingly awful and painful to read. I cannot fathom what would compel anyone to believe this book is anything more than the product of a self-indulgent creative writing instructor gone wild. Formulaic, contrived, painfully pretentious. It should be disposed of like toxic waste. Normally films loose the heart of a book. Let's hope that's the case with this thing, since the pompous writing style will be striped away, cleansing the thin storyline of the vile prose, it might make for a good movie after a good sanitization.
B000000WI4|3.0|John Lee Hooker provided some very basic but important music in his time. The Healer was a landmark album bringing John back to the fore with some good cuts which made up for his musical deficiencies. This album attempts to go down the same road but in general fails to achieve the same heights. The best tracks are 'Stripped me naked' with Carlos Santana and 'This is hip' with Ry Cooder. I prefer the original JLH cuts of the track on the album.
B000089RVX|5.0|If you haven't heard of Evanescence then you must live under-a rock.  This band is so amazing, and I'm sure their album Origin will be hard to find for fans of this awesome band.<br />This band knows how to rock and have some beautiful lyrics that grab a hold of you like a hook.<br />If you don't like this album, then you don't deserve to listen to good music.
6305696071|4.0|This marvelous feel-good movie made Julia Roberts a star.  After this i don't believe anyone has ever gotten billing above hers, as Richard Gere did here.  A sleeper among men, most of whom when asked will tell you Pretty Woman (or notting hill) are their favorite movies ever.  <br />That is certainly the case for me.  However, although i am getting used to the \\"added scenes\\" of the 10th anniversary version they do not add to the story and tend to \\"change the softness and gentle feeling\\" present in the original version.  <br />If you are shopping, i recommend the original version not the anniversary edition.  The other features of the dvd are not worth your money, and the two scenes having to do with the drug dealer and the rough side of \\"the life\\" were correctly excluded from the original and i wish they would have been here.
0767827694|5.0|Finally got this one on DVD after nearly wearing out my VHS copy. Sally Potter is one of the best directors and of course Tilda Swinton in the title role is mesmerizing in every way. Although a sharp departure from Virginia Woolf's source material, it retains the spirit and scope of the novel. Orlando's tranformation from man to woman half way through is a beautiful moment. Swinton proudly naked and observing herself in the mirror  looks directly into the camera and says \\"no difference really, just a different sex\\" it brilliantly blurs the line between what it means to be a man and woman. And when I say blur, I mean it in a good way. The gender, sexual orientation and race lines all need to be blurred until they disappear. Orland is a good salvo in that war.
0894803123|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS SO HELPFUL AND VERY DETAILED IN EXPLAINING HOW TO ACHIEVE THE MOST CREAMIEST ICE CREAM.  IT WAS EXCELLENT, AWESOME, EASY, AND I LOVE IT.  THIS ICE CREAM BOOK CONTAINS MANY FLAVORS THAT YOU DON'T USUALLY FIND IN STORES, AND I THINK THAT IS A GREAT THING!   SOME RECIPES CONTAIN VERY SMALL QUANTITIES OF INGREDIENTS, BUT...HAVE A GIANT TASTE!!  WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE WHO PURCHASES AN ICE CREAM MAKER.
B000063V8T|5.0|Season five in so many ways, is just an absolutely incredible season that is packed with stunning, thought provoking episodes.  As one watched these shows aired for the first time or is working their way through the DVD's, the quality of the writing and the actors comfort with their characters just becomes better and better by the episode.  The shows popularity is at an all time high during this season.  This is evidenced by the high quality of the scripts and shows that deal with so many issues brilliantly.  The one true oddity about the season is the lack of a \\"Q\\" episode due to the lack of a good script for the character.  Of key interest is the fact that more and more of Hollywood's big names were inquiring about and or getting spots on the show.  In my opinion, many of the series best episodes of its seven year run came from this season.<br />The following is a list with a synopsis of episodes that stand out among all of the great episodes of the season: <br />Redemption part II - The outstanding conclusion to season fours season ending cliffhanger.  Introducing the return of Denise Crosby in the role of Commander Sela, Tasha Yar's daughter; this brings us back to the events of \\"Yesterdays Enterprise.\\"  Here we are treated to some of the best Klingon scenes of the entire series.<br />Darmok - Paul Winfield, better known in the Star Trek universe from Star Trek II, makes a guest appearance.  This episode is quite intriguing in how Captain Picard and crew have to come up with a way to communicate with the Children of Tama, whose language is indecipherable, hopefully before Captain Picard gets killed.<br />Ensign Ro - The introduction of Michelle Forbes in the role of Ensign Ro Laren and the Bajoran people which will become quite prominent in Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  Her addition to the cast at least in a part time status, is an outstanding addition, even for a show that really didn't need it.<br />Disaster - A great episode in which we get to see Counselor Troi in charge and Worf assist in the birth of Chief O'Brien's and Keiko's daughter, which is extremely humorous.<br />The Game - This is an interesting episode about Riker meeting a woman who introduces him to an \\"addictive\\" game.  This episode also marks the first appearance of Ashley Judd as Ensign Robin Lefler.<br />Unification parts I &amp; II - In no uncertain terms, this episode is among the tops in the series whole seven year run.  Leonard Nimoy's appearance as Ambassador Spock and the intrigue involved is gripping to say the least.  The conversation between Spock and Data is highly enlightening into both characters.<br />Ethics - This episode stands out because of its Klingon mythology aspect, bringing even further along in how the Klingon culture deals with issues, such as this one, suicide due to injury.<br />Cause and Effect - I just thoroughly enjoy how this episode was done.  The Enterprise is caught in a causality loop.  This causes them to repeat several days, over and over again, always ending in disaster until they figure out a way to stop it.  Kelsey Grammer makes a brief but endearing guest appearance.<br />The First Duty - The Enterprise is home at earth, with Captain Picard planning on giving the commencement speech for Starfleet Academy.  Wesley Crusher makes an appearance and he's part of Nova Squadron which is an Academy flying team.  They've had an accident and there is an investigation.  This episode has some of the best conflict between the characters out of the entire series.  In this episode, we also finally get to see what the Academy looks like and meet Boothby, played by Ray Walston.<br />The Perfect Mate - This episode truly stands out among the shows of the entire series.  Newcomer Famke Janssen appears a Kamala.  She is a Metamorph, a woman who is empathic and in the final stages of her \\"maturing\\" process bonds perfectly with the man she meets when she comes out of stasis.  Hers and Patrick Stewart's performance are exceptional!<br />The Next Phase - This is a great Ro Laren and LaForge episode that deals with what is initially thought of as their deaths.  This show is very ingeniously written!<br />The Inner Light - This episode is by far the best of the season and among the top five of the entire series!  Patrick Stewart's performance is heartfelt and touching and should've won him many awards!  The Enterprise encounters an alien probe which \\"attaches\\" itself to him and he then lives a lifetime in the span of twenty five minutes.  This is a beautiful episode which bears many viewings!<br />Time's Arrow part I - The season ending cliffhanger.  While not being one of the best cliffhangers of the series, this one is still quite interesting as the crew deals with time travel and Guinan takes a prominent position in the script.  Jerry Hardin's performance as Samuel Clemens is marvelous!<br />Special Features:<br />Mission Overview:  Year Five<BR>Departmental Briefing:  Year Five, Production &amp; Visual Effects<BR>Memorable Missions:  Year Five<BR>A Tribute to Gene Roddenberry - This special feature above all others, offsets the costs of the DVD sets as it is priceless, especially the surprise ending!<br />Also included:<br />A separate mini-CD containing some great Star Trek Nemesis wallpapers, screensavers and a theatrical trailer.<br />A Season Five Bonus Featurette containing a great \\"Intergalactic Guest Stars\\" clip that is enlightening!  Also included is \\"Alien Speak\\" which is a wonderful clip about how some of the alien writings and speech came about!  {ssintrepid}<br />Entire episode list:<br />Redemption Part II<BR>Darmok<BR>Ensign Ro<BR>Silicon Avatar<BR>Disaster<BR>The Game<BR>Unification Part I<BR>Unification Part II<BR>A Matter of Time<BR>New Ground<BR>Hero Worship<BR>Violations<BR>The Masterpiece Society<BR>Conundrum<BR>Power Play<BR>Ethics<BR>The Outcast<BR>Cause and Effect<BR>The First Duty<BR>Cost of Living<BR>The Perfect Mate<BR>Imaginary Friend<BR>I, Borg<BR>The Next Phase<BR>TheInner Light<BR>Time's Arrow Part I
B00006690G|5.0|whats up....All I can say is this CD is the total package....Em fills in the gaps (if any) that he left open on the past 2 CD's...where the Slim Shady LP was fun and games and the Marshall Mathers LP was pure emotion and venting. This one is everything. Starts out with his views on the Government and his critics moves on to alot of subjects love,family,friends,..etc.....I have always connected with Em because his music is so honest and sometimes when you go through something that is hard instead of snaping he can mellow you out and give you another way to vent ,also being a father and having went through a rocky relationship, its cool to see how Em is still the model father after all hes been through.....This CD is defenatly a must for any CD collection. ....
B000070WJE|5.0|There has never been an artist I've been drawn to so much as Mr. RW. In the past with other artists, I've expected to appreciate a few if not a couple of songs on an entire CD...but, with each and every CD/DVD I purchase of RW's I find that there is something wonderful and a bit of surprise on each track. Sure, Escapology is a departure from some of his previous works but, it is an absolute joy to witness Robbie reveal yet another faucet of himself and his talent.  Special favorites are: Feel, Come Undone, Me and My Monkey, Nan's, Sexed-Up...all are nothing short of BRILLIANT!)... I'm a hopelessly devoted fan...
B000006FYP|2.0|I know when you watch a movie,you're supposed to temporarily suspend belief, but how in the world did Harvey Dent turn from Billy Dee Williams Jr in the first Batman movie to Tommy Lee Jones in this Batman movie. It would've been interesting to see Billie Dee as Two-Face, just like Michael Clarke Duncan played the Kingpin in the Daredevil movie.<br />One Last Thing--I hate to admit,but Schumacher had to play these Batman movies light,flaky and campy as long ws Robin was in them.  In the comics and cartoons, Batman's character is so dark grim and moody, Robin has to make \\"light\\" of everything to ease the tension and make Batman not look [so uptight]! Without Robin, you can make Batmn psychologically grim, moody, and completely obsessed with fighting crime! That still doesnt excuse Schumacher from ruining Batman the way Adam West and Burt Ward did.....
0066214122|1.0|Michael Crichton must have spent at least a few days reading some rudimentary a-life papers or introductory books before writing this book (if he properly understood those in the bibliography, then his ability to grasp the nature of scientific development must have been the problem).<br />He shows a rudimentary grasp of the ideas behind the technology, but is inept at creating believable and relevant projections of the implications of it. I have no beef with the danger of rogue a-life nanobots, but the manner of development and premises presented in this book are pretty shaky. This smells like sci-fi, but at best is science fantasy.<br />The language register is chatty and in part inane, with many cliche`s thrown in for good measure. Generally his attempts to flesh out or make his characters more life-like fall pretty flat.<br />Note to authors: don't include source code in your writing unless you know what you're doing (or find some clued-up teenager who does) - the 2 examples in this novelette are a joke.<br />This is a fascinating area of research, pity about the way the topic was handled, though.
1567184855|4.0|Although some of it I found hard to visualize or beleive, it really gave me a lot to think about.  In addition to other books i've read, I have gathered a huge amount of insight into past lives, and life after death.  Much of this book has given me the ability to not fear death.
6305508550|5.0|This movie's tongue-in cheek view of the office experience - rather the office tedium is not only dead on, but magnifies every bad situation you've had at work and then lets the protagonists get back at the bosses, consultants and all the other nutjobs you have to endure as co-workers. If you've never worked in the Dante's ring level referred to as cubicle, count your blessings, maybe you won't relate.  However, if you have, don't miss out on watching someone else suffer at it, while you die laughing!
1400034779|5.0|Alexander McCall Smith has done it again with &quot;The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. The protagonist Precious is, well, precious.  A wonderful character!  The humor displayed in this book cannot be surpassed.  I really love the locale and characters in this book. A fun read you will not want to put down.  This one I highly recommend.
B00005JLSC|2.0|The story of this movie is actually talking about the murder case of the actress but the film maker tried to package the movie with less boring method by adding music, singing and some jokes to it. I find that it is just another ordinary movie if the story of the movie concentrated on the trials of the murder case of the actress. These oridinary movie could be easily found in serial dramas(Cops dramas) in any part of the world.
B00005YW4H|5.0|to the negative reviewers - grouchy reviewer and \\"marketing machine\\" - who complain of Norah being over-hyped, etc...  I say, get over it... and do something useful with  your life....a huge number of people seem to like Norah's music - why does that bother you so much? she can't be responsible for the music industry's issues - e.g., she's not the one who calls her music \\"jazz\\" - so why try to hold her accountable!  if you're fed up with the tastes of the rest of us, that's your issue, not ours, and certainly not Norah's.  <br />personally I find her music very refreshing - it's simple, yet it speaks volumes, Norah seems to sing from the heart.  I started listening to her before the grammies, with no knowledge of a big marketing machine, or who her father is, and frankly I could care less. I knew that I had to have this CD within the first few bars.    Just because her music doesn't speak to you yet happens to be very popular is no reason to trash it or her.<BR>To be truthful, I was a little surprised at the degree to which so many people seem to be able to appreciate her music. Perhaps if you'd just open your heart and really listen - instead of worrying about her father, or her awards, or how she looks, you might enjoy the music as well.  But if, not, it's just not that big a deal, there is plenty of other music out there for you to enjoy!<br />with apologies to groucho marx and woody allen:<br />those who can, do; those who can't, teach; and those who can't teach, criticize!<br />if you're capable of doing anything - not necessarily music, but anything at all - that is even half as good as what Norah has done here, then perhaps you'd be better off spending your time doing that, I know that the rest of us would be better off if you did!<br />enjoy
B00006AFUR|5.0|The first time I ever heard 30 Seconds to Mars was in my friend's car one day when we were going to lunch, and as soon as she told me who it was I couldn't get them off my mind and I've loved them ever since. I got their CD and I listen to it nearly everyday because they have a unique sound, it's not the same as the other sounds on the radio today, so if you like unique, fun music, I can't think of a better band for you! Some of the songs, such as Buddha for Mary, Capricorn [a brand new name] and Edge of The Earth get stuck in your head, but it's a good thing!
