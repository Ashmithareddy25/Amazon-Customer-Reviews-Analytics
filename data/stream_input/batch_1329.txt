B0054JZC6E|3.0|lots of variety when it comes to games, but some are a little cheesy. for the most part, I enjoy this app.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Not a replacement for full size ceramic, carbide, and diamond based sharpeners. That said, works great considering price point, durability, and of course, portability.
B0002BO05S|5.0|excellent movie watch for yourself if have faith in God and Jesus Christ. WATCHED IT AS A TEENAGER AND SHED A TEAR THEN AND NOW
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I just downloaded it yesterday, it looks good so far. some of the games look like they wont hold you for long as they don't have much room to grow, but then you just switch to the next one!
B0036TGSIK|4.0|This is a fun and sweet movie. Emma Stone plays a High School kid with somewhat eccentric but loving parents, who are also fun to see and gets caught up in what many would say is something silly. For a High School kid it also can be socially destructive but in the end teaches a moral lesson. This movie is pleasant to watch and fun as well. Emma does a good job at showing humor and a dramatic side as well. She is always a pleasure to watch and brings life to any character she portrays.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift. Very enjoyable movie. If you ever watched the old Planet of the Apes series, you'll enjoy this prequel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game. its the best game i have ever played. its a great game instead of half of the games that i have.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I love this app...but I just wish that I was able to use it offline at church. but because it is free I cannot complain too much
B0054JZC6E|5.0|games are simply. its very time consuming. very cool for long rides or just to kill boredom. thank you. :)
B00006RINF|3.0|I generally like very much atmospheric metal. Well in this album we have also female vocals (which are very sutable and good). They remind me The Gathering (Though i believe The Gathering is much better than them). Anyway, its a good album, not to go crazy for but an album betwwen its just ok and i like it. FRom what i have been told this is the most commercial album they have ever released. Well its sound a little bit more approapiate to the every day fans. If you like atmospheric metal then you will like this album. But its not as good as their first Ep which i believe it is their best work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|beat the games. get loot.buy more games. get more loot. games like snake and sadoku and car racing pretty sweet .
032147404X|4.0|I got into photography in the last two years and did a lot of research before purchasing a camera and lenses. After that, I wanted to learn how to shoot in full manual, but this book was over my head at the time. I had also purchased [[ASIN:0817439390 Understanding Exposure, 3rd Edition: How to Shoot Great Photographs with Any Camera]] and that book was incredible. It got me far enough along to understand the concepts in this book. Granted, some of what is said in both books is very similar, but they teach you in different ways.  The book explains everything, but it takes the approach of the author explaining to you what settings he would use to shoot the scenes in question. He covers ISO, shutter speed, white balance, about everything. This approach had me at first, but once you understand the camera settings things become clearer.  While I would not recommend this book for an absolute beginner, I would recommend it to those who have at least a basic understanding of how shutter speed, ISO, and your aperture work together.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Awesome cover! I highly recommend it. We have had ours now for one month and we love it. The cover is much nicer than I expected especially considering the price. My son has dropped the fire a couple times with this cover on it and the kindle was as good as new. Highly recommend.
0817439390|5.0|When I purchased my first digital camera, a Rebel T2i, I picked up this book to learn how to shoot in manual and produce great, creative photos. The book met and exceeded my expectations. After reading through it just once, I understood the core concepts of shutter speed, ISO, and aperture and how they affect an image. After a second read-through, I was shooting creative photographs of things like water and fire.  I would absolutely recommend this book for anybody interested in shooting good photos that is new to the field.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love every game!  love that I have to gain point to unlock more games!  have been playing for several week and not a moment of boredom!  install and enjoy!
1451627289|4.0|I had trouble getting into this book in the first 150 pages. I kept putting it down, not sure if I wanted to finish. But once I got to about page 200 I couldn't put the book down. So much to think about and so many great characters. I have always loved Stephen King's books, and while this is a departure from the horror genre, it's well-written and has left me thinking about the characters and the repercussions of changing the past long after I finished the last page.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun and addicting but I need more mystery bombs for free & more opportunities  for golden eggs to give this app 5 stars.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Purchased as a gift for our Daughter in Law.  We hadn't seen it yet, but was assured that it was a must-have movie.   We have since seen it. and I am very glad we purchased it as a gift. If you haven't seen it yet, at least rent it...you'll wish you had just gone ahead and bought a copy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app! Fun to use winning game option when short on time. Enjoy wins  on random mode. Nice to have clue icon though sometimes the clue is not a clue,  it's the end of the game.
B0009IW88A|5.0|One of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to and there have been many of them. It's moving, dark, haunting, epic. It goes perfectly well with the film and is a pleasure to listen to on its own.

B005CA4SQK|5.0|Love this. Great series will get the rest as soon as there released. It is great for adults would not recommend for kids.  The zombies are more black and white old school which I find refreshing.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of the most fun and addictive games for any smartphone. Om Nom is an adorable monster that will give you a smile you will never forget when you finish your puzzles. The game runs perfectly on my Verizon Incredible. The physics and graphics are guaranteed to entertain. This will be the best $.99 you've ever spent. Enjoy!
0439023521|5.0|great fast paced dystopian novel.  Violent, but not unbearably violent if you are squeamish.  More disturbing in the way violence is normalized than gory.
B0070TDERU|5.0|Series two of Downton Abbey is as good as the first. It picks up in Nov of 1916 where series one ended. The entire series concludes in Dec of 1919--and already there is production for series 3, a continuation but in the 1920s. There are plenty of cast members back so it is advisable to watch the first prior to the second, but not mandatory for entertainment. You will be as enthralled as the true series of comparison, the amazing dramatization of Brideshead Revisited. Both are period perfection, a look at British life in the war years, some intense suspense and mystery mixed with bits of serenity and romance. It's the WWI years with all the good and the bad, but the acting and writing make it all seem good somehow, at least from an entertainment point of view.<br /><br />I'd strongly recommend the full series, even the past series one, and of course I'll be purchasing Series Three as soon as it is available.
0307959856|3.0|As a fan of both Jane Austen and P.D. James, I expected better than this.  There were many times in this book when I just wanted to stop reading.  Unlike Jane Austen, and unlike herself in every other book of hers that I've read, P.D. James seemed to have a difficult time keeping this story moving.  The characters were not very thoroughly fleshed out, and in fact, seemed rather one-dimensional, unlike the characters in her other works.  Also, nothing really happens in this book.  I was expecting a murder mystery, with clues and the involvement of people at Pemberley, but they are little more than peripheral witnesses to events.  Both Stephanie Barron and Elizabeth Alston have done a better job breathing new life into Jane Austen or her characters and continuing their story.  This was not up to the standard I have come to expect from P.D. James.  I was very disappointed, and unlike her other books, cannot see myself ever reading this one again.

B005HV6Y5W|4.0|\\"The Tree of Life\\" is Terrence Malick's comment on two different approaches to living and understanding life, that of natural determinism versus that of acceptance or grace, not just in human life but on a universal scale. It's no wonder the film's reach exceeds its grasp. Jack (Sean Penn) is a successful architect who is reminded of his childhood and the death of his younger brother when he sees a tree being planted near his office. He thinks back to his childhood in post-War Waco, Texas, with his two brothers, his stern, overcritical father (Brad Pitt), and empathetic mother (Jessica Chastain). When Jack reached puberty, he often clashed with his father, who seemed to take out his dissatisfaction with his own life on his boys.<br /><br />We don't only see Jack's memories, but also what came before him -his parents' relationship, prehistoric earth, where we observe some interesting dinosaur interactions, and the creation of the universe. These seem to include Jack's mother's rumination on the meaning of life after she loses her son, as well. The ideas presented are, in a sense, an omnipresent perspective, channeled through these people. Many images are of water, fire, landscapes, and stellar phenomena. I lost patience with one extended abstract sequence that I felt was not connected to the human story effectively. But the film eventually returns to a loose narrative of Jack's childhood.<br /><br />\\"The Tree of Life\\" is highly cinematic, which I appreciated. Dialogue is spare. The story is told through shots, not scenes. Images are beautiful and strong. And Brad Pitt gives a wonderful performance. I'm a huge fan of the cinematic, of films that are films, not theatrical productions, of images rather than dialogue, reminiscent of the silent era. So I found a lot to like. On the other hand, the film is unnecessarily long. In some instances, Malick simply overdoes the imagery. His thematic reach exceeds its grasp, sometimes conspicuously so. I would cut a half-hour off of it, but Terrence Malick was never in a hurry to get through a film. It's flawed. If you like Terrence Malick's work, I recommend it. But I'm not sure what the rest of the audience will make of it.Malick was never in a hurry to get through a film. It's flawed. If you like Terrence Malick's work, I recommend it.

B006QS0KO6|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />Of course, Stevensons's novella \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" (hereafter Jekyll/Hyde) has bestowed upon the world a shorthand phrase acknowledging human psychological duality. However, many of us perfunctorily conclude that the phrase \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" means we are 50% \\"good\\" and 50% \\"evil\\".  Stevenson pessimistically and tragically suggests that it is not so; instead, humans are disproportionately and naturally predisposed towards evil and that \\"goodness\\" ia a superficial barrier, or at best a superhuman assertion of will.<br /><br />At \\"Jekyll/Hyde\\"'s conclusion, where Jekyll's posthumous letter explains not only the mystery of the diabolical Hyde but summarizes Jekyll's life, the doctor admits that his reputation for charity and compassion was indeed hard-won.  From the beginning, it was a strenuous effort for Jekyll to be studious, composed, and dignified.  He always had a latent urge to be unrestrained, irreverent, and even dissolute, and even secretly indulged these shocking appetites.  Jekyll thought his potion could separate this terrible, embarrassing part of him and allow his \\"true\\" good nature to prosper without hindrance.  Eventually and horrifically, Jekyll learns that a psychological house divided against itself cannot stand.  In other words, \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" are inextricably linked.<br /><br />Furthermore, the linkage is not really a balanced yin and yang.  When Hyde is unleashed, he kills without remorse, without his inner Jekyll fighting to control him.  Jekyll is nothing more than a superficial \\"refuge\\" from justice.  In contrast, Jekyll finds that his inner Hyde IS fighting to control him.  Jekyll eventually finds out and admits that is because Jekyll as Jekyll is not purely \\"good\\", but actually a mixture of good and evil.  As Hyde, he IS purely evil.  Jekyll was overmatched by Hyde from the start.<br /><br />Stevenson sprinkles other clues about our natural evil nature.  When Jekyll views himself after the transformation, he is not appalled, at least at first.  Instead, he describes himself as freer, younger, lighter.  Yes, Hyde is initially dwarfish, but only because of long \\"captivity\\".  With each appearance, Hyde becomes more monstrous, but Jekyll does little to check his alter ego other than to register concern and displeasure and even to pretend that he, Jekyll, is not truly responsible.  True, after Hyde murders Sir Danvers Carew, Jekyll asserts his will and abstains from being Hyde for a while.  But the evil genie cannot be bottled long.  Eventually, Hyde takes over, or to be more precise, the true Jekyll emerges, although Jekyll continues the feeble pretense that \\"Hyde is responsible, not me!!!\\"<br /><br />Remember that Dr. Jekyll's skeptical colleague Dr. Lanyon witnessed Hyde's final, fitful transformation back to Jekyll.  The shock killed him.  The implication is that the realization that all humans contain this evil core was too much to bear.  For most of us, this realization is almost too much to bear, but despite the evil odds against us, we struggle to keep our better natures alive.n, he is not appalled, at least at first.

B006VA4E3C|3.0|Musically, it has been a long while since I have heard any brilliant music from Seal. Lately, hearing about his divorce from supermodel Heidi Klum was really a massive shocker. I was really blown away with the news that he was losing his marriage. Musically, he also had shown not much in the way of good music. His last full-length record Commitment fell a bit short of expectations commercially and professionally. But I have been eager to hear what rabbit he would pull out of his hat, despite whatever heartbreak he was dealing with. Musically, he decided to make a sequel of what he made big with his 2008 covers record Soul. Now his sequel has been finally released, but the question is that are the covers worth Seal's own. Well yes and no.<br /><br />Seal's latest album Soul 2, is the sequel from his 2008 album Soul, which had some good covers flows about the same through his voice, with some renditions of R&B and Soul classics feeling mixed, while others he has made a noble standard his own. The collection of songs could've brought more from departed soul greats to give them a better memory like Love T.K.O. which was more driven from the late Teddy Pendergrass and Love Won't Let Me Wait where Luther Vandross did a much more intimate version of that cover he made of Major Harris's standard. There are some songs worth hearing that Seal does call his own like his rendition of Al Green's Let's Stay Together, and a more orchestrated version of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On that would've made Gaye very proud. The deluxe version also includes a few extras as well including a good cover of The Isley Brothers' hit For The Love Of You to name one of the two. Some of the songs work well for Seal, yet I have honestly felt that some worked better from others from a long while ago.<br /><br />All in all, with what Seal is going through right now with his divorce, I do wish him the best of luck. Yet for Soul 2, I have wanted to hear a bit more from him soulfully in his voice than what was showcased in the songs. I do hope he comes out with better songs to call his own. It has not been there from Seal in quite awhile in his songs. He did have a lot of good music back in the 90's and the early 2000 decade, but not lately. As for Soul 2, it isn't a bad record but I was hoping for more soul to drive from the soul.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C+<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Mastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+the songs.

1936041111|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />Because the subtitle of Mary Shelley's atmospheric, gothic tale is \\"The Modern Prometheus\\", \\"Frankenstein\\" has traditionally been interpreted as a cautionary tale against seeking forbidden knowledge or \\"Tampering in God's Domain\\".  Nonsense.  In Greek mythology, the Titan Prometheus defied Zeus's edict against giving mankind fire.  Yes, he did suffer Olympian torment by being bound to a rock and suffering an eagle's daily ritual of snacking on his liver.  However, Prometheus's defiance DID benefit mankind, and Prometheus's liver grew back each night.  Furthermore, during his legendary twelve tasks, Hercules killed the eagle and released Prometheus from his ordeal.  Tampering in a god's domain ultimately paid off.<br /><br />Tampering in God's domain has usually benefitted mankind in reality as well.  If we didn't, we'd still be living naked in caves and be vulnerable to severe weather changes and predation. Yes, but one might say that Victor's creation or reanimation of life inappropriately encroached on a function exclusively in God's job description.  Nonsense again.  Humans create life all the time by having sex.  So no, Victor's true transgression was not seeking the amelioration of the human condition by creating life.  Instead, his true sin was not taking responsibility for the life he created.<br /><br />Seeking knowledge about the world in itself is not wrong.  Doing so selfishly and without concern for the consequences definitely IS wrong.  To paraphrase Ian Malcolm's observation in the movie \\"Jurassic Park\\", sometimes scientists are so engrossed in finding out whether they can make a discovery, they neglect to consider how to, or whether they should, put it to \\"good use\\".  Victor does exactly that.  There is no sense in \\"Frankenstein\\" as to what benefit Victor will put his resurrection abilities.  There is a sense that Victor wants to create life just so he can say he can.  He is heedless.  Instead of making a being of normal human proportions and appearance, Victor just rushes ahead to make an unsightly giant just because the bodily parts are easier to manipulate.  When he succeeds, Victor flees in disgust and terror from the creature.  When he returns to the lab to find the creature gone, Victor rejoices.<br /><br />As a result of his abandonment by his errant \\"father\\", the creature has to stumble through a second life alone through trial and error.  His infant-like sensations gradually get clearer and he adapts.  At least \\"deadbeat dad\\" Victor gave the creature one advantage (however unlikely) besides physical strength; an apparently brilliant, perceptive brain.  The creature doesn't grunt inarticulately for long.  As he seeks invisible shelter with the DeLacey family, the creature succeeds in becoming not only literate, but also quite eloquent.  Nevertheless, no matter where he goes, or whatever good deeds he performs, humanity shuns the creature for its ugliness.  This undeserved isolation inexorably drives the creature to acts of envious spite, deceit, and murder.<br /><br />I believe that despite his descent into malignancy, the creature largely maintains the reader's sympathy because as he himself says, \\"I am malicious because I am miserable\\".  We are wont to blame Victor as the ultimate source of the havoc the creature wreaks.  And yet, despite his anguish, the creature does not regress into a mindless killing id.  He is introspective and remorseful for all the deaths he directly or indirectly causes.  If only the creature had encountered Victor before his killing rampage, we feel, his philosophical reasoning would have convinced Victor to rehabilitate his creature and facilitate his entry into society. Alas, the creature also could have, but also fails to take responsibility for his actions and thus compounds his misery.  The only thing that redeems the creature in our eyes is that he is at least aware of his failure to take responsibility, and will at leastmake some amends by presumably immolating himself so he doesn't kill any more.  Victor, to the end on his deathbed on Captain Walton's sailing vessel in the Arctic, never does and even feels he has behaved honorably through life!<br /><br />Being irresponsible can make anyone a monster, some (Victor) more than others (the creature).so he doesn't kill any more.  Victor, to the end on his deathbed on Captain Walton's sailing vessel in the Arctic, never does and even feels he has behaved honorably through life!  Being irresponsible can make anyone a monster, some (Victor) more than others (the creature).
B005VTGB0S|1.0|Here is a perfect example of trying to make something functional for more than one product that fails.  In essence, there is nothing wrong in trying to do that to increase sales and capture more of the market, however, if it goes wrong, as it does in this case, it should be avoided at all costs.<br /><br />First and foremost, I do not trust this case to hold my iPad2 securely at all.  It has 4 velcro strips that open and hold the corners of the tablet.  Well, I've got my iPad2 in there now and can tell you that the strips barely cover the corners of the device.<br /><br />Secondly, the positioning of the straps covers the sleep button making it a nightmare to turn off.  Since there is no magnetic off device built in (at least that I've detected) to cover the power button with a strap is inexcusable.  How in the world did that make it past R&D, testing and marketing???  How, how, how?!<br /><br />Third.  While not a big deal to me personally, as some have said, there is no camera hole in the back.  I don't use my iPad as a camera or video camera so that isn't a killer for me, but for those that do, another annoyance.<br /><br />Fourth.  It's hard to describe, but this case just feels cheap to me.  Almost like a hard cardboard product.  Personal preference I'm sure, but something doesn't feel right.<br /><br />The one thing I like (hence the one star) is the multi-angle stand function.  Other cases should take note of this design and jump on board.<br /><br />I have written nearly 500 reviews and would venture to say I've only given 1 star to less than 10 of the products I've reviewed.  So when I give something 1 star, in my opinion, it really deserves it.

B004HO6HWA|4.0|I got this DVD based upon a review by Jason here on Amazon, and as has been true so far, I continue to trust what Jason says.  This film is worth watching, and I like subtle differences from the Charles Bronson / Jan Michael Vincent version in 1972.  This 2011 remake with Donald Sutherland has it's own charm, and I am impressed enough by this film that I'm glad I bought my own copy.

B004EPYZXU|4.0|The film was actually better than I feared it was going to be (after reading all of the negative reviews and such) but I found it pretty authentic in it's portrayal of a moon mission gone wrong (granted, I've never done any serious studying of any actual moon mission films, so enthusiasts of moon mission imagery will probably be able to pick this thing apart till the cows come home, but for the average viewer, I found it pretty real, I mean, at least the space suits didn't look like someone's mom had sewn them together with some bed sheets, which is always a plus in my book).<br /><br />But  that being said, this is not a film for people looking for a non-stop action rush, this is a slower burn type of film, in the same vain as the recent, Paranormal Activity movies, but in space.<br /><br />So if you like stuff to do with the moon landings and have a thing for revisionist history/conspiracy theories, then this film is your cup of tea (or, Tang, as it were, and if you didn't get that reference, then you're not as big a moon mission aficionado as you may have thought you were before you started to read this review '<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** (go and watch the film, then come back and read this as I think you'll find it quite interestingly compelling)<br /><br />Okay, so here's my BIG overall problem with this film (and correct me if I'm wrong here) but what we're watching is supposedly, \\"Found Footage\\" taken during this ill fated mission, film footage, not video sent back to mission control on earth, cameras with actual film cartridges in them that have to be developed before they can be run through a projector to be watched (keeping in mind that this was way before digital camera technology came into existence).<br /><br />So here's my problem; how, if the film from the moon cameras (you know, the ones showing Ben meandering about the moon's surface trying to avoid his demented colleague and the rock spider/crab creatures, in his mad attempt to reach the Russian space ship and escape the lunar horror of it all) is still actually in the cameras (as we never see Ben getting the film from them, during his frantic flight for survival) and then what film Ben did manage to bring with him in the Russian space craft was blown up when the Russian craft and the moon obiter crashed, then how are we watching any of this footage???<br /><br />Let's see, we have some footage stranded on the moon, and the rest has been atomized in the collision between the two ships in lunar orbit, and even if, let's say for the sake of argument, that another mission went back to the moon, better prepared to fight off the, \\"Moon Mites\\", then all that they would have is the stuff taken on the moon's surface and nothing taken from inside the space ships because that has been lost in the collision of the two ships in orbit.<br /><br />So there you have the BIGGEST deterrent to the possible believability of this movie, the one thing that they shot themselves in the foot with, the lack of any explanation as to how any surviving footage could have, well, made it's way back to earth to be, \\"Leaked\\" to the internet in the first place (had they been using video cameras everywhere that sent video images and sound, back to mission control then sure, this would have been plausible, but the fact that at one point Ben is gathering up film cartages to be taken back to earth (before everything went, \\"Loopy\\") and we never see him bring said film cartridges to the Russian ship at the end (and like I mentioned, even if he had, the ship collides with the lunar orbiter in orbit around the moon) so anyway you slice it, the film could never have made it back to Earth.<br /><br />Also, really, rock creatures, hasn't that been done to death, but I guess that is the only way they could try and add a, \\"Chill\\" factor to the films end by indicating that lots of moon rocks have made their way to earth during the previous 17 Apollo missions and could in fact be rock creatures as well(but the stupid flaw in this theory is that it is indicated that the rocks that are these creatures, are from a recent impact site, which would indicate that the rock creatures were not indigenous to the moon but travelled there on this meteor or asteroid piece of space junk, which would also mean that they weren't present during the other 17 Apollo missions if this impact site was recent).are these creatures, are from a recent impact site, which would indicate that the rock creatures were not indigenous to the moon but travelled there on this meteor or asteroid piece of space junk, which would also mean that they weren't present during the other 17 Apollo missions if this impact site was recent).
0061537969|5.0|We can never live up to what our dogs think of us.  They are never disappointed in us, never ashamed of us.  We never fail in their eyes.  And the only thing they really ask of us is the bond between them and us.  This is a story told by a dog, Enzo, who wants to become human, and about his human, Denny.  Denny is a race car driver, earning his own way up through the ranks.  He'll have to earn his way through more than just the dangers and competitions of racing, though -- he'll have to persevere through the illness of his wife, Eve, and through the consequences of that for their daughter, Zoe.  Enzo longs to be human, not in a Pinocchio sort of a way, but in the way of someone schooled in beliefs of reincarnation, a dog wanting to earn his way to reincarnation as a human.  He wishes he had thumbs, and he wishes his tongue were short and dexterous instead of long and slobbery.  Otherwise, he has the mind of a human, and the kind of understanding of human aspirations and relationships that any of us would love to have.  He believes that by conquering his dog-ness he can, by the end of his life, earn his way to what he regards as the next step up, to become human.  Denny and Enzo help each other along the way.  Enzo studies and admires Denny.  Racing is everything to Enzo.  He doesn't just enjoy it, he learns the lessons of life in the lessons of racing, drawn from what he sees in Denny's driving and in what Denny tells him.  Mostly, he learns, \\"The car goes where the eyes go.\\"  Achievement follows hope.  Enzo's aspiration to be human is his compass.  Sometimes Denny leads the way, but sometimes Enzo leads the way for Denny.  Enzo wants more than anything else to stand with Denny, on two feet, shaking Denny's hand and introducing himself.  He wants it so badly that in death, there's no real sting, only the promise of following and living in Denny's footsteps.

B005GFPZYK|1.0|First, the writing.  This book reads as though the subject sat down with the \\"co-author\\" and bs'd over beers a couple of times and then the \\"co-author\\" went back and wrote up what he remembered.  It's boring where it's not incoherent.  As an example, in the middle of some moderately boring story what little momentum there is slams to a complete halt while the authors go on for a lengthy paragraph (or two?) to explain that all weapons of a certain class and lineage are referred to as M-60s whether or not they are actual M-60s.  Second, I found the subject's views repugnant.  For example, in the preface he talks about how his first kill is a woman with a grenade.  Obviously the woman needed to be killed to protect the soldiers, but the subject goes further in his justification and characterizes her as \\"evil\\".  Several times the subject refers to anyone opposing him as evil.  You cannot win a war if you do not understand your enemy's needs and desires.  You cannot understand your enemy if you simply write them off as evil.  In guerrilla wars in particular, when it's hard to tell friendly citizens from opposing citizens, this lack of willingness to understand the enemy can lead to lack of ability to understand your allies.  Moreover, at one point the subject reports that he was eager to get into battle to start killing people.  This is not the attitude of a war hero, this is the attitude of a mass murderer.  A war hero must accept that killing and risking death are part of what he signed up to do. When they face these duties not reluctantly but eagerly, they are simply sociopaths who have made a good career choice.

B004F9OV5C|3.0|This book is not in the least credible, but it's fun to read.  One must suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride.  Yes, there are the stereotypes, the old hippy living on a houseboat, the wastrel brother-in-law, etc, and at each step the solutions to the main character's problems come more than a little too conveniently.<br /><br />There are some wapping factual errors in the book, the most egregious being that Boyd doesn't know what a cloud chamber is and has his protagonist, a climatologist, using one for cloud-seeding experiments! In addition, Boyd confuses kidney disease with hepatitis, and retrovirals with antiretrovirals.<br /><br />All that being said, it's a great book for reading an a plane. I read it through and enjoyed it despite the utter silliness of it.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|James Bond in both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace is almost macabre in the way he is always covered in someone else's blood, the way blood often oozes from opened cuts on his face and his hands with his not caring in the least that it does. He's the right degree of handsome--or not--for the masses who are \\"anti\\" good-looking leading men.  But for me, Bond's greatest attributes are that he is vulnerable and that emotionally, he bleeds, in ways so subtle, they're almost subliminal.  His emotions surface  and then are  swallowed  up, lost, in the next frantic chase, fight or mind game.  But during their surfacing, they are so intense that they linger in the air like invisible tangibleness, and when the movie ends, you still remember a certain cold look, a distancing expression, or words, like a well-mixed drink, spoken with a shot of anger and a shot of the inability to mask the pain.<br /><br />I did miss the Bond gadgets, but the one liners were still in there, though not the deliberately funny ones like in previous Bond movies.  This Bond doesn't have a \\"tell\\" that gives away the fact he's about to say something funny. The line just comes out naturally, and sometimes, it takes the viewer a minute to realize the joke.  It's a new and difference approach, and I think it works well.<br /><br />As for the overall movie, some of the scenes in it just have to be watched over and over again. They are just that good. I don't mean only the action scenes. That shower scene rivals  The Age of Innocence on any given day.  And there are others. Each viewer will pick his or her own.  My recommendation is to watch this movie. Daniel Craig is so good in this picture. I read some of the Bond books, and like Ian Fleming's character, Craig's Bond is both a human being and an incredibly cold and dangerous machine, while not allowing one side of himself to detract or distract from the other.<br /><br />I gave the movie five stars because overall it was enjoyable. The only problem I had with it was what happened in the end with Vesper and why it happened.  The explanation given to justify it was just too muddy.had with it was what happened in the end with Vesper and why it happened.  The explanation given to justify it was just too muddy.

B000000OAA|5.0|This to me is the best Queen album, not that the others aren't great because they are, but this is the first Queen album I bought and yes it blew my little 16 year old mind. I bought this after hearing only \\"Killer Queen\\" on the radio and I had no idea what I was bringing home.  So I put on the record and \\"Brighton Rock\\" comes on and from the first amazing Brian May riff I am hooked but oh there was so much more. This album has it all, from rockers to ballads to camp and everything in between. This is the record that made me go right back out and purchase their first 2 albums and this record is still the benchmark for them as far as I'm concerned.  Sure they went on to be huge throughout the world but they would never top this album. Every song is great and you have 4 talented songwriters and so many great singers in this band. In any other band Roger Taylor and Brian May would have been king but when you have Freddie Mercury it's like having gravy. Still I think Brian is one of the best and underrated song writers ever not to mention his guitar playing which is so original and tasteful and yet so rocking. Check out \\"Brighton Rock\\" and you'll see what I mean. Also just listen to \\"She Makes Me\\", what an incredible piece of pop music. Anyway I could ramble on all day about this album but if you only know Queen from \\"Opera\\" and up or just their 80's stuff, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. I can guarantee it will become one of your favorites, there is no filler here, just a heaping helping of good rock 'n' roll.
B005VTGB0S|4.0|The iPad cases of the world seem to suffer from the predicament of the purse: no perfect purse has ever been found but people are willing to keep the fire of hope alive  -- knowing that somewhere the perfect one exists.  It's possible.<br /><br />Strength:<br />This iPad cover seems less flexible and much more protective of the iPad inside of it than many cases I have seen but it has its own good and bad points.  It is flexible enough so that the ipad won't be damaged but not inflexible enough to cause damage: you can bend but probably not break it in normal use.<br /><br />Elastic corners and sizing:<br />The Velcro on the elastic corner pieces was a little difficult to get free and I wondered about the purpose of it.  Is the Galaxy a slightly different size needing Velcro on the corners to fit it more closely?  It was difficult to fit the iPad into the case, which probably means it is more secure.  However, as often as this thing comes out to charge it, this seems like a potential annoyance.<br /><br />Angles:<br />The angle of the iPad at its highest point in this case is about 60 degrees.  When I put my Fire in its comparable [[ASIN:B005VTGCE8 AmazonBasics Leather Folio Cover with Multi-Angle Adjustable Stand for Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 (Black)]], the angle that it sits at is 70 degrees, a perfectly comfortable angle for watching videos while it is sitting on my desk.  The Fire folio angle being about 10 degrees higher than the iPad angle, puts the Fire at a more comfortable angle to watch, while this iPad case makes it too low.<br /><br />Price:<br />My husband and youngest child both use [[ASIN:B004QKJU56 Apple iPad 2 Polyurethane Smart Cover - Gray (MC939LL/A)]] for their iPads.  We recently had to replace one of the covers because of an ink spill (and general sloth) that one of them suffered from being in a teenager's backpack.  That cover, which only fits on the top of the iPad is much less protective and costs more.  Obviously, it also leaves the back open for scratches.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|As a long time Stephen King fan, I have to admit, I start his books assuming I'll enjoy them. He can prove me wrong (I never cared for the Dark Tower series), but I always give him the benefit of the doubt. With this one, though, good ole Steve came through again. 11/22/63 is a great example of King's ability to combine the ordinary and everyday with the strange and sometimes downright bizarre, and still end up with a believable story. I couldn't quite go with 5 stars if only for the ending - Jake's epiphany moment is a little too 'Clockwork Orange' for my taste (not because I don't like Clockwork, but because I *do* - a little tip of the hat goes a long way).
1589795474|5.0|I read this every two years ago and without fail, it \\"resets\\" the way our family behaves.  As so many people have stated, it's a lot of data and common sense compiled in one place with surprising results.  But here's what so many people are not mentioning.  This book is loaded with information about the emotional baggage/freedom that money can provide.  Do you want to learn about how families use \\"Economic Outpatient Care\\" aka financial gifts as a way to control & influence each other?  It's in there.  What about how financial gifts can dampen your children's motivation?  That's in there, too.  Many of us are brought up to not discuss money, yet money issues are everywhere and we're often left to educate ourselves on the matter; rarely do we receive formal financial training.  You can't help but notice that so and so must have money because of the way they display it.  Conversely, we never notice (or know) that the older gentleman driving the 15 year old Dodge has seven figures in the bank.  My husband and I read it 10 years ago and here's what we've changed-  The book heavily influenced where we bought our home and how big (or in our case, small) it is.  Cable went out the window (we use digital bunny ears that cost $50 for local channels and got Netflix).  Saved $2,000/year.  We haven't purchased a new car since.  We try (and often do) save at least 10% of our annual income and we're slowly trying to invest it- not as impressive as many in the book but it's a start.  We negotiate like crazy for our annual propane purchase and save $1,800/year.  I clip coupons.  We buy name brand clothes but absolutely never at full price.  Frequently clothes will be purchased for next season for the kids while they're on sale at the end of this season.  We are surgical about turning off the lights when we leave a room and every week our menu is planned so we don't waste food.  Do some of these things sound extreme?  Maybe they are, but here's what we haven't changed after readingthis book...  We still take great vacations, usually two a year.  We go out to eat once a month but rarely more.  We drive one nicer car and one beater.  We like really good food so despite all the coupons, we don't compromise on the quality of meats or fruits & veggies.  In short, The Millionaire Next Door has been a defining part of our lives.  Whenever I start to feel myself slip into a mode where I want to spend more we remind ourselves of the freedom financial stability provides.  At our age (34) people are flashing money everywhere- Wow, hot car!  Love the house upgrade- we all need 4000 sq ft right?  Ohhhh, the beach house is tempting.  Expensive camps for the kids.  Expensive weekly dinners for the parents.  A tree exploding with presents.  I could go on and on and on.....  We've developed a keen eye for detecting people that we think live \\"The Millionaire Next Door' lifestyle....but we'll never know for sure.  If nothing else, this book has taught us to be cognizant and aware of every penny we spend.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|It took a bit of time and a few restarts of the first episode to make me fall in love with the series. Being a fan of high fantasy settings and never having read the books, I expected more magic and less gritty realism. How wrong I was! HBO was very smart to make a series to can connect not only with the traditional Ringers crowd (of which I'm a card carrying member) but also with the more mainstream viewers that liked Rome, Spartacus and yes, the Sopranos. It should also make an impact in Asia because more than a few times I was reminded of great historic Korean and Chinese series like Jewel in the Palace. The intricate plot has so many twists that you really need to pay attention. Plans set in motion in earlier episodes spectacularly fail later on and people you thought you loved either turn out to be bastards or quite sympathetic after all. The slow but never boring build up of events always made me clamor for more. The main plot sees two houses struggle for power. The cool thing is that BOTH sides have good and bad characters. Blood feuds are fought out over the backs of the common serfs (nothing has changed since medieval times there!) and over all of there is the still invisible threat of the horrors from beyond the Wall. In the end, I was actually a bit disappointed when the super natural made it's entrance. There's enough political maneuvering going on that you don't really miss the spell-casters. Best actor so far is Peter Dinklage, whom I really want to see in an episode of House. He has the same arrogant-yet-likable character. On the other hand, that seems to have become the cliche Brit in the States. Update: I have almost finished the first two books of the series. People who cringe at the blood and raping that is going on in series one better get prepared because there's much more to come!
B004EPZ02A|3.0|Okay, I LOVED this movie in the theater!  It was scary and kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through it!<br /><br />So I rushed out and got this on the very first day it was released and I eagerly watched it.  It was just as good on my TV as it was in the theaters.  I wasn't as scared cuz I knew what was going to happen, but I was excited to see that there was a \\"Extended Version!\\"  I eagerly clicked on that and watched it with my girlfriend.  However from what I could see, there was only one thing that was different.  There's a scene where Dennis gets up in the middle of the night cuz he hears something and he grabs the camera.  He goes to the window and something rattles the window.  That's it.  Not really worth the extra money if you ask me.<br /><br />I only have one actual complaint about the movie itself.  They use modern catch phrases in a movie that was set in the 80's.  The phrases, \\"That just happened!\\" and \\"Seriously!?!\\" Those phrases didn't exist back then, so they shouldn't be in this movie!<br /><br />Ever since the first Paranormal Activity movie came out I was waiting for them to put a commentary on one of these movies so I could hear more about this movie series and how the movies were made, but I have yet to get a Paranormal Activity with a commentary, or some interviews, or SOMETHING other than just the movie itself.<br /><br />Sure there was a few extra \\"scares\\" where Dennis scares his wife in the style of MTV's Jackass, and a commercial that Dennis made for his little business of filming weddings.  But that's it, that's all that's on this Blu Ray.<br /><br />So if all you're really looking for is the movie itself, then you'll be very happy with this movie, but if you wanted some extra features on this disc, you're gonna be disappointed.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the dismay of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is rich. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married.<br /><br />Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are good because of what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than \\"venison\\" or \\"meat.\\" Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play.<br /><br />The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" With that great opener, we are off to the races.<br /><br />Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own. Somehow it seemed Jane Austen anticipated the future when much of her character's behavior would be seen as folly, though we certainly have follies of our own today.
B005CMSDLE|4.0|&lt;strong>Hanna&lt;/strong> (Joe Wright, 2011)<br /><br />&lt;em>Hanna&lt;/em> was one of my favorite films of 2011, among the relatively few that I have so far seen, so I have no idea why it has taken me so long to actually get around to reviewing it. (And it's third on the list; there are two films I saw before this one I haven't reviewed yet. Sheesh.) Some movies just have to percolate for a long, long time, I guess. Maybe because this is so far removed from the types of things I usually watch, which break down into \\"Hollywood blockbusters\\" and \\"stuff no one's ever heard of before.\\" &lt;em>Hanna&lt;/em>, from what little publicity it received, seemed as if it was of the latter variety, but at the eleventh hour got a push from the distributor to try and turn it into the former. It still has the feel of a small indie film, albeit a brilliantly-shot one with much-nominated director Joe Wright (&lt;em>Atonement&lt;/em>) at the helm and a cast stuffed so full of award-winning actors it sometimes felt as if the entire thing would burst at the seams from all the OMGIMPORTANT. And yet, at no point did it ever feel pretentious or overblown or... Hollywood. Even had it not been all that good a film, that sense alone would have endeared me to it. But good it is.<br /><br />Plot: Hanna (Saoirse Ronan, who worked with Wright on &lt;em>Atonement&lt;/em>) is a thirteen-year-old girl living in the middle of nowhere with her father (&lt;em>Chopper&lt;/em>'s Eric Bana), a former secret agent who spends his days training his daughter to survive in the world. Problem is, he only knows his own way of doing so, so he's also training her to be, essentially, an assassin. Well, the inevitable happens, his old friends track him down, and he sends Hanna off on a trans-Europe run, being chased by those same operatives, headed up by dad's former boss, the enigmatic Marissa (Cate Blanchett). Do I need to tell you anything else for you to know the entire movie is a setup for a confrontation between Hanna and Marissa? Not if you've watched half a dozen spy thrillers in your life, I don't. But Seth Lochhead's script is entirely unafraid to go places that normal spy thrillers don't, but that make perfect sense given the age and sex of the protagonist (who is, at best, a charming sociopath for whom \\"socalized\\" may be a word she encountered in the dictionary once), including hooking up for part of her journey with a loud, blowsy British family whose daughter, Sophie (&lt;em>Tamara Drewe&lt;/em>'s Jessica Barden), is actually the undiscovered jewel of this film, a brash young actress whose considerable skills enable her to shine in a film containing, well, Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett.<br /><br />The best thing to do with &lt;em>Hanna&lt;/em> is to not take it too seriously. At its heart, this is a simple genre spy thriller with a twist, not some art film with Oscar pretensions. And yet still, there are places where this movie transcends. Most notable is the incredible cinematography courtesy DP Alwin Kuchler (&lt;em>Sunshine&lt;/em>); this is a movie that feels just at home in the trackless wastes of Norway as it does, in one memorable scene, inside a bullet hole. (It makes up for the somewhat woeful Chemical Brothers soundtrack, the movie's one real weakness.) The principal actors all bring their A games, and Lochhead's script is a lot of fun; if you missed this one the first time round, see it--but try to catch it on the big screen so you can soak in all that great camerawork. *** ½ozen spy thrillers in your life, I don't.

B003N5VOUO|5.0|&lt;strong>My Name Is Khan&lt;/strong> (Karan Johar, 2010)<br /><br />I have terrifying, terrifying images in my head of Hollywood attempting to remake &lt;em>My Name Is Khan&lt;/em>. First off, the Bollywood original runs two hours and forty-one minutes. This would be untenable in any culture in which Harvey \\"ninety minutes and out\\" Weinstein is a player, so of course we'd lose a few subplots. (We might actually lose the main plot. I've seen a couple of Asian-horror-film remakes that came bloody close to losing the main plot.) But imagine all the time you could save by doing what Hollywood does best: emotional shortcuts.<br /><br />If you've read my movie reviews for any length of time, you've heard me going off about Hollywood's use of emotional shortcuts, which has by this time gotten so endemic that I can't remember the last mainstream Hollywood-studio-distributed movie I saw that didn't contain them as a substitute for real characterization. (This is why today's monthly update of my thousand-best-films-ever list's twelve changes--including &lt;em>My Name Is Khan&lt;/em>, which entered the list at #160--saw eight foreign films, three American movies made well outside the Hollywood machine, and one pre-emotional-shortcut Hollywood film enter the list, and twelve modern mainstream Hollywood films leave it.) Let me give you a quick example of what I'm talking about here. &lt;em>My Name Is Khan&lt;/em> contains a minor character named Abdul, who runs a store in San Francisco selling televisions. Once he's introduced, which doesn't happen until relatively late in the film, we see a number of scenes in which Abdul features, though he's never the center of the scene. As we progress, we get that Abdul, who in post-9/11 America is basically shunned for being a Muslim, is getting more and more frustrated with the world around him. Finally, in the first scene in which Abdul &lt;em>does&lt;/em> take center stage, he absolutely blows his top, storms out onto the street and starts accosting middle-class white folks, confronting them with his Muslim-ness. It's an absolutely hysterical scene, and it works because we've had time to get to know Abdul and his situation. Now, in a Hollywood remake, the ten minutes or so of collected Abdul scenes which are spread over about an hour of this flick would be conflated into a single scene--the one in which Khan himself stumbles by Abdul's shop and sees footage of a massive hurricane hitting the coast of Georgia (which, in the main plotline, sends Khan running back to Georgia to help some friends he has down there). Assuming Abdul was kept in the film at all, naturally, all the buildup of Abdul's frustration would be cut down to one customer's Meaningful Look(TM), probably a suspicious narrowing of the eyes, accompanied by a subtle ominous cue in the soundtrack. These two things will combine to tell you that Abdul is Suspicious (or, at least, considered so by everyone else in the movie). And yes, as the incredible success of hundreds of mainstream American movies every year will tell you, the emotional shortcut method DOES play in Des Moines, often to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues. But ask yourself the question: would you rather allow yourself to be manipulated by a narrowing of the eyes and a musical cue, or would it be preferable for you to be given more detail about Abdul and make up your own mind?<br /><br />If you prefer the latter, I cannot begin to recommend &lt;em>My Name Is Khan&lt;/em> enough. There are so many superlatives I want to use to describe this movie that I'm not sure where to begin, so I may as well start with the opening scene. I am a big, big advocate of using unknown actors in high-profile roles, because all too often, the meta--the stuff we know about a film star's off-camera life--tends to overwhelm the character. You can't look at Tom Cruise these days without thinking about him jumping on the couch, right? Well, the opening scene of this movie isa stunning exception. Shah Rukh Khan basically &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a Bollywood version of Tom Cruise, one of the Indian film industry's most famous, and recognizable, exports. And the first sequence of this movie is a horrifying ten-minute journey through the TSA (Transportation Safety Authority, for those of you outside the US--the people who have added two hours to your wait time at American airports) system at SFO as Rizvan Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan, natch; I'll try not to let the last-name confusion go any farther than this), a man with severe Asperger's Syndrome, is pulled out of line, herded into a small room, searched, and ridiculed. And the fact that this is one of Bollywood's biggest actors puts that seed in our heads: \\"if this can happen to Shah Rukh Kahn, this can happen to &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em>\\". It's a [censored for Amazon consumption] gamble, and it pays off in spades.<br /><br />But that wouldn't be enough to make this film as good as it is by itself, naturally; you've still got two and a half hours of movie after that, and while there are a number of other actors whose presence here must (and will) be noted, this movie is all Shah Rukh Khan. I grant you, the Asperger's suffered by Rizvan in this movie is extreme, and it's one of the few places where the movie exaggerates for effect. (I note this because the movie's otherwise restrained feel is very surprising in a big-budget Bollywood blockbuster; I was very pleasantly surprised.) But that said, once you get past the initial \\"this is kind of exaggerated, here...\\", and start digesting how well Khan is playing this part, the wow factor just plain soars. Even if the film had been nothing but a character sketch/road movie, which the end of that first sequence points to if you're used to Hollywood movies and their linear plots, Khan's performance alone would have propelled this into the stratosphere.<br /><br />It's not just a character sketch/road movie, though it is that. It is also a romantic drama (I can't think of the last Bollywood film I saw that didn't have a romance element to it), and here's where I can finally find a way to segue from superlatives into an actual plot synopsis: Rizvan Khan is originally in that little room because he has been charged by his wife, Mandira (&lt;em>Ishq&lt;/em>'s Kajol), with meeting President George W. Bush and delivering him the message: \\"my name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.\\" While we can guess at the broadest idea of why this is from the very moment he says it (Rizvan is a Muslim in post-9/11 America), the movie shuttles back and forth between Khan's often amusing journey, which takes place from late 2007 to early 2010, around the country trying to track down the president and deliver his message, to the past, from the early-eighties Hindu-Muslim riots in India, to the climactic event in 2007 that causes Mandira to charge him with the task at hand. In the process, Shibani Bathija's (&lt;em>Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&lt;/em>) script tackles a &lt;em>hell&lt;/em> of a lot of weighty issues. You'd think Asperger's Syndrome, 9/11, and the Hindu-Muslim riots would be enough. You'd be wrong. (I already mentioned the hurricane, and if you pay attention to those dates, you'll notice an historic presidential election in there as well.) Now, we've all seen any number of Hollywood films that tried to tackle a single one of those issues--9/11. And I don't know about you, but I haven't seen a single one that's gotten it right yet. (The closest of them was Spike Lee's impressionist take on \\"we will rebuild\\" in &lt;em>25th Hour&lt;/em>.) Perhaps it takes a sympathetic outsider's eye to examine such things? God knows we're still too close to it, thanks to still-unending media coverage. Bathija--who often teams with director Karan Johar--is one mean talent. That said, one of the places the movie does fail is in some of the English dialogue (especially in a hospital scene about two-thirds of the way through the film); having a nativespeaker take a quick look over the script, a larger portion of which is in English than is usual in Bollywood productions, to check such things as idiom would have been a really, really good idea here.<br /><br />Johar ain't so bad himself. He's either produced, directed, or both a string of Bollywood blockbusters over the past fifteen years (including &lt;em>Kal Ho Naa Ho&lt;/em>, another favorite of mine, and another film where SRK gives a fine performance) that any producer/director on this side of the pond would be proud to have under his belt. I think he may be slightly better as a producer than a director; at one hundred sixty-one minutes, this is actually on the short side for Bollywood, and there are still a few places, though they are rare, where the direction seems to lose its way for a minute or two and the pace slips. But they are few, and forgivable, especially to American eyes--which are generally unused to seeing a movie with this much energy applied for such an extended period of time.<br /><br />Okay, I've already gone on way too long about this movie (word count tells me I was at 1,513 at the end of the last paragraph) and I haven't even mentioned the strong supporting cast, which includes a number of solid American character actors you'll likely recognize (Katie Amanda Keane, Benny Nieves, and Kenton Duty all have meaty roles) as well as some bigger names in America (&lt;em>Deadgirl&lt;/em>'s Kathleen Darcy pops up in a small role, while the always-wonderful Jennifer Echols, who's been providing comic relief in Hollywood since &lt;em>Save the Last Dance&lt;/em>, gets what may be the largest role of her career). Nor a number of other facets of the film (the soundtrack plays more like that of an American film, rather than the cast breaking out into those big Bollywood dance numbers, which was a welcome surprise) that range from the notable to the praiseworthy. While the film does have a few flaws I mentioned above, it's still one of the best movies I've seen in years.

0545403359|5.0|As Editor of the Teen site at BellaOnline.com, I enjoyed this captivating story.  War Horse, penned as a children's novel in the 1980s, is a very compelling tale. It has a wide range of appeal that has even garnered the attention of teenagers, which is why it is a great read for young people.  As a matter of fact, it has gained such a wide following as a popular work of literature that it has been developed into an Oscar nominated film adaptation. Though it is a great story about endurance and the power of staying true to your goals, \\"War Horse\\" does have some questionable content that could have been left out for a children's novel.  For instance, Albert's father Ted is depicted as drinking alcohol from a flask. But despite this, there are some scenes that are very delightful.  An example of this would be where Albert commands Joey to come to him by imitating the sound of an owl. By the end of the novel, the reader will appreciate having read this story.  The tale of Joey and Albert's separation from one another and their final reconciliation is one that is sure to place this book as an instant classic.

B000VE439Y|1.0|I'm a big Python fan. Holy Grail is perhaps, for me, the funniest movie I have ever seen. I can watch it continuously and still get laughs. Its clever, witty, amazingly well performed, and (the Python hallmark,) incorrigibly silly. Perhaps the best comedy every made.<br /><br />So for this troupe to come out with this movie - well, it certainly tempers my regard for them, (especially Cleese, so insistently irreligious.)<br /><br />I have seen this movie only once, and that was in its theatre release in 1979. Even though I was extremely high at the time, and I laughed uproariously at the \\"funny bits,\\" the lingering aftertaste is one of distaste and extreme revulsion.<br /><br />Holy Grail was about a silly look at the iconic King Arthur and the Round Table knights. Plenty of glorious fodder in that, (and the \\"God scenes\\" are only marginally offensive.)<br /><br />Life of Brian was their vehicle to attack their mutually disdained adversary, the Christian Religion, (manifested by the ordained Church of England and other church notables.) Surely there is a lot of humor to be found here, but Python goes for more than laughs. What comes across in this picture is not irreverence and silliness, but a very edgy and harsh commentary on religion and its forms.<br /><br />Brian is a vehicle to mock Christ. The shallow \\"mistaken identity\\" device is very thin and ill disguised. Yes, we are supposed to understand that Jesus and Brian are two different people, but the satire is directed firmly at the historical record of these events. (You cannot satirize something previously unknown.) Therefore, the attack is directly on the Bible and its accounts.<br /><br />The Biblical story of Jesus is a very touching and (dare I say,) HOLY. How He is born into this world, the things He says and does, how He is betrayed and ultimately crucified are exceptionally moving and critical events, the likes of which are not even REMOTELY humorous or even slightly funny. In my opinion, only people utterly detuned to the sincerity of Jesus Christ can accept this movie on its terms.<br /><br />What exactly is funny about pretending the Virgin Mary was a rotten-tooth whore, ready to fellate a Roman soldier at a moment's notice? Even the notion is of such a thing is scandalous! (And that's saying quite a bit in this day and age.) Is this really something funny to consider?<br /><br />Brian tells the people specifically they are not to follow him, but to be individuals and think for themselves, (responded to by unison replies by the mass of his unthinking, mindless followers.) And yet Jesus Christ says only by following Him can there be any entrance into heaven. So who is mocking Whom? And for what reason? Because Python thinks all believers in Jesus Christ are mindless robots, another thinly veiled attack.<br /><br />Finally, the crucifixion is treated in an exceptionally foolish and naive manner. There is nothing even remotely funny about people dying on a cross, even in a comedy. That's why you don't see many comedy sketches treading on this ground. Its NOT FUNNY when people are left to die in the most horrific manner imaginable; all the more so when it is the very atonement for the sins of the whole earth that is in view. And to sing, \\"Always look on the bright side of life,\\" is not funny, its moronic.<br /><br />BAD movie. Poor performances. Cluttered and incohesive. Leaves a bad taste in your mouth. (I won't even watch the clips on YouTube.) Only watchable if you have a taste for blasphemy.

The jumps in time feel well-placed and complement each other. My only complaint is that the ending is both abrupt and un-satisfying, leaving much to be desired.

B005TZFZJC|3.0|Rihanna definitely went a different route on this album. It seem like she wanted to be more R&B on this particular album out of all the songs I dislike the bonus songs except Fool In Love, that's one of my favotite songs on this album. Where Have You Been , and Talk That Talk are not good to me at all. Cockiness is a little annoying to be honest but the beat is good. But other than that I enjoy every other song. I would give this album a 3.5/5 :) Rihanna was a little dirty on this album, I'm used to her being this pop artist. I use to be a huge fan until Good Girl Gone Bad then she kinda lost me. So, she surprised me alot with this album. But, I enjoy listening to it so, that's good.

She wanted to show there are more sides to her and you can have fun with music and make a great album. It doesn't necessarily have to be like every other rap album. Most of her fans that have been listening to her from her first years (2007) understand her and the album better than everyone else. Some of the songs on this album are telling a story , and then the others are just her having fun with the music. Not taking everything so serious like most people do. I rate this album 5 stars because it was different than what I ever heard before and it was unique. It had a lot of different sounds and she totally surprised me I wasn't expecting this. I'm excited about her next album which is titled Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded.

I feel like where [[ASIN:B002BWQ58G Good Calories, Bad Calories]] focused on comparing the \\"low-fat\\" hypothesis to the \\"low-carb\\" hypothesis, this present book took a different tack and attacked the \\"Calories in / calories out\\" perspective of weight gain / loss instead. The basic point is that, although it is indeed true that you gain (lose) weight because you consume more (fewer) calories than you expend, this is not a causal relationship; in particular, restricting your caloric intake (diet) or increasing your energy output (exercise) has, at best, a limited impact on your weight. Instead, your body adjusts how tired or hungry you feel to compensate. Your accumulation or shedding of fat is instead based on a hormonal balance or imbalance that directs your body how to distribute incoming food energy (eg., fat cells or muscle cells) and whether to store or release energy from fat cells. I think it's very much worth reading this book to get a good understanding of this perspective.  I found the actual description of the hormonal imbalance a bit disappointing. There seems to be a tendency in low-carb books to vilify insulin (IIRC, [[ASIN:0553380788 Protein Power: The High-Protein/Low-Carbohydrate Way to Lose Weight, Feel Fit, and Boost Your Health--in Just Weeks!]] did this to a much greater extent), but I think that misses the point a little bit. The problem, as I understand it, is not insulin per se, but an excess of insulin due to insulin resistance. Taubes does discuss insulin resistance, but very briefly; I would have liked to see more on the topic, since it seems to be the crux of the problem. The next logical jump, that reducing carbohydrate intake will help reduce or eliminate excess insulin, is also taken more quickly for my liking. Overall, I would have been interested in a more in-depth discussion of our understanding of fat and blood sugar metabolism. But then again, I don't think that is the book that Taubes wanted to write.

0575088281|4.0|Reynolds has always set himself apart from other science fiction authors by widening the scope of the plot to the nth degree, by infusing the setting with richness and depth, and by marbling all of this with awe-inducing science and technology. Akin to [[ASIN:0575083093 Revelation Space]] and [[ASIN:B002ZNJWI6 House of Suns]], Blue Remembered Earth proves he still has the gift for exhibiting unique ideas, penning an intriguing story, and capturing the imagination of the reader. It's not his best work, but it's definitely the great beginning to a surely great series.<br /><br />At the end of the year 2161, after sixty years of solitude orbiting the moon, the empress to a solar system-wide company passes away. Her genetic legacy includes one pair of grandchildren, Geoffrey, who studies elephants on the African plains, and Sunday, who pursues sculpture in the Descrutinized Zone on the moon, away from the patrolling omniscient eye of the Mechanism. Controlling the interests in the family company are their cousins Hector and Lucas, who have a frosty relationship with Geoffry and Sunday. Once into 2162, the cousins bride Geoff into traveling to the moon in order to recover the contents of a safe-deposit box once belonging to their wealthy and reclusive grandmother, Eunice. With agreement not to meet his sister when he's on the moon, Geoff breaks this treaty by visiting her enclave in order to unravel the mystery behind the contents of the box: a antique spacesuit glove which holds yet another mystery... colored gems.<br /><br />Earth in the year 2162, as stylized by Reynolds, is one of African prosperity born from the decline of unmentioned Western nations and where humanity is recovering from the symptoms of a century of global warming. Pages 148-149 outline a post-warming earth, where sea levels had risen and were combated with seawalls, where Sahara had extended its arid grip upon the continent, where depopulation had been enforced, where humanity derived its energy from deep-penetration geothermal tap and solar arrays spanning the globe, efficient transmission accomplished by superconducting cables. Once ill-weather regions of the earth now harvest grapes and produce fine wines, such as Patagonia, Iceland, and Mongolia. In contrast to this great human revival to calamity, there has been an unheard of decline in crime because of the nearly worldwide Mechanism, which uses algorithms to predict human behavior... each person with an augmentation connected to this incorruptible sentinel:<br /><br />\\"Murder isn't impossible, even in 2162... Because the Mechanism wasn't infallible, and even this tirelessly engineered god couldn't be in all places at once. The Mandatory Enhancements were supposed to weed out the worst criminal tendencies from developing minds... it was inevitable that someone... would slip through the mesh.\\" (278)<br /><br />The plot has a feel similar to [[ASIN:0441010644 Chasm City]] and [[ASIN:B001KOTU88 The Prefect]], where a mystery is unraveled step-by-step in order to find the nexus of \\"what it all means.\\" Jumping from shadows of Kilimanjaro, to the lunar cityscapes, to the underwater expanse of the Panspermian Initiative, to the still inhospitable Martian atmosphere, and beyond... the scope of action on these and other settings is enough to please any space opera fan. Chuck in a few wholesome bits of orbital technology, mind transference technology, and a few spaceships - bam, what more could a hard sci-fi fan long for?<br /><br />Plot aside, there is a core of characters which is tightly woven, numbering around six. It's easy to keep track of the ongoings, but when you start to toss in some far-flung family lineage, some transient personages, some representatives of human sects, and some semi-sentient corporal golem figures... you may need to keep a list if you're going to take more than three days to read this tome. A tome it may be, but it's not without its peppering of poetic prose:<br /><br />\\"It was mid-afternoon and cloudless, the sky preposterously blue and infinite, as if it reached all the way to Andromeda rather than being confined within the indigo cusp he had seen from space.\\" (154-155)<br /><br />Nor it is without its share of humor, if you know your history of Mars in fiction: one character thinks the Martian city of Robinson is named after the novel Robinson Crusoe. The dialogue is less than airy at times, something Reynolds has been guilty of ever since Revelation Space. At times it's dry and recapitalizing. There's more swearing here than in his other novels, which is fine by my. Again, one more fault I found is a similar in fault to Chasm City: the unraveling is too convenient, the timing too auspicious, the clues too quickly understood, the backpedaling too awkward (i.e. the Phoboes Monolith).<br /><br />It's not as preciously crafty as The Prefect or as expansive as [[ASIN:044101173X Redemption Ark]] (my favorite Revelation Space novel), but Reynold's doesn't disappoint with Blue Remembered Earth- an optimistic tale of humanity's collective potential on the earth we live and on the orbiting bodies we will settle, develop, and prosper upon.ite, as if it reached all the way to Andromeda rather than being confined within the indigo cusp he had seen from space.\\" (154-155)  Nor it is without its share of humor, if you know your history of Mars in fiction: one character thinks the Martian city of Robinson is named after the novel Robinson Crusoe.

B006TTC5O0|5.0|\\"Well, I've wrestled with reality for 35 years, doctor, and I'm happy to state I finally won out over it.\\"<br /><br />That cheerful comment sets the tone for \\"Harvey,\\" a movie about a lovable guy whose way of dealing with the harshness of reality is simple: Make his own. It sounds either alarming or overly precious, but the brilliant performances of James Stewart, Josephine Hull and the rest of the cast give it a strangely sunny, heartfelt charm.<br /><br />Veta Louise Simmons (Josephine Hull) hopes to arrange a wonderful marriage for daughter Myrtle May (Victoria Horne) in the upper echelons of society. There's one problem: her wealthy brother Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) has an imaginary pal, a six-foot-three rabbit called Harvey. After Elwood accidently wrecks a party by introducing Harvey to everyone, Veta decides to have him committed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when Veta takes Elwood to the sanatorium, the staff come to think that the fluttery socialite is crazy, and is trying to get her sunny brother out of the way. So they lock her up, and let him go. After that mistake is straightened out, the psychiatric staff and Elwood's long-suffering family try to find him.... and Harvey.<br /><br />If we ever saw Elwood P. Dowd (\\"Here, let me give you one of my cards\\") in a car, the bumper sticker would probably say, \\"Reality is highly overrated.\\" The big theme of the movie is that reality can be harsh, and that it's not necessarily a bad thing to lapse out of it into the fantasies of our own minds. If Elwood isn't dangerous and is otherwise normal, who cares if he has an imaginary friend?<br /><br />Is Harvey real? The film leaves that up to our imaginations. And in the end, it doesn't matter if Harvey is a figment of Elwood's imagination, or a friendly spirit. It's the effect he has on Elwood that is important. His presence makes Elwood happy and relaxed, and Elwood makes others happy and relaxed -- even the hard-boiled head of the psychiatric ward, who lies down on his own couch and tells his secrets to Elwood.<br /><br />This actually isn't too screwballish a comedy -- sure, there's the running joke where Elwood politely introduces Harvey to people he meets. And the scene where Veta is committed is hilarious. But it's more of a heartwarmer than a comedy, from Elwood softening the lead shrink to Myrtle May finding love with a lovable blue-collar worker from the sanatorium.<br /><br />James Stewart gives a wonderfully dreamy performance, slightly smelling of booze and flowers -- his Elwood P. Dowd is mild-mannered, sweet, gallant, courteous, and oh-so-pleasant. And he's learned the value of just enjoying the little things in life, like a flower, a beer or a talk with a friend. And Josephine Hull brings up a brilliant performance as his frazzled sister, with several other good actors rounding off the supporting cast.<br /><br />Who is crazier -- the happy man with the imaginary rabbit, or the people who want him to be 100% sane and less happy? You make the call. With a sweet, surreal story and a flawless cast \\"Harvey\\" is one of those rare movies that does an unspecifiable number on your heartstrings.This actually isn't too screwballish a comedy -- sure, there's the running joke where Elwood politely introduces Harvey to people he meets.

B00062IDCO|5.0|Well I finally did it. I finally completed my Star Trek Voyager DVD collection and have had a great time watching all of my favorite episodes again throughout the last year or so. This, the 7th and last season of Voyager is just as good as the seasons before it were, which is saying a lot because the past few seasons were pretty phenomenal. I will definitely be enjoying this series from time to time for many years to come.<br /><br />The show had many outstanding and memorable moments, and even some old favorite guests from ST:TNG such as Counselor Deanna Troi , and Lieutenant Reginald Barclay who is always a fun character to watch, and Q made an appearance even!<br /><br />The episode where Neelix leaves his friends on Voyager behind to go and live with a group of Talaxians got me a little teary-eyed as well. LOL. And yes, the final two-parter episode could have been better, but I can let it slide because overall during the course of it's seven season run this show rocked!

0307949486|1.0|Warning : SPOILERS ahaed...<br /><br />I didn't expect much from this book, since I'm naturally suspicious of anything that is so intensely hyped.<br />However, eventually I couldn't resist and decided to see what all the fuss was about - and I am in utter shock ! (And no, not because of the appalling violence...)<br />This is the first book I have felt the need to review without actually finishing it. I gave up at the blank page between the second and third part, which conveniently marks the middle of the work. It may be fair to say that reviewing a book without finishing it is most unfair; but when you have read half of it and can think of no earthly reason to read further, that means something, doesn't it ?<br /> I just couldn't take it anymore...it's the writing that's the problem, writing which is unbelievably bad and sloppy.<br />There might be some fault in the translation, as so many other reviewers have already pointed out, but this can't excuse the incredibly bland prose, narrative, cardboard characters, and generally bad technique.<br />The only character with a little bit of depth is of course Lisbeth Salander, but since she is anything but the titular heroine, I'll get to her later.<br />In fact, she is only the sidekick of the protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist. He has just been convicted in a libel suit initiated by a business magnate, but this storyline holds very little interest, since the trial and the research that got him into it are not part of the book, and it's obvious anyway that the tycoon is a crook and Blomkvist has been framed. Wow.<br />For the entire first half of the book, Mikael Blomkvist does virtually nothing, except for drinking a lot of coffee and eating a lot of sandwiches. At some point, he actually eats a plate of potatoes and beets, now that's what you call a really astonishing plot twist !<br />And he listens, preferably to monologues about the history of the Vanger clan. The Vangers don't do much either, except for inhabiting their private island and despising each other. It has been said in other reviews that Blomkvist jumps into bed with anything that moves, but except for his ongoing relationship with his boss and a desperate little affair with one of the elder Vangers I have seen no evidence of this yet. At the point I put the novel down, Blomkvist had just started his three-month prison sentence as a result of the libel case. Since there is notoriously little to do in prison, I doubt that his activities will increase.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is a little more energetic. She actually does things, like shocking evil sadist fiends with Tasers, which (now that the horror has faded) makes me think of a character in the animated film \\"Flushed Away\\" - there's a kid rat there with a similar device who calls himself \\"Shocky\\"........I know, it's a cruel comparison, and of course the pig deserved it.<br />Anyway, she is a genuinely unique character. Unfortunately, that doesn't make her one bit believable. She is considered mentally disturbed and therefore under legal guardianship, although she is already 24. However, she is also described as fiercely intelligent and resourceful, so the question is this : why doesn't she put on some \\"normal\\" clothes for the occasion (as she actually does for one of her investigations), walk into some courtroom, speak a few coherent sentences, and settle this mess ?<br />Why would a free spirit like herself, who resents anyone telling her what to do, intentionally remain in a position where other people have legal power over her life ?<br />I suspect the reason for this is that she can uncover a conspiracy in the second part and have a triumphant court victory in the third, thereby allowing the author to contrive a trilogy - thanks to Wikipedia, I know this now.<br />Although regarded as a genius, she doesn't seem to be very bright - after a newly appointed guardian has already abused her, she returns to his apartment with some half-baked<br />revenge plan. Naturally, the plan goes wrong so that we can be indulged in a graphic rape scene. Also naturally, the heroine won't allow this incident to upset her unduly - she simply pays the sadist a third visit, equipped with a more elaborate idea. Hence, we can now enjoy in equally graphic detail how he get's what he deserves.<br />How many contrived excuses for depicting sickening violence can a single brain produce ?<br />By the way, when first introduced, she is described as having \\"childlike breasts\\" (although she is an adult woman) - can somebody please explain to me what on earth this is supposed to mean ? I have yet to see a child with breasts. Extraordinary. Of course, a pubescent girl (aka teenager) with a developing bust is considered a \\"child\\" under the law, but was this really necessary ? Wouldn't \\"small\\" have sufficed ?<br />I can't understand how so many people, especially women, came to be so impressed with this character. What is there to admire in this person ?<br />That she dares to dress differently ? Is that all it takes nowadays ?<br />Sure, she \\"kicks butt\\", but vengefully torturing your abusers doesn't seem to be a very practical approach for abuse victims in the real world.<br />Can she be a role model for rape survivors, even though she has no interest in therapy, in healing, in help of any kind ?<br />Let alone in legal justice, which she dismisses from her mind because \\"they wouldn't believe her anyway\\". Tragically, that is what most abuse victims think and, combined with the shame, the reason that so many sex crimes go unreported. Since the Taser method is not one that most survivors of horrific violence will fall back on, this fact still proves to be the greatest problem with the prosecution of sex offenders.<br />What is Larsson trying to say ? That vigilante justice is a proper solution ? Welcome to the wild, wild west.....<br /><br />The murder mystery is the dullest one of it's kind that I have ever encountered, mainly because this is the part where the writing really becomes a major problem.<br />While the premise of the mystery - disappearing girl, locked island scenario, limited list of suspects etc. - is quite promising, the investigation passes you by.<br />Why ? Because Larsson writes a lot about \\"unanswered questions\\" , \\"clues that lead nowhere\\" and the \\"thorough investigation\\" of the police. But he never actually spells out just one of the questions or the clues, or the details of the investigation. As a result, the readers can do nothing to try to put the pieces together, are not given the chance to \\"unravel\\" the mystery themselves, but have to wait for one of the lethargic characters to get caught in a fit of hyperactivity and do something.<br />Granted, the mystery comes to a pretty stupid and obvious conclusion, but in thriller/whodunit fiction I consider this kind of style a bad joke.<br /><br />In fact, I've come to think that the whole phenomenon is a bad joke. It appears to me as the ultimate triumph of aggressive marketing, perhaps aggravated by the fact that the author is dead and can do nothing to pester his publishers - a PR person's dream.<br />This novel is in no way worthy of the praise that is thrown at it from all sides.<br />It has been hailed by reliable critics as \\"whisking us away instantly with\\" :<br /><br />* \\"it's spellbinding, complex and compelling characters\\"<br />  - Salander excepted, virtually none of the characters have any depth, any quirks, any unique and/or realistic traits, any emotional life at all - come to think of it, Salander doesn't have an emotional life either....<br /><br />* \\"it's fast-paced action\\"<br /> - I have never read anything so tedious and boring in my life.....<br /><br />* \\"it's dark and brooding mysteries\\"<br /> - in spite of all the marketing trying to convince us otherwise, there is absolutely no sense of atmosphere coming across from Larsson's writing - he seems obsessed with giving precise daytimes and temperatures on countless occasions, but telling the reader that it's 2.00 pm and -10 degrees won't compensate for an utter lack in creating memorable scenes.<br />The mystery is a boring little puzzle that Chief Inspector Japp from the good old Yard would have solved 36 years ago.<br />At any rate, I always take thrillers that conclude with a serial killer with a pinch of salt - it's too cheap a solution for me when the killer needs no motive beyond his own insanity.<br /><br />This book has been called a \\"masterpiece of contemporary literature.\\" I have no words for this statement. It is outrageous. If this is all it takes to write a masterpiece in our bleak times, I feel tempted to give it a shot myself. But I would never in my greediest dreams dare to show a manuscript like this to a publisher, for fear of being laughed out of the office as the author of pretentious, uncreative, exploitative, very slow pulp.....<br /><br />Finally, there is something rather distasteful about the way the whole thing, inlcuding both movies, is being sold. Apparently Larsson was, out of personal experience, deeply appalled by violence against women.<br />Yet there is so much media frenzy about the graphic content. Very often, it is conveniently phrased \\"violent sex\\", when in fact, it deals with sexual violence.

B005PYZG6E|1.0|This is really hard to make balance, after 3 hours of trying I couldn't get it to fully balance.  Trying to balance out my Canon t3i was a nightmare. I would suggest getting a better quality camera stabilizer instead of getting a cheap one. Package itself was also damaged and there aren't really any instructions on it
B002ZG999U|5.0|\\"The Expendables\\" is a merry cheerful genocide between old friends &agrave; la sauce testosterone, a very violent and in the same time surprisingly tender, nostalgic, full of humour and less than half serious movie - and I loved every minute of it!<br /><br />The story is in principle about a group of mercenaries, many of them a little bit aged, who are hired by the CIA to eliminate the military dictator ruling a little island in the Caribbean - but the plot is really really NOT important, and so it will not be discussed further.<br /><br />The team of mercenaries is small but lethal (of course!). Its leader Barney Ross is (of course!) played by Stallone himself, who also wrote the scenario and directed the film. Ross is the oldest member of the team; he is also a man of few words, without much personal life, very calm and slightly sad. His great pride is to be the fastest man to draw and shoot the gun - \\"Only light is faster\\"...<br /><br />The second in command, Lee Christmas, is played by Jason Statham, who gives an IMPRESSIVE performance!! Christmas is much younger than his commander (and best friend), much more extraverted and with a gorgeous, although unfaithful girlfriend played by Charisma Carpenter. He is an excellent marksman and an accomplished martial arts expert, but his personal specialty is knife fight and especially knife throwing. In homage to the \\"Magnificent seven\\" old western classic, Ross and Christmas have at every possible occasion a friendly speed competition between knife and revolver...<br /><br />The third most important member of the team is Gunner Jensen, a gigantic sociopathic and borderline insane sniper played with great brio by Dolph Lundgren - who gives in this movie his (in my modest opinion) best screen performance ever. Considering the fact that Lundgren almost killed (accidentally) Stallone when they turned \\"Rocky IV\\" (Sly spend eight days in ICU), their reunion is a particularly touching cinema moment.<br /><br />Number four is Ying Yang, played by Jet Li. Much shorter and smaller than his pals, Yang is also a good shooter but (obviously) he is the most dangerous in close combat - although his character clearly also is no more in his prime and will realise it during this mission...<br /><br />The other members of the team, Toll Road (ex-wrestler Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (ex-footballer Terry Crews) have less screen time, but they also have their stories to tell and they add some flavour to the whole thing.<br /><br />Other than the names of some of the mercenaries, the big gag which I appreciated the most is that they all have deep and concerning issues: Ross has the aging problem, Christmas has a girlfriend problem, Jensen has an addiction problem, Yang has money troubles, Road has depression issues (and the whole cinema went amok with laughter when he confessed why) and Caesar has a fixation on absolutely enormous guns, which is most of the times a sign of..., well, you know what kind of problem...)))<br /><br />Stallone's team is assisted by a former soldier and mercenary known only as Tool (played by Mickey Rourke), who now is retired and earns his living officially by making tattoos to bikers and exotic dancers - but in fact he is a go-between arranging \\"jobs\\" for the mercenaries. Mickey Rourke gives in this movie a great performance and it is a pure pleasure watching him on the screen.<br /><br />This testosterone laced ensemble will have to face not only the usual hordes of evil gun fodder but also three particularly nasty bad guys: a fiendish former CIA agent turned free lance criminal (Eric Roberts) and his two vile and brutish henchmen: Paine (played by ex-wrestler \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin) and Brit (played by kickboxer and martial arts expert Gary Daniels). The two apocalyptic close quarter fights between Ross and Paine and between Christmas, Yang and Brit towards the end of the movie are a particularly great treat. Martial arts shown in those duels are nothing like karatefrom Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris movies - they look rather like battlefield fighting styles (Israeli krav maga or Soviet sambo), very violent and brutal and designed to kill rather than to display one's ability.<br /><br />As almost everybody probably already knows there is one scene in the movie when Stallone meets Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. This short scene takes place in a church - and I am almost certain that this is homage to the scene from Sergio Leone's most famous western, when the three heroes meet in a cemetery... Although short, the church scene is a simply incredible moment of cinema! In my modest opinion even if somebody got a Nobel Prize, found the cure for cancer or climbed Mount Everest wearing only strings, still his/her life is not complete without watching the church scene from \\"Expendables\\"...)))<br /><br />The cast is clearly impressive, but what makes this movie so enjoyable is the tone Stallone adopted for the whole movie. No matter how much we try, it is simply impossible to take this film seriously. The violence is certainly omnipresent and very graphic, but it is also so exaggerated that it finally starts to have an almost comic effect. Stallone also took care to soften the violence of fights by giving the \\"bad guys\\" face paintings which make them look more like plastic figures than real human beings - which gave as final result more the impression of a video game for teenagers than a real fight.<br /><br />Another great thing is that this movie has many surprisingly touching and even tender moments. Stallone did a good choice by giving his character a soft touch: as he gets old he clearly regrets less his youth than the fact that he does not have any family, other than the handful of desperados he hangs with. He also clearly has some bad things on the conscience and as his life enters its last stage, he longs for some redemption. This is why Ross decides to commit himself so heavily in this \\"job\\" - not only to earn his wage, but also to save an innocent person... who reminds him of a daughter he never had... And finally the relation between the whole team (and Tool) reminds one of an extended family or tribe reunion - with Rourke and Stallone playing the role of aging tribal ancestors, watching with tender care (and also some concern) their young and not so young braves.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie greatly and I really hope that there will be a sequel - if possible with Chuck Norris making at least one cameo! Another great idea somebody launched on internet is an \\"oestrogen\\" version of \\"Expendables\\" - a remake with an exclusively feminine cast, with Sigourney Weaver, Lucy Lawless and Michelle Yeoh taking Stallone, Lundgren and Jet Li roles... )))<br /><br />The title of this review (which was inspired by a not so good Mel Gibson's movie) reflects quite well my feelings, when I left the cinema. This movie - and especially the ending - made me feel some nostalgia, gave me a lot of fun, but it also made me feel good. I will certainly buy the DVD as soon as it is available and I will watch it again from time to time to remind me of the old good action movies from the 80s, a time when I was an action movie fan... and young!Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris movies - they look rather like battlefield fighting styles (Israeli krav maga or Soviet sambo), very violent and brutal and designed to kill rather than to display one's ability.<br /><br />As almost everybody probably already knows there is one scene in the movie when Stallone meets Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis.

B005FLX1HS|5.0|Wow, I mean really, wow. I had listened to all the songs before this album became available, and I knew I'd love it, but again, wow. I just listened to the whole CD and the songs are all perfect. I love the fact that he collaborated with people like Sirah and Ellie Goulding, because it just makes his music that much better. Also, silly me, I thought the album included the 'Orchestral Suite' track, but it doesn't, but that doesn't matter, because this album is awesome. I love the style of the music, and despite what other people may think, I will always have Skrillex in my top 5! I look forward to more! Please, if you are a fan of Skrillex, buy this album. Seriously. You won't regret it.

0439023491|4.0|In Catching Fire we get a better history the world of Panem as well as a storyline that moves the Hunger Games story ahead nicely.  We get a bit of a back-story on the characters from the first book as well as a decent job by Collins introducing new characters.<br /><br />The violence and cruelty that were prevalent in the first book are present here and do a better job than the first of showing the harshness of the people of the Capitol and the peacekeepers monitoring each district.  In some scenarios violence and over graphic descriptions in novels detract from a story's overall feeling.  You don't get that with Collins.  She gives you just enough to make you scared or hate the villains of the book with out getting gory.<br /><br />Much like the first book, the pacing in Catching Fire is perfect and keeps you turning page after page to get to the conclusion.  The story is and language are easy enough for teens, but intriguing enough for adults.  The one detraction I have in Catching Fire is the romance angle.  Collins seems to have taken a page from Stephanie Meyer and gone a little over the top with Katniss and her flip flopping between love interests.  In Hunger Games she did a great job showing you a 16 year old girl in a post-apocalyptic world who still has to deal with the emotions of being a teenage girl.  In Catching Fire she goes a little too far and it detracts from the book and becomes annoying at times.<br /><br />Overall Catching Fire is a good, quick read that keeps you turning page after page, not because you want to get through the book, but because you can't wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />4/5 Stars.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I purchased this to boost the bass and volume from my Sony MP3 player to my Sennheiser HD448 headphones. There is a slight difference in the volume, just enough to make the volume where I like it but no improvement on the bass. I do like that it is light weight and the small size where you can't even tell it is attached to the headphone wire. It should come with Velcro so it can attach to the MP3 player.

B002PYW26O|1.0|Concentrated too much on special effects, and substituted a cliché \\"Time Loop\\" plot for a interesting story. Gone is all the campy goodness and adventure of the original series. Don't waste money seeing it.
B004I744AS|5.0|I check this dictionary every morning for the word of the day and the definition matching game.  The quote of the day and everything else it has are also great.  The actual dictionary part is awesome too.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The Weather Channel app is great for finding detailed weather forecasts and also good for finding out about the latest watches and warnings. The radar is also great too. The only thing that I found was that sometimes the 10 day forecast shows the same day twice or even three times. This also occurs for the app on my phone and on my iPod. Aside from this little bug, this is probably the best weather app for the Amazon Appstore.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|good variety of games for all age levels! its a free game which makes it very appealing!! my husband and daughters love it!
B0036S4CTS|3.0|I confess that I enjoyed this book, but I'm not sure I understand why it's become such a runaway bestseller. You'll already know from product descriptions and reviews what this romantic story is all about so I'll not precis the plot here. Suffice to say that the dialogue is fun and often wryly amusing and there are occasional smart insights into the human condition (particularly when it comes to the differences between how men and women see relationships). I did however feel that the (controversial?) ending was a bit manipulative and that the overall emotional impact quite slight. For real insight into love and relationships, try Julian Barnes or the criminally underrated Peter Michael Rosenberg.

B005COO1X6|4.0|While short, this story was creative, exploring the avenues of what it means to be hidden in plain sight as a dirty old stationwagon. But King also allows the shroud of mystery about the origins of the vehicle to permeate the story and your thoughts, never truly finding an answer. I really enjoyed this short piece and highly recommend it for such a low price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It keeps me entertained, and even when I'm bored I take a shot at trying to get my high score on parachuting or ice hockey.  I like it that on each update it gets more and more games...=more fun!! No problems on the Kindle Fire.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible app. I use it every week for my Bible study class. I like being able to bookmark Bible verses for the week so when I go to Bible studying can easily pull them up. also having the option to choose what version I want to use is a big plus.

B004EPYZUI|3.0|Sucker Punch offers up plenty of action and eye candy but falls short of being a truly great film by the end of it.  As a matter of fact,the small scenes of action we do see in Sucker Punch manage to put a lot of bigger action films to shame in some respects,spanning from fuedal Japan all the way to a futuristic city and manages to fall between Lord of The Rings and World War 2 all around a two hour period. The problem with the action offered in Sucker Punch is that it heavily favors style over substance. Yes the action is great but it plays off more times than not as tongue and cheek. What makes it worse is that it feels like the film makers where either oblivious to this fact or masked it as well as they could.  Pretty much,if you've ever played any video game from the final fantasy series think Final Fantasy X part 2 and this pretty much sums up Sucker Punch. Only this film attempts to take itself way more seriously than the before mentioned game.  The extended cut of Sucker Punch is well worth watching and the cabaret style rendition of \\"Love is the Drug\\" is worthy viewing several times by itself.  Sucker Punch is a fun experiment of a movie and is worth watching at least twice. Take it for what it is and you'll be very pleased.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good app u should get becase it is cool not really but ok h j j h f d g
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I loved this book but I almost put it down because of my concern for Jack and his mom.  I fell in love with Jack.  And any author who can grab and adult audience with a child's voice gets a gold star from me.  Well done.  A tough book to recommend because of its premise, but if you miss it, you are missing out.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because everyone needs room to grow and a five star novel should be written at the end of your writing career - so I'm waiting for more from this author.

B0018LX9T4|5.0|This is a softer side of a lifestyle that is seldom accepted.  Its consensual and makes for a very realistic situation. Worth every cent!!!
B006X8GFBQ|4.0|Alastair Reynolds is known for sweeping, epic, galaxy-wide (and occasionally even intergalactic) space opera. An additional twist comes from his professional background as a physicist: while the science is often wildly speculative, it manages to stay within the bounds of the barely possible better than most space opera. So no faster-than-light travel and no causality violations. Yet somehow he still manages to write up galaxy-wide ancient precursor civilizations, wars that span light-years and aeons, space battles that destroy entire solar systems, and the usual good, clean, space opera fun.  Blue Remembered Earth is painted on a smaller canvas. It is set only about a century and a half in our future, within the Solar System. The more familiar locations, scope, cultures, and characters of the relatively near future are a welcome change of direction.  Reynolds also breaks out of some staid science-fiction conventions. For one thing, in his future world, the dominant cultural, economic, and scientific power is Africa, and all but one of his main characters (Jitendra, of Indian origin) are Africans. Like Ursula K. LeGuin, he doesn't rub your face in it; it's just that much of the action happens in the shadow of Kilimanjar, it's noted that the characters speak Swahili, and the only time somebody's race comes up is if it departs from the norm--i.e., s/he's Chinese or white.  Also, elephants.  I'm pretty much completely clueless about African cultures, so I have no idea how well--if at all--Reynolds has managed to work in cultural particularities of his Kenyan-Tanzaniyan protagonists. I have a suspicion that a Kenyan or Tanzanian might have written it in more strongly: as it is, the only things that struck me as unusual--other than the décor--were the family ties of the Akinya siblings and cousins. They are a good deal stronger than usually portrayed for typically individualist sci-fi heroes.  Blue Remembered Earth is an optimistic book. That's also a very refreshing change from the ever-grimmer dystopias of many current sci-fi authors, and indeed the sticky end Reynolds envisions for his own Revelation Space universe. In his future, humanity has managed to survive the Anthropocene--the near-catastrophic results of climate change--and has entered a new golden age. War is a barbaric feature of the receding past, crime and disease have been eradicated so thoroughly that an attempted murder in Finland or a death from cancer in Australia make the news in Nairobi, and the ecology has been brought back into balance. Colonization of the Solar System is well under way, with the ones too adventurous to live in the Earth's Surveyed Zones emigrating to more anarchic colonies on the far side of the Moon, or Mars, or even further.  Utopias make for pretty boring stories, though, so naturally there's a fly in the ointment. The story is a straightforward treasure hunt across the Solar System, to uncover a deadly family secret with the potential to change humanity's future, or perhaps destroy it. Yes, suitably epic again, in true Reynolds fashion.  I thoroughly enjoyed Blue Remembered Earth, and am looking forward to further instalments in the Poseidon's Children cycle, which the book begins. There are enough loose ends to make sequels possible, but also like most of Reynolds's work, the novel stands very well on its own. As all good sci-fi, Blue Remembered Earth has a lot to say about the world we live in, by portraying a possible future one.  Besides which, who wouldn't love spaceships and astronauts and Martian colonies and iceteroid mining?

B002C6A6N6|3.0|I loved Dr Quinn Medicine when it originally aired. I was very happy to see it re-aired. But the episodes sometimes jumped around for holiday airing. So I decided to purchase the complete set. Some of the episodes sound doesn't match the mouth movement. Which is very distracting. I am returned it and reodering. Hopefully 2nd set is alright.
1439102732|4.0|You can also read my review here: [...]    Where to begin? This book is full of so much emotion that it was hard to not feel swayed one way or another. As someone that works for an Evangenical church, I found this book very hard to digest but not because of the 'anti-Christian' context, because of the 'Christian' context. I guess I am one that falls outside the box when it comes to religion. Believing that a person has a right to choose how they live their lives without it affecting my day-to-day life.    Having also gone through minor infertility issues myself, I found Jodi Picoult's account of the feelings and emotions involved with each failed cycle to be bang on. Understanding the devastation that parents/partners go through is so hard to describe and she did it beautifully.    While I will never be able to fully wrap myself around the 'same-sex' issues (because I haven't dealt with them first or really, second, hand), Sing You Home, has made me realize that there are people out there who struggle each and every day just to get by in a world that is unaccepting, a world that judges/hates/bullys, a world that is cruel. I hope that this book hits home in some of those 'unaccepting' people and makes them realize that it really isn't about them... it's about us.    Overall, this book was wonderfully written and hit home on each and every basis of the story. Never going to far one way or the other and showing each side of the 'story' fairly and accurately (sadly). Another great book by a great author!!

B000JMKQX0|5.0|i completely enjoyed this book. read it a few hours. awesome fun, a little sad, i loved the societal commentary. i liked the non-linear storyline, i assume that makes the ADHD people happy, and would have liked a little more one person perspective, i was thinking, when i realized i was that person. so Max pulled it off with style! I have not read the \\"survival guide\\", cause i already know how to do that. anyway, this is a good and fun, if you are into the genre, read.<br /><br />The Zombies.... are a metaphor, we all get that. I think that's why we all love this genre. But this book will make you look around a little, and ask yourself.... how can i be safe in a world gone to h.e. double hockeystix?<br /><br />To Quote AN old Movie from 1967: \\"They're coming for you...\\"<br /><br />Good Fun. Get it.
B006WT2TZC|4.0|If you're a Scorps fan, you may or may not like the new recordings of their classics, but their covers are worth checking out!  When I saw the list I wasn't quite sure, but their hard rock spin to them really works.  I ended up getting \\"Tainted Love\\" and \\"All of the Day and All of the Night\\".  \\"Children of the Revolution\\" and \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" are pretty good, am going to listen to the samples one more time and might get them, too.  \\"Ruby Tuesday\\", for me, is much better than the Stones original!  If nothing else this album is good enough that you should listen to the samples, which in this day and age is high praise, and for an aging band they can still rock you!

0547424779|3.0|I'm a mom with a family of boys.  \\"The Giver\\" is a very typical dystopia book -- it slowly dawns on the hero that his well-ordered world masks horrible secrets.  Human life comes cheap in every communitarian paradise, same goes for this story.  The first glimmer comes when the book describes how the boy who is clumsy with words is beaten for every mistake, until he simply stops talking.  Then darker revelations come into play.  The questions becomes, Equality?  Or Liberty?<br /><br />Liberty is messier, but it is always better.<br /><br />Ira Levin wrote almost this exact same book, called \\"This Perfect Day\\".  Both are enjoyable.  Also try \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" -- all three explain at a gut level to children why it is impossible implement communitarian societies.  Mankind is not perfectable.  Truth will get out.  Socialism is evil.
0316044695|5.0|The news stories about this mission and the huge losses were sad. But Marcus Luttrell's harrowing first person account was absolutly heartbreaking to read. He did a wonderful thing giving us the public, faces and personalities to those who were lost that day. Who sacficed everything for each other and our country. He and the rest of his men were shining examples of everything good about America. Getting to know them through his eyes really emphsised what we have all lost.  very well done.

0812992792|5.0|Let me start by saying I was so impressed with this novel that I am going to come across like Adam Johnsons' mum, publisher, editor, best friend, paid acquaintance or a combination of any of the above. I was actually lucky enough to get a copy and just read it. The blurb makes it sound like a sort of comedy set in North Korea, in actuality it is a staggering achievement as to what you can do when you truly love the subject as Johnson does.<br /><br />It is in two parts, the first chronicles the life or rather endurance and suffering of Jun Do; he is the son of the Orphan Master, after his mother was taken away to entertain the big wigs in Pyongyang, they were left alone. All beautiful girls from the provinces are taken away like this. It is also shameful to be an orphan and they have their real names ignored and are replaced with the names of fallen martyrs. This way they will always carry the mark and shame of being an orphan. Jun Do's father pretends he too is an orphan and treats him more harshly than the others, it is an existence of grinding poverty - made worse by the compulsory loud speakers that spout blatant propaganda all day and act as brain washing devices.<br /><br />In turns he becomes a tunnel assassin in the Demilitarized Zone, a kidnapper and reluctant and not very good spy. He also ends up on a fishing boat where he gets the love of his life's image tattooed over his heart - the `best actress in the world' Sun Moon - not her real name, but chosen for her by The Dear Leader Kim Jong Il; or the fat tyrant who is famous for his song `I so Ronery', as we know him in the Imperialist West.<br /><br />Then Part Two deals with the Taekwando Champion of the World and husband to the best actress - Commander Ga. He is famous for many things including ridding the army of homosexuals. This is done oft times by seeing if they can fend off his `man attacks' - a veiled euphemism for full on rear entry intercourse. If you fail well then you must have wanted it - makes perfect sense.<br /><br />This book was researched by Adam Johnson for over six years and he visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to ensure authenticity. He has crammed so much in that it is as educational as it is both entertaining and moving. He brings all the characters to life and brilliantly highlights the failings of the West when viewed through the eyes of the North Koreans. Whilst at the heart of this there is a central theme of love and sacrifice, there is hope, there is humour, though comi-tragic would probably best describe it; but moreover there is a page turner of a story that had me hooked from the start and kept me right to the end. I actually had a dream about the characters at one point, I was that caught up in the book. I can not say enough good things about this brilliant, original, fascinating and thoroughly captivating read. I am longing for his next one and even if it takes another six years it will be worth the wait.was researched by Adam Johnson for over six years and he visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to ensure authenticity.

030788743X|4.0|Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (screenwriter of the indie film \\"Fanboys\\") is a love letter to those who grew up on 80's video games and geek pop culture. References to movies, songs and especially games are everywhere! Some are cleverly disguised so if you're in on the joke, it's like a wink from the author.<br /><br />The story takes place in the bleak future of 2044, which is imagined as all of our world's current problems compounded over the next 30 years. (i.e. skyrocketing energy costs, rising unemployment, educational deterioration, exacerabated economic inequality, etc.) But little of this seems to matter because most spend there time in a utopian MMO (Massive Multiplayer Online) world called The Oasis, which is a high-resolution digital reality where people play, work and live.<br /><br />The fun begins when one of the creators of The Oasis passes away and leaves his fortune to whoever wins his one final game, and to succeed the story's protagonist, Wade Watts, will need to be versed in all things 1980's.
B0061TQBRK|4.0|I have followed this band since I heard the great single Swamped. While this album may be one of their best since Comalies, do not spend any extra money on the \\"special\\" edition with the DVD. That has to be one of the worst pieces of musical crap I've ever bought. Instead of getting some bonus live footage, interviews or a studio documentary like I would have preferred, I got some lame pseudo Twilight horror movie set to music that was absolutely terrible. Buy the CD if you like Lacuna Coil (you won't be disappointed), but don't spend anything extra on the DVD edition unless you want to really feel like you wasted your hard earned money.
B004EPYZP8|1.0|Legal Ethics 101 would have prevented Mickey Haller from getting past the moment when he learns client A, the kid serial murderer, Louis Roulet (which anyone with half a brain could see coming from their first scene together), really killed the victim client B entered a plea of guilty for, upon Mickey's bad advice, years earlier.  There is no way he could represent client A, ethically, and should have withdrawn from the case. Plus, you cannot represent a client in a way that ultimately causes that client detriment.  And he breached the duty of confidentiality to do it by getting the information to the jailhouse snitch (and ruining the career of the prosecutor in the process).  Not to mention that he committed a crime himself by getting the fake snitch to commit perjury.  Aside from the ethics, the plot, though twisted, was contrived.  Why would Louis Roulet hire him?  Plus, what exactly was the set up?  A parking ticket near where the girl was murdered?  And what else?  Oh, yeah, there was the kind of surprise trick ending that the mother killed the Investigator, Levine, I guess to protect her spoiled rich son, although that relationship never got even a slight probing, probably because we had to probe the oddly untroubled former marriage of Haller and Margaret.  I felt bad for that poor kid who got the job of \\"acting\\" asleep as their daughter - in two scenes!  She'll probably go through life subject of mocking that she should have won an Oscar for the Best Sleeping Kid Actor Award.  And, geez, Macghoney was just too cool for school for my tastes.  And Margaret, his ex-wife, forgot her name, and their relationship was just too weird that it stretched my credulity.  Ah, another bad lawyer movie.  You want good lawyer movies, go watch The Verdict (Paul Newman), Anatomy of a Murder (James Stewart), Witness for the Prosecution.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm one of those readers that when I find a book, series, character, etc, that interests me I wont put it down.  When I first read \\"The Poet\\" by Michael Connelly I was so hooked that I bought every book he had out at that point, and blew threw each one in 1-2 days.  I'm a power reader, but it's hard to \\"hook\\" me.  I start/stop books often, because they can't grab my attention.  I had never heard of \\"The Hunger Games Trilogy\\" until a few weeks ago, and everyone was talking about it.  Apparently the trailers for the movie brought a resurgence of the books.  I was looking for more books as I had read the two \\"Ex\\" books (Ex-Heroes/Patriots) recently, and wanted to find something else that had a few books to keep me interested.  I found this.  I walked in not knowing a thing about the series.  I had never heard of it prior to a few weeks ago.  I had no idea what it was about, but I had found a reference to Battle Royale (which I am familiar with) and dug that idea so I just gave them a read.  I read every book in about 24hrs each.  The Hunger Games:  A brutal vision into a world so torn the capital finds it has to remind us, through horrible acts, that they won this war.  As I was reading I could definitely see the appeal to the target teen audience, but as an adult I was still glued to the pages.  The author went through great lengths to make a book that, at it's core, appealed to their target audience but was mirroring the evils of humanity, governments, and society in general that I couldn't get enough.  At time's it's calm, and other's its an all out battle.  The pages couldn't turn fast enough.  By the end of the book I was completely satisfied, and anxious to start the next.  Most books, in an intended series, leave off with a cliffhanger that makes you want to read the next, but doesn't really give you a sense of closure.  When the final page turned I felt the story ended perfectly, and more important with closure to the current portion of the storyline, and was excited to see where the next story went.  Catching Fire:  I wasn't 100% sure where they'd go with this.  THG ended in such a way that you knew where the series was going in terms of \\"the end game\\" but not how it would get there.  Being the middle book I wasn't sure where it would be taken.  Yet, very quickly it felt like I never left the world they created.  The story is told expertly, and as we watch Katniss, Peeta and everyone evolve from the first book it doesn't feel like it's a book made to bridge the gap until the end.  Especially with the \\"twists\\" throughout the book.  I honestly saw some, but didn't even consider others, but again when I turned that last page.  I immediately started reading the third because I had to know what was going to happen!  While the \\"closure\\" wasn't here with the end of this, it's clearly ending with a lead into the final book, it felt like they chose the perfect point to end.  The Mockingbird:  I was most surprised with this book.  With so many things behind us, in terms of the story, this was the book that I knew where it was going... but had no idea how it was going to get there, and what we'd see on the way.  The character development, the twists and turns, the heartache of seeing people we've read about die... it was, again, expertly done.  I also love, how many have said, the story isn't all rosey.  You knew, after moments in the first book, that the ending would not be as happy as most in this type of series is.  I wasn't dissapointed.  I really enjoyed the little twists, deaths, development, and when it was all said and done.  I really enjoyed where the key players ended up.  I thought it was fitting, in a way, and while it may not be as \\"full of rainbows\\" as some would like it's exactly where our key players should be.  All in all.  The series is a must read.  I know I left a lot of details out, almost all, but I wanted to just sort of say how I interpreted the book and not so much on \\"what happened\\" as I loved going into it knowing almost nothing.  If you're going to take anything from this.  Read the books.  They're worth it.  If you're a power reader like me.  Make sure you set time to do this.  I read each book in about a day each because I was so hooked into this world put in front of me.  In the end I only wish there was more.
0439023513|4.0|I would like to start by saying taken as a whole I really enjoyed the trilogy. That being said this was my least favorite book of the three. I think the reason I feel this way is not what the story said or how it ended,  but how it got there. The story built to this crescendo of events where you had many questions to be answered. These items were answered for the most part but not directly, not in the narrative of Katniss. It builds to this big finale and then answers the questions in flashback and not fully fleshed out. One is left with some questions and wondering how we got to the end point. Still I recommend highly.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I like this game because it is kind of hard and easy. It has many kind of games. it has levels and more!
0439023513|5.0|...war  District 12 is gone.  Peeta's captured by the Capitol.  The rebellion needs its figurehead, its symbol to rally the districts together in order to wage total war on President Snow and end three quarters of a century of oppression, violence and fear...that symbol is Katniss, the Mockingjay.  Based on word of mouth and just how trilogies work in general I knew I was in for something that was different than either of the previous two books.  The first was new and fresh, brutal in how it stripped children of their innocence in the gladiatorial way the Capitol kept its subjects in check and kept the luminous city of power itself pleased with the Hunger Games.  The second depicted the aftermath and the buds of the revolution.  Mockingjay, preparation and execution of the war against the capitol.  I'll be honest.  Reading through this book I was thinking I knew how it would end.  It wouldn't be a happy ending.  I didn't know how it would happen but I knew who Katniss would end up with (if any of them survived that is..and I'm not saying anything on that point).  Let's say I was right about some things and wrong about some things.  Wouldn't be the first time ;)  This book seems to have a polarizing effect.  A lot loved it, a lot hated it.  I know for me, about halfway through the book (although I was enjoying it) there was no way I was going to rate it a five.  Sending teens into battle against a superior enemy?  The propoganda sequences?  Frankly some of it, while still well written, seemed a little too...campy..but by the time I got to the end, it makes sense...The children of the districts are forced to mature at an early age...lack of convenience and the constant threat of starvation makes people turn into adults quickly..working manual labor makes them strong...this is nothing new historically speaking..and propoganda has always been used on both sides of wars as rallying points and to gain advantage...  and then I got to the end..and the end more than made upfor any of those shortcomings.  It's the end of this book and I do mean, the VERY end, the final pages, that really define the whole saga.  Things I thought I figured out really didn't pan out that way..things I did get right didn't happen in the way I thought they would..in other words, there's nothing cookie cutter here...the common cliches in a story such as this are avoided...the rug DOES get pulled out from under you (or at least it did for me)...the ending is one of the more satisfying to any trilogy or saga I've read in a long time..  You know you've just finished something special when you realize that that's it..no more...done...you won't be spending any more time with these characters and frankly you're saddened by it..  I hope the 'young adult' moniker doesn't throw off adults from reading this one...I'm in my 30s and I've enjoyed this as much any 'adult' fiction I've read previously. (Although I'm so late to the party on this one everyone has probably read it already!) The main characters may be kids but the themes and their voices are plenty mature.  Wonderful stuff.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|So I read the reviews, they all said this thing was beefy... but the pictures don't do it justice. Don't get me wrong this isn't the knife you want if you are trying to compensate for your short comings... It's not a fourteen inch, six pound, wanna be gladiator sword, that yanks down your pants every time you go behind the bushes. what it is, is a thick, sharp and very well crafted hunk of steel. Just like they tell you in the description, you can dissect a log with it and then turn around and slice up some parsley to garnish that freshly cooked pelican you just deftly prepared. What they don't tell you is that you can also pry open the door on your 66' Lincoln Continental if you lock your keys in it, or that you can use it as a make shift boat anchor while yachting through the Florida Keys. I'm very pleased with my purchase and those folks complaining about the size of this very sturdy and useful tool need to go do some wrist exercises. Yours truly, Ramshackle.

B005WGBQ9G|5.0|First let me say that I am not a fan of horror and in the past I've found zombie horror to be particularly loathsome, but I am me a huge fan of this show.  I think this is mostly due to the great character development.  The first episode was initially disturbing due to the graphic violence, but I stayed with it at the behest of my daughter.  By episode two, I was hooked.  Each character brings something unique to this morality tale. For those who chide the writers for not being accurate about such things as deer behavior, or wasting bullets, I say for goodness sake! You're watching a show about zombies!  Disbelief is suspended and literary license is allowed.  I love that the show is not just about violence and apocalyptic chaos as the \\"group\\" must find ways to cooperate to survive.  Also each individual faces challenges personally and the viewer is allowed to witness the decision making process as well as the consequences that follow.  I don't want to see hundreds of the walking dead decapitated each week and I certainly don't want to see my favorite characters destroyed.  I hope the body count is kept within reason (ok, funny)and that some resolution is found but this show is fantastic!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I am amused at the great divide of opinions on this book.  I come down solidly on the plus side.  I found previous Camel Club books to be somewhat boring.  In fact I quit reading them after the first two.  This one is a great improvement in holding my interest, but that is probably because the Camel Club is less central in this one.  All that being said, I really enjoyed the book.  It had a fair number of twists to keep things going.  On the minus side, Baldacci had to keep Stone a bit slow on figuring things out so that the story could proceed.  That did get a bit frustrating, but the eventual outcome was NOT obvious, at least to me.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I'm so glad that I decided to pick up this album, although I think I may need to get another copy! I probably played this album at least ten times the first couple of days after I had purchased it. The songs are just so good, that I kept having to go back and hear certain ones over and over again. Then I'd play the entire album a few times. Needless to say that this album is a masterpiece. I think what I like about this album (and the band in general) is that their style of music is new, but it also reminds me a lot of the kind of music I grew up listening to. I'm just glad Maroon 5 is only getting better with age and still going strong three records in. More power to 'em!! Looking forward to the next release

B0053JJLLC|2.0|If you, like me, often read in low light with reversed text (my wife is a light sleeper) you will have a problem with this book on the FIRE. This ebook only supports black text. When Sepia background is selected, the text remains black instead of the normal dark brown. In reversed mode you get black text on black background. None of my other books have this problem nor does it appear on my PC app or my iPad app.  As to the book itself, there is very little Michael Crichton here. The science is basic and the plot worn out. The small people vs large insects has been done better by \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man\\",\\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\\", Asimov's \\"Incredible Journey\\" (shrunk people vs antibodies), and even Jules Verne's \\"Mysterious Island\\".  There is little about any of the characters to identify with and the writing is disjointed.  Overall a bad effort to recover a manuscript.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|This is series based on three novels published in the 1940s about a young woman and the families in two particular towns. The stories are set in the late 1800s, just before the turn of the century. The novels are semi-autobiographical, so they have an honest appeal to them.<br /><br />The events that occur are not the earth shattering and ground breaking instances that most major series are filled with. Instead the stories revolve around everyday life in these two hamlets. Lark Rise is conservative, smaller, and more remote. Candleford is a town on the rise with influences from near and far. We see these influences with such subtle hints as the unveiling of the latest Parisian fashions for example. Several of the stories deal with family issues, debts, and work.

The roles are played well with an emphasis on subtlety, instead of the more dramatic performances in series such as Downton. The acting and the sets remind me a lot more of Cranford, despite the 40 or 50 year gap in their time periods.<br /><br />Though the series starts with young Laura as the apparent main character, she acts more as a foil to the other various characters.

B0050LJIRK|4.0|The people of today seemed skeptical of Limp Bizkit's brand new album that was released just last year. They've probably heard of all the negative reaction from the mainstream media. And seeing as how this album received mixed reviews from both critics and audiences, the band's future appears grim once again. Personally, I do like the album, though it's a bit unsatisfactory for one reason: it all sounds the same. I may be biased, but a majority of the songs sound a bit too old-school. You would expect Limp Bizkit to alter their sounds a bit after all these years. Fortunately, however, the album is just as good as their classic ones (Three Dollar Bill Y'All, Significant Other). The songs are politically incorrect: you can tell that Fred, John, Sam, Wes, and DJ Lethal go all out as always. Full of profane words and hardcore sounds, the songs would easily anger groups such as the FCC. \\"Gold Cobra\\" and \\"Get a Life\\" are full of adrenaline, while the soft and lyrical \\"Walking Away\\" is absolutely perfect. \\"Shark Attack\\" is probably the weakest song on this album (same can be said about \\"Loser\\"). The rest of the songs (including \\"Bring it Back\\" and \\"Autotunage\\") are satisfactory, very decent to listen to.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily call this an excellent album. It has its poorly developed moments, but overall, it's nice to see Limp Bizkit back with Gold Cobra. I would take this album over the more mainstream trash that's plaguing our radios.<br /><br />Grade: 7.4 out of 10

B0067BXPUI|4.0|The book \\"Love You Forever\\" is a 5 stars story.  I read it often to my children, especially my oldest son who was a lot like the two year old in this story.  Recently I bought the recordable version to give as a gift. While I was recording it I realized that Hallmark left out the page where the mother drives across town at night to her son's house.  Maybe this was in response to the reviewers that took this part of the story literally but I was disappointed to find this part of the story missing thus the 4 star rating for the recordable version. This story makes it clear that a mother's love is forever no matter how you behave, how old you are, or how far from home you happen to be.  Thank you Robert Munsch for this beautiful story.  Hallmark did a disservice in not printing it in it's entirety.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I do not generally buy second copies of anything. I don't like to buy blu-rays of movies I already own on DVD, and I certainly don't buy into the \\"New limited collectors edition super special remastered remixed ultra mega edition!!!\\" of anything. But Aqualung. Oh Aqualung. This is a CD that I used to play for people to show how bad a CD could sound if you didn't master it properly. The 1987 edition is, to be charitable, a disaster.<br /><br />So when I saw this, I was intrigued. I was tempted. And finally, I was convinced to try it. In a word: wow. This is the release that this album has always deserved. Every single track is noticeably better. Gone is the awful hiss. Gone is the hollow, tinny sound. Gone is the distorted, clipped piano. In its place is a masterpiece. Songs that used to get skipped by me, like Cheap Day Return, suddenly have presence, power and depth. Now I'm ashamed to say I always skipped that track... Locomotive Breath has begged for this release since the day it was recorded.<br /><br />The second disc did not factor even the slightest little bit in my purchase decision, but it should have. I really like Lick Your Fingers Clean, a song I've never heard before (it has been released before, but I'm a casual fan, not a huge follower of the band). There are a bunch of other tracks that I have never heard before but they complement the main content very well. I'm not a big fan of alternate takes and early versions, but I know for some fans that's a huge draw here.<br /><br />If you like this album at all, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. I can't emphasize enough how much of a difference this release makes.

098478280X|5.0|Cracking the coding interview is one book you should definitively have in your bookshelf, and you should keep reading it now and then.  I have a passion for reading and solving coding interview questions and never found such a detailed source of information.  The book starts with several suggestions on how preparing yourself for an interview. This is an aspect that many people underestimate, whilst having a well-written CV, a personal blog, and possibly a number of open source projects is definitively important. This book gives you a number of good suggestions.  Then there is long part discussing interview questions with a broad coverage of basic data structures, algorithms, programming languages, databases and threads and some advanced coding questions.  The style is concise and you can read each Chapter in isolation.  Gayle made an amazing job in illustrating not just the solutions, but several techniques that you can use for solving new problems. Plus, those interview questions, the solutions and the techniques, are not just hypothetical but are very useful in your day by day life as Dev or Researcher.  I would suggest the author splitting the Chapter 7 \\"Mathematics and Probability\\" into two separate parts and expand both of them because they are very important during interviews and the current  description is probably too synthetic. Also, a Chapter on String algorithms and another one on Parallel programming would be probably useful to have because people will look for them elsewhere.  Having said that, this is definitively a must have book and the money you spend will definitively generate a great return on the investment.  Thanks Gayle for writing it.

0812992792|3.0|I have to admit that I bought this book due to the large number of \\"5 star reviews\\" so I settled in figuring I'd be up all night  reading this novel. I was wrong. The book is a beautifully written book, but at the same time, it's a tiring book to read. The main  character, Jun Do, finds himself in the insane world of North Korea where he ends up in prison and kills a famous General who is  in prison (going to prison in North Korea doesn't take much....the paranoia of the government puts the famous General in prison  for no real legitimate reason). Jun Do finally finds himself back out into the insane world of North Korea where he  then replaces the General and the role the General had to his beautiful wife (confused? So was I!). The author has apparently done  a lot of homework in learning how the North Korean people survive in a nation full of lies, deceit and political paranoia.  The book's plot and the way he wrote the book moved around too much. I had to put it down and then pick it up and re-read a page or pages to figure out what was happening to the various characters. The fascination of North Korea and the propaganda speeches in the book are scary, haunting and gives a great insight into the psyche of the North Korean government and its power over its people, but this book just wore me down and when it was over  I found that to review it and give it more than three stars would be fair. It's a good read, not a great read.

0393338827|4.0|Lewis writes in such a snappy and witty manner about motivations behind financial transactions and the way bankers thought about the securities they were selling and packaging. It's amazing to hear the stories about intimidation, incompetence, and bad management, and he really brings to life the way the markets moved against the housing market as well as how derivatives were structured and sold, particularly how CDS bets acted like bonds and were really CDOs on the other side. It's incredible to learn that the paper wealth generated really was out of thin air, and that bankers just couldn't find enough faulty borrowers to fund their securitization machine; there are some stories like how borrowers would default on their first payment after taking out a loan that are hilarious and worth the price alone.  That said, this is not exactly Anna Karenina. It's a fast fluffy read, like candy; all the characters are pretty stereotyped (either unconventionally smart or dumb as rocks; either handsome and charming or completely incompetent and hostile). He demands why the street isn't as smart as \\"a person with Asperger's,\\" or asks \\"how can the [second smartest man in China], who doesn't know English, lie?\\" way to go for cheap shots, michael lewis. i love stereotypes as much as the next person but it seems cheap to turn it into a joke or pass it off as charming insight.  Characterization aside, there are some broad macro issues that are just not addessed, which is disappointing because Lewis is usually so insightful about the hivemind and the gaming and trading going on. It's almost simplistic in the way it portrays trades going into the crisis, as if there was no possible chance that the other side could be right given what trash was underlying the securities, even though we know that for every bear there were probably 1,000 bulls at the time--smart people--smart, profitable firms were holding these toxic assets on their books--what were they thinking? Lewis makes it seem likeeveryone at the investment banks were crooks, and in retrospect everything's obvious, but these firms bought into their own dog food too, which is totally irrational if they knew what they were doing. Why?  He rails on the government for bailing these risk-blind, irresponsible parties out with golden parachutes, but doesn't say enough about systemic risk and about what the Fed was thinking during crisis moments, or what the other options were, or suggest ways of fixing financial services to serve the consumer. A fun and amusing read that describes toxic assets and the root of the crisis, though not an all-inclusive history. I would have loved to hear about AIG, about the rally, about structural weaknesses. At times I was on the edge of my seat--like when people were realizing that after they had bought these CDS's that shot up in value they were going to be worthless because of counterparty risk--so it's definitely an exciting, single-trade-oriented book that gets into the mindsight of these investors with an additional shot of a moral lecture without apology.
1400049628|4.0|This book isn't an \\"endurance read,\\" but there were times when the fun was slightly spoiled by repetition.  On many occasions, I said out loud, \\"yeah, I get it. Zombies can only be killed by destroying the head.\\" Oddly enough, this can sometimes adds to the fiction told in a nonfiction style that makes this interesting.  This book knows no one is going to take it as nonfiction.  That means that the nonfiction style it's written adds to the outlandishness of it all.  Telling something so impossible and fantastical just like it's really real keeps the reader interested and engaged.  Similarly , it combines spoofy, hollywood zombie cliches that we have all come to know and love, and mixed that with the nonfiction style for a creative narrative that keeps you engaged.  The drawings also fit in nicely and contributed further to the \\"fiction nonfiction\\" style unique to this book.  Even though this book is written as nonfiction, it delivers a surprisingly strong narrative.  Personal accounts and \\"historical\\" records give it plenty of character.  When those are combined with the scientific way it's written, it does a very good job of making the reader check his/her closet before going to bed.  It creates an almost tangible atmosphere.  I know that those who have read this book know EXACTLY what they would do in the impossible situation presented.  After reading this, you know exactly what you would do for blockading, what to do about food, who you would seek out for help first. Hell, the thought of firearms as a hobby (something I have absolutley no experience or interest in) entered my mind.  This book isn't without its flaw, but if you let it, it will grab you and not let go.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|I Know this case is kind of cheap but I like it so far  I didn't install the screen protector (I didn't use it yet).  I only used the case and I am using it since August 2011. It is very durable and protected my iphone from several falls  may be somebody doesn't like the \\"amazon basics\\" label at the cell phone back. I don't have problems with it  I think (I didn't try it) a person could scratch the name from the case.  The only disadvantage (not the case's fault though) is that the iphone 4 signal is enhanced but not as much as some other cases ( I was with a friend and she showed me her iphone 4 signal and it was 1 line higher than me and she was using a different case)  Anyways  i recommend buying this product but I will give it 4 stars

B003LZ5B7S|1.0|It starts off pretty good, suggesting it was set in a racially tolerant world, then goes on to do a very good job of emasculating the black race, portraying them as craven or cowardly, then ends with \\"the superhero\\" stealing the guys girlfriend with a flashy display of his powers,...i.e now operating on his id and not his superego.  All in all, looked like the white supremacist version of what a super hero would look like.  Well done BBC, for turning back race relations about 50 years back in time!

B000MQ54OY|1.0|This film failed to grab my attention. Impressive visuals can't hide the fact that this movie is terrible. The plot is mediocre (singing penguins discriminate a dancing penguin, LAME.) No memorable characters. The adult penguins are ugly,especially in HD, they could have at least made them \\"cute\\". The main character (dancing penguin)lacks charisma. The voice acting is bland and uninspiring, it's as if the actors are reading from the script instead of acting it out. Any Disney animated film would put these voice actors to shame. And  it would've been nice if the penguins performed songs made specifically for the film ala Disney, but it seems like the Happy Feet songs are borrowed from the radio. I hate to be comparing this to Disney. But Disney is the gold standard by which all others are measured by.

0439023521|4.0|This is not a book I would ever have chosen to read. I find its premise disgusting. My daughter (10) was given this book as a present from one of her teachers. Since she is such a reluctant reader, yet was eager to read The Hunger Games in anticipation of seeing the movie, I decided the best way to handle it was to read it with her.<br /><br />The plot aside, Collins is a masterful storyteller. She knows how to pull the reader in and keep them turning the pages. What unfolds is the story of a bright, independent young woman who learns to hunt illegally so that she can feed her family now that her father is gone. She has a close, yet confusing relationship with Gale, who also hunts.<br /><br />Katniss is soon turned into a brave sibling, who protects her younger sister from certain death. The other tribute from District 12 is Peeta Mellark, the bread boy. It is Peeta's budding friendship with Katniss that provides the emotional side to this tale of death and woe. The kids have been trained for survival. Without the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, you simply have a story of horrible loss of life.<br /><br />This isn't a book I would have allowed my daughter to read without me. It contains graphic violence that is more appropriate for older teens and adults.

B003MC5N28|4.0|I am not going to join the masses about what an amazing book this is.  I think it is a good book, and definitely a powerful read for children since it introduces some thought provoking questions and makes some very pertinent points about individuality, the balance of pain and pleasure, and other such topics.  But I was not amazed by the book.  The story lacks a certain depth that I'm accustomed to, which is likely attributed to the fact that it is a children's book.  I'd give it five stars for being a great read *as a child's book*.  From an adult perspective, it's probably more of a three star book.
B004A8ZWW4|3.0|The robot fights and their associated sound tracks is pretty good, especially if you have home theater system. But as other reviewers mentionned, its really a movie<br />made for kids as the young lad in this movie is pretty smart...talks a lot and likes<br />to give orders, that 's pretty good for a 11 year old kid.... So once you have that<br />out of the way, you have the story.<br />If i was a under 16, i would love this movie...but for a adult, the movie is not<br />bad, but could have been better.<br />I liked it,but its not a keeper,thats enough teary google eyes for one session.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|I almost didn't pick up this book (even when it was on sale for 99 cents) because of some of the reviews I read.  I'm glad I ignored those reviews, and went with my gut instinct to give the book a chance.  Yes, I could see how the book could be considered boring in comparison to other high-intensity plot novels.  But if you enjoy description and detail and are not looking for one exciting twist of plot after another, you'll very much so enjoy this book.  I thoroughly enjoyed this read.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|For a few bucks, this device solves a big problem: connecting my new Apple TV (optical output) to my old amp (RCA). I like the build quality of the product (tight fit and form) and it worked, no problems, right out of the box. One of my amps supported digital inputs, but it won't pass the signal through at analog RCA. Probably some stupid copy protection nonsense. With the FiiO D3, it all just works.  One tip: Plug the FiiO into the switched outlet in the back of your amp - then it only powers on when you are listening.

B0069GRIHW|1.0|Not again, please! How many times are The Doors going to reissue L.A.Woman? The definitive version will always be the original vinyl LP and if you don't own that already, simply buy the 180g remastered version released a couple of years ago. If you don't own a turntable anymore then the next best thing will be the already available 2007 CD issue which contains two genuine extra songs on it. However whilst the 2007 version is slightly remixed it is BETTER sounding that the original mix with far more depth and space allowing the listener into the atmosphere created by the band in their rehearsal workshop - highly recommended!  Don't forget also that the ORIGINAL stereo mix of this album has also been available in the digital domain since 1987 and has never been out of print. The original CD's were great sounding but the 1999 remastered versions do sound better.  So where does all that leave THIS issue? Well, you get the original AGAIN (yawn) with a further disc of rough early takes of only some of the songs that made it onto the actual album. Nothing revealing or earth shattering here, I can guarantee you. These early takes were always destined for the can and are totally unnecessary. The so-called new song is probably the weakest track The Doors have ever released. It is a rough lazy blues jam with an inebriated high-spirited Morrison ad-libbing it poorly through four minutes. You will be begging it to stop after the first listen.  All in all this is a travesty of a release and a disgrace that this band is milking fans once more with a re-re-re-re-issue of material they know we will already have. If you're a newbie, you'll also be better served elsewhere.  With every passing year, and every 'new' Doors release my appreciation for my one-time favourite band is slipping. The post-Morrison marketing policy just taints the whole catalogue for me.  And whoopee! I hear there is more of L.A. Woman to come soon!
0525423656|3.0|*Beware! This review may contain spoilers for Matched!*<br /><br />Crossed picks up pretty much right where Matched left off. Cassia and Ky have both left Oria.

All the while, Cassia is missing her home, family, and Xander.<br /><br />Both Ky and Cassia have one thing in common: they want to find each other. When the time is right, both of our main characters make a run for it and end up in the \\"Carving\\" - a network of mountains and crevices, a maze in which they can hopefully find safety from the Society as well as a way to get back to each other, all while searching for the answers they both so desperately need.<br /><br />Throughout their separate journeys, they each meet new people that aid them along the way and become new additions to the plot. This journey also brings up more questions than ever, and when secrets that may be unforgivable arise, Cassia and Ky wonder if they can ever be together at the end of this mess.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />Ally Condie has an amazingly beautiful, and poetic writing style.

None of our questions were answered, and the book left me with a huge question mark over my head.<br /><br />It's slow. Slower than death from the right from the start. We get a little surge of power through the middle, but it fizzles out again toward the end. I spent almost the entire book waiting for something big, but it never came. I think, in part, it's because this book is from the POV of both Cassia and Ky. Whenever I was reading from Ky's POV, I was bored to tears. It was 80% inner dialogue and blasts to the past. It was like an entirely different story was going on. There was so much inner turmoil to slog through that it took away from the issues at hand, and it became info-dumpy and bored me.<br /><br />My other complaint about the alternating POVs is that they weren't distinguished enough. I sometimes found myself having to check whose POV I was reading from. They didn't have distinctive voices and I found it annoying.<br /><br />My likes?<br /><br />As I said before, Ms. Condie is a truly truly talented writer.

It's a little bit different from any other YA romance I've read. When I read Matched I really wanted Ky and Cassia to beat the odds, struggle through the diversity, the whole idea of \\"matching\\"... and end up together. After reading Crossed, my views changed.

0439023513|5.0|For some reason people gave this book negative ratings/reviews. I really don't see how. This is one of the best series I've ever read. And, hopefully if the movie is done close enough to the book, if not exactly- one of the best film series since The Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter, or Legend of the Seeker (tv show but I can't think of any more movies).   Granted, there were some parts that made think, \\"okay, that was a stupid way to react\\", but remember this is a teenager who reacts before she thinks through most of the book. And the author portrayed her as somewhat reserved. (SPOILER ALERT) I also think her reaction to her sister's death was understandable. After everything she went through, the crying, screaming, fighting, and hurting, the only thing left was to completely shut down. That does happen. Also, all through the book she voices or thinks about how she just wants to be left alone, free from the capitol, the games, the fighting, and the politics controlling everyone's lives. In the end, she is left alone. I also didn't see that as a bad thing.  All-in-all a very good series. I hate that I'm finished but glad that the story has an ending that didn't seem like it was pulled out of nowhere.

B004XANKVO|4.0|I bought this bag when I couldn't find an Oakley bag that fit my need.  I needed a place for my 13\\" MacBook Pro, Kindle touch, cables, external drives, and have plenty of room for other gear.  This bag gets the job done and does a pretty good job of keeping it organized as well.  The only issue I have with it is the main pocket should really have at least a couple more mesh pockets.  There is a lot of space in the bag and I find myself digging to the bottom for things that don't fit elsewhere, but would be fine with just a little better organization.

On to the music.<br />Well this is an album that has taken some time to grow on me which is rather unexpected after I warmed to the debut album right from the start. III just didn't grab me at all besides a few stand out tracks, but after many repeated plays over the last few months I'm pleased to say that it has grown on me. Much like some drug, Sammy Hagar has a voice that I really get a kick out of listening to and always look forward to more. For a guy in his mid 60's he is showing no signs of slowing down, and his vocal chords don't seem to have suffered any noticeable wear and tear over the years at all. On III Hagar sounds as good as ever. Chad Smith... funny guy, seems a bit of a wild card, looks like Will Farrell, Chili Pepper, plays drums, `nuff said. Joe Satriani... master guitarist who really seems to be enjoying his gig here, finally able to play some stuff in a band like he's always wanted to do, without doing everything and the pressure that can come with that to deliver the expected wizardry. This album does see him branching out a bit more than on the last album though, with some retro guitar effects and riffs, plus a little banjo in Something Going Wrong. Michael Anthony... yeah he can play bass, but his high voice and ability to sing great backing vocals makes him the secret ingredient in the Chickenfoot recipe. It seems that he's been given far more freedom and input into this band than he ever had in Van Halen, and on III we hear him even more than on the first album which is a big plus.<br />Songs that immediately stood out as personal favorites are: Different Devil which is exactly the kind of stuff I love Hagar singing, very melodic, sounding just as good as any of his best Van Halen or solo stuff. The excellent ballad Come Closer is sublime, and even though they have a more mellow sound to them, I could quite easily take a whole album of songs like these two. The straight forward, bluesy and somewhat retro sounding rocker Bigfoot is simple yet catchy, foot tapping, head banging stuff. Dubai Blues has great bass driving the song, and as the title suggests it does sound bluesy. I love this kinda stuff!<br />Something Going Wrong is also a definite highlight for me, much more of a traditional sounding blues song in the vein of the bonus track Bitten By The Wolf from the first album with great acoustic guitar and as mentioned previously, a subtle dose of banjo in the back ground, and a nice bluesy electric solo. And just as you think it's gonna finish, it picks up again and continues for over another minute. Gimme more of this anytime!<br />For me it's just a shame that the rest of the album isn't this good. After initially thinking Alright Alright was a good song ruined by a bad chorus, it's infectiousness set in on me and now I don't mind it at all and consider it the next best song after those mentioned above, followed by the opener Last Temptation which isn't bad but doesn't really give the album a kick start at all. Up Next and Lighten Up are ok, but average songs really with the repeated \\"pearly gates\\" lyrics of the former getting quite annoying. However at the 2.36 minute mark when it goes all Van Halen-ish I love it. Unfortunately it doesn't last and Hagar arrives at the pearly gates again. Three And A Half Letters is in my opinion the worst song on the album. No matter how the letters in question affected Hagar and no matter how poignant the lyrics are, the song is just plain boring with a very poor chorus. I would much rather have had a better song (sung as opposed to spoken), and read the letters in a cover booklet (then again, I'd like to have anything at all in a cover booklet to read... but I wasn't goingto get into the cover art/packaging thing was I ?).<br />My version of this album has a bonus DVD but not the bonus song. However having obtained that song and having listened to it frequently on my car stereo I'm not too fussed that I don't have an original version of it. It's an ok song, but just average really. It's another that suffers from lyrical repetition with \\"they lied about...\\" and the chorus isn't very good either.<br />Whilst there are some aspects of III which are an improvement on the first album, this one doesn't seem to have the loose jam type vibe to it which I thought was a big plus for the first. Plus it's let down by a totally rubbish song and a few average ones, so whilst there is lots to like about it, it just doesn't quite hit the mark for me as well as the first Foot did. But hey, it's a very good album none the less.cover art/packaging thing was I ?).  My version of this album has a bonus DVD but not the bonus song.

B00516ZWRE|5.0|There is absolutely no doubt that Saxon are making a statement with their latest album Call To Arms.  The cover lets everyone know that without doubt this is a departure from their previous few albums.  Gone are the gothic images, instead replaced with a no frills Lord Kitchener pointing the finger at all of us metal heads, emphatically calling us to arms, to join with Saxon and fly the metal flag high over all we conquer!  (There's even a tip of the hat to the past with the \\"Militia Guard\\" cap badge.)  Gone too is the gothic intro we've become accustomed to with recent Saxon releases as instead they launch straight into the metal with a no frills guitar riffing Saxon assault in Hammer Of The Gods to open the album in full force.  Then it's what Biff describes as a \\"Denim And Leather type song\\" with Back In '79 and it is.  A slower paced metal anthem with pounding drums, a big riff, crowd chanting chorus and a lyrical joining of fans and band as Biff takes us back to when it all began and we were all there together (if not physically then in spirit).<br />If by now anyone hasn't realized that this album is aimed squarely at fans of the bands early years, then they probably won't get into this album that much at all.  But for anyone who like me is a huge fan of the NWOBHM era Saxon then this album is a welcome return to all that we loved about this band in the first place.  Yet at the same time they have cleverly kept enough of a modern tinge to the music so that recent fans might indeed find some appeal and could in fact be drawn back to their first four or five albums.<br /><br />The albums highlights are undoubtedly Mists Of Avalon with it's wonderful melodic chorus and the title track which is another great Saxon war song, but one which conveys the emotion of loss and longing rather than guts, glory and/or horror.  But I think what makes this album a bit better than the last few is not only a return to a less heavy, more melodic and straight forward sound, but also the quality and consistency of what could be described as the \\"second tier\\" songs.  The recent albums Into The Labyrinth, The Inner Sanctum and Lionheart each contained many moments of absolute Saxon bliss but were let down a little bit (just a little... these guys are always very reliable) by some filler.  But with Call To Arms that isn't the case at all.  Surviving Against The Odds and Chasing The Bullet are great Straight ahead Saxon rockers to please any fan, and Afterburner is Fire In The Sky or 20,000 Feet for the new millennium.<br />Then modern era Saxon shines through with When Doomsday Comes and another favorite No Rest For The Wicked which sounds quite  \\"Metalhead-esque\\".  Ballad Of The Working Man is probably the weakest track in my opinion but it still isn't too bad and sounds very reminiscent of something from Wheels Of Steel or Denim And Leather.  The album closer is the orchestral version of the title track, but personally I prefer the normal version which I think works better for the more straight forward sound they were going for with this album.<br /><br />And then at 43 minutes it's over.  Again I think a deliberate move by the band to make an album like they used to be made, before everyone expected a 70 minute CD to be filled.  No padding the album out, no fluff, just straight into the metal and there you have it.<br />Over all a very well-conceived and well executed album that should please the fans, with Saxon showing why they have been around for over 30 years, and why they deserve to be recognized up there with the great bands that are their contemporaries in Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.and consistency of what could be described as the \\"second tier\\" songs.

If the option is not needed why do they have the option to sync it down.  This is a custom build for fire, so I would have thought that they would remove this.

B000FC1HBY|3.0|Too wordy, not enough action (which is okay if the book has romance but it doesn't), had me wanting to skip chapters to get to the meat of the story only to find out there wasn't any meat. This is a long series, I know, and I wasn't expecting more then I got from this book....was it as good as book #1? No, but I have faith in the reviews on here & I heard the action picks up in the next book so I will give it a go. I really wish Martin would chill out on the number of characters in this book (I struggled to remember who was who) & let a little light shine on some of the people (I know \\"The winter is here\\" & its a war book but come on, its a bit of a depressing read). Also, the Danerie's story got boring & it seemed like Martin was giving me every little grubby detail about her trip & sorry but I just didn't find any of it interesting. I hate giving this a 3 star because I read it and enjoyed it but my eyes wandered & I felt like I was given too much detail that wasn't interesting so I had to deduct stars. Maybe the next book will be better, I will try one more.<br /><br />Update: I read the next book and it gets MUCH better.

B00005JKG9|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and recently tracked it down again, since I now work in real estate sales.  I'm not sure what David Mamet's experience was working in real estate in the 1970's but the (real life) real estate world of today looks absolutely NOTHING like this!  I think that's the reason us realtors joke about it and find this film so funny is because it's the exact opposite of how real business is done.  The cast is brilliant and despite the profanity, if you can appreciate the dry humor and 'A+' talent, acting like egotistical children then you'll love the interaction.  Anyone who has young kids will appreciate the banter (just watch AFTER your kids have gone to bed).  In reality, this film depicts used car salesman, not realtors, but regardless, it's funny stuff!  No one in today's real estate market, or modern office environment, would EVER get away with the things these guys do and say, which makes it all the more funny.  REALISTICALLY, if you believe this is how the real world is... you'll hate this film!  If you understand it for what it is... pure satire, then you may find this is a classic top 100 film of all time.

B006H3MIV8|1.0|I was very excited for this album, especially after hearing the Johnny Cash song on the first CD.  After that first song this entire album was full of disappointment.  Song after song of bloated over textured pretty voices unraveling all the Dylan classics.  I do not think any of these artist took this opportunity seriously.  Sting, I love you, but your version of Girl from North Country does not come close to the soulful version of Ain't No Sunshine on your unplugged set in 1991, where is the love and craft?  I could go on and one but I will not... other than the fact DMB just recycled a live version of All Along the Watchtower that makes Jimi Hendrix spin in his grave.  At least U2's 1989 version on Rattle and Hum has a pulse (not really a great one) I have seen more life in the eyes of a shark.  My advice is to donate to Amnesty International, its a good cause, unlike this over produced Frankenstein that has no heartbeat!
0385534639|4.0|Sometimes there are magicians who pretend to have magic, but are simply skilled at illusion. Other times there are magicians who have real magic but have to pretend they are just illusions. The Night Circus is spawned and one of the latter magicians audition for the illusionist job. She has been practicing and training all her life to face her competition. She does not yet know who they are, but they know who she is. They are playing a game that has rules not made clear to them. The circus and all the people involved are pawns, and sometimes sacrifices are made. The two competitors get in too deep, when they let their emotions get the better of them. Few people know of this hidden secret that the circus keeps, most are just dazzled by it's elegance and whimsy. Step inside a tent and perk up your ears to hear the story of Le Cirque des Rêves.<br /><br />What a wonderful story. I never wanted it to end. I took my time with this, devouring just one morsel at a time. The story plays out as if you were meandering around the circus. Lazy circles and flying between past and present until they intertwine. I loved all the characters in this, especially the twins Poppet and Widget. They were just a nice fresh feel in the circus and they just seemed like very fun, smart kids. I adore the idea of a circus only open at night, especially one that is all black and white. Very fancy and gorgeous. This book doesn't necessarily have to be read too much in order. You could easily skip around within the first 300 pages and probably not be too lost. It would be a shame to read it that way the first time through though. The first time you should read it start to finish and then you'll probably want to pick it up again and explore the chapters in a different way. Each chapter is a black and white tent, with mystery and wonder inside dying to be explored. I recommend this to people who love magic and romance and mystery and a whimsical story.<br />Celia takes on so much in this novel, and her father is a pain. I can't imagine having to put up with him. He and his friend do seem a bit too old to be playing the same game. Celia's father just seems very pompous and childish, after all the years he's been around, it seems like he simply has not grown up yet. Marco is charming. That's not all there is to him, but he certainly falls comfortably into his skin. The tents he invents for the circus are just amazing. I wish I could run away with this circus. They could hide me in a trunk, I wouldn't mind. All the characters were unique and unforgettable though, and they were just amazing people with great vision.<br />The near ending sort of bothered me though, some of the last few chapters had that wrapping up the story feel to them, seemed a bit forced. It felt like there were things that we were supposed to garner from the book and the author wanted to make sure we got them. I did like the very ending though. It was prefect and almost how I thought it might end. A very lovely novel. I can not wait to read another novel by Erin Morgenstern because this one was simply awing.<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"The circus arrives without warning.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Line:<br />\\"The spreading moss is crushed by deep plum and sparkling gold as he pulls her away.\\"a pain.

0312641893|3.0|Cinder Linh is an orphan. She is looked after by her adoptive father's wife after he died. She has two of her own girls though, human girls. Cinder is a cyborg, which means that she is worthless in most people's eyes. The only thing she's good for is earning money as a mechanic. Though her life is not enviable, it's good enough for now. Then Prince Kai comes to her to ask Cinder to fix one of his androids. Soon after, her favorite sister gets the plague and everyone blames Cinder, even though Cinder is fine. The Prince has many struggles and heaped onto that is a forbidden attraction. Cinder is just trying to help her sister and find an escape to a better life. With all the chaos stirred up, they might have to look to each other for some help.<br /><br />YAY, a re-telling of Cinderella. This was a fun story and a great take on the classic. One thing that really disappointed me, is that the big secret was obvious within the first 50 pages. That takes a lot away from the reading experience, when you know exactly what's going to happen. The journey to the reveal was good though, so it was not a wasted reading adventure. I really enjoyed Cinder and Iko's characters. The banter between the two of them was fun and light. Prince Kai was charming and funny too. He was a very like-able guy, which is a curious but welcomed trait in royalty. I really enjoyed the cyber take on Cinderella, it made the story quite fresh especially with the added Lunar people aspect. The whole setting was really interesting, but sort of downplayed. The environment was nor payed too much attention to, which I guess the characters wouldn't, but I just felt like NEW BEIJING! could have been amazing, but just felt like any other place on Earth. Cinder's cyborg struggle with her identity was also a bit lackluster. She seemed to just start to delve into a deep thought about her machine versus human parts, but then something always seems to distract her. Each part of the story started with a snippet of the original which was fun. This was a good read and I look forward to the next one. I was very disappointed with how this one ended though. It ended right in the beginning of a big action-y scene. It's a clever but painful ploy making the reader have to read the next book for resolution.

B00422LESE|2.0|The press welcomed the new book (yeah, not new anymore!) of Stephen Hawking emphasizing the few lines related to the existence/non-existence of god. A lot of crazy talks started and, for the amusement of Hawking I guess, the book received huge promotion. The quality of the comments were not important as long as people was discussing (and buying) the book.<br /><br />To my opinion those sentences were quite irrelevant. That was not the subject of the book but a very good promotional ticket, that's it!<br /><br />Now let's focus on the real content of the book.<br />I believe three quarters of it are just repeating concepts already described in previous Hawking (popular) publications. I understand you can't describe new ideas without some introduction and generic background but they occupy most of the book!<br /><br />The last quarter contains the only interesting ideas yet the reader should remember that nothing has been fully proved and my opinion as popular reader is that we're still in the brainstorming phase, as a consequence I don't like all the triumphalism and pretended knowledge on how the universe really works. Sobriety, that would be nice.<br /><br />I just wrote about quarters, like a football game, and I didn't really mentioned what's the content! Briefly, the subjects are simplified descriptions of... always the same subjects, i.e. M-theory, quantum mechanics, theory of relativity, multiverse, ...<br /><br />If you are a passionate of the popular science genre and you already read many books on the subject then I suggest you to look somewhere else, you'll be bored here. If you want to read a Stephen Hawking's book then I suggest you The Universe in a Nutshell.<br /><br />In conclusion, there is no sparkle here. I'd expect better and more brilliant content from Stephen Hawking, but yet here we are, simply disappointing.<br /><br />That was a sober review eh? :P

B0019X3YXM|2.0|... to ruin a great movie.  Wow, where to start on this remake?  First of all, I am a huge fan of the original Korean movie; if you have not seen it, please stop reading now and go do so; I can almost guarantee that if you like chick flicks, a la \\"The Notebook\\", that you will like the Korean version, and perhaps even love it, like I did.  So what's wrong with this remake?  CAUTION - SPOILERS AHEAD  Within the first five minutes of the movie, it had already gone off the rails.  Maybe it never even got on the rails.  The opening music was a variation, a worse variation, on the opening music to the original movie.  So I didn't like the music, big deal.  But the huge, waving red flag was how the subject of the cousin's death was introduced.  The male lead is positively flippant about his cousin having just died.  It was like the movie wanted to play the cousin's death for a laugh or something.  This was most likely the fault of the writer, but it's hard not to blame the actor and director too.  I actually like the two lead actors, but Elisha Cuthbert was seriously miscast in this movie.  She's not old, but she's too worldly to pull off the irrational behavior required by the script.  In the Korean original, the actress was innocent and almost tomboyish; she didn't have any \\"feminine wiles\\"; she's just innocent, sweet, and suffering.  The audience forgives her behavior because she is so innocent and sweet, and you see her heartbreak in almost every frame.  The problem is, Cuthbert's character seems like she ought to know better, and she exudes a sexiness and lack of innocence that is wrong for the character.  It made me wonder if the character might be a part-time dominatrix or something.  Next, the editing: was the editor asleep?  There is a whole scene missing:  the male lead takes the girl to his apartment, there's a cut, and now he's walking out of jail.  At least I think he's walking out of jail.  What the hell just happened?  This is very near the beginning of themovie, and yet another big red flag of things to come.  Now I come to the most egregious of the factors that ruined this remake: the writing.  I'm not a vindictive man, but I hope the writer or writers suffer a nasty papercut.  Is that too harsh?  OK, maybe so, but every change the writer made from the original movie made this movie worse.  Why did they have to change the nature of the male lead's character?  In the original movie, he's kind of a dog and hits on girls pretty outrageously when he's drunk; it's very amusing.  In the remake, he's more of a 40 Year Old Virgin type, who wants to work for a tractor company.  A tractor company?  I was surprised they didn't have all the characters wear cowboy hats to demonstrate to the audience that this was an American movie (made by Koreans).  Also, almost every scene seems rushed; maybe the writer and director thought Americans didn't have the attention span required for longer scenes, but it's like the movie is playing at slightly-faster-than-normal speed, throughout the entire movie.  The pacing is rushed; the dialogue is rushed.  Do you like the scene where the male lead hits on the female lead in the street, not realizing it's her?  Yep, it's gone.  Remember the recreations of the action movies that the girl writes?  Well, they worsened those.  They filmed them as if they were scenes from a high school play; maybe they were running out of money.  The racquetball scene?  In the original, the male lead gets hit with the ball about a million times and it's hilarious.  Yep, they removed that.  The one scene I would have changed from the original movie was the amusement park scene with the soldier.  This scene doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the movie very well, so I thought they might cut it or alter it in some way.  Of course, the writer decided to reproduce this scene somewhat faithfully, and it doesn't work this time either.  At least they rushed through it, just like every other scene.  And now, some of my favorite lines from the original and, you guessed it, they are missing in the remake:  1 - \\"Hey, wanna die?\\" (every one is removed)  2 - \\"If she hits you, act like it hurts.  If it hurts, act like it doesn't.\\"  3 - \\"I don't have to go now.\\"  I now understand why this remake went straight to video.  The original was funny and heart-breaking; the remake is heart-breaking but for mostly the wrong reasons.  After watching it, I had to immediately re-watch the original to wipe this film off my eyes.  It gets 2.5 stars because it's based on a movie that is so good, and some of it survives, but not nearly enough, so I'm rounding down.  Alas, for what should have been.  Oh, one more thing:  I must give props to the remake for removing the graphic throwing-up scenes from the original.  Probably it would have been better to just edit them down, but I think they were all removed.  To me, these scenes in the original are a little too gross, and I've gotten into the habit of fast-forwarding through them.

B003Y5HWK4|5.0|Before the mob created Las Vegas, there was Atlantic City, a town where ambition ruled, not the law. All it took to succeed was an idea, a gun, and the gift of knowing when to use which.  The HBO period drama \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" kicked off its pilot episode, handled by director Martin Scorsese (also one of series' producers), by literally counting down the minutes until the dawn of Prohibition. Steeped in the sights, sounds and scandals of the era, this brilliant show illustrates what is ridiculously obvious in hindsight -- that the most ardent fans of Prohibition were bootleggers like Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson (Steve Buscemi). His letterhead may read \\"Treasurer, Atlantic County, New Jersey,\\" but his real title is Boss. Nuck flat-out runs the town. A dollar isn't spent on booze, gambling or salt-water taffy without him getting a cut.  Put in power by the aging Commodore (Dabney Coleman) and aided by his brother Eli (Shea Whigham), the country sheriff, \\"Boardwalk Empire's\\" first season sees Nuck fighting tooth and nail to stay on top. His biggest foes aren't political opponents. Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg), fresh off fixing the 1919 World Series, wants to expand from Manhattan to Atlantic City and his gunman, Lucky Luciano (Vincent Piazza), is only too willing to lead Italian henchmen against Nuck's Irish crew. The show's creator Terence Winter (The Sopranos) delivers plenty of sex and startling violence during the 12 episodes, which explode in jazzy color. (When I die, I want to be buried in one of Nuck's finely tailored suits by Martin Greenfield.)  When dead bodies start turning up, the feds bring the heat in the form of Prohibition agent Nelson Van Alden (Michael Shannon), who is like a twisted mix of Elliot Ness and Inspector Javert. Nuck may control the state and local law, but he doesn't run Washington (yet anyway).  Luckily, Nuck has a few allies in his corner, including the sharp-dressed Chalky White (Michael Kenneth Williams), a bootlegger who controlsthe local black vote. Nuck's protégé, Jimmy Darmody (Michael Pitt), a tortured war vet who thinks little about killing for Nuck, ends up banished to Chicago, where he pals around with a young tough on the rise named Al Capone (Stephen Graham).  But Nuck has no greater ally than the widow Margaret Schroeder (Kelly Macdonald). She's the one person capable of tapping into something positive buried deep within Nuck. And like Michael Corleone holding on to Kay Adams in \\"The Godfather,\\" Nuck clings to Margaret as his soul's lifeline. When you reach the end of the finale, you'll feel like you've earned an honorary PhD in the Roaring Twenties.  The \\"Boardwalk Empire: Season 1\\" Blu-ray includes a staggering amount of extras, including but not limited to several cast-and-crew audio commentaries, three \\"making of\\" featurettes, a helpful character dossier featuring bios and key relationships, and a \\"speakeasy tour.\\" (HBO Home Entertainment)  Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.
0060730552|5.0|As a frequent reader of adventure related books, I found this tome to land in my top 10%.  The pacing and intimacy of the writing kept me enthralled as I read into the night.<br /><br />Based on the true story of two young men enduring a crisis high on an icy mountain, it certainly made me appreciate my mundane life on terra firma.<br /><br />Not only is this a book of roller coaster highs and lows but gives wonderful insight into the survival instinct of man.  While I would like to think I could possibly endure this harrowing experience, the truth is that I would probably succumb to the elements.  Anyway, it was fun to place myself in that situation if only in my mind.<br /><br />As a bonus, the book can be viewed as a leadership guide.  Keeping cool under pressure, maintaining a clear mission and making tough, sound decisions in a timely manner.  All critical to great leadership.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and hope you find this review helpful.<br /><br />Michael L. Gooch, Author of [[ASIN:1897326882 Wingtips with Spurs]]
B005MYEPXC|5.0|The film is very entertaining, and worth watching just for the atmospheric views of Paris.  I never would have expected to find Owen Wilson in a Woody Allen film, but he is very good in this one.  Blu-Ray is nicely done.  All in all, an excellent presentation of an excellent film.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have seen so many of the kids at my children's school wear angry bird stuff. I wondered what the big deal was. After I got my Kindle Fire, I downloaded all the Angry Bird apps so my kids could play. I started to play with it to try it out. Big mistake. Now, I can't stop playing it. The house doesn't get vacuumed, laundry doesn't get washed, the dishes are piling up in the sink! Darn you, Angry Birds! Why did you have to be so fun? First, I noticed how beautiful the graphics are. The gameplay and objective are simple, knockdown the pigs from their structures. What makes the game so interesting are the creative structures that you have to knock down and thinking of the best way to catapult the birds to cause the most damage. There seems to be always 1 pig in a location that is hard to get. You want to keep trying and trying until you get that little sucker. It is truly a physics and problem solving game. I love the new Year of the Dragon episode that was just released. My favorite is the Mighty Dragon. After I use up my birds, I can use that Mighty Dragon to get the rest of the pigs that are left. Too bad there isn't something like the Mighty Dragon in each episode. Sometimes passing a level is so frustrating! But I want to come back for more! Updated: Angry Birds added a new level called Cherry Blossom which has a Japanese theme. The artwork is so beautiful with Mt. Fuji in the background amongst cherry blossom trees. The sushi chef green pigs are a hoot!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Such a fun app. Keeps me so entertained. You never get bored. I played this app for almost the whole 2 hour drive.  Plus, it is free. What can be better than that?
B006W5JF9Y|2.0|Previewed this on my KINDLE FIRE. Yikes! This SUCKS!!! Probably 3 songs I consider worthy. I am a Dylan fan (child of the 60's). Most of this awful--especially KESHA!! Really, just buy Dylan's GREATEST HITS and donate some money to a charity of your choice.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love The Big Bang Theory! The first show in this set \\"The Robotic Manipulation\\" will have you rolling on the floor. The rest will not disappoint. I love when they dress up in their Justice League costumes and in this season they have two new members in their group, Penny & Zack. Sheldon is great, as usual.

B006TJXZ30|5.0|Downloaded and setup this application and found it to be much better than the built in e-mail client.  It has support for Exchange ActiveSync with push notification.  Right now I only have my personal e-mail set up in the application, but it works great.  When I compose new mail, it correctly pulls my contact list to identify the recipient.  If you're using a Windows Phone that manages your contacts through Live Mail, this is a great companion app.
B003NX76BM|4.0|I just finished this book and loved it, as is the case most of the time with Ms. Roberts. I absolutely loooved Simon, very sexy, straight to the point. I like Fiona also; verysmart, tough-no weak heroine there. They \\"suited\\" each other perfectly! And the villians were quite nicely deranged in spite of themselves. This book is definately a keeper. It took me a awhile to want to purchase it though as I am not into themey books (in this case dog training)but the dogs were very much a part of the story as the main characters and I fell equally in love with them too! Dog training theme aside; I would recommend this as another great book from Ms. Roberts!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follett really nailed the female psyche in this book without compromising the narrative on harsh 14th Century life.  This book (the series) isn't for the faint at heart.  The descriptions are sometimes hard to read but it feels authentic and believable.  It's engrossing yet informative.  I feel smarter about the era...about earldoms, merchant negotiations, monastery politics, the emotional and economic devastation of The Black Plague...and that as a woman, I am SO GLAD to have been born in a different era! I was particularly impressed with the author's architectural detail.  It's not so technical that your eyes glaze over yet it's thought-provoking enough for you to stop and consider what it must have been like to walk the halls of such large stone churches and castles.  Kingsbridge Cathedral felt real.  I visted Mont. St Michel church in France last year and it felt as if I had been there before!  The best part is that it's a stand alone novel.  You don't have to read Pillars of the Earth to enjoy this book. Though I highly recommend Pillars as well!  Tip: Get it in paperback.  Hardcover weighs a ton.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really really really love this game because it. is so So so so so so so much fun I think every body should have this game.

B004A8ZWW4|3.0|Had all the elements of a great movie,  but it still came across as mostly surface acting to me.  Maybe on a different day with less expectation it might seem better.  Did not buy this movie, watched it on my Blu-Ray player over Amazon Instant Video.  Should have given this review under the HD version.

B004SGWYW4|5.0|I generally like zombie movies, and this is easily one of the best I've ever seen.  And while this is a TV series and not a movie, that shouldn't matter.  It is a bit graphic (violence, blood, and implied nudity), and young kids probably shouldn't watch, but it's highly recommended for everyone else.

0061122416|1.0|I had high hopes for this book, based on it's popularity, I guess. Or perhaps I'd seen so many references to it that it had wormed its way into my subconscious.  I had some misgivings when I read the jacket cover, but I thought, shucks, millions of adoring Earthlings can't be wrong, right?  Well, I should have listened to that little voice inside me (perhaps that was my own \\"heart\\" talking to me, which I ignored to my chagrin).  What a bunch of pseudo-religious poppy-cock!  I've been more \\"moved\\" by some of the patently false urban legends circulating on the internet.  As one reviewer suggested, perhaps the translator is to blame.  But wait--he or she can't be blamed for lack of character development, stupid plot, and plodding prose.  Could this be the greatest hoodwinking ever of the global reading public?  Where can I get a piece of that action?!?!

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Jacob Portman witnesses his beloved grandfather's death at the hands of an eyeless three tongued monster. Because it's so horrific, he is promptly convinced by everyone around him, including his therapist, that it couldn't have been real. But something's wrong, including the strange pictures his grandfather kept in a cigar box. Jacob keeps scratching at the mystery of his grandfather's life and death until he ends up visiting the orphanage that his father grew up in during world war 2, convincing his father that the birds on the little Welsh island would make a worthwhile ornithological study.<br /><br />Once on the island, he finds the orphanage, but not in the place he expected. And he certainly didn't expect the pictures in his grandfather's cigar box to be of real people, exhibiting their weird abilities. And he didn't expect to get involved with this grandfather's lovely ex-girlfriend.<br /><br />I picked this up on the recommendation of a co-worker. I really enjoyed this book for the voice and the world building. The description and cover kind of lead you to believe it will be a sort of steampunk X-Men. The author uses found antique photos throughout  to illustrate actual characters, many of which have a cool, spooky quality to it. But as you can tell from the above, it's more dieselpunk. And though the randomness to the Peculiar children's abilities give a sort of superhero vibe, there are hints of deeper order that lead you along a trail to a much more urban fantasy style of milieu, with a fresh supernatural taxonomy. You have to love any series that calls it's creatures \\"peculiars.\\"<br /><br />The protagonists voice is cynical but optimistic, and unlike a lot of YA titles, uses language that teens would actually use. Not swearing in the manner of South Park (not that there's anything wrong with that), but swearing in the casually colorful way Holden Caufield might have if he'd actually sworn.<br /><br />I can't think of anything I disliked without nitpicking, so I won't bother. Miss Peregrine was a short, fresh read with a likable protaganist and fun milieu.a short, fresh read with a likable protaganist and fun milieu.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|First of all i would like to start by introducing my self. I am a film music composer for 15 years and i usually use 2 pairs of headphones sets in the studio. This specific AKG 240 are NOT being produced for loud music or casual listening. They are manufactured for sound engineers and studio use for people like me want to listen to the details in the mixing process during production. I rate them 5 stars for such a cheap solution and this model has been an industry standard for years. But i wouldn't recommend these headphones for recreational purposes, such us music listening, ipods, mobile phones that support MP3 format, Home Hi-Fi etc. Reason is that they are made as i said for mixing and not for listening. If you are NOT a professional, you will be disappointed. These headphones respond to high frequencies for listening details to the mixing and have almost no bass. These headphones have a low volume but fine detail so it takes all it's strength to the detail of sound quality than loudness. This is the reason i use two studio headphones. One for bass frequencies and one for detail. Hope i helped!

B003L77FYS|5.0|When I heard that Nathan Fillion was going to be in a TV series (again) I had to start watching it. I have been watching Castle since day 1 and have enjoyed it immensely. Nathan usually plays a kind of wise-cracking character and this is no different. The chemistry with the rest of the team is great. We own the 1st 3 seasons as well as having watched them when they came on TV originally. If the series keeps up this way I will be buying the rest of them as well. Looking forward to season 4 on DVD when it comes out. Have been watching Nathan Fillion since 'Two Guys, a Girl & a Pizza Place'. We even saw a live episode being filmed, way back when. I also love him in 'Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-Long Blog', 'Firefly/Serenity', 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' season 7 as Caleb and 'Slither'.

1451627289|5.0|I won't go into a detailed review.  I read this book because I remember this awful tragedy as I was a grammar school student in Maine at the time.  I remember the textile mills in Lisbon Falls as I worked in one myself.  It is obvious that a lot of research went into the details of the story.  As time goes by we find ourselves asking the question, What if??  Steven King delivers his version of the answer to this question.  You won't be dissappointed.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I would recommend this movie to all Fathers.  This hit home for me and opened my eyes about what a Christian father needs to be to his family.

1612130283|5.0|I read this book as a favour to a friend and I'll never regret it.  \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" was a number of firsts for me. It's the first book I've read that had a strong female character and the author was able to do it without making her a bitch. Anastasia was likable, even when she was confused. It's also the first book from a first person perspective that I've enjoyed.  Well done Ms. James;

B00005JPSM|5.0|This movie is about a woman, named Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is a workahlolic master chief at a upscale Manhattan resturant.  When her younger sister, Christine suddently died in a car accident with Kate's niece, Zoe (Abigail Breslin) Kate discovers that she is named Zoe's guardian. Kate knows nothing about raising a kid.  While Kate takes a few days off work to make Zoe is comfortable in her new home her boss hires, Nick (Aaron Eckhart)a sous chief who is a free-spirited,and loves to sing opera. At first Kate does not care for Nick. When Nick meets Zoe at the resturant they become great friends. Nick helps Kate with Zoe when she needs an extra hand. With time Nick and Kate also become good friends. Kate reailizes that there is more to Nick than his annoying opera singing in the kitchen.  If you have not had a chance to watch No Reservations yet I think you should. This would be a perfect valentine's day movie to watch! Watch the movie to see that happens to Nick and Kate. Enjoy!
0307346617|2.0|This book got great reviews and that drew me in. The whole reporter dialog just didn't do it for me. By the time the stories got interesting they were switching to someone else's story on the other side of the globe. None of the stories ever came together no relation of the characters. Just a collection of open ended shorts. I did enjoy the detail of the virus and how the outbreak began but ended up just putting the book down unfinished.
B003HE2B6C|5.0|I'll start this by saying that I am not a person who mindlessly marks every album a favorite band makes as five-star. I base each album on its own merit. That said, then, if I'm honest, I will tell you that I haven't really liked any of Hanson's albums since their first one, [[ASIN:B002AUVDM2 Middle Of Nowhere]]. At best, I've felt they've been an average band since then, and a bit disappointing. In fact, despite being a huge fan and attending some of their concerts over the years, \\"Middle Of Nowhere\\" was still the only album of theirs that I owned until I bought this one. I think this is because they've spent over a decade trying to find who they are as a band--it was obvious they could not continue being a candy pop band.<br /><br />Well, they've finally figured it out. This album is not the Hanson you remember--this is the Hanson you will never forget.<br /><br />While I will always treasure \\"Middle Of Nowhere\\" as a five-star album for its candy pop sound, groovy feel, and energy...<br /><br />This...<br /><br />This is just...<br /><br />H-O-L-Y COW. O_o I am truly astonished and blown away by this album. I'm SO glad I listened to samples of this album or I would never have added this awesomeness to my music collection.<br /><br />This band has found its place, their voices have matured beautifully, and they have become a marvel. This album roots you to the earth, you feel its heart and soul, its purity, its steadiness. The harmony gives you chills. The execution is perfection. I feel like this is one of the only albums I own where the intent of what the artist was reaching for is clear and palpable to me. To use their own words, they've \\"shown us something real.\\"<br /><br />Well done, boys. &lt;3 This is a masterpiece.

1400052181|3.0|I'm of two minds about this book. On the one hand, I enjoyed the scientific side of the story: the horror that was scientific research in the 1950s and the decades before informed consent became common practice; the discussion about cells and the research that can be conducted with them; and the legal and ethical ramifications of scientific research. In our world of HIPAA and institutional review boards, the information given in this book was both mind-opening and mind-blowing.  I did not enjoy what I felt was emotional manipulation on the part of the author. Look at these people and their horrible lives! Feel sorry for how poorly treated they've been! Their mother's cells have been used for research for years, yet they have no health insurance!  To be clear, I'm NOT a cold-hearted person. I believe everyone should have healthcare, regardless of their ability to pay for it. But this book wasn't about the state of the American health care system, as such. Nor was it, I'm sure, meant to be commentary on class or race issues in America. Yet those things were brought into the book, and I felt that they detracted from the real story, which was these amazing cells that survive and proliferate. Of course, that story by itself would have yielded a much shorter book, and perhaps a story that's already been told.  I didn't get the sense, despite what the author may have wished, that Henrietta was treated that much differently than any other woman with \\"female troubles\\" would have been in 1951. Surely, the segregation of Blacks and the complete lack of privacy given them in the hospital was deplorable, but I don't know that she would have gotten a different medical treatment - radiation, etc. - had she been a white woman with the same disease. I think her complaints would have been written off by the male doctors no matter who she was.  In book group, I posed the question of whether Henrietta's children would have turned out much differently had she lived, and the consensus was that the youngest would have had a much different life, a more secure, less anger-filled existence. But I don't know if it would have changed the overall outlook for the family.  I also felt that the author put herself into the story way too much, insinuating herself with the family when they were resistant to it -- continually resistant to it. There was no reporterly detachment here.  The medical and scientific aspect of this book is fascinating for anyone who is interested in such things; the family stuff detracts from the rest.  I would like to thank my book group for helping me solidify my thoughts on this book.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|Any fan of the John Carpenter version of The Thing should enjoy this film. Was it a perfect? no... Could they of done some things different? yes... I seen the film and I really enjoyed it. I went into the theater with semi-low expectations but I was still very excited to see what they have done with this film. I walked out very pleased and I loved the way they brought this film (yes it is a prequel) and John's film together. Anyone that says this is not a prequel is an idiot and does not know what prequel even means (look it up). If you are a fan of The Thing it's a given.. just get the film.

0671015206|5.0|Next to the \\"Total Money Makeover\\" this is one of my favorite personal finance books to date.  The book is well written, concise, and doesn't have too much technical information.  It provides real insight on how the \\"rich\\" truly live.  We are not talking about rich celebrities but rather the rich men and women who live in your neighborhood.  Yes, they live in your neighborhood!  Remember, it's not how much you earn but how much you spend.  The author presents surveys and statistics that show what the average millionaire drives, wears, and looks like.  You will find out that the average millionaire drives used cars and has never owned a Rolex.  You will find out that they never inherited money and were typically \\"C\\" students in college.  They live in average to below average houses and neighborhoods.  Status for these people is not a BMW in the driveway but money in the bank.  According to this book, most doctors are broke and education is inversely proportional wealth.  There are always exceptions of course.  Net worth is a better indicator of wealth than yearly income.  I recommend this book.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I enjoy problem solving games and this had plenty of them. I found this game to be very easy but I really liked the concept. Worth 99cents.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app it has made reading the Bible so easy to do and you can do it whenever you have time and where ever you are.
B003IY48PS|5.0|This movie made Bruce Campbell a star and also made Sam Raimi a star director!  A slow start but great use of one location milked beyond belief made the movie enjoyable.  Acting was B-grade but will definitely appeal to fans of the genre.  Effects were also pretty good for its time.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I was so stoked that I got my DVD so quickly! I got to watch the DVD in less than a week after I ordered it, very cool!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|l feel that this is a great App.-but it needs to show prices taken. Other than that I feel very comfortable playing this game.
0439023521|5.0|First let me say I am a 15 year old boy who hates to read.  I should say I WAS a 15 year old boy how hated to read because this book and the next two in the series changed reading for me.  My English teacher recommended I read The Hunger Games as my independent reading book.  I was skeptical at first mainly because the main character is a girl.  But I had to read something so I went for it.   Once I picked this book up I couldn't put it down.  My mom was amazed to see me reading all the time.  If I had 5 minutes between class I had this book out and was reading.  The book just sucks you in.  You have to keep reading.  You just need to know what will happen next.   I don't want to give away anything that happens in this book because you should discover how amazing it is yourself when you read it and enjoy the wild ride.  Let me just say that it is a book that appeals to all ages and genders.  All of my friends have read it, my MOM read it, my math teacher read it and we all loved it.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be totally engrossed in a good book.    My advise is to get all 3 books because you won't want to wait for the second or third to arrive!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|every time my kid starts to bug me I just give him my kindle fire to play this game that he likes to play so much so he leaves me alone so I can rest
B005DZMODI|5.0|Hot.  From the first cut to the last, these guys swing.  Shame they're not touring together. It's nice to hear Wynton getting back to his roots.  Clapton's vocals are right at home here, even channeling Louis at times.  The high points \\"Ice Cream\\" \\"Forty-Four\\" \\"The Last Time\\" and \\"Careless Love\\" are true gems.  If I have a knock against the performance, and this is merely a niggle, it's that Clapton's drive on a few of the cuts doesn't feel at home in this environment.  A cleaner guitar tone might have been a better match for the material.  It sounds a bit experimental at times.  But I'll happily go along for the ride, at this level of musical mastery.  \\"Layla\\" is the most experimental of the collection.  Clapton may have gone to the well once too often here.  Clapton pulls out some interesting licks, moving between Brian Setzer infused vibes and staccato call and response that's pure Clapton.  I can't heap enough praise on this unexpected treasure.  Why this isn't up for four or five Grammys is a symbol of how the recording academy is adamant about a youthful movement.  This is the hottest thing I've heard in a long, long time.  Now if they'd just tour....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are all pretty fun, some really easy and other you got to keep working at which makes you play it even more!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wow I love  this game .my brother cant put my kindle fire down we r addicted. I love it wow.so cool
0385534639|4.0|The Night Circus is one of those rare books which catches you off guard in its simplicity, seduces you with its narrative, and you find yourself unwittingly drawn deeper and deeper into the revolving plot which, like a circus, draws you eyes towards the center. A beautiful alchemical story of love, triumph, and the stuff dreams are made on. A wonderfully captivating, entertaining, and engaging story.  I always judge a book by the first sentence. Always. If I'm not convinced to read the next sentence, finish the paragraph, or the page, then I'm not going to enjoy the rest of the book. I was skeptical when I picked up The Night Circus. I don't tend to read \\"bestsellers\\" lists, because all they tell you are what books people are buying. Given that I selected two titles to read over Christmas and only finished this one, I believe, adds to the truth of my statement that bestsellers are only that: best sellers. Opening to find the book's first offering I was instantly compelled to find out what happens next. \\"The circus arrives at night.\\" From that point, I was hooked.  The story follows a simple alchemical structure: black stage, white stage, and a spectacular crimson red stage. Magic fires, ice gardens, cloud mazes, living carousels, magic spells, living statues, and a man who has removed himself from this plane of existence only to appear at odd moments as a shadow in your periphery when you least want him to appear are only a few of the wonders on display at this circus. Told in a mixture of voices from limited omniscience third person to second person makes your journey through the pages of this story a real treat. I look forward to reading more to see if there are other surprises to be found in this author's repertoire.
B0063GORYU|5.0|runs smooth, great way to pass the time. I have really enjoyed all of mobilityware's products and this one is tops.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book was a great read! I did not put it down and read it in a few hours! Very interesting to read about what happens in war. I would recommend this to read. I recommend for older children and teens.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I originally gave this a poor rating (Jan 25, 2012) because, although I found the app useful, an update in January erased all of my appointment information and I had to scramble to recreate it. I continued to use the app, found it very useful, and nervously entered the February update. Happy to say everything went flawlessly and I continue using this app. I'm now a happy camper and pleased that whatever went wrong with the January update was not repeated in February. This review was updated on February 24, 2012.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The title says it all this is a great app. I really love this app it has a lot of games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is good for travel,  it wastes. a lot of time,and doesn't require wifi. The games are quite fun.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I just uninstalled it ... the easy games were fun but the harder ones on page 3 that cost 180,000 points were kind of taxing. I was bored.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good mix of games. some are a little slow or stupid but overall a good mix.not too many ads and good mix of easy and hard games.
B003L77GRY|5.0|Dexter is one of the greatest shows out there. I was hooked after the first few episodes. This season is great too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is fun and is a good way to waste time. The points to add games aren't that hard to get and there are a lot of games to play as you work your way up. Some of the controls are harder to use with the Kindle Fire. But over all it's a good app especially for the price.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|the movie was what  was looking for, only problem is the only subtitles available are french! and i don't mean english and french but not spanish, i mean ONLY French. i wish the description would have said that.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome<br />its the best game I have it hes a total of119 games and its all free
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love the classics and am so happy to have come accross this movie. The characters and story plot are great!!! I absolutely love John Thorton and Richard Armitage does a great job at playing the role. My sis and I watched all the episodes the same day that we received it. It is the type of movie that you do not want to see come to an end. I didn't read the book before watching the movie but I am expecting to receive the book any day now (since I recently ordered it). I would recommend this movie to everyone!!!
B005T87QCI|1.0|purchased and downloaded app but only goes to blank screen once you try to start match or even practice. need a refund or suggestions on how to make it work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I put off reading this book for months. But my friends and coworkers all pushed me to read them. SOOO glad I did! Now we have a almost everyone at my work reading these books. Everyone says that same thing about it...Amazing, phenomenal, epic!!!  This entire series is absolutely amazing! I bought all three books and finished them all in less than a week. The books are so engaging and honest that it is hard to put them down. Definitely worth a look!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this cartoon movie, but I did.  It's not just for kids.  You have to be adult to understand the underlying word context.
0441013597|5.0|There are plenty of full-length reviews already written, I just wanted to give this book a 5 star rating.  Along with Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" series it is one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We purchased Settlers after playing the travel version for a while, and it is now easily the favorite game in the house. The full version allows for endless random game setup which makes the game different and exciting each time you play. The game says it is for 3-4 players, and it is certainly best with 3 or 4, but we commonly play with 2 people with just as much competition and fun (and a little more luck, a little less trading).  We did have a problem with the game, though -- despite living in a very dry climate (Denver, CO), the game tiles started to warp by the second time we played. I can see from previous reviews that this is not an isolated incident (which makes me wonder why they don't simply make the game from thicker cardboard), but having had the game for less than a month and paying what we did for it, I decided to contact Mayfair Games customer service. Their service was the fastest I've ever received -- I exchanged emails with one representative who easily got back to me within one business day each time. New tiles are now in the mail, which of course may not fix the issue but I am regardless impressed with how they handled my concern.  The game does take a little while to learn if you haven't played before, but the complexities of the rules make it a highly strategic and competitive game. I would recommend Settlers to anyone who enjoys board games.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|What an interesting selection. You either love her or hate her. I love her. She reminds me of early Annie Lenox.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is soooooooo fun and.I really.think it is great that u can. get coins for free which I think is great is it insanely addictive and yeah!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games can be quite frustrating while others surprisingly simple. been playing off and on since I got my kindle fire. I will beat it I guarantee it. om apparently. there is more words needed to submit a review so I am just typing until it allows me to submit this review. how fun is this? I hope you are having fun reading this because I'm getting tired of typing.  oops forgot to give rating
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is the best TV show that I have ever seen.  If you don't like this show  then you are not breathing, by that I mean you are a zombie. This being on Blu-Ray is even better.  Price wise this could be $40 and still be worth it.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|use this on itouch so trying on kindle too. seems to work. just got so hope it continues a nd want it offline too.
1451648537|5.0|There is a Russian adage, &#34;One cannot throw out words from a song.&#34;  Well, Amazon insisted on my throwing out Steve's own words from his quotes. Sadly, another example of the crazy infantile world we live in.  Below is a sterile version. I subbed s-word (meaning &#34;bad&#34;) on &#34;s-word.&#34; Better?  An easy read that will leave a thoughtful reader with lots of useful ideas and by extension possibly add another chapter to Jobs influence on the world.  In his research University of Chicago Booth School of Business professor Steven Kaplan showed with statistical significance that, contrary to what media wants us to believe, hard core CEOs outperform soft, touchy-feely CEOs. On page 565 Walter Isaacson confirms professor Kaplan's point on what makes a successful CEO, &#34;The nasty edge to his personality ... served a purpose. Polite and velvety leaders, who take care to avoid bruising others, are generally not as effective at forcing change. Dozens of colleagues whom Jobs most abused ended their litany of horror stories by saying that he got them to do things they never dreamed possible. And he created a corporation crammed with A players.&#34;  Steve's magic impact was felt beyond Apple. There is a scene in  iPhone story, when Jobs makes Corning to accomplish something its CEO Wendell Weeks thought was absolutely impossible (quite funny story too!).  There is also a confirmation of a controversial and politically incorrect point that I've been making for years. It relates to our (mis)perceptions and (mis)interpretations of human actions. These (mis)perceptions and (mis)interpretations lead to particular (often wrong) labels we choose for people, jerks vs. nice, etc. etc. Have you noticed that, -to hedge my bets -, most geniuses whose achievements we admire so much are what many would label today as jerks: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Gary Kasparov, Michael Jordan,  etc. etc., Pele, Maradona, and the biggest of them all Dennis Rodman.  So the dilemma is: we,Homo Sapiences, can choose to be irresponsible for our own emotions and blame others for what we feel. Or we can choose to become Phil Jackson's of the world and find a way to deal with A players, to create something that leaves humanity in awe. What do you choose?  This is precisely what one of the Apple's managers, Atkinson,  realized and accomplished. (p 122), &#34;One day Jobs barged into the cubicle of one of Atkinson's engineers and uttered his usual &#34;This is `s-word'.&#34; As Atkinson recalled, &#34;The guy said, 'No it's not, it's actually the best way,' and he explained to Steve the engineering trade-offs he's made.&#34; Jobs backed down. Atkinson taught his team to put Jobs's words through a translator, &#34;We learned to interpret 'This is `s-word' to actually be a question that means, 'Tell me why this is the best way to do it.' &#34;But the story had a coda, which Atkinson also found instructive. Eventually the engineer found an even better way to perform the function that Jobs had criticized. &#34;He did it better because Steve had challenged him,&#34; said Atkinson, &#34;which shows you can push back on him, but should also listen, for he's usually right.&#34;  The reality is - we all put words through &#34;translators.&#34; These &#34;translators&#34; have been handed to us by environments in which we grew up and developed. Majority of us accept these &#34;gifts&#34; without thinking, without questioning validity of these `gifts' and the results these translators lead to. More often than not, these &#34;translators&#34; are wrong with corresponding not &#34;optimal&#34; consequences.  P 124: &#34;But even though Job's style could be demoralizing, it could also be oddly inspiring. It infused Apple employees with an abiding passion to create groundbreaking products and a belief that they could accomplish what seemed impossible. They had T-shirts made that read `90 hours a week and loving it!' Out of fear of Jobs mixed with an incredibly strong urgeto impress him, they exceeded their own expectations. I've learned over the years that when you have really good people you don't have to baby-sit them,' Jobs later explained. `By expecting them to do great things, you can get them to do great things. The original Mac team taught me that A-plus players like to work together, and they don't like it if you tolerate B work. Ask any member of that Mac team. They will tell you it was worth the pain.&#34;  Debi Coleman recalled &#34;... I consider myself the absolute luckiest person in the world to have worked with him.&#34;  There were a few superbly interesting moments, details of which did not make to the book and made me wonder why. Among them:  1. in the first quarter, Jobs refuses to give options to, at least at some point, his close friend, roommate, and fellow traveler, Daniel Kottke that has been with Apple from the day 1. There are nasty scenes about it, that's left unfinished. ....  n. it the end, Jobs advises Larry Page on the best governance. I would love to know the details of that conversation.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I was not sure at all about this series which was kind of wierd because i LIVE the 20`s, Mobsters, Chicago and New York ad it has all the Characters from back in the day. The best part about it is they put it all together to make a fascinating story of Booze, Prohabition,Love,Feds,Gangsters,Cities,Transportation and everything else you could imagine rom tat time period! WELL DONE!!!! PLEASE make season 2 as good PLEASE! I have not seen anything so interesting since the Sopranos and Of course the Best show of all time, THE WIRE!
B000002B30|5.0|My son absolutely loved this cd!  It came in just in time for Christmas.  Brings back some good old school days for me.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|I've wanted this cd for a long time, but seemed to never come around to picking it up.  Finally picked it up a few weeks ago and I'm blown away.  Yes, Pumped Up Kicks and Helena Beat are two of my favorite radio songs, but this album has a lot more depth.  Would recommend this to anyone that wants an upbeat cd to listen to.
030788743X|5.0|I loved this book, couldn't put it down. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys science fiction, fantasy, video games, anime, or 80's anything. So much Fun!!!!!
B005URRCUY|5.0|Received this for Christmas just like Brothers the year before.  This is a great modern Rock and Roll album.  Will having Danger Mouse contributing to an album makes me nervous, I feel that the Keys have kept their identity, but opened up new sounds.  This is a top 5 cd for either 2011 or 2012 depending on how you look at the calendar.
B004LUS390|4.0|Perfect app to quickly sketch ideas that pop into your head. Would love to try it on a tablet. I might be getting a kindle fire for that reason.
0307959856|1.0|This book is a snore!Same thing told over and over. It's a big who cares. Don't like her other books, don't know why she got such a wonderful review.One word Boring
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a fun game. good to pass the time when board. looking for something new, give it a shot
B000UVT3OI|4.0|Great product and great Album... Everything I'd hoped it would be!! Very satified wih the product and service.  Thanks Again!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Wonderful Zen for the mind. After a long day I use Quell as a cool down exercise for my fried brain. The music soothes and the puzzles stretches the cells slowly
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I read some of the reviews about this watch and most complains were about the time it took to find the satellite, I have had no problems with mine. It will locate them in under 30 seconds.  The watch is not too big and yes the bevel is a little to sensitive but if you lock it once you start your run it won't be a big deal.  So far this has been a good purchase.  The only bad thing is that the watch is not waterproof.
076115728X|5.0|This is for a 3 and up.My Granddaughter will be 2 in May so I will wait and see if she can take care of this book and understand it then. I might have to save for Christmas. The book shows that anything can be something and I want her to learn that things can go wrong and it is O.K. I think this will be a keeper for years to come. I'm going to check out other books by Saltzberg. She already has peekaboo kisses and like that book.
1451627289|5.0|I am currently suffering from a spine condition, and for the first time in my professional life am unable to work. This book is so engaging that it is rescuing me from near-depression. You can really lose yourself in this story; it is pure genius. After I finish this, I will probably catch up on other books by him that I have missed. This is truly the definitive \\"great read\\". Thank you, Mr. King, for the rescue.
014312093X|2.0|Got through the first 15 pages maybe before I decided to ditch this one.<br />It might heat up later, but the only real use for this book is as a sleep aid<br />snooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrring<br /><br />Maybe the movie will be better, but I'll wait until that's out on DVD.<br />Disappointed, thought this would be half decent.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a fun game and if you get a lot of expensive games they are the best to play.just keep playing the game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  It's helped me to re-invigerate my Bible reading.  I would recommend this app to anyone who is looking for a good and easy way to reaquaint ones self with their Bible.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the app so much. there are all kind of version to read or even download.  the Bible plan is very helpful.  one problem though, I downloaded the NLT version one time but when I have to restore my device, I cant download it again. it wasn't in my account.
0345529057|3.0|After almost four thousand pages of reading, I'm left feeling that the plot plan for this magnum opus is mainly retirement income. The stories feel like they have direction and an overall plan of some sort, there may even be an end game somewhere, but the author seems to take every opportunity to string the story along. I enjoyed the authors writing enough to finish these 'first four', but feel that buying any more in this series would simply be throwing money into a bottomless pit. If in some future installment the author does in fact find his conclusion I might revisit the choice and read the rest, but the series just isn't captivating enough for an open commitment to an endless series of purchases.  Just as a side note, I felt the many and lengthy pornographic scenes were an attempt to attract a demographic and had no relevance to whatever tenuous plot into which they were wedged.
0062012339|5.0|Once I opened this book and started to read, I seriously could not put it down. Just WOW! I am a huge fan of the Crue and can't believe I didn't buy this book a long time ago. BUY IT! You won't be disappointed!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have already dropped my kindle fire 3 times from a height of at least 4 feet.  Clumsy, I know, but this cover protected it each time--nothing broken or scratched; the kindle fire is still working fine thanks to this cover.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a pretty fun app tto have, with all its mini games. you're bound to find one that you'll love!
B006C1DH92|5.0|This game is amazing, love the game modes and all, this game is better then the original fruit ninja :)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Like most of the Kindle Fire apps I have, it is not as good as the same app on my iPad but of the Bible apps on the Fire it is one of the best.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Perfect case for the perfect money. Love how it breaks in half for a stand. Easy to put on and good Color selection
0307454541|4.0|Really enjoyed it. It was a little slow to get going, but once it did I couldn't put it down. I just started The Girl Who Played With Fire and I'm really excited.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty fun and all by unlocking the games and stuff but it takes a ton of points or whatever their called to unlock all these games
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I grew up watching this film with my grandfather. Seeing it now reminds me so much of him. The vocals are absolutely stunning. Judy Garland sings and acts like an angel. The entire family is so warm and, surprisingly funny as well. I hope to always watch this movie and take a trip back to my childhood and share the same with my future children.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Granted the game isn't the best but it's still fun in my opinion. idk why people.keep complaining about the adds or game play, its a free game, and a good one at that. low graphics and you do have to play once to get controls but that's the fun of it learning as you go. I give it a solid 4 and highly recommend it as a free game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a convenient way for on the go instant bible access. i love it and use it all the time.
015206396X|5.0|I have finally read this book again. Eee. I cannot believe I let it go more than three years before I did this. Graceling have been my favorite for years. I was a bit nervous about reading it again, this time for the fifth time, as I worried that I wouldn't love it as much as I did years before. I shouldn't have worried. It is the best book.<br /><br />Graceling is still my favorite book. The characters are beyond amazing. And I love this romance more than I can say. This book still made me cry, even though this is the fifth time I have read it. Sigh. It is simply the most beautiful story. And I'm thrilled that I loved it just as must this time, despite the years since last time.<br /><br />This is a book that I could talk about forever, I think. But I'm not going to. I'm going to mention some of the parts I love about it, but nothing too much. Though, if you still haven't read this book yet, as it had been out for nine years, then shame on you. Hmph. This is a book that everyone should read. You don't want to miss this. I cannot wait to re-read Fire and Bitterblue next. So excited. Have missed these books so much. My mind is already full of the things that I know are coming up and I'm so excited to be in this world again. Sigh. I just wish there were news about more books from this world. I want more than three. I want it so badly. I need another Po and Katsa story more than I need anything else. They are simply the most amazing characters. Love them so.<br /><br />This book tells the story about Katsa. Whom is the most interesting character. I love reading about her so much. She's exciting and fierce and strong and I love that about her. She's killed a lot of people, because her king demands it of her. But she doesn't like it. Reading about her rebelling was all kinds of awesome. I just adore this girl. I love that she had the most amazing Grace. Which is this gift that some people get when they are young. Most people doesn't have a Grace. It's this kind of power that is pretty awesome.<br /><br />Katsa is such a fierce fighter. No one can defeat her. And I loved it oh so much. But then Po arrives. And he's just as good as she is, almost. And watching them fight together.. sigh. It was so awesome. I adore these two characters beyond words. Reading about how Katsa and Po became friends, then more, was the most amazing thing. They are so cute. Their love is the strongest. I also really loved reading about Katsa's other friends. Raffin is adorable. Bann and Oll too. Giddon.. not so much. But he'll grow on me.<br /><br />There is just so much about this book that I love. I'm not going to mention much of the plot. Just that it is so exciting and mysterious and I loved it beyond words. I love the sort of adventure that Katsa and Po goes on. It's the best. But gosh, this book is heartbreaking. And I loved every moment of it. There isn't really that much about Leck in this first book. But yeah. He was still horrible, and learning about what he does is the worst. But his daughter, Bitterblue. Oh, I adore this little girl so much. She's just so amazing.<br /><br />I'm not going to mention much more about this book. Already written more than I had planned to. Just, gosh, I love this story so much. There are seven kingdoms. And I want to know more about all of them. Loved what I did learn, though. I love how amazing Katsa is. She truly is the strongest person. And she has the best heart. She will anger me a bit in Bitterblue, but I still love her to pieces. And Po. Eee. He's my favorite. I love learning more about this man. He is amazing. And his Grace is perfection. Love him.<br /><br />I'm so thrilled to finally have read this book again. It's been way too long. I just haven't felt like re-reading it for three years. I could say that I don't know why, but, well. I do. The last time I read this, I wrote a very, very long letter to Kristin. Was really excited, waiting for a reply. Then she had a goodreads chat, and I asked about it, andshe sort of told me that she wouldn't be able to respond. Which made my heart hurt a bunch. But I do understand. I do. I just got my feelings hurt a bit, lol. But it's better now. I do adore Kristin.<br /><br />For real, if you still haven't read Graceling, then get moving. This book is the best. These three books are beyond amazing. And I love them all like crazy. You really need to read and love them too. I can't imagine never loving this book and these characters. Sigh. Graceling is simply the best book. With the very best characters, the best story, and the best romance. I love everything about this book. And this world. And gosh, I'm so glad I finally made myself re-read this one. It still has everything I want in a book. Love it so.<br /><br />---<br /><br />This review was first posted on my blog, Carina's Books. Read in March 2017.<br /><br />I have read Graceling 5 times now. I was sure it was 6 times, but I looked at all my tweets, and I couldn't find that extra time. So 5 times it is. Only sharing my newest post here, though all the other posts can be found on my blog :)mance happened. And it happened in such a real way. I just loved it to pieces. Just, I wish there had been even more of them together. Though we do get a lot and I loved it so much. They are the best.<br /><br />That is all I will say of Graceling this time. It's a beautiful book. And it will always be my favorite book. The writing is gorgeous. The world amazing. The characters perfectly flawed. I loved every moment of re-reading this book. And I cannot wait to do it again. Just, oh, how I wish for a fourth book with Katsa and Po. I need more of them. Even just outtakes from the book. That would be the best. But anyway. Graceling is perfect and you all need to read it. Included a couple of awesome teasers below. <3<br /><br />~<br /><br />She stared at the checked pattern of her marble floor and wondered how she could feel so desolate that her eyes filled with tears. She couldn't remember crying, not once in her life. Not until this fool Lienid had come to her court, and lied to her, and then announced that he was leaving.<br /><br />~<br /><br />A tear made an icy track down his face. When Katsa went to him and dropped down before him, he let her come; the fight had gone out of him and he let her in. Katsa's arms came around him. He pulled Katsa against him, practically smothered her with his grip, and cried into her neck. She held him, simply held him, and touched him, and kissed his cold face.<br /><br />~<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Note about how many times I have read the book.<br />I'm pretty sure I first read it on January 18th to 19th 2012.<br />Then I read it on November 4th 2012 for the fourth time.<br />And now from December 1st to December 3rd 2013. <3<br />New blog post: http://carinabooks.blogspot.no/2013/12/graceling-by-kristin-cashore.html
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The simplicity of these games and rewarding you with points to unlock more of them make for hours of entertaining, addictive gameplay!
B002XMGGK6|3.0|This one is a variation on the old-fashioned vengeance theme, with a surviving family man seeking to rub out anyone who had anything to do with his family's demise. That means the entire criminal justice system, which he thinks did him wrong. As this goes on, it appears that he is also a genius at killing other people himself, as he picks them off one by one from prison, using his highly developed skills. Despite several script holes and a huge lack of lgic to the whole thing, the movie does move along at a fast clip. You will be forced to watch one man cut up with ssaws, and another stabbed in the jugular with a T-bone steak bone, as well as a woman's head blown off by an exploding cellphone. If you like that sort of \\"entertainment,\\" then watch.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|How can i instal this game and make it work with windows 7. When i try instaling it tells me that its only for XP and windows 98 ?????
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Don't use it as much on my Droid X, but works well there too. I prefer the standard calendar on the phone I guess.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I love this movie! Where can I start? The cinematography and directing is quite unique in style and I would understand some people not liking but I loved it!. The acting by everybody is really good! All actors play their role to perfection! Soundtrack is wow wow wow! Its very 80s music and I love 80s music so it caught my attention really fast. The movie can be quite violent and gory however it does add to movie and to the characters. I really recommend this movie!
B004R13U6Y|3.0|I am using this app inky kindlefire and when I try to export the annotations it comes in a .xfdf format I can't view anywhere. seems to work ok but this is a problem for me.

B000AGTPUU|5.0|We received the product as requested. It was in its original packaging. This is a great family classic to add to all the other holiday movies. It's well after Christmas and my kids still watch it.
1442344288|5.0|This is my first Stephen King book, and I can't put it down, yet I don't want to finish it.  I'm a baby boomer, and the setting brings back so many wonderful memories of drive-in movies, soda fountains, and unlocked doors.  I remember exactly where I was the day President Kennedy was shot -I was in my last period in Mr. Shippey's biology class.  We were let out of school immediately, and my family was glued to our tv set the entire weekend.  I love the rich details of this novel and the development of the characters.  Kudos, Mr. King.  I will check out more of your books!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the game is great for any body.  there is so many different. levels and stages and birds to use. recomended
B000OJFV3S|5.0|It's really great. The production quality is great. The acting is great. The story lines are great. I watched the entire series and loved every minute of it.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I ordered Boardwalk Empire last summer knowing that it would not be out until after Christmas.  The story is very good with good characters and great set.  Knowing about the real Nucky Johnson and what he looked like it took me a few episodes to get use to Steve Bucemi in the role but now he fits perfectly. You get the feel of how it was to live back then during the pohibition and I am enjoying looking at what the fashion in clothes and automobiles were like also.  One thing I found that times may change but human nature stays the same.

B005VTGB0S|5.0|This leather sleeve is an upscale cover for your tablet.  I tested this with an iPad 2 - so I cannot comment on how well it fits a Galaxy.  The iPad itself gets secured to the cover via 4 strong corner elastic bands - which snuggly hold the device in place.  The handsome leather surface is 'pebbled', and folds around to protect your iPad from scratches, etc.  The cover will fold back, and has 3 different slots for propping the iPad into table-top positions.  This has been really useful for us to make Skype video calls, or to do email with a bluetooth keyboard.  Another long elastic strap holds the lid in place when you want to cover up the ipad.  This is a stylish, and useful accessory.  Be forewarned, that this case does not accommodate the rear facing camera on the iPad2.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|My kids are so into this entire series.  We have watched both movies and my oldest has read all the books.
0761158820|5.0|I got this book for my son, but turns out he is a little young (6) to make the toys himself.  I was recruited and I love it!  The pieces are perforated, so no cutting is needed and the projects go together great.  I am in love with this book!

B003XMKMTQ|5.0|I have not listened to 2004 album yet.I been listening 2010 album and the 2007 albums.I alwasyed loved eric claptons work.I kind of having a hard time getting away from the 70s music.I use to play guitar in the past and i really love eric clapton,since he is the best and stands alone in guitar playing.There use to be guitar contest some years ago and eric clapton won i believe at least 8 years in a row.Even if people may not care for claptons music,i have heard them say that he is the master player and the greatest.There is so much more that can be said.  geno
B004J1DBJI|5.0|5/5 but the font size is really small ... I wish they had an option to increase it. other than that it works wonders for my calculus learning skills.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I haven't used google calendar, so I guess I haven't experienced those problems, but I really love this. You can make different categories for each thing you need (especially handy for school). The layout makes a lot more sense if you turn it sideways :) I sort of got lost when I had it vertical...but I really love this! Total life saver!!
B004FOA84A|5.0|I remember when a game like this would have taken up half your hard drive and cost you over $20.00.  Heck, I remember no computer at all and watching the original 13 Ghosts!  At $.99. it's a real bargain.  Like all good games, it leaves you wanting more.  Parts were more challenging for me because of my limited manual dexterity, but that's not the programmer's fault.  I like the game a lot and hope for other, similar products.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Best ever miniseries, I own this for myself and bought it here for my brother-in-law for Xmas several years ago.  When they have Band of Brothers marathons on cable TV, I still watch the episodes even though I own them all - that's how good the production was.
B00005R2IS|4.0|I loved the Mad Max movies,the first one is pretty good if you haven't watched it in a long time.I've never liked racing movies or high-speed pursuit movies except the Mad Max films...it's just good old-fashion action without slow-motion moments or re-hashed effects you see in modern movies.The movie has one thing I wished they changed-the legendary villian known as the Night Rider dies at the beginning of the film,yet throughout the film the biker gang he led honors his name deeply yet throughout the story you just don't get to see what made the Night Rider so legendary.Overall a good film.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|There are so many positive reviews here that I don't have much to add.  I'll just say that if you're interested in fitness and/or an entertaining story, this book is as good as it gets.  Top notch.  I couldn't put it down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is full with awesome games and I love it  including bounce which is an awesome soccor game. the only.thing I don't like about it is you have to earn points to get more games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good game it is very addicting can not put it down my kids love it buy these game good game
B003L77G6A|3.0|I'm really annoyed with the so-called \\"DVD\\" quality of Season 4. It's about as high-res as a youtube video-clip expanded in fullscreen mode, where low-resolution \\"pixelation\\" occurs throughout all the shows. There's a very big difference between the video quality of this season compared to seasons 1 through 3, which I also own. The worst example is on Disc 1's advert to let people know that TBBT will be showing 5 days a week before the video loads into the menu screen - it's horrible.  This makes me wonder whether I got a pirated disc instead of the original. If you have a similar experience, please let me know! I don't know if this is WB's problem or the seller I bought from.
B006H3MIV8|2.0|There are some nice moments on these cds.  Artists like Mark Knopfler, Jackson Browne, Billy Bragg, Nils Lofgren, Pete Townshend, and most notably Pete Seeger all put in fine performances.  But there are plenty of weak tracks recorded by some folks who just can't measure up to the music.  And one has to question why the greatest interpreter of Dylan's music, Roger McGuinn, was not invited to participate in this project.  McGuinn's groundbreaking readings of Dylan's music with The Byrds changed the whole landscape of how Dylan, and other artists arranged and performed many of the songs that are contained on these cds.  In fact, for the title of this project to be called \\"Chimes of Freedom,\\" and then to pass on the man who made that song famous seems narrow-minded to me.  Of course one remembers Bob's poetry on \\"Chimes,\\" but it was The Byrds who turned the song into an anthem that will always be loved by knowledgeable fans of rock music.  To this day, McGuinn always includes \\"Chimes\\" in his concerts, and his chiming 12-string Rickenbacker and perfectly phrased vocals bring the house down with applause.  Like \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" McGuinn took Dylan's song (Chimes) to another musical level and created a lasting, definitive sound that those songs will always be remembered by.  It should be also said that The Byrds and McGuinn were the only artists who, by nature of the greatness of their interpretations, actually changed the way Dylan recorded his own music.  As great as many of the artists are on this cd, I don't think a single one of them had the kind of influence on Dylan that the Byrds had.  It goes well beyond \\"Chimes\\" and \\"Tambourine Man,\\" to \\"Back Pages,\\" Lay Down Your Weary Tune,\\" \\"Spanish Harlem Incident,\\" \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere,\\" \\"This Wheel's On Fire,\\" on and on right into McGuinn's solo career.  Listen to McGuinn's powerful version of \\"Up to Me,\\" on the \\"Cardiff Rose\\" cd as oppossed to Dylan's spare take on \\"Biograph,\\" and you'll see what I'm saying.  So,where is Roger McGuinn?  And how could he be slighted this way?  One reviewer points out the great Bob-fest cd as a reference point around other artists performing Dylan songs; and what was the highlight of that concert?  Unarguably, it was the performance of \\"My Back Pages\\" that McGuinn kicked off in a rousing fashion.  Mr. McGuinn's absence from this package is unforgivable.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I have been very pleased with this product. It fits the Kindle very well  and does not take up much room in my wifes hand bag.I would order  it again very pleased.
B004A8ZX28|2.0|I think a lot of reviewers missed it on this one - although it's based on a novel, the structure of the film, it's characters, situations, and actions, have been cobbled together into a poor remake of Total Recall.  I realized this as soon as his wife didn't recognize him after he left the hospital, then it was easy to see where everything would go from there.  I like Liam Neeson and he was adequate as was the rest of the cast, but the movie as a whole was a misfire.
B004XQO90O|4.0|Good sci-fi thriller about rewinding and doing it again...<br />Military hero finds himself in a strange mission in Chicago .. When he thought he was actually fighting in Afghanistan. Now he finds himself in somebody else's body, on a train, with a pretty girl that he never saw in his life. While he still struggles to figure it out, the train blows up in a fire ball.<br />Rewind. Do it again. Captain Goodwin, Colleen, tells our hero, Captain Stevens, Colter, who is in some kind of capsule, via a screen, that he has 8 minutes to find the bomb and to figure out who is the bomber. And back to square 1. More than once. Some progress each time.<br />I liked it, I am usually fascinated by time travel stories. Going back and changing the past looks like a pretty good idea to me. Never mind the complications.<br />If you think of figuring out the holes in the plot, be my guest.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there are so many games to play!and its a great time waster.I recommed this game.the only down side is you have to by the games with points.they are not already unlocked.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is the best Bible app. thank you youversion! I am a preacher and know I use this app all the time. I can take all the translations I like with me in my pocket.
B000005KQT|5.0|I've been searching for old American music and have been very, very happy so far w/the collection I have been creating for myself. Little Walker met my expectations. His music is from the 50's. He played his harmonica from his soul. This is a fantastic CD!
030746363X|5.0|This is a very interesting book. The research is well documented and the author is going all the way in his testing of hypothesis. I do not buy the whole story, and there is bound to be exaggeration all along. But the whole process is thought provoking and well spread out. Very interesting, and the reader will certainly adopt some of the proposed life changes. Highly recommended forwarded with a minimum of critical sense.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I loveeee this app! You can download songs as mp3 files and take your favorite videos and download them! It very great for long car rides. Download this app! Sooooo glad it was free! I downloaded Tv episodes and music and watch them on car rides. Very good app for kindle fire. :)
044651506X|3.0|This book started nicely - it was witty and developed characters well, with interesting promise. Then the storyline dragged, then turned implausible, then completely absurd. The storyline and characters are so stereotypical it is rather laughable. Admittedly, I did find the smart-aleck NY homicide detective John Corey (our hero!) to be frequently entertaining, even occasionally hilarious. But his actions were often completely unbelievable - so it was difficult to get invested and really care. John is handsome, witty, cocky, strong, virile, etc., so the women fall for him. The bumbling local cop is a Barney Fife look-alike. The lead detective, Beth, is smart & beautiful and eventually falls for John (of course). The bad guys are pompous and unlikeable from the start. The CIA and FBI get involved, sending humorless guys in dark suits to make foil any conspiracy - these characters are total clichés: sly, underhanded, dull, and secretive.  John meets his true love (Emma), who is also formulaic: sweet, sexy, smart, spontaneous, understanding, etc.  If that were not enough banality, then there is the storyline (I hesitate to call it a \\"plot\\"). Our hero, John, figures out virtually everything by about halfway through the book. I kept waiting/hoping for a surprising plot twist, but no luck. Once the mystery was revealed, and the bad guys were surmised, the rest of the book was rather tedious. John does unbelievably stupid things (breaking and entering, tampering with evidence, beating people up...), which became tiresome.  In the climax, John decides to get on a little boat like the one from Gilligan's Island during a hurricane and sail the open sea, even though he's never had any boating experience. Cute little Beth decides to go along with him. Just sing along to the Gilligan's Island theme song: \\"the weather started getting rough, the little ship was tossed; if not for the courage of the fearless John, the ship would have been lost.\\" Somehow they make it to the island.Amazingly, even though the bad guys had 3 guns between them, while shirtless, barefoot John had nothing but a knife, he came out victorious. Wow.  So implausible! But then, it was also completely stereotypical - in fact it was *too* stereotypical - I agree with another reviewer - this *had* to have been meant as a parody. Right?? Otherwise, shame on Nelson DeMille.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I'd give it 5 stars but there are still a few minor glitches. The location doesn't always. stick once set.  would also like to see map with fronts and low/high pressure systems, in addition to radar.
B002UD56I6|3.0|I bought this on sale over the holidays.  It was decent, but I guess I was expecting more out of it in terms of telling the story of \\"This Is It\\" and I expected more performances to listen to on my home theater sound system.  It's just OK in my opinion.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|heck yes maps on app now for fire!!!!!! 5 stars. thanks for the update. top weather app on the kindle fire
B001UGB1X8|1.0|As you watch the movie you try to link all the murders and the different events in the movie, but it is useless.  It is very confusing and boring.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B0068RHGJM|3.0|Imaginaerum Review:  Nightwish's new album \\"Imaginaerum\\" named after the movie of a similar title coming later this year features more of Annette Oslon's vocals and surprisingly less of them as well. The first 30 seconds of your album are very important as it sets the tone for the rest of the record and the listener's first impressions of your entire work.  Kamelot, Ayreon and similar bands in the same vein including Nightwish itself always have bombastic and dramatic or underdramatic (depending on the tonality of the album) openings that a listener can always work back to as the flashpoint of the fire to come. Unfortunately Imaginaerum gets off to a slow and oddly pedantic start with Marco singing in Finnish to a very boardwalk type sleepy waltz. What follows are two heavier yet oddly pop-infused songs with tons of original Nightwish flair the group has become known for. The songs \\"Storytime\\" and \\"Ghost River\\" are some of the best and heaviest works on the entire album. They take the album off sprinting towards orchestral heavy metal in Nightwish's traditional fashion.  Therefore it's a shame that Imaginaerum constantly is losing its own momentum by taking one or two heavy songs and immediately contrasting them with slow celtic, waltz, even jazzy music instead of better grouping the songs on the disc. What the listener gets is a ton of erratic and often mismatched tempos and styles next to each other that feel nothing short of eclectic. What the biggest shame of this album is, is that it's not a bad record! It's not \\"Once\\" or even \\"Poet and the Pendulum\\" but it certainly isn't Nightwish's worst album, though they could stand to lose the youth choir they have become fond of. It doesn't fit, and it doesn't sound great.  Oddly, Annette's voice is almost a 3rd class citizen here, for every one time you hear Annette on this record, you'll also hear Marco, a choir and tons of interfering orchestra. Instead of making the orchestra a fantastic new band member a la their last record \\"Poet and the Pendulum\\" they consistently bash you over the head with it in ways that feel inappropriate given the band's track record of amazing orchestral pieces over the past 5 years. I also feel like this band experimented and has failed with poppier tracks and even a straight prose section similar to \\"Trans-Siberian Orchestra\\" legacy. Annette's voice just isn't the star of the show, they do well to bury it or straight up not have it on some songs almost all together. Track by track there isn't anything wrong with any one of their songs, but combined onto a full-length album, it just didn't work this time.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|For the price a very good pack. Enough room for camera gear for a day hike and easy to use, although tripod fits a bit awkwardly.

0545403359|3.0|As wonderful as this fictional account is and as glamorous as it's star is (who does not love a beautiful horse! myself included), let's not forget the real Horses, Donkeys and Mules that are companions and heros to soldiers in war. Take \\"Duffy\\" for example, a Donkey from WWI, who was found wandering on the beach at Gallipoli by an Australian soldier named \\"Simpson\\". They became friends and together they saved 300 soldiers by going out on the battlefield at Gallipoli, Turkey, ten to fifteen times a day and during the night to save the wounded. Their story became one of endurance, courage, friendship and good humor. \\"Duffy\\" survived the war, retired with care and was awarded the Gold Medal of Honor. In Australia, they have a statue of Duffy and Major Simpson to commemorate their bravery. I wear a Purple Poppy every day to remind myself of the animal casualties of war. There is a wonderful commemorative monument in London you can visit and remember not only the Donkeys, Horses, and Mules, but dogs, dolphins, elephants as well! Selfless service, indeed.
0525478817|5.0|Quite simply one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. I bought the book simply because I really enjoy John and Hank Green's web series, but man did I get more than I bargained for. Truly moving, truly great, it was fantastic.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think its great to play and you get to unlock more games as you go. I would recommend this to anyone!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Addictive variety of games that are great fun for kids too. Games are unlocked by points, which are acquired by playing already unlocked games or thru special offers. Points can also be paid for at a reasonable price.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I have owned three copies of American Gods since first reading it.  The most recent physical copy was purchased for me by my beautiful wife for my 32nd birthday, which is oddly enough the same age as Shadow, the main character in the book.  When my wife purchased a Kindle for me for Christmas of the same year I discovered that a Tenth Anniversary Edition was available.  I couldn't have a Kindle without my favorite book installed on it.  I was already over halfway through the book again when I downloaded the Tenth Anniversary Edition but I started it over again to read it digitally.  When I started reading the book I discovered small differences between the version that I know and love, and the new edition.  These differences did not make a difference to the story, but they added bits here and there.  I really enjoyed reading the additional material and feel that it made a little more sense with the added content.  If you haven't read the book I would definitely go with the Tenth Anniversary Edition.  If you have read it before I would still recommend the Tenth Anniversary Edition... that is if you really liked the book, which I did and do.  I'm sure I will read the book many more times and can easily justify buying the new edition.  [[ASIN:0062059882 American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition: A Novel]]
B006HL9G10|5.0|This app works beautifully on my Kindle Fire. I collect singing bowls and am most impressed with the tones that are used. It's a simple to use timer that works reliably and easily, and it's nice to have that connection to a community of meditators. I've used much more expensive timers and find this one to be better than all of them!
B004FDPOHC|5.0|I have been listening to this album for quite a while at work and in the car.  It reminds me of the ancient/long-forgotten soundtrack to the Activision game \\"Interstate '76\\", in that I can listen to the soundtrack and identify with the action in the game... or in this case, the movie.<br /><br />There are rocking tunes, most notably 'Derezzed', but a lot of the music is ambient and symphonic.  All of that, combined with a unique sound that I've not heard before in a movie score, makes for a very nice body of work to listen to and enjoy.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Nice-looking and works very well on my KF. The unexpected bit where I have to hit the power button and then unlock my Fire before hitting the snooze button, actually wakes my brain up enough that it's unlikely I'll sleep in.
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|Was hoping this would enable me to use my Motorola Bionic (Droid) in the iPod dock in my 2009 VW EOS but it doesn't work.  :(
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Just a minor design flaw, otherwise a nice, lightweight case so far. My wife and I both ordered one, she getting black and me getting the gray. They are these different colors on the back side, but the front flap is black on both . The idea was to differentiate so we could tell whose Fire it is on the table. You cannot do this without a little extra effort which could have been avoided by making the gray one gray all over.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so fun with a wide variety. fun for all ages. works well on kindle fire. absolutely entertaining. love it so much
B005UKJX4E|4.0|In what seems to be par for the course for a Terrence Malick film, people either love this movie or hate it. If you find yourself wondering which extreme is correct, or more accurately which side of the fence you're likely to fall on should you dedicate 3 hours to watching, just ask yourself how important story and plot are to your personal moviegoing experience. That may sound silly, but consider that music videos don't always tell coherent stories, yet can be rightfully appreciated for their artistry and emotional pull. It's best to think of 'The Tree of Life' as a really long music video, and it's a very well done one at that, but if you expect a story to go with it, then prepare to be disappointed - angered, even - as many unsuspecting film goers have been. But it is what it is, and it does what it sets out to do very well. Just anticipate that it's not going to be a typical film watching experience, have patience with it, and you should get the most enjoyment out of it that you are able.
1573229725|4.0|Okay.  I have, quite literally, just finished this book.  I started this journey with \\"The Little Stranger\\" and loved it so much I went out and bought ALL of her books.  I wanted to read them in order starting with her first book to watch the evolution of this remarkable talent.  Some people are good writers.  Some are good storytellers.  She is both.  Her writing has the ability to transport you back to a time and place and make you feel like you are right there with the characters.<br /><br />So, you might ask why I only gave it 4 stars rather than 5.  It wasn't an easy decision but I felt like she sometimes overdid it with all the description.  If it weren't for the fact that her writing is so darn good, I'd be annoyed because all this wonderful text is making it take longer to get to the next parts.<br /><br />I won't recap the story as there plenty of people who have already done it.  What I will say is that I was blown away by the twists and turns of the story, and I had a hard time putting it down when the first twist came.<br /><br />I'll sign off now.  I'm about to start \\"The Night Watch\\".<br /><br />By the way, the cover on this book is beautiful.  The color and composition are incredible!
0375413405|5.0|Julia Child's work has enabled me to go from just following recipes to developing a technique.  She has changed the way I approach cooking and has made the kitchen the most wonderful room in my house.  I spent years reading Saveur and Fine Cooking magazine, years watching the Food Network.  I saw \\"The Way to Cook\\" and my eyes opened.  Then I purchased this book and my life in the kitchen changed.  The way this book notates recipes with the respective ingredients listed at each step should be a benchmark for all recipes printed anywhere.  This is so much more than a cookbook.  This is a classic that should be on the shelf of anyone who loves to cook and eat.

0385344325|5.0|First, I was confused. The story is a flashback, but for some reason I had a hard time catching onto that. I remember feeling irritated because I couldn't figure out exactly where, in time, we were. Then I was hooked, as the story settled into the flashback and I figured out this is where Reacher began. This is his backstory, how he came to be. Why he travels so light. The whole of it. There's more to come, I know, but this is where it all started.<br /><br />I have to say, it was quite fun delving into the why of it all. If you are a Reacher fan, you will love this book. It's like snooping in someone's medicine cabinet. It has everything I've come to love from a Reacher novel: Reacher, of course, in uniform...grrrrr! A couple of love-making sessions that steamed up the mirror and a mystery with clue upon clue and twist upon twist. If you haven't read any Reacher stories, you've been missing out. Go...buy one...right now. I'll wait.<br /><br />First Line: \\"The Pentagon is the world's largest office building, six and a half million square feet, thirty thousand people, more than seventeen miles of corridors, but it was built with just three street doors, each one of them opening into a guarded pedestrian lobby.\\" Well, ain't that interesting. Great tourist information, for sure. Typical Reacher style, definitely. Not a real hook for me though. Mind you, it picks up pretty quickly as Reacher enters the building, so don't give up based on the first line. Plus, I suppose there are those who will be fascinated by knowing all that about the Pentagon.<br /><br />This was a fantastic read, and one of my favorites of the entire series. The last few books I felt like Lee Child was losing his steam a bit. Like maybe he was tired and done with Reacher. But this one proves he's not done just yet. The structure does feel a bit Hollywood, perhaps in anticipation of a movie now that One Shot is finally in production? Whatever the reason, if you ever liked a Reacher book don't miss this one. If you've never read one, start with this one. Then go back and read the others in order. 1 star each for great plot, excellent writing, fun pace, grrrr factor of lead character, and 1 for overall greatness. Lee Child, you outdid yourself with this one. 5/5 stars!ne, start with this one. Then go back and read the others in order. 1 star each for great plot, excellent writing, fun pace, grrrr factor of lead character, and 1 for overall greatness. Lee Child, you outdid yourself with this one. 5/5 stars!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a beautiful closing to an astounding series.It asks imploring questions,such as, &#34;Is it ever right to take a few lives for the 'greater good'? What can sacrifice to begin or restore love?&#34; Filled with emotion and conflict, Katnis's final thoughts are captured clearly.This book brought me to tears a few times with all the suffering that almost everyone can relate too. As moving as &#34;The Red  Badge of Courage&#34;.  :)
B006JD48NM|5.0|This film was incredible.  Senna was a flawed man like all of us, but he was so pure in his desire to be the best, both on and off the track, that you had to admire him.  He made racing interesting in an era when defensive driving to slow and beat better drivers was the norm. He RACED!  The film brought much to the table including home movies and private moments about Senna's life that gave a great insight into him as a competitor on the track and a man who cared deeply for his country and the children who live there.  These children  needed a chance at a better life and Senna fought tirelessly for them despite coming from a rich background himself.  His charities are active and strong to this day and have helped countless children get a shot at a better life.  Watch this movie.  You will be glad you did.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|There must be more to this book, it ended so abruptly, I'm not sure I got all of it.  Actually, I noticed this complaint in the reviews from other readers, maybe we are getting in early on a series. I know It wasn't a problem with my IPAD.  The pictures are fun, the story was ok, but not terribly original.  I read it in an evening, and feel a bit disappointed.  If you've read 'A Wrinkle in Time' in 4th grade, you are not going to be amazed.  If you've read \\"Wicked Pigeon Ladies in the Garden\\" by Mary Chase in 5th grade, you are not going to find it shocking.  Maybe it's me, but this book seemed to have been written for a young adult audience.  Wish I had gotten it out of the public library, I probably won't be knocking myself out for the sequel if there is one.
074322454X|4.0|This book is full of amazing stories.  The men that lived these stories are what heroes should be about.  They put their lives on the line for their country and their fellow soldiers.  They lived history, and changed its course dramatically.  This book is a must for all military, war, and American history buffs.  Heck, this is the type of book that should be mandatory for ALL Americans.<br /><br />The one thing holding this back is that the writing is not the best.  I don't know if Ambrose took what the soldiers wrote and put it in the book word for word, or this just isn't his best work.  There were a lot of areas that just did not flow that well.  Also, there is a lot, A LOT, of military language in terms of troop grouping.  I have no idea what any of that means, and I still don't.
0439023491|5.0|I'm not a great fan of Suzanne Collins's writing style, but the idea behind this trilogy is fantastic.  The books are exciting and a quick read.  I'm really just reviewing these books to improve my recommendations, but I still recommend this book!<br /><br />The arena in this book is even better than the first one, although the dues ex machina ending of this one is a little annoying.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game. very addicting and fun.  I just wish that some of the games didn't cost so many points
B0057MFA42|1.0|Unfortunately, it is true.  After waiting 20 years for this concert to be released, Universal has given us an unwatchable Blu-Ray.  The concert itself is amazing.  The video and audio are, on their own, fantastic.  But they're out of sync.  It varies, and certain camera shots are OK.  But much of the time, you hear a cymbal crash notably earlier than you see Dave hit it.  Or you hear Kurt slide from one note to the next a moment before he actually does it.  If you're paying any attention at all, it quickly becomes unwatchable.  The DVD is apparently fine, and while the quality won't quite measure up to the Blu-Ray, having it in sync is more important than the uncompressed audio and higher resolution we could have on BD.  I haven't picked it up yet, but that's the only option.  Don't buy the Blu-Ray.  Universal denies there is a problem and says it's the fault of our equipment, but nearly every review of the Blu-Ray is negative.  It's clearly a defective production.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I have once again (by accident) accepted the update for Evernote on my Kindle Fire and it stopped working. I can only use it if I decline ALL updates.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|Believe me, I was skeptical when I ordered this but after playing Dance Central for the past couple hours, I'm seriously shocked by the negative reviews. I live in a TEENY (700 sq ft) apartment and playing Dance Central required me to be pretty close to the wall.  I got 5 stars on songs then.  I also get 5 stars now.  If it helps any - my Kinect is also less than 2 weeks old, and has no dust or finger prints on the lenses or the zoom.  It's positioned below my about 1 ft below my projector screen and at chest height. I can play REALLY close to the kinect now - at about 4 feet with no issues.

0955153077|5.0|I just received my copy of this book, and this book is amazing! I have purchased other books regarding tutorials and techniques for working in Photoshop, with the sole purpose of completing digital art. (Some of those books have come from 3D Total, the company behind this book as well.)<br /><br />However, all of the other books have been written with the idea that the reader already has a good, solid understanding of how to work in Photoshop. The idea is, here are some tips and techniques to help one improve their ability and skills within Photoshop. This book is not like the previously mentioned class of digital art books. From the very first pages, the book starts out with basic principles and techniques on how to begin using Photoshop. You learn how to adjust the default settings in Photoshop and then how to setup your graphic tablet as well. From there the information continues, teaching someone how to go about using the tools found in Photoshop and eventually how to start creating one's own piece of digital art. There are even limited and brief sections on art theory and what makes a good piece, color, composition, etc.<br /><br />After looking for many books related to learning digital art techniques, I am glad I risked the money and bought this book. This is by far the best book I have found for anyone looking to learn about digital art as a complete beginner.

I also thought Danny McBride's part, especially in the first scenes, was hilarious. After I watched it a second and third time I realized the rest of the movie is pretty good as well.

B0069GRIHW|4.0|Let's get one thing straight-I've been listening to THE DOORS since the band's beginning-both live and on record.  So please don't think I dislike the band or their music when you read the following.  The four \\"stars\\" are for the original album.  I still own the original vinyl release-the one with the cool, clear plastic over the portrait of the band-along with all the other Elektra Records albums.<br /><br />Well-here it is I guess.  The original album plus about 51 minutes of previously unreleased alternate tracks.  Plus the unheard song \\"She Smells So Nice\\" (with a poorly recorded vocal).  Plus some between takes studio chat.  A booklet with a few photos of the band working in the studio, plus an essay by noted writer David Fricke.  All in a cardboard tri-fold package.  The sound is very good-even having a little warmth to it, reminiscent of the original vinyl release.<br /><br />Was \\"L.A. Woman\\" THE DOORS' greatest album?  Maybe, maybe not.  Certainly it's one of the band's best albums.  And while I, too, like to hear unreleased stuff for a better understanding of a band, I can't help but think that listening to these extra tracks, proves that the original record was a good, stand alone album.  The extra tracks are interesting, and at times, even exciting, but overall they're superfluous-it's obvious that the basis (especially early on) of the band's music (not necessarily the lyrics), and Morrison's first love and influence,  was the blues.  And that's fine.  But I don't understand Mr. Fricke, who I've read from his first days at Rolling Stone Magazine (when that magazine mattered), and who is usually right when writing about music, when he writes that THE DOORS were \\"the most thrilling American band of the '60s caught live,\\".  What?  In an era when rock (as opposed to r'n'r) was producing a number of exciting live bands, why are THE DOORS at the top of the heap?  And he writes that this album is \\"arguably, the first true indie-rock album, the sound of a band writing and playing on home ground, beholden to nothing but their own passionate standards\\".  What was the difference between what THE DOORS  were doing, and all the other great bands of the era?  Maybe it's me, but his comments seem to go a bit too far.  He seems to be, perhaps, over-selling the whole thing a bit.  \\"L.A. Woman\\" is a good album-as good (I feel) as the band's first album, and \\"Morrison Hotel\\".  But there were other bands producing music of great excitement and worth during the same period.<br /><br /> Was this another \\"cash-in\\"?  Who knows.  If you don't own the original album, this is the one to pick up if it's cheap enough.  Now if you're a died-in-the-wool DOORS fan/collector, you'll probably disagree with what I've written-that's fine.  To each his own.  But I can't help but get a slight, underwhelmed feeling with the whole package.  I listen to the original album fairly often when I'm in a \\"DOORS mood\\", and I continue to think back to hearing the band just after their first album was released,and how exciting it all was.  In those days the abbreviated version of \\"Light My Fire\\" was played on AM radio.  Initially very few people knew of the longer version-it was played on the then new FM \\"underground\\" radio-usually only broadcasting late at night in San Diego in those first years.  I still remember the feeling of hearing THE DOORS first album-with those long tracks, and lyrics that were a long way from the teen pop of the era-something weird was going on here.  And the few people who knew about the band (including me) felt like they  were in a group apart-we knew something the rest didn't-cool!  But this \\"40th Anniversary\\" release isn't really necessary if you want to hear one of their best albums.  The extra tracks seem to dilute the power, the feel, of the original album.  As I wrote, there are some good moments on the second disc-but the original is still the best.n home ground, beholden to nothing but their own passionate standards\\".

B001GZ6QC4|3.0|I ordered The Dark Knight thinking I ordered exactly what was pictured and described. Instead, I received The Dark Knight, French-Canadian edition, complete with the subheading \\"Le Chevalier Noir\\" on the cover, just in case I was confused. I should have ordered the two-disc special edition but then I might get it in Cantonese or something.  Amazon, when you use a second party to fulfill your orders, be honest and tell the customer exactly what they might receive. I'm not going to send it back because it is in English, but I will practice utmost caution when ordering from \\"fulfilled through\\" items. Thanks.
B000GYI32M|4.0|I have already seen then entire series of the show, but have been working on buying the seasons for myself. It is a great show to curl up on the couch and have a marathon on a cold cloudy day! Lots of drama to keep you interested.
B00479SVBU|4.0|it's so compact but it works well.  great sound.  I am plugging my ipod to it through audio jack.  I would not use usualy apple USB cable, because as soon as you plugged in, it start to sync and tried to download all songs and you can not play the songs.  One draw back is, there is no \\"off \\" button.  I am not sure even it has auto off feature or not.  also it is kind a tight fit with my car cig lighter outlet.  and, it is pain to plug it in or out.  Other than that it is nice product and transmit sound very well and I would give 4 out of 5.  Hope it last a long time.
B00563M11M|3.0|Snuff is a classic Pratchett novel. It is entertaining, funny and a good yarn to boot. I wouldn't classify it as one of his best, but it is certainly not his worst work either. If you like Pratchett's style, I highly recommend you read this one.
B0069EP0Z6|5.0|Not only is she beautiful, but her detached persona is a perfect vehicle for this astonishingly haunting song.  Lyrically, Carly Simon comes to mind with moody dips and brooding focuses of codependence vs. singular existence.  It's a new and interesting look at \\"relationships\\" for the current day coupled with a memorable melody and impeccably understated delivery.  Musically, Tori Amos and/or Kate Bush seem to present as possible inspirations.  She's a modern-day poetess!<br /><br />Although I am perplexed by the need for remixes geared toward clubs for such an \\"acoustic\\" masterpiece, I sense a bright future for this sensual new artist<br />with and by its first, original version.
B002N5N5LG|4.0|I'm a little late coming to the game but I'm very happy I decided to jump on the Community train. With a highly appealing cast of a mix of characters, all oddballs and loser this series really is right up my alley. Full of jokes that actually require a few second of thought to get, the intelligence of this show is completely there. Highly recommend watching this series to all lovers of smart comedy. Can't wait to start watching season 2!
1905236042|4.0|I bought this yoga deck at the recommendation of my daughter's occupational therapist for her to do some yoga at home in between OT sessions.  I think that the way that the cards are presented (quality, color, illustrations, etc.) has been a big plus in terms of getting my daughter interested in doing yoga at home.  While she does yoga only sporatically during the day because of all of her other activities, she and my other daugher both pick a few of the relaxation poses to do as part of their bedtime routines.  We dim the lights and I read through the poses they have chosen (good ones are \\"All is well\\", \\"Special place\\", \\"Animal friend\\", and \\"Rainbow pose\\") while they relax and wind down for the day.  We have incorporated deep breathing with the poses so that they are well practiced at it for when they might need to use the deep breathing as a strategy for when they get frustrated, upset, angry, etc. during the day.  My only complaint has to do with the illustrations.  While I appreciate that they are colorful and depict children, the proportions seem to be off on many of the drawings, making the actual poses a bit questionable as to how to do them correctly.  While I understand that many people believe that kids shouldn't be corrected much when they are doing yoga, it's difficult if the poses as drawn are disproportionate and/or show incorrect body lines within the poses.  All that said, I am very happy with the product overall and would definitely recommend it to others for OT/relaxation purposes or just in general.
B000002KKC|4.0|Tusk is the third album from Fleetwood Mac's most famous line-up, but it doesn't seem to pick up where Rumours, its predecessor and one of the most successful albums ever, left off. Despite the personal struggles and collapsed relationships within the group, Rumours was a tight 11 track, 40 minute record with some of the most straightforward and infectious singles of the 1970s. Tusk is the album Rumours might have been, a sprawling, 70 minute set originally released as a double LP. Here, the band is literally split apart over the 20 tracks, aside from several appearances of their trademark harmonies. Sadness, loss, and occasional paranoia color most of these songs with a thick eeriness.  Tusk is most profoundly influenced by the songwriting and production of Lindsey Buckingham, as expressed in the credits. Lindsey's production is smooth and clear, perhaps the only element that keeps this album together as a single work. His work is especially experimental, as on the claustrophobic title track and the deliciously bizarre \\"What Makes You Think You're the One.\\"  Due to Buckingham's domination over the album, the work from Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie stands out. Nicks expands upon the theme of loss she first explored with \\"Landslide,\\" and \\"Storms\\" and \\"Beautiful Child\\" are simple and gorgeous reflections. McVie's adult contemporary style turns soulful on \\"Brown Eyes\\" and is stripped down for the gentle \\"Honey Hi.\\"  Upon my earliest listens to Tusk, I was disappointed. I was lost in the sheer number of tracks, many of them difficult to absorb. I've accepted that Tusk is not supposed to make sense or be easy to listen to. Furthermore, its essential highlights rank among Fleetwood Mac's best. I now enjoy getting lost in this expansive work and discovering something new every time. 4 Stars.

0756405890|5.0|Though this book is more in the genre that I read, I've suggested it to almost everyone I've met for over a year now. It's a wonderful book that has let no one down, even if you're a critic, it'll be more than decent. The story to me, is realistic. It has a wonderful balance of slow, fast, happy, sad, fantasy, realism, and much more. The wording, in my opinion, is some of the best. Very, very quotable book. I'm a fairly active reader, and this is my favorite book as of the last 3 years.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|My favorite sit-com!  Season 2 has some of the most memorable episodes!  And it all started with a big bang!!
B00715SUI6|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of time. I think it may have been sexist, too actually. It did not seem to represent the 80's very well. There was no John Cusack, and there were certainly no songs by music legends Earth, Wind and Fire. This movie is a jive turkey
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This movie was made for Blu Ray and this is the best collection of all the movies with tons of bonus features.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I hesitated before spending $100+ on headphones but these are well worth it. I'm not enough of an audio snob to tell you these are the greatest headphones on the planet but I can tell you they sound much, much better than $20 headphones.<br /><br />They're a lot more adjustable than cheap headphones too so they're more comfortable to wear for long periods. They have a long, coiled cord so they're easier to move around in while plugged into a computer in your cube. The earpieces are also more comfortable and seal better than the cheaper varieties.<br /><br />They block outside sounds quite well also, which can be good or bad depending on what you're doing while wearing these.<br /><br />Overall I'd say these are well worth the price if you're looking for something nicer.

007174889X|4.0|Its a great book.Its like my bible for internal medicine.I am loving it.It also has a DVD in it for 26 extra chapters.Amazon delivered it a little late though.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This is such a delight within the category of comedy series, absolutely fabulous and the best ever I have experienced. Sheldon is a real treasure, not to mention all the other characters in this show. Penny is luckily there to put some down to earth common sense into the funny and weird scientists. This series made me want to know more about science! I don´t stop admiring their ability to remember all those difficult scientific dialogues. I can hardly wait for the next seasons to be released on dvd!
006123141X|5.0|I love James Rollins. He is a wonderful author and always leaves me on the edge of my seat. This novel is no exception and I was thoroughly entertained.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|nice set of creative real-time camera filters! some of them are like pencil sketches. you can see the effects right away before clicking.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|When looking for a DSLR backpack i came across this one by AmazonBasics. This bag is anything but Basic, on the outside and on your back its Comfortable Looking and seems small on the outside, but when you open it up its like Narnia! is so big and holds so much I will probably have trouble filling it! the padding is great, the whole interior where the lens and camera goes is all adjustable, move the dividers around at will via velcro which holds super strong! It comes with the dividers place in already in recommended spots ill say, i moved 2 so that my telephoto lens is laying on its side taking up two spots and put that divider underneath it for its extra padding it offered! super amazed and SATISFIED!!
0061537934|3.0|This book reminded me of the movie *Warhorse,* and not because it featured an animal as a main character - but because it was quite well made but exquisitely \\"corny.\\"  The recurrent usage of auto racing as a metaphor for life was interesting, and as a dog lover I found the canine narrator, Enzo, irresistible in many respects.  But the plot of the story was something along the lines of one of those hokey Christian radio dramas you hear when you're driving across the desert and can only get that one weird station that plays those things. As another reviewer noted at one point, early in the book, the narrator describes a good hero as being flawed and then proceeds to present a perfectly flawless hero. Another reviewer suggested that the hero appeared flawless only because the narrator was a dog who idealized him; but I truly don't believe Enzo was supposed to be an \\"unreliable narrator\\" because there were absolutely no clues (as far as I could see) that that literary technique was being used.  The book gets cornier and cornier as it progresses. When Enzo (in some sort of fantasy sequence) is hooked up to a Stephen Hawkins type speech creating machine and testified in court to exonerate his \\"master\\" I nearly sprained my eyeballs I was rolling them so vigorously!  (Spoilers?)  I'm not giving anything away when I disclose that Enzo dies at the end because the book starts out with Enzo readying to make that one way trip to the veterinarian's office a la *Carlito's Way.* The death scene was actually well done and might even be described as amazing - and I wish it would have just ended there. But the little epilogue was just too much - I came close to spraining my eyeballs once again.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This parody gore-fest has some of my favorite qualities in movies: Comedy, a bit of horror, and some sexy overall wearing hillbilly performance ART. I find this particular sub-genre of the human male(and sometimes human female) HOT.<br /><br />So trap a bunch of cabin-horror movie frat/sorority model-types up in the mountains with two hapless hicks there on vacation to try out a new vacation home (shack) and let the horror movie cliche's roll! Some of the comedy and horror was very predictable but it was time for this to be made and it IS very well made. It's a keeper!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I received a Kindle Fire as a gift for Christmas, and immediately started looking for a case to protect it.  I chose the Folio cover because it gives more protection than a shell, but also has the capability to be propped up.  It's easy to use, and I very much recommend it!

0307352145|5.0|Susan Cain's new book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, has the power to change the way we think about ourselves, each other, and our world. Cain sheds new light on creativity and success by showing that, even in business, many acts of creation have sprung from solitude, not collaboration. As a card-carrying introvert in a workplace - Harvard Business School - that Cain aptly calls the \\"Spiritual Capital of Extroversion,\\" I recognized the daily challenges that \\"quiet people\\" face, as well as the value they can bring, to a world that prizes socializing and fast judgment. This quietly audacious book gives all of us - introverts and extroverts alike - tools that we need to be happier, more effective, and more appreciative of different ways of being.  Quiet deserves to be read by the one-third of us who are introverts, and by everyone who may underestimate introverts at work, in school, and in society. Why? Three reasons:  First, it is a wonderful read. Each chapter springs to life with a story that sparkles with fascinating detail - how the first Apple computer got invented, for example; how Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt fell in love; or how it feels to be welcomed into a Tony Robbins seminar. Even the tales of the research on introversion and extroversion are compelling, bringing the researchers, their subjects, and their scientific quests to life.  The second reason is all that research. Cain marshals evidence to back up every claim. Much of the research was done by others - psychologists, organizational behavior scholars, educational researchers - with Cain reporting, synthesizing, and interpreting. I'm familiar with much of the original research and, as far as I can tell, Cain gets the story right, from Jerome Kagan's studies of temperament in infants to Adam Grant's studies of introversion and extroversion in leaders. And Cain has done a great deal of research herself, including history (like the extreme introversion of Mahatma Gandhi and Rosa Parks) and literature (even the Bible), extensive interviews, and observations in a variety of settings. Cain humanizes all of this not only by making each person real, but also by sprinkling her own personal history throughout. The book is, essentially, a string of great stories woven together by a strong underlying theme: introversion is vastly underrated.  Finally, Quiet is enormously practical. Take, for example, the self-quiz in the opening pages, which helps readers orient themselves toward their own degree of introversion or extroversion. Or the final chapters, which include a great deal of useful advice on how introverts can comfortably behave more like extroverts when they need to; how extroverts and introverts can understand, benefit from, and even love one another; and how parents and teachers can raise introverted children to be comfortable, competent, and happy adults.  I read a pre-publication version of this book, and endorsed it. Having re-read it just now, I remain enthusiastic. I predict that we will soon be hearing a lot of noise about Quiet, for good reason.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the most engrossing and compelling version of the Bible I've read. I really enjoyed the additional chapters and action sequences not found in the original. The sound effects add a lot of excitement to scenes where I normally wouldn't have imagined a cow or geese. I would recommend this version of the Bible to people who have become bored with the original Bible, or also for parties where it would normally be too loud to read. My daughter says &quot;poke him again!&quot; every time we do the Noah game where you try to shove him off the boat.
0312641893|2.0|I wanted to love this story. I have always been fascinated by the permutations of Cinderella that have sprung up around the world and I loved the concept of a futuristic cyborg Cinderella. I thought the world build-up was interesting - a plague-ridden futuristic Beijing (which is the dominant world power?) (and I liked that it was set in China where the first Cinderella story is said to originate from), but I had questions about parts of the premise. Why are cyborgs - with their unique skills and advancements considered second-class citizens? And if they are so disrespected why would anyone ever become one? (Given the choice or not?) I needed a believable reason and CINDER did not deliver.<br /><br />I was confused by the arrival of the Lunars. I felt this story could have had enough going on without adding an alien race. I would have preferred to explore life on earth with the plague, the discrimination against the cyborgs, and maybe some international (but not intergalactic) politics. I thought the Lunar queen made a suitably psychotic villain, but I felt this part of the story worked less well than the parts about the plague, Cinderella's homelife, and cyborged-ness.<br /><br />Beyond that, my biggest issue is that CINDER does not stay true to the underlying message of the Cinderella fairytale... namely that a girl of humble origins through internal goodness and personal work ethic can capture the attention of a prince and therefore become a princess THAT WAY. I was interested in the mystery of Cinder's origins, but the answer was both predictable (not at all shocking to anyone except maybe the main character) and also fundamentally contradictory to the original fairytale...<br /><br />It also reminded me forcibly of the animee show, SAILOR MOON.<br /><br />So, while I did enjoy parts of this novel, it just didn't quite deliver the futuristic Cinderella story I was hoping for.
B005K17RU0|5.0|would recommend you get this app, love the graphics you won't be disappointed very accurate love that it is free
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A fabulous book.  I have given it as a gift on multiple occassions.  Clever and well-written, this was difficult to put down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you love Solitaire, you should get this app. it allows you to play games of Solitaire without needing with a real deck and on the go. I love this app.
B0030A0ZD4|4.0|I'll get to the good stuff first...(I hate reading spoilers in reviews, so I'll just focus on the product itself.)  The clarity of the picture and sound of this remaster is amazing.  I have never owned any of the DVD releases so the last mental image I have of this movie is in it's original grainy VHS glory. Watching this movie in blu-ray for the first time was truly an entirely new experience.  The audio is dynamic and brings you in from the beginning of the movie.  The picture clarity (in comparison to the VHS) is like putting on glasses for the first time.  Good news for those concerned with the country restrictions (as this is a EU release)...it worked perfect on my Toshiba and should definitely work on your Blu-ray.  Now, the not so good stuff...  This may be nitpicking, but I'm not too fond of the reconstructed cover.  I understand there are certain limitations because of the size of the blu-ray case, but I'm never a fan of drastically changing original cover art.  The biggest complaint I have of this particular release of \\"Moonwalker\\" is that they edit out some of the original film. Nothing big. Relatively small sequences that total about 30 seconds of film, but noticeable nonetheless.  Overall, those two flaws aren't enough to make this a passerby.  It is a MUST HAVE for all Michael Jackson fans, especially at the price that Amazon is currently selling it for.  I am extremely happy to have found this and purchased it.  Hope this helps!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Final Fantasy series, way back to the original one on the NES. This game combines the look and feel of the first one with a skill system similar to FFX-2 (costumes versus tablets). About twenty hours into the game, there have been a couple of force quits that made me lose a few minutes of progress, but as long as you save regularly, it's fine.  Quite fun, and I'll be buying the sequel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this game, have no problems with it working.  I recommend down loading the app, it will keep you entertained for hours l!
B005XI94HY|5.0|Disclaimer: This is not actually the deluxe edition of the record. The real deluxe edition has 8 extra songs. The USA version only has four extra tracks tacked onto the end. The only way to get the real deluxe edition is to get the two cd import set or have access to Amazon UK's mp3 store.<br /><br />A Simple Review: The record is lushly vibrant and worth seeking out; rocking art. :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Overall decent experience.. at times the controls are a little soft and iiffy, and does get a little ad baggy, but really for a free game... its decent.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|The story of Wyatt Earp, played by Kurt Russell, is a western we have watched over and over.  Val Kilmer, as Doc Holiday, did a superb job.  The story is a sequel to the Wyatt Earp movie  in which Kevin Costner portrayed him. Robert Mitchum's narrative at the beginning and the end completes it.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have found Evernote very helpful to organize my research because it is available on all my devices and can handle different types of media. I would love for Evernote to add a sharing option that. would. compete with Google docs.

014004891X|5.0|I have always been a lover of John Steinbeck novels, and Of Mice and Men is one of my favorites.  This edition is great because it also includes another one of his great works, Cannery Row.  Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was unsure of whether or not to read this. I had been hearing so much about it, yet like others reviews said, I didn't realize it was geared to young adults/teenagers. Being 27 years old, I wasn't too sure, but I like to read and I like to try new genres so I finally decided I would get the sample first and see what it was like. Well let me tell you I read that sample and instantly bought the book. It hooked me from the very beginning and I have been unable to put it down. I give it 5 stars. I'll definitely be buying the other two books in this trilogy, and will recommend it to friends for sure!
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja is amazing! Whole family loves this game & it is free!  Doesn't get better than that! Must have for all families
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I thought this movie was a really informative look at where our food comes from. I went into it with an open mind, and I felt like I learned a lot. Parts of it were tough to watch, and I teared up more than once. This has definitely made me think about my food choices going forward.

B0000A2I1B|4.0|One of, if not my  FAVORITE offering, from Carlos. But buyer beware. When I ordered last week it stated \\"Import\\"....\\"Japan\\".  Naturally I had to order a second copy if from Japan. When it arrived, the cover had a \\"Made in England\\" sticker on it. Then, I noticed that the CD had \\"Made in Austria\\" on the label! Sonically, I notice no difference from my 20 year old CD \\"made in the USA\\"....except now I need to turn the volume up a bit more, so for some strange reason the volume level has been reduced.
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|First of all if you are considering buying this item, you should have already listened to LMFAO. If not go on youtube  before you decide. I love LMFAO. I bought some of their songs online but I like physical records as well so I wanted a copy of their CD. I bought directly from Amazon (sold by them) and I received it under 5 hours after my purchase. That's right. Under 5 hours... It is not only very impressive but also scary.  P.S. if you are reading reviews to decide if you should get the album because you're not too familiar with LMFAO start with Shots (old album) and then go with Sexy and I know it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love Spider Solitaire, and this app is great. No glitches or anything else to complain about. Great way to waste time lolZ
B002XTXG1G|5.0|Frankly, I'm upset that I had not heard more about this movie when it came out.  Tom Hardy did an amazing job playing Bronson.  I have not been much of a Hardy fan until I saw this and now I have nothing but respect for the man.  He gave the character charisma and even though there is nothing really redeeming about the man, you still want to love him.  It's a bit violent and you Tom's manhood more than once, but apart from that you should see this movie at least once.
B005OK721G|5.0|The movie keeps moving,rent this if you enjoyed Taken with Liam Neeson! I like Zoe, she is a very good action actress! Incredible acting and photography packs a one-two punch that will keep your attention throughout Colombiana's 108 minute run time. No doubt about it, Zoe Saldana is a fascinating, beautiful and strong actress who nailed her role. At the movie's conclusion, I love Johnny Cash sings a stunning song that anchors down the cost Cataleya has paid for her dark journey. Rent it, you won't disappointed!
B0063GORYU|5.0|My new brain workout.  Creepy addictive.  Serious love/hate relationship with this game, depending on the success of my gameplay.  Goes great with a morning cup of coffee.
B0047Y17P2|3.0|I think what is missing in this work is more character.  Haller is interesting, but not like Bosch, Connelly's burnt out detective.  He just isn't as likeable.  Too much like your dispassionate lawyers out to make a buck and their mark in the world.
B006470HZ6|5.0|Don't listen to the naysayers!  This is an amazing series.  I loved the first season and \\"tried\\" to wait patiently for the second.  It was well worth the wait.  The acting was fantastic and the storyline kept me hanging on the edge of my seat.  Now I can't wait for the third season!!  I can't wait for it to be released on DVD.  I will be one of the first in line to buy it.  For those who enjoyed this show, check out \\"Breaking Bad\\" (on AMC) and \\"Being Human\\" (on SyFy).
B002KSPKRS|3.0|Got these in the mail yesterday right as the first two maps were released for MW3.  Setup is a snap; plug the USB, optical and turn on, thats it.  The audio is rediculous, the reviews don't do justice to the amount of happiness you will have once you put these puppies on.  No more hearing the wife complain about the noise!    I will admit however, I did have some popping interference from other wireless devices.  For most of us, we keep all of our electronics in a cabinent near or under the tele.  And alot of those electronics use wireless connectivity.  Be sure you move the box around to find that \\"sweet spot\\" so you won't have interference.  For me, I have to pull it out of the cabinent when I use it and set it in an open area.  I use RF modulators to control my electronics while hidden behind the cabinet; so if your using them too, yep, you'll have to pull the box out while using these headphones.  Microwaves, and other wireless devices used around the headset (iphones/ipads on the couch) will disrupt the connectivity a tad.  Not a huge deal, but it is noticeable.  In all, find the \\"sweet spot\\" and your set.  Enjoy!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|First off, the cover is thin, which is a good thing. It is so descreet, but it protects the Kindle Fire from MAJOR damage.  I have a really naughty cat who pushed my device with the cover on off of the table, which is well over 3 and a half feet high.  I thought that my cat had cracked the screen, but because of this cover, it saved my device. I highly recommend it to anyone who has the Kindle Fire...especially to cat people! ;P
B000002KK2|5.0|I listen to a ton of music. This woman is one of my absolute favorites. I can't even count how many times I've listened to the cd. In face, I had to buy three of them to replace them when they got worn out. Of course, now I know I can back them up, but still, I believe it was well worth it. Every time I listen to this woman's music, it brings me out of myself and on a journey that doesn't end until the record stops (good thing for repeat on iPod) or some nosy friend/family member pops in while I'm in a trance.  I've tried to listen to her at night to relax and sleep, because I can often just chill out listening to anything, but with her, I get completely obsessed with soaking up every nuance. This stuff is one of a kind. I would consider it FAR from any folk you've heard in the 70's. A little more esoteric and refined. I mean, and what other high voiced white *woman* can say \\"rapping a fat skat!\\" and meld it so perfectly into the style.  It's hard for me not to say that this particular album, (The self entitled debut) isn't my very favorite album ever made.... SO, I'm going to have to conclude even to myself that when I was in college, it was the album that was stuck in my bag for school and never left my headphones. The other one I loved, in a different vein, was/is Phoebe Snow. Big difference, but still so unique and original in terms of tonal vocal quality. Phoebe may not have been quite so complex, but after a phew listens to her album, I was hooked.  Hope that helps someone who seems to think like me a bit. I'm a musician myself, so I'm always listening closely for certain unique nuances, and that's why I love her music. And of course, there are those few slower songs that I find to be quite ingenious. melodically. Again, stuff you just don't hear anyway else.  Hope you buy it and love it, my friends!  ~W.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I heard about this show a while back, probably around the time it was on the air.  I watched the first episode at a friends house, and I have no idea what I was waiting for.  If your on this page looking, you should be buying, it wont let you down.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|A timeless story of an underachiever who seizes his moment, against all odds. Thumbs up for Hugh Jackman as the reluctant father....this movie was a refreshing change with just the right amount of special effects and they didn't get in the way of the story.  I'd gladly look forward to a follow up-Real Steel 2...it was that good.  This story has a potential to be a real Money Franchise in the vein of the \\"Rocky\\" movies.  Worth every penny....fasten your seatbelt cause you in for a real feel-good time.
0738212415|5.0|I have done a lot of drawing over the years, and worked from several books.  I am a week into this book (doing one lesson a day and reviewing previous lessons in the evenings) and I am totally enjoying it.  The book is really well written, the author's sense of humor and teaching experience both shine through.  I have often sat down with a pad and wanted to \\"draw some skyscrapers.\\"  But had no idea how to begin.  After a week with this book, I do.  It may sound silly...who wants to draw skyscrapers?  My point is, perspective has eluded me.  Imagination has eluded me.  I have always been able to draw a cube in 3D...but no idea what to do with it next.  I am looking forward to the rest of the daily lessons in the book, and can't thank the author enough!
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|The conclusion of this trilogy did not disappoint.  More drama, more intrigue, more hot sex as our favorite characters grow and change.  Ana and Christian move forward in their lives and face their challenges in their own unique way.  This series combines a modern vibe and great story telling that will move you.  Don't miss it.  The icing on this cake is the epilogue.  I guarantee you will want MORE.
B000XR4OC0|4.0|a half size up.  I read the reviews and they are mixed.  Some people say order true to size, they'll stretch and others say order a half size up.  I've had mine for 3 months, now and they still are as tight as the day I got them.  I don't know if it's that I got them in corduroy or not.  It makes it hard to wear them to stretch them out, if they're uncomfortable to begin with.  I'm torn about whether to order the canvas true to size or half size up.  Such a pain to send them back.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this app is the best one that angry. birds. have made the graghics are good and the sound affects are amazing that's why this should not be 1 2 3 4. it should be 5
B004O3YGMC|2.0|This app is great but two things make it unusable for me:  1) You cannot configure it for a proxy  2) It doesnt work with Swiftkeys  once they fix this it would be a five star app, but I hear that Splashtop support has been convieniently ignoring these issues.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Love the look of the case and it is very functional. It also saved the screen of my Kindle when my 120# dog accidentally stepped on it while running through my living room. There is a scratch on the cover, but I wouldn't doubt it if my Kindle would have been damaged without the case! Well worth the $.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Absolutely perfect ending to this delicious story. My love affair with Fifty goes on and on and I believe it will continue FOREVER! Ms. James I will look forward to your next book whatever it may be. This Fifty trilogy has been everything I could possibly want in a romantic experience. Thank you so much for giving Fifty such a satisfying conclusion. I really loved the bonus chapters at the end with Fifty's POV giving us his perspective.

0810989956|5.0|My older son had a lot of fun with this book, and  quickly filled out all spaces. The younger son, too, enjoyed reading, humor and pictures. Great idea by author. I recommend this book to those kids who got captured by this story. Have fun!
B0059XTTW8|5.0|To begin with, this is NOT a James Bond, blow-em-up, seduce the girl, fancy toys, type of spy movie.  If that's what you want, don't waste your time with this movie...it's not for you.  When I heard this movie was coming out starring my favourite actor, Gary Oldman, I was very excited...I love his movies.  But I had not read the book, nor did I know anything other than it was a spy movie about a \\"mole\\".  So I went to the library and got the book.  I stayed up all night reading it!  You could tell it was written by someone who knew the crafting of spies.  In fact John le Carré (real name David John Moore Cornwell) was a member of British MI5 and MI6 and was outed to the Russians by Kim Philby one of the infamous \\"Cambridge Five\\" who were Russian double agents.  The mole in the movie is modeled after Kim Philby in fact.  I won't say who and spoil it for you!  The book totally gives you a sense of how the movie will be.  Slowly building to the climax where you may, or may not be, stunned by who the \\"mole\\" is.  I hate when you read a book and the actor playing the role is in no way like how you imagined them to be reading the book, so I was very happy to see Gary Oldman as a very taciturn George Smiley.  I was glad to see he got a BAFTA and Oscar nomination for the role. John Hurt really makes you believe he is the slightly crazed Control desperately trying to find the mole.  When he is waiting to hear Jim Prideaux's news from Hungary, you are as resigned and depressed as he is, knowing it's going to go bad but wondering just how bad.  You see, they all really know who the mole is in their heart of hearts.  As another reviewer said, the movie does not introduce, nor develop, the characters enough for the people who have not read the book.  It may be hard for those people to get a clear gist of what really is going on.  But as I said, I loved it because now when I reread the book again (as well as the other books in the Karla trilogy - The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People) I can use the characters and the scenes from the movie in my imagination and flesh it out even further than I had before.  Yes, I am a total geek.  :-)
B0055SWM08|5.0|great design and game play.  perfect on Acer iconia tab a500.  music is excellent.  just wish there were more tracks to listen too while playing. well worth $1.
B005GVF95O|5.0|My 2 yr old absolutely loves this game. She needs only a little help while playing.  Works great on my Fire.
B0053B347M|2.0|Honestly this thing isn't really pricey so I didn't expect much and decided to test it out. As usual, Amazon ships their items at the speed of light, but sadly I cannot say much about the item itself.<br /><br />The sticky tape is horrible and the LED strip falls off easily.<br />This is the infamous blue/white you would find on cheaper LED's, takes away from the aesthetics purpose.<br />No where close to being bright enough, misses it by a long shot. Defeats the whole purpose of these really, what a disappointment.<br /><br />I will be going with iKea diodes instead, it was worth shot, but my iMac deserves better. Save your money and looks else where!

It asks for your city and state so you get the exact phase and view. I love to turn the moon and watch the different phases thru the year. It doesn't use drawings or sketches but actual views of the moon itself!
159102594X|4.0|I stumbled upon \\"The Blade Itself\\" trilogy because I was looking for something to fill the void after finishing George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire.  This series came highly recommended to me by the internets.  And the internets did not disappoint!  The main characters are all established in different parts of the world, and then become united by the plot.  Logen Ninefingers is a enjoyable character to read, and the slow unfolding of his back story always kept the reader wanting more.  Glokta, the fallen warrior, was fantastic.  I found myself enjoying his point of view immensely, while simultaneously being creeped out by his profession.  And finally, Jezal.  Oh Jezal, you vain little nobleman.  It was fun to hate Jezal in the beginning because of his constant whining, and enjoyable to watch him grow as the book progressed.  I actually enjoyed the occasional bursts of swearing and I appreciated that Abercrombie didn't create a new language.  It allowed readers to fully engage with the characters and plot.  Sometimes that can be a nice change when reading a series, and a lot of fantasy authors try too hard to create a completely new world.  My overall review is four stars.  Though engaging, this trilogy felt a little bit geared towards a younger audience who is easily impressed with violence and murder.  Perhaps I feel that way because the plot, while interesting, didn't have a lot of twists and turns.  It will be interesting to see how it develops in book two.  Abercrombie left us at the beginning of a major adventure at the end of the first book!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I downloaded and installed the drivers while waiting for this item to arrive in the mail which I recommend.  Once it did arrive I loaded Streets & Trips 2011 on my laptop, plugged this GPS in a USB port, and within 10 seconds of calling for it in the application it 'found' me - and I was in the house.  IT IS GREAT!!!  I have struggled with the Microsoft furnished GPS (it's their POJ model, Piece Of Junk) and it has never worked worth a plug - and I've have three rotting in my accessories bag.
0385342063|3.0|I've Got Your Number is classic Sophie Kinsella but that's okay with me! It has all the wonderful things that I love about Kinsella's stories and it proved to be another fast, engaging, definitely fluffy fun read.<br /><br />I really liked Poppy. She is as obsessed with her phone and communication as most people my age so her struggle after she lost her phone really rang true for me. She needed her phone to stay connected but as she finds out, when she snags a thrown away phone, the phone allows her to make new connections too. I also really liked that Poppy liked her job. Kinsella does \\"chick-lit\\" very well (though I'm not sure if that's the correct term for these books anymore) and she fortunately she also knows what tropes to ignore. Poppy is good at her job as a physiotherapist. She likes helping people feel better and she genuinely cares about her patients.<br /><br />The antics Poppy gets into as she has Sam's company phone are hilarious. She cares too much and makes trouble for him though as she sees it, she is just trying to make him a bit more human. I loved their differing views and I liked seeing Sam slowly start to come along to Poppy's way of thinking, at least to a degree. As is usual for most of Kinsella's books, there is a business crisis that takes the two main characters in different directions. But Poppy is not the silly character Kinsella's infamous Becky Bloomwood is. Poppy has a good head on her shoulders and she is able to aid Sam in sorting out the business issues that develop in the story.<br /><br />Of course, Poppy still has some inferiority issues to sort out, particularly when it comes to Magnus's family. However, the scenes where she plays Scrabble or tries to understand just what this family of academics is saying are hilarious. I liked that she was an ordinary girl just trying to be pleasing to her fiance's family. Poppy is kindhearted and it shows on every page of the story. She is a likeable character that is kind of like the girlfriend everyone has in their life, supporting her friends (even when their envy shows), going out for drinks and just enjoying life. Her romance with Sam is subtle but I loved seeing it blossom on the pages through the text messages. This book is in fact a great readalike to Meg Cabot's [[ASIN:0060085452 Boy Meets Girl]] series.<br /><br />All in all, I raced through I've Got Your Number. It's nothing particularly new in the world of romance or women's fiction but it's a fun book with two great characters.

B000FC1AGG|1.0|i would have given it two stars if i had not expected so much from this book. there is not much romance in this book,too many secondary characters,not much chemistry,no sexual tention,i skimmed through most of the book,was not able to finish it. it is a PG13 lightweight situation comedy with a little romance. i should stick to historical romance.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|In our L shaped house, the base station is in an office on one arm and the family room where we use the wireless, is in the other.  The signal, having to pass through the kitchen, a nest of wifi defeating appliances and metal, was always erratic and the IT admin, me, regularly endured demeaning asides as others tried to do their online work.  Enter the analyzer which I found surfing Kindle apps.  With ease, I determined that the family room signal was never strong enough to maintain a link, so I purchased an extender for the network.  Again with ease, I found the optimal plug to install the extender.  The family room has become a happier place for me since removing just this one categorical source of derision.  Save your marriage, save your family, defeat a weak link, this analyzer beats a therapist.
0385344325|5.0|I gotta say I was very disappointed with Mr. Child's books of late.  I totally got hooked after reading Persuator and immediately purchased all his previous books.  Unfortunately, his last three or four books have been very disapointing to say the least.  My assumpsion was his publishing company pressured him into writing so many books in certain period of time and he was rushed.  Well, I certainly believe he is back.  I throughly enjoyed this book and read it in two days.  I couldn't put it down.  If you liked his books in the past, you won't be disappointed with this one.
B000002KIE|5.0|Sweetheart, I listened to this.  This is for all you 1 star rating, bilious, miserable, self hating, juvenile, despisers of the old timers.  Punk wasn't invented by the Sex Pistols, they took an American idea and lit the fuse properly. Exploding onto the British music scene in the mid 1970's. The Ramones, New York Dolls, Stooges, MC5 had tried, but the majority of folk in the States at the time were not interested. Over here in Britain we were, we took to those bands like a duck to water. More so though, we knew the Pistols were the real deal.  You cannot simply imagine what it was like as a 13 year old in 1977 to stand in a shop with this record in your hands before handing over the princely sum of £3.00. It had been out a couple of months, I was horribly jealous of a neighbour who had it from day 1. With my birthday money in hand I went into town, just trying to find a shop that stocked it was a task on it's own. Buying it, having some sneering 25 year old with hair at his shoulders bag it and pass it back to you and then, on the bus on the way home, removing it from it's bag and seeing the dayglo sleeve and the type face wording jumping out at you was provocative enough. Playing it on the only stereo in the house (my dad's) was tantamount to a revolution.  The press seized upon them, they were front page, back page, every page, scaremongering tactics used by the press similar to the ecstasy explosion just a decade later, no one was safe with this mob on the loose.  The lyrics may seem tamer now, for those that denounced it's musical worth at the time, that the band members couldn't play now seems so wrong. There are bands that have written far more risque songs, nearly everything comes with a warning sticker and band members far more outrageously dressed, behaved and spotlight grabbing.  You have it too easy these days, you don't have to search for your gems, you can get them all online in just a few clicks. You're not the only punk in your street, they're everywhere these days. Your sullen attitude, sheep like way that you dress, shoe staring way that you stand around - you'd be listening to bands like the Dooley's had it not been for Rotten, Jones, Matlock and Cook.  Take Green Day and shove them up your f.......................
B004IJY4L0|5.0|I've been jamming to Pendulum since hearing them on Radio One's famous Essential Mix series in the mid 2000's when I remember remarking to myself that their brand of drum & bass seemed to go beyond the genre's norms; the subsequent album \\"Hold Your Colour\\" to me remains a landmark release not just for Pendulum but for electronic music with its blend of sick D&B breakdowns and catchy melodies.  Fast forward a few years and the album \\"In Silico\\" which marked the group's official diversion from hardcore electronic after it turned out one of the Aussie trio (Rob Swire) could actually sing.  They've spent the years since then perfecting their sound and with this release have manufactured a splendid and remarkably/mercifully auto-tune-less  album of vocal D&B/dubstep/rock fusion which has a cutting edge but a definite mainstream appeal. I'm told in Britain \\"Watercolour\\" has even featured on major TV shows and the like.  But enough history and onto the music! If you're new to Pendulum, well you've never heard anything quite like them.  There is still a good deal of their trademark fast paced heavy electronic beats, born out of their early days as pioneers of epic D&B. Occasionally they slow it down to almost headbanging effect which will appeal to fans of dubstep.  Fast or slow, the beats are immaculately crisp and beautifully combined with all manners of synths and samples; for instance there is what sounds like Hindi vocals on one of the album's standout tracks, \\"Set Me On Fire\\" which ebbs and flows in slow magnificence.  On the flip side, there are more straightforward electric guitar infused movements layered under Swire's vocals that will appeal to fans of the rock scene.  Far from boring, these tracks, such as \\"Crush,\\" still carry plenty of electronic pop and the percussion is still noticeably very Pendulum.  And then there is a confluence of the above two, as in \\"Under the Waves\\" which contains trademark Swire vocals but is decidedly more electronic than rock.  Prodigy producer Liam Howlett makes an appearance on \\"Immunize\\" and his influence is rather apparent to those familiar with his recent work; fast paced electronic with a rough, hard edge.  (However this particular track is miles better than anything on \\"Invaders Must Die.\\")  And prolific Swedish metal band In Flames collaborates on \\"Self Vs Self,\\" which is very cool if you're a fan of that kind of music. The Pendulum influence here is basically Swire singing part of the chorus and it's all In Flames otherwise.  Basically almost all the tracks are really good and pretty accessible no matter your music background.  Standouts are \\"Set Me On Fire,\\" \\"Watercolour\\" and \\"Witchcraft.\\" Bottom line is that this is an incredibly well produced rock-electronic fusion album that you need to own if you like either genre even a little bit.

B0057LUI0O|2.0|I purchased this video for instant viewing and because they do not have rights to stream it anymore, it sits uselessly in my video library. I paid the full price to own the video and now I do not even get a credit for not being able to watch it. It would not let me download it before, but I thought it should be fine since it was in my video library. My kids like the movie itself.

This album deserves a Sixth Star.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Fantastic story about the differences and love story between two people in England, John Thornton, who is from the North, and Margaret Hale, who is from the South. Terrific acting by all the actors, especially by the extremely handsome Richard Armitage. He can outdo Mr. Darcy any day! If you like good movies, you must watch North and South!

B0063GORYU|4.0|I find this to be a great way to relax and unwind after a tedious day.  it's fun and challenging but does not require an undo amount of thought or concentration.
B0007O38F8|5.0|In my opinion this album suffered a lot of hate as 50 was the biggest thing in rap at the time and he was following up his 5/5 classic Get Rich or Die Trying. In retrospect give or take 2/3 tracks this album is straight. Yes compared to Get Rich the formula is more polished, but the production is on point the whole way through and it features some of 50's strongest work in \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight, \\"Ski Mask Way\\" and \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\". Considering 50 gave Game 5 or 6 tracks for his album imagine what this could have been. Definitely worth revisiting, album is a personal classic to me.

B004132HZS|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created the fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, in 1887.<br />Since then the Sherlock Homes Society formed in 1934. In 1990, the Sherlock Holmes Museum opened in Baker Street, London.<br />The Guinness World Records has consistently listed Sherlock Holmes as the \\"most portrayed movie character\\" with 75 actors playing the part in over 211 films. Many youth may only know  the role of Holmes is performed by Robert Downey, Jr. with Jude Law portraying Dr. John Watson.<br />Although there have been all these characterizations, few have varied from the original concept until now with Benedict Cumberbatch plays a modern-day version of the detective, with Martin Freeman as Watson, in the BBC One TV series Sherlock, which premiered on 25 July 2010.<br />This modern Sherlock has replaced his pipe for numerous nicotine patches and from private detective to \\"consulting detective\\" who Scotland Yard turn to when they can't solve a case which Sherlock adds \\"is always.\\"<br />The first case, A Study in Pink, tells the story of how Sherlock, who has no friends, teams up with Dr. Watson. Watson, in this modernized version, is a returning shell shocked veteran from Afghanistan. The case involves a series of would-be suicides that to Sherlock are obviously murders. When the incompetence of Scotland Yard overwhelms Sherlock he boldly states, \\"Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring!\\" This is must-see sarcastic fun.

B0061TQBRK|3.0|Really Century Media?! As with my review for Roadrunner Record's very flawed physical \\"deluxe edition\\" of [[ASIN:B004E2XAFW The Unforgiving (Special Edition CD+DVD)]] by Within Temptation, this latest release by Lacuna Coil continues the insanely disgusting practice where the record labels do anything and everything to get us to buy their music, EXCEPT give us the bonus tracks! There are no less than eight different physical versions of this album being released today, all featuring ridiculous bells and whistles; everything from dvds to posters, medical kits, etc., and yet not a single one of these different physical versions features 'Soul Inmate' as a bonus track (nor any of the other b-sides). Do you want to know who gets it? The Itunes MP3 customers because they must be rewarded for making the record label's job easier by being so willing to settle for far less than a physical product, while us physical release fans are being punished for still holding onto \\"the old ways\\". No amount of added posters, dvds, syringes, medical kits, photos, etc. will EVER be better than getting a complete release of the album where there are NO missing songs.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Lacuna Coil, as they were my first exposure into the world of female fronted rock, so it greatly pains me to not buy this album. But I must stand by my belief to not buy something that I know I am getting screwed over on. Century Media re-released [[ASIN:B0033WH6U4 Shallow Life (Bonus CD) (Dlx)]] a year after the album's initial release with all three b-sides (and it was well worth buying then), so I am going to hold out hope that they will come to their senses again and re-release this album with all the cut bonus b-side tracks. However, as I am still waiting on a physical release of [[ASIN:B000EHSVI2 Karmacode]] with both 'Without A Reason' and 'Virtual Environment' included on it to be released, I also know to not hold my breath.<br /><br />Record labels need to wake up  and realize that the game has completely changed with the introduction of the internet. People can now download albums rather easily, and while I prefer just to go without entirely (as I do not wish to hurt the bands who made the music by stealing their material, just because their idiot record labels can not get it through their thick skulls that we want ALL the songs), a lot of other fans do not. Record labels need to adjust their outdated marketing ploys and start giving fans COMPLETE products that we are proud to pluck our money down for. Stop with the shiny boxsets, posters, dvds, etc. and just give us ALL the songs! If a record label can afford to produce this many versions of one album, then SURELY they can afford to produce a TRUE \\"deluxe\\" edition for us completists to where we get all the songs. Until they learn this, my purchasing of cds will halt. Even though the latest release from Evanescence [[ASIN:B005GVA2L0 Evanescence (Deluxe CD/DVD)]] was not their strongest effort, I give mad props to Wind-Up Records for giving us the type of cd release I desire from every band (where we are given a choice between purchasing the standard 12 track album or the complete \\"deluxe edition\\" with all the b-sides included) and that I am more than happy to pay money for.<br /><br />And what makes it even worse is the fact that this new album sounds like it would be very good.

B004LWZW7E|4.0|It is quite easy to see where this is going.  Nobody gets to live more than 25 years unless they can work for more time, steal it, buy it, etc.  Time replaces money as currency, and time is even equal to the cost of living.  Those without much time are in the ghetto, while the wealthy ones have hundreds of years to play with and waste if they want to.  It is a good metaphor for the haves and have-nots of our own society.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I was truly disappointed when this series was abruptly cancelled.  However, I feel it made its mark and was the foundation for some similar shows of today. I LOVED the on-going story lines, as it was never a facade, the happy conclusion at the end of the episode. Nothing can beat this show; it is timeless and dealt with real issues teenagers and adults faced while going through high school and life in general.  GREAT cast, never forgotten show!  So glad it is available on DVD!
B006W5JF9Y|5.0|There's no way I wouldn't add this to my collection. Dylan is one of those who has sung the soundtrack to my life, now to rapidly approaching seven decades. I first heard, and then saw him, in the auld country back in the '60's, (took a night off from Georgie Fame at the Flamingo). Leonard Cohen is another who's words and music have sustained and rescued me and he also has a new album full of \\"Old Ideas\\" coming out.  Just listening to the first few samples was enough to remove any doubt, which I never had, and grant amnesty to any who may not 'live up to expectations'. As a home visit Hospice nurse one of my guiding principles is to 'leave my expectations at the door', just enter into whatever waits. Deep thanks to all the artists in all fields, and those behind the scenes, who contributed their time, effort and talents to this noble cause.  What I want to know is WILL WE EVER GET A DVD OF THE 30th ANNIVERSARY CONCERT, hopefully before I kick the bucket. I've still got a lot of miles left on me, I ain't knocking on heaven's door yet, but I am going down slow. Sure would like to watch this concert before I hear the Chimes of Ultimate Freedom.

HOWEVER, it also taught me multiple lessons. I laughed throughout the entire movie and I learned a couple of things. AND hey... seeing Justin Timberlake's butt a couple of times really didn't hurt my review of 5 stars. I would def. rent this again.

0061438294|5.0|The way that the author presented the theory in terms of brain mechanics made it really easy to understand why our body reacts in certain ways which then makes it easier to interpret the readings.  An excellent resource that is easy to read, understand and apply. The author's experience shines through every page, which gave the book more credibility (with added citations and references) that made me more confident to test out the signs covered. After reading it I found that with only a little practise on people I encounter, I was able to understand more than what was being said and was able to direct the conversation so that I could decipher more.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|not a bad game cool cause there's over a hundred games in one game. interesting games in this should be more
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is a great app that can find and organize a great deal of source materials into a slick format. I love how easy it is to brouse through news and blog entries on all of my favorite subjects on feedly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there are a bunch of great games in this app! some are older games just renamed which is pretty cool.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun and hard so I think if you like those things I would get get this game.
1439102813|5.0|This is a powerfully written story that is told in such a gentle way.  Readers my age can read this book and see in themselves, the signs Alice saw in herself. The descriptions, although written so gently, are so ugly and scary to one who might think they are in early on-set.  Though it is important to be tested, one does not want to chance the reality of the disease.  A knock out story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was a very food ap that challenged you to do you absolute best and even some lucky thrown on there too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have no problems with the app, and it's free! A win, in my opinion. I love solitaire, and this is just what I was looking for.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this game!! you defend a city against a bombing and each night gets harder and harder. I love saving myself from boredom with this awesome game!
B002BWP49M|1.0|Unfortunately the options of \\"no stars\\" is not in existence. This crap does not even deserve the one star. If you thought the books were bad, you were dead wrong. Horrible acting, disgusting plot line and forced action (which doesn't exist really).
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is very simple to navigate and does not require much thought!  After a long day it is relaxing!
B005T87QCI|5.0|the game its self is osome but what happened 2 atom I mean really it culde at least have zuse.
1904994679|5.0|GREAT SELLER AND THE BOOK IS AMAZING!  10 YEAR OLD GRANDSON IS THRILLED!  PICKS IT UP EVERYDAY AND I COULDN'T ASK FOR MORE!  GREAT BUY!
1400034779|5.0|What a delightful, unique series. I never would have discovered these books on my own, but a friend got me started. I haven't been able to quit. They are apparently addictive for me.<br /><br />The first thing my friend said to me was, \\"They aren't really detective novels. It's a book about a lady who started a detective agency because she wanted to help people.\\"<br /><br />I would suggest that these books are stories about people. By reading them, the reader is able to get to know about life in small villages far, far away. The personalities are so beautifully created that I couldn't wait to find out what happened to them.<br /><br />I read these over the long, hot, drought-filled, sun-baked Oklahoma summer. It seemed appropriate.<br /><br />If  you decide to read them, be sure to read them in order. It's a must!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very addicting. I cant stop playing it. all of the levels provide hours of entertainment.  you'll love it!
B0061TQBRK|4.0|Dark Adrenaline is an good comeback from Shallow Life, which was a commercial failure and a terrible mainstream attempt. It isn't as good as their stuff before but it's definitely a step up from their last. It's a little darker and way heavier, faster and more metal than their last. If you liked Karmacode than I'd recommend getting it. That's where it should've left off.
0316067601|5.0|I originally purchased this book in paperback a few years ago.  As a result of the interest in this subject, created by this book, I have since read several books about the Afghan conflict,including SEAL of Honor, a companion book about the SEAL Team Commander of this particular operation, Mike Murphy.  He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his role in this battle.  When I bought my Kindle two years ago, I purchased Lone Survivor again in Kindle format and re-read it.  I found it almost as entertaining the second time as the first--it's that good. I am a retired Air Force Lt. Col., so subjects like this book really interest me.  I can say that this is the best military book I have ever read--I couldn't put it down.  In my mind, Marcus and the other three members of his team are genuine American heroes,who MUST never be forgotten.  Without the help of God, I believe it is safe to say that Marcus couldn't have survived the battle he and his team found themselves fighting.  Their compassion and beliefs as Americans in the importance of each human life--they fully understood the implications of their choice--caused them to make a decision that ultimately lead to three American deaths and one seriously wounded Navy SEAL. The role that the Afghan villagers (who took him into their village and defied the Taliban's demands to hand him over to them) played in his ultimate return to American control is almost unbelievable.  That proves to me that there are still honorable people in our world.  I can't wait until the movie comes out sometime next year, if things go as planned.  As Oliver North would say, \\"theirs' is a story that deserves to be told\\". God bless Marcus Luttrell and the USA!!
1416955070|5.0|I was extremely satisfied with the order I purchased. The book was in perfect condition and it arrived exactly when I thought it would. I would highly recommend using this company to order books in the future.

B002P7BKVO|5.0|This episode has Sheldon trying to figure out, via physics of course, the best way in which to make friends. However, not understanding the rules of society, he winds up some pretty interesting situations. Don't want to do any spoilers - so will just say this episode truly had me laughing out loud. Played great on my Kindle Fire as well as streaming on my television.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good assortment of games.its good for wasting all that unwanted time, tho some of the games feel like like your doing the same thing over and over
B006WWPI5W|5.0|I really enjoy the BBT episodes with Sheldon and Amy (nick named \\"Shamy\\" by their friends). The two actors worked together amazingly well. In this episode, Sheldon begins to realize he may not be \\"boyfriend\\" material and must do something to make amends for so bad behavior. The end result left me laughing out loud literally, with tears streaming down my face. A really neat episode.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is the best puzzle I have found for the Android.  I appreciate the hints and hope I wont need them on my second pass through the puzles to improve my scores.
0446573019|4.0|David,  It may be awhile before we meet again so hope you don't mind my public comments and congrats on another great story.  You continue to inspire.  Like yourself- glad I have stayed committed to writing and as a bonus it has offered me incredible freedom.  Looking forward to sharing more personal thoughts...do you remember the sherry we shared on 5th and Broad?  Cheers, Douglas
B005Q1W10A|5.0|After waiting for Season 2, one wondered if it would be able to match the quality of Season 1 of DOWNTON ABBEY.  It does, and then some.  The actors seem even more comfortable in their roles and seem to be relishing them.  The writing continues to be wonderful.  There are surprises in plot--you never can anticipate exactly what will happen.  There's enough villains to keep it entertaining and from being too precious. The wardrobe continues to delight. I hope this series endures for many seasons.  It's a total delight.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is the best movie that I have seen in a very long time, maybe ever. Although I have enjoyed Alex Kendrick's movies, this movie is truly professional and hollywood quality, but with the high values and godly message fully intact. Highly recommended!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|simply amazing. so many options and it really helps you figure out what you want to read easy to navigate and there are so many different translations available.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Finally I know what Angry Birds are!  Fun game.  As a victim of the current economy, I appreciate free books and apps.
B00000K0E5|5.0|I personally consider this Bond movie number one, with Licence to kill a veeeery close second. This Movie pits 007 against 006, And it hits the ground running, question for those of you who didn't like it, and if you didn't that's fine. But question, was it the fact that 006 didn't want to take over the world, He wants to use the goldeneye to get back AT ENGLAND FIRST, then the world. Some have said \\" the World Is not enough\\" is better than this. Really?! Really?!, in that one he faced a villain who feels no pain. BECAUSE A BULLET IS STUCK IN HIS BRAIN, wow talk about leaping the shark. But in this one, Bond thinks 006 died in the pre-title teaser, but later on. As he's going after Janus, behold it's 006. Friend Vs friend, what is even funnier. Is that this movie came out in '95, The world Is Not Enough came out in '99, and Goldeneye holds up better in story, better in acting. Just plain better, I liked the CIA working with MI6, in Jack Wade. Played by Forrest wittaker, who would appear in Tomorrow never dies, and had been in The Living Daylights. This movie Brought James Bond back with a bang, yes this movie isn't Roger Moorish, but it delivers. In my humble opinion, Brosnan's best outing as Bond.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brook's \\"World War Z\\" is a thought work of entertainment. I can honestly recommend this work to both fans of the zombie/horror  and  historical fiction genres. Its hard to put down.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|I have to laugh at all the positive reviews on this movie, Yes Batman Begins was a huge success. But I have to agree with a previous reviewer. This movie only gets all the love because {and no offense intended} of Heath ledger's death, strip away the cgi effects, the 45 minute speeches. And you don't have a Batman movie, but a psychosis on Batman and the joker. Neither resembled the characters they were supposed to be based on, in fact. watching this movie, heath's joker reminded me of a character off of \\"Criminal minds\\". Not the joker, and this Batman is not a detective. Some of the people who applauded this movie, are the same ones who laughed at the ending to \\"Superman the movie\\" where he turns back time. But they have no problem with a giant leaping of shark in this movie, when Batman rigs all the cell phones, to keep an eye on the citizens of Gotham. Sorry, but i didn't drink the cool-aid. I'll stick with 89' version, yes that movie had some problems, but unlike this one. Those can be overlooked by the fact that the movie had substance, annnnd a Batmobile. Batman acted like Batman, and the joker acted like the joker. and I don't need explosions to keep me entertained in a movie, I KNow I know, this is an updated version of the characters. One question to all those who loved this movie, can you honestly tell me. right of the top of your head, a memorable line. Not a whole speech, but a moment. The '89 movie is full of them, also. Christopher Nolan is a great director, but this movie felt like he meshed \\"Inception\\" with Batman. A realistic Batman doesn't work, sorry.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|there's lots of games and it effectively. kills time. sort of addictive when all you want to do is win but you run out of time
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I won't give the plot, since that has been given thousands of times. But for years we grew up with the Lester version of this movie, and while it wasn't great, yeah it was bad. Until recently, after the updated versions of late 80's movies on DVD, and Superman the movie, the behind the scenes bickereing between richard Donner and the salkynds came out. I won't bore everybody with that story, since it's been told a thousands times as well. Needless to say, we have richard Donner's cut of Superman II. AND IT IS AWSOME, for those who don't like it. Must like mediocrity, as shown in Superman III. Point one, the story had always been between Jor-El and Kal-El. Not with the mother, thus the giving up his power scene is more powerful, when His father tries to talk him out of it. Kind of like a normal father would when their children are about to do something that in the long run would be a harmful decision for them, and the fact that Lois is wearing Superman's shirt during that scene. Just priceless, also the repowereing scene. In Lester's version all we get is him seeing the glowing crystal, walking over to it picking it up. And Cut to Metropolis, and the battle. But here, again, Jor-El forgives Kal-El, But the consequences for his actions, are that Jor-El, sacrafices himself to give Kal-El back his powers, sacraficially I might add. And yes, I like the ending. It was always going to be the ending to this movie, not the god-awful memory losing kiss. And as Tom mankiewicz had said in the commentary, \\"only Superman should kiss Lois, not clark\\" Is this movie perfect, no. As Dick Donner himself said, if he could, he would go back and change a few things. But he can't, all in all. It's hands down better than Lester's version, I'll quote Dick Donner in Closing \\"this story is about Verisimilitude\\" Lester's wasn't
B004LP10PO|4.0|I'm watching the original 'Thomas Crown Affair' on Blu-ray (2010 MGM/Fox pressing) as I write this and it is, as the package specs indicate, 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen-- no cropping evident.  The picture in most places is perceptibly sharper than the nicely remastered '05 MGM DVD (a fullscreen/widescreen flipper), although original grain elements are also enhanced, which can detract from the HD format's potential 'wow' factor, especially in soft-focus shots.  The disc is 50 GB dual-layer (AVC@40MBPS) and features the same commentary by director Norman Jewison that appears on previous DVD releases, as well as a theatrical trailer.  All things considered, I'd recommend this as a 30%-video/50%-audio upgrade from the '05 version.  4 stars for the film, 3 1/2 for presentation.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|Hahahahahahahaha, my wife and I tried to sit through this movie. and Alas, WE MADE IT!!!!, barely. First let me say this Harrison Is looking reeeeeeeeeeeeeally Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally old, second of all. Daniel Craig, while he did and incredible job in \\" Casino Royale\\" was apparently told in this movie, to do what he did in that movie. I'm sorry, but his expressions never changed in this movie. Except at the end, where he showed briefly a smile as he rode off into the sunset. Secondly, the plot and yes I'm going to spoil it for some of you, aliens show up in the old west for.................. wait for it............................. Gold. Oh and the girl in the movie, is also an alien, only she's tracking the other aliens after they destroyed her planet. She's here to help, and that's the movie. Yep, now while I like Harrison ford, and Daniel craig. They seemed miscast in this movie, well Ford at least, he looked like he was going to have a stroke or heart attack at any moment, craig just seemed misused. But the big problem with this movie was that it didn't know what it wanted to be, and Sci-fi mixed with Westerns never work out. Go look into the archives, they're called B-movies. And yet somehow, alot of people thought this was awsome movie, nope nope nope. It wasn't, not even close.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Best list app ever! You know on To Do lists how you love to cross off the items once they are complete, this even lets you do that. So satisfying. Such a small thing but it makes me love this app all the more for it! Plus you can sync it to your google so it can follow you to your computer.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The AccuWeather app was not something I deliberately sought out. I was browsing apps and thought it might be useful. It is and I now refer to it as much or more than my traditional weather source at NOAA. This app gives a lot of useful information that is easier to quickly access than most other weather apps I've seen and it works well with my Kindle Fire.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great puzzle game. Beautiful graphics and music. I have not had any problems with it on Kindle Fire. All in all a wonderful puzzle game that i highly recommend.
1451627289|5.0|I loved this book so much that I didn't want it to end.  Right from the beginning I was hooked and have recommended this book to everyone!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I have sent a dozen emails to customer service, along with wasting about 2 hours of time and still can't make the Ultraviolet copy work.  Totally useless digital copy and they should abandon such a flawed technology.  Waste of time and money.
B006GRBK4G|5.0|Im a die hard MotoGP fan and have many, many DVD's this newest \\"Fastest\\" is part of the faster/Doctor ,tornado,kentucky kid series. I enjoyed this new movie very much but wish i would have waited a little while for it to go on sale. Dont get me wrong its evey bit as good as the first two movies and i have no complaint on content, but its not a barn burner movie that you must add to your collection today, you can wait for a sale and pick it up later and be just as happy.
B0015346OM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was the first book I read by Mark Bowden.  The book was a little difficult to fallow all of the names of the soldiers and where they were throughout the book, but once I watched the movie everything came clear.  I also read Killing Pablo by Mark Bowden and that too was a great story.  The author knows how to tell a story so that you get every fact from the true story and yet it keeps my attention which is very hard to do.  I havent read a lot of books prior to finding Mark Bowden because I have the attention of a kitten, but these books held my attention to the point that I couldnt wait to read another.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|For me, this is absolutely the best way to manage a large library of apps. It automatically asks me to categorize any new or updated app that I have not already categorized. Then, using one widget for &quot;main menu&quot;, I always have all my folders of all my apps where I want them. I can easily add or change categories on an app, or change my home launcher without having to mess with reorganizing folders.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I saw this movie when I was little during its theatrical release-it was creepy and I got scared. A recent trip to WDW at Halloween ignited my interest in this movie again, and I believe it is one of the best films Disney ever made. The sets are incredibly detailed, each character is an individual, the voices are fantastic and the plot is very original. More than anything-I love the music. Danny Elfman not only wrote the score, but is also the singing voice for The Pumpkin King himself-Jack Skellington.  There are plenty of special features on the DVD. I enjoyed hearing the poem that Tim Burton wrote after seeing window displays switched from Halloween to Christmas, the basis for the Nightmare Before Christmas. There is also \\"behind the scenes\\" footage (from almost 20 years ago now) that shows the sets, the heads for the different characters and the intricate way each scene had to be set up and filmed.  While I had a hard time watching it as a kid-there is nothing ridiculously scary or inappropriate about this film. There are very few good family Halloween films out there. When the time comes-I hope to watch this with my kids every Halloween as a kick-off for the Christmas season.  $22.00 Is an excellent price for this DVD/Blu-Ray, I haven't found anything close in any store.
1451627289|5.0|S. K. You are the best! I could hardly put this book down. It kept me glued to the pages just like your Green Mile did. Thank you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|like most of the reviews say, this book was awesome. incredibly creative and addicting to read. easy to finish in a sitting or two. all three of the books in this series were very very easy and pleasurable to read.
145551389X|2.0|I was disappointed because there are a lot of photos that could have been put on only 1 page so poor Gaga's face didn't end up in the crack of the book.  It ruined the photos for me.  I don't understand why they did it this way.  I wonder if they actually looked at the book after they created it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|a narrator that is easy to get deeply invested in her future, creative and well written and researched. would recommend to any one.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I purchased the Otterbox Defender Series case, the hard exterior shell plus the silicone skin covering, which made it very difficult to now use my Monster charger in my car.  The Monster charger has several connections...one cable to the AUX port, and another to the vehicle 12V charger...and all connect to my iPhone3GS thru it's bottom port.  I never realized the Otterbox would hinder this connection because of its extreme thickness at the bottom port connection.<br /><br />I just got burned ordering one thru DockExtenders.com a/k/a Gadgetboost.com, which was just taken down again for fraudulent advertising and sales.<br /><br />Always best to go thru Amazon.com to purchase.  Got 2 day delivery and this thing works like a charm.  It connected thru the Defender case to my iPhone 3GS and the other end connected perfectly to my Monster charger.  Pleasantly surprised that anything would work since the case is really a compromise for me to use.  Really huge all around.<br /><br />The CableJive piece is nice looking, compact and simple to connect, at least for me.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was looking for something to seemlessly sync notes across my windows phone 7.5, Pc laptop &amp; kindle fire. evermore does that &amp; more for free. I've lost some notes forgetting to save but that is User error &amp; how much protection from our errors can we expect for free? I've only been using it for an month but so far it's been doing great with surprisingly easy organization &amp; syncronization. It has some really cool compatible apps &amp; services I've just started playing with (Eye-Fi wireless SD cards, expense reports, etc.) Great User experience so far.
B000001EUL|5.0|This was great melodic metal and it made the scorps popular among metal fans far more than their earlier output had. Some people call this arena rock , all that means is that this band was good enough to sell out arenas!  Other bands were stuck in small venues and could never capture the fanbase that this great band did. Up until this point the scorps were heavily hendrix influenced among other styles and it was great stuff with uli roth playing his best. But this sound was a new direction and it was more melodic than what can before. This one set the standard for the band in coming 3 decades. It even has Michael Schenker on a few tracks again , the first since 'fly to the rainbow'. Mathias Jabs has to take credit for the way the new sound flows and I loved the older scorpions. I really did but this was the type of cd that every song was filled with flowing energy.  They still play some of these songs live too.  The sound is great on this cd so that's a added bonus. There are no bonus tracks though and the scorps need a boxset someday to put all their rarities on and there are many of them. I have many rare tracks on single cd's etc. Anyways this is a great one to grab for all fans of 1980's sounding metal. And this was released in 1979!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it's pretty handy.  I love being able to save notes on my computer and pull them back up on my phone/kindle-fire and vice versa.
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|Loved this app and found each level challenging, but I don't like that two different people cannot play so if my grandson wants to play he plays on my game.also for end of level challenge would be nice for hints after many many tries.never could solve last final challenge

0385344325|5.0|Lee Child steps back into Jack Reacher's early history to tell this story.<br /><br />It's 1997 and Reacher is still in the military. He's a major in the military police and goes where he's ordered. This time he's sent to Carter Crossing, Mississippi, to be an undercover witness and monitor to the official investigation of a young woman who was murdered.<br /><br />The crime took place outside Ft. Kelham, a U.S. Ranger base where a secret operation is under way. Rangers are being sent as peace keepers to Kosovo. Reacher is ordered to observe the action and avoid publicity.<br /><br />When he arrives, Reacher meets the sheriff, a beautiful woman named Elizabeth Devereaux. She is attempting to investigate the murder of the woman in question, who is white, and two black women. All three women were very attractive but only the white woman's death stirred up any concern in Mississippi.<br /><br />Devereaux is hindered in running a thorough investigation because her official powers stop at Ft. Kelham's gate. Reacher is sympathetic with this problem and as he gets to know Devereaux, he finds that she is the daughter of the former sheriff and was a former military police member. She and Reacher begin to work together and as they do, they develop a romantic relationship.<br /><br />The plot moves rapidly with built in humor as Reacher tries to search for answers while dealing with a group of local hillbillies. This is described in a picturesque manner.<br /><br />The pacing is well done as there are moments of tension spaced with the relationship of Reacher and Devereaux. We are also interested with the attempt of the military to whitewash the investigation for political purposes with Reacher's refusal to bend to the attempted cover-up.<br /><br />\\"The Affair\\" is another well written novel by Lee Child, a master storyteller.<br /><br />4.5 stars, moving up to 5.
0061714402|5.0|This is such an incredible story. I grew up with this band. As a teenager I went to every show. I had no idea of the troubles in this mans life. I had a huge respect for him as a musician and I attribute his style as the greatest writing and most unique Heavy Metal had ever known. After reading this book, I now have a huge respect for him on a personal level. His life is tragic and triumphant which makes this book the best auto biography I've ever read. Thank you Dave Mustaine, for finally writing it.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I got this book first because Collen Hoover is a local author and the book was free for kindle. I was a little aprehensive since it was her first book. I don't know the author personally either. The book is outstanding. I couldn't put it down. I don't usually do book reviews either but thought this one was worth the time. The characters in the story come to life as you read the pages. I laughed, I cried, and laughed again. Collen brought together the story of a young girl whose life takes a lot of hard turns and twist. This is one book that I will read more than once.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|We are long time enthusiasts for the Masterpiece series and this is one of their best efforts!  This is the new \\"Upstairs/Downstairs\\" which was one of the most watched and loved series in England.  The characters are well played and although not an \\"action\\" genre series, keeps one on the edge of one's seat, hoping for the best outcome, fearing for the worst!  This is another of those classic series that we will watch every year - a must have in any great video collection!  Well played, well photographed, well done!

The only thing is with expanded stereo there is significant hissing... no matter how little or quiet some people may say it is, it is very audible and makes the expanded stereo mode not worth it. Without the expanded stereo mode though, the headset sounds amazing and makes playing Modern Warfare 3 awesome.

B0050SYS5A|3.0|I purchased the XBox Zoom at another location and the instructions were fairly straight forward, simple and easy to follow.  It comes with a clear film to place over your Kinect to prevent scratches when putting on or taking off the Zoom.  I really wish the manufacturer would have included a few extra films because they aren't the easiest to place perfectly and I can see, in the future, needing another since the Zoom doesn't remain on our Kinect.  You place the film over the Kinect lenses, align the Zoom and snap on.  The manufacturer is very clear about NOT sliding the Zoom on to the Kinect and that is advice to be heeded.  The Zoom had spring loaded lens fittings on it that slip in to the lens holes of your Kinect.  Siding could break both items.  You're pretty much ready to go after placement.  Functionality:  Honestly, I'm noticing that we can stand maybe, a foot closer to the TV which doesn't make this product all that useful.  I will take in to account that lighting could be a factor here and I will update this review if I find any improvement.
B000002OX7|5.0|The Who's fifth studio album entitled Who's Next was released in August of 1971.<br />After the mammoth success of Tommy in 1969, The Who (comprised of guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend, lead singer Roger Daltrey, the late John Entwistle on bass guitar and the seemingly four armed/four legged drummer Keith Moon (also sadly missed)) continued to tour Tommy into 1970 which resulted in the classic live album Live At Leeds. Then Pete wanted to come up with the ultimate concept called Lifehouse which was to be originally intended as a combination science fiction film, rock opera, double album and concert cycle all connected to make a statement about the world uniting under a music chord and the show was to take place at The Young Vic Theater in London. However, a dispute between Townshend and The Who's then-manager Kit Lambert (who accused Townshend of going mad and just wanted to make a film of Tommy) erupted over Lifehouse and the other band members felt the story didn't make sense. Then the band started recording the album in New York at The Record Plant but Kit Lambert was on heroin and the sessions were not usable by The Who's standards. Then the band got together with engineer Glyn Johns and recorded some stuff at Stargroves (owned by Mick Jagger) but the sessions (sans \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\") was not up to par so Johns suggested the band record a single album of songs at Olympic Studios. The result, one of the greatest albums ever made (as I found out as a 11 year old in 1987).<br />We start the album off with \\"Baba O'Riley\\" with innovative VCS3 organ and ARP synthesizer line that hypnotizes you. Then piano comes in followed by thundering drums from Moon, Daltrey's powerful voice, Entwistle's bass and a spare but powerful guitar riff from Pete (who also sings one line here) propel you into the teenage wasteland. The song was one of Pete's cynical goodbyes to the 60s hippie idealism rounded out by Dave Arbus' classic violin solo. Next is \\"Bargain\\" with excellent acoustic and guitar work from Pete plus hypnotic synthesizers and vocals by Daltrey and Townshend. Next is the acoustic \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" which is only 2 minutes but excellent. We follow with The Ox (John Entwistle)'s heavy rocker \\"My Wife\\" which was inspired by a fight he had with his wife. We close the first half with the superb \\"The Song is Over\\". This epic has Pete on vocal for verses and Daltrey on choruses, stellar guitar and synth work from Pete and piano work by the late Nicky Hopkins.<br />The album's second half starts with the stellar \\"Gettin' in Tune\\" which again features Nicky Hopkins on piano and starts as a ballad before ending in a rocking note with great playing by the band. Next is Pete's ode to the Volkswagen mini-bus called \\"Going Mobile\\". We follow that with the classic ode to vengeance entitled \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" which starts out acoustic then has the heavy bridge section before it ends like it begins and perfect example of what the British call \\"light and shade\\". We close with another VCS3/ARP synthesizer loop which goes into the epic rocker \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". The song is not a political song and points out to Pete's cynical view of hippie communalism. This track has heavy guitars, atomic bass, maniacal drumming and Daltrey's powerful singing and anti-climatic scream before it ends with the line \\"meet the new boss, same as the old boss\\" (this song is my view on politicians who make fools of their supporters).<br />Who's Next would be the highest selling Who album with three million in the US alone and would peak at #4 on the Billboard album chart.<br />In 1995, the album was re-released with a painstaking remix and remastering by Jon Astley as part of the restoring of The Who catalog. This version has seven bonus tracks. First is the Record Plant take of \\"Pure and Easy\\" which differs from the Odds and Sods take. Then we have another outtake from the Record Plant sessions being \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\". Then two tracks from the Young Vic performance in April, 1971 being \\"Naked Eye\\" (first issued on the Thirty Years of Maximum R&B box set) and then the track \\"Water\\" which was a concert staple from 1970/71. Then it's the Odds and Sods cut \\"Too Much of Anything\\" (which was intended for Who's Next before it was scrapped). Then it's \\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\" which was recorded in 1970/71 and featured Pete on slide guitar for a change. We close with the Record Plant outtake of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\". You also get a cool booklet with essays, credits, a synopsis for each track and photos. Another reissue came in 2003 with the 1971 mix remastered and different bonus tracks.<br />Who's Next is recommended!in April, 1971 being \\"Naked Eye\\" (first issued on the Thirty Years of Maximum R&B box set) and then the track \\"Water\\" which was a concert staple from 1970/71.

B0063GORYU|4.0|I like.playing card games so I tried this one and its not bad. no big problems or small ones just fun
B004L03B3S|5.0|From Beginning to End is hyped as \\"controversial\\" because the relationship that is portrayed is between two males who are half-brothers, the suggestion being, of course, that their relationship is incestuous.  How silly! The incest taboo in Western society and elsewhere was established to prevent a male and female who are closely related from having sexual intercourse and giving birth to a child who often is born retarded or suffers from other physical or mental defects.  That taboo makes sense in human society.  BUT sexual relations between two males results in no offspring.  Intercourse produces no human beings.  Therefore to compare sexual relations between two related males to that of a related male and female makes no biological or logical sense.  What is beautiful about this movie is the love between these two half-brothers from the time when they were growing up through their life as young, sexual adults.  The earlier relationship was, of course, not sexual but one of tender closeness, protectiveness, and love.  Later, after they were older the relationship evolved naturally into a sexual one that was an expression of both tender love and protectiveness that was a natural part of their normal social and professional lives.  What, I ask, could be more satisfying for two people?  Its storyline, the script, the acting in this movie are all superb. It certainly surpasses most American movies classified as gay. To dismiss it as a movie about incest reflects ignorant prejudice.  Would that more human relationships were as beautiful as the one portrayed here.
B005KAH7QU|1.0|Crap. Plus really obnoxious music. What was the story? A waste of a talent like Cate Blanchett. She must have needed the money.
0091936977|2.0|I am a big, big fan of Robert Harris. I found his book Enigma when my interest in the code breaking of Bletchley Park in WW2 was at its peak; that mix of fact and fiction blew me away and it remains his best book in my mind. On a par with it there is Fatherland, the alternative history classic, and almost level, Pompeii. Archangel is also not to be missed.<br /><br />So, when I started The Fear Index, I was positively titillated with anticipation - a new Harris is always good news.<br /><br />Within 50 pages, my enthusiasm was dampened somewhat, and after 150 pages, I was downright disappointed. This tale of a brilliant physicist who leaves CERN to write the best algorithmic investment system ever seen was just not what I have always liked best in Harris.<br /><br />In my mind, Harris shines when he tells the tale of the single man, cast in a role by chance and personal talent, conquering insurmountable odds. Tom Jericho in Enigma, Xavier March in Fatherland, and Fluke Kelso in Archangel have all been set in a situation where only their personal integrity and hard work will win the day.<br /><br />Not so in The Fear Index. Harris writes well as always, but the picture he draws of Alex Hoffmann has none of the usual charm of a Harris hero. Hoffmann is arrogant, talented, and definitely the man for the job, but his almost autistic lack of interaction doesn't endear him to the reader. Alex's relationship with his artist wife Gabrielle is superficial and uninteresting, even if the culmination point of that relationship in the art gallery raises eyebrows in the best tradition of Harris' books.<br /><br />Another thing that worried me much was that Harris ventures into Clancyist methods of adding technobabble to add excitement. I was especially disappointed with the small things that he's always done really well: risking that I will be called a muppet by some people, I'll say that CPUs do not hum - transformers do, and there are no files in a computer's registry. Such small items become more and more evident towards the end of the book.<br /><br />And the crucial element of any book of this type, namely suspension of disbelief, just didn't go far enough. I will not disclose the plot, but at 2/3 of the book it fell flat for me and I read the rest merely to see what happens, not on the edge of the seat enjoying every moment of it.<br /><br />I will repeat that he writes just as well as ever (with a few somewhat tired similes, a first for me in his books), and to some people, especially in the world of finance, this may be more interesting than to the average lay person, but my expectations were not met, and I will remain in wait for his next book to see if he goes back to creating a truly interesting character in a complex and dangerous situation.<br /><br />-Heikki Hietala, author of Tulagi Hotelll items become more and more evident towards the end of the book.<br /><br />And the crucial element of any book of this type, namely suspension of disbelief, just didn't go far enough.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I seriously don't know what I'd do without this app. I use it for everything from reference when I'm in deep study, to when I need a quick verse to comfort someone. Only thing I can think of that would improve it is a random verse feature.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|it was a great game. some levels are hard, but i got thru them. i liked the sweetheart's, slumber party, crusty rival's and all the rest, it was a nice touch
B001P06GX4|5.0|Blockus is a great family game that can be played with children and spouces alike.  I've played this game with my inlaw and guest to our home and they love it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Ai recently doenllwnloaded this and I love it. the large assortment of games keeps me occupied. Id recommend it to anyone.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is by far my favorite Hitchcock movie. I love the way Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly interact with each other and do it with the context of a murder mystery. I love the way that every time Grace Kelly shows up she has an elegant outfit fitting to the era. This movie has powerful acting and great suspense.
B00067BBQE|2.0|The video editing, as many reviewers pointed out, is so fast-paced you can't make out any details, esp on the playing of the instruments.Pic is barely acceptable, lacks sharpness and is very dark.<br /><br />But that would not be that big of a deal if the LPCM sound had not had so much bottom end it almost split my sub in two. When I turned the volume down on the sub, the bass made my amp clip, so I had to resort to the bass control on my amp to substract the incredible excess of signal. Guitars are also quiet in the mix; not exactly suitable for METAL, don't you think ?<br /><br /> Respect to not having overdubbed Amy's voice on the mix. She sounds real live and rawer than on studio recording, which I appreciate. The videoclips are OK, and the behind-the-scenes feature are very lame, although I have seen worse.<br /><br />The packaging is lavish but I had happily traded that for a better-mastered disc.<br /><br />Borrow this from a friend,rent it, whatever, but do not spend your hard-earned on this failure of a dvd. Oh, do not get me wrong; I love the band, not criticizing the product just because I do not like them like some people do.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|IT JUST WORKS. Great quality app, finds remote PC in a blink and connects super fast. Great for streaming video.

B0063IH60K|5.0|great game!!  love the option to tap the cards to move them.  I use it as a sleep aid since you can our as much bought into it as you want.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is worth getting!!! It provides a variety of games to meet everyone's interests. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B002K0WBYG|1.0|This DVD set is advertised at the blu-ray movie and digital copy, which is several dollars more than the blu-ray only copy.  However, the code for the digital copy expired quite some time ago (APRIL 2011).  You cannot download the digital copy that you paid for, a fact you do not find out until AFTER you open the DVD and it's no longer returnable as \\"new\\", yet Amazon is still selling the Digital Copy edition without informing the customer that they cannot obtain the digital copy.  DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION.  Amazon needs to stop selling this DVD or put in the description that you can no longer obtain the digital copy.
B005R32L66|4.0|I have been using Skype for several years.  The price has gone up since EBay has purchased the company.  But it does work.  Not very useful for me and most cell phones already offer this type of service without the need to get seperate software.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love playing this game at night or whenever I can find a time to play. My brother and I love it!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I am not a fan of Adobe or flash media, but we have no choice so all I can say is this app works pretty good but it does not allow you to rotate the screen.
B000068FXR|4.0|Supertramp's fourth album Crisis? What Crisis? was recorded in the Autumn/Fall of 1975 at A&M Studios in Los Angeles and released in November. Several of the songs were holdovers from the band's last album  Crime Of The Century.<br /><br />The album opens with the shimmering up beat Easy Does It which fit the mood of the original album's yellow and orange inside/inner sleeve. Sister Moonshine is a great song sung by both Roger and Rick. Ain't Nobody But Me is a cool rocking Rick sung song with a catchy hook that would become a Supertramp standard. A Soapbox Opera has a nice \\"epic\\" feel even though it's fairly short. Another Man's Woman is another Rick sung rocker which is a nice contrast to Roger's more mellow songs. The second half of the album kicks off with one of Roger's more rocking songs on the album, Lady, which was also the first single. It's too bad that Universal couldn't have thrown on the single's B side, the original studio version of You Started Laughing as a bonus song. The Rick sung Poor Boy is next and is followed by a great song called Just A Normal Day sung by both Roger and Rick. The Meaning is a good song and the album ends with the excellent Two of Us. A great album with one or two average songs and with Supertramp, average isn't bad.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This book was terrible compared to the first two.  A total let down, the characters you learned to love and appreciate over the first two books were missing and/or vacant.  If you set the bar low for the third book of this trilogy you won't be as disappointed as I was.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|After using Evernote for the last two years, I have yet to find a major problem. Simple and safe syncing on several devices.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|The movie got here faster than I expected. Was great fun. I look forward to watching it again. My husband thought it was the best movie.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|This movie will not explain the financial crisis and there are no explosions. But the characters, their interactions, and conflicts are believable and interesting.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love this product - fits perfectly and functions perfectly! Reasonable pricing. Really love the colors available - I selected the PINK! It makes the Kindle Fire easier to use.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to quickly change versions to read the same verse in multiple ways.  This is also handy in church as my pastor does not always read from the same Bible version.  I enjoy the Bible reading plans too.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games on here are quite fun. some can be a tad bit challenging, which makes them even more enjoyable.
1591841216|5.0|this is a nice little book that will help you approach things in a different way. i always try to read this one at least once a year just to get \\"refreshed\\"
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Another great game,a lot of hidden objects,some easier to find than others. Good story line and mini puzzles. Would like to see it in a longer format.  I would purchase any similar game from g5.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like that the YouVersion Bible has a number of well-respected translations available. I am using one of the reading plans available as well. It is nice to have access to a daily reading that does the page turning for you. With a young daughter, I am always looking for a few extra minutes to read. With YouVersion, I can read several chapters in the OT and NT quickly.
0802473156|5.0|This book is a real eye-opener. Read it with someone you love and find out what says \\"I love you\\" to them. This knowledge can be the key to a better relationship, not only with your spouse, but also with everyone you care about.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|I rank this album with their Karmacode album.  While this album doesn't have the couple of stand out songs (Our Truth and Enjoy the Silence) that Karmacode has, it is more solid overall.  All the songs are equally good, and an interesting cover of an R.E.M. song is thrown in there.  The album is dark and heavy with solid guitar riffs, well constructed harmonies, and haunting melodies.  Lacuna Coil does an exceptional job of featuring all singers on this album - everyone gets a chance to shine (as much as goth rockers shine) and takes full advantage.  If you enjoyed Karmacode, you will like this one too.  A must have for any goth metal fan.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Hotmail app is great and the Fire just got better because of this add. Thanks Amazon and Microsoft for adding it.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I've read Grisham's books for a long time and I wasn't too impressed with The Litigators.  The characters were ok, but I don't think they meshed well.  The book is a good read but....  Hopefully the next book coming out in April is better.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is my favorite Bible app. It has few issues like repeatition of the first sentence in a chapter and poor capitalization of word (both in the NKJV), but this is clearly the best free Bible app with no advert. May God bless the developers.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The Amazon Kindle Fire is a great tablet for an amazing price.  What I really love about it is the Amazon Prime features.  What's not to love about tens of thousands of movies, songs, and books at the tip of your finger.  Amazon Prime allows you to receive purchased items in 2 days with no shipping cost, and you're cloud drive is upgraded to allow unlimited songs.  I can now listen to my cloud drive on my Kindle Fire, my cell phone (with Amazon MP3 app), and my computer.  I would recommend this table to anyone that wants a tablet that can give you great content.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|tom cruise is awesome in this fourth installment of mission impossible. i tell ya one thing mission impossible would not be what it is without tom cruise. this fourth movie is awesome and i hope he does more. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Eddie was on fire once again for this effort, this was the first concert I ever saw in my life.. would have loved to see the first 3 album tours when Eddie was at his best, but this was right up there and probably the last great tour he did when he was really inspired and throwing down some serious guitar playing.  Filled with awesome hooks, gritty rock lyrics and song themes this is probably Van Halen's most \\"conceptual\\" album. A must have, and I will ad that all the Roth albums are must haves for true VH fans, while Diver Down is their weakest effort even it has some great shining rock moments like Little Guitars etc...
B000EGDB10|5.0|this is an awesome movie. tom cruise is at his best in this action packed thrill ride. i belive tom cruise was made to play the part of ethan hunt. this movie is full of wonders and it has you at the edge of your seat all the way through the film. this is a great film. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00004Y6OA|5.0|This album pretty much kept things rolling along for the MIGHTY VAN HALEN... i used to have all the LP's but have no idea where the hell they are now, plus I don't even have a decent turntable to import them to my Mac via Logic anyway and it's not worth it to invest in one, easier to just finally buy the CD's. I owned Van Halen(the debut album) for years so just now collecting all the Roth era CD's in anticipation of the new album with Roth.  Solid guitar hooks, a couple of hit tunes and just general typical Van Halen raucous rock and roll. Roth helped Edward create what I now look back on as Rock Noir, gritty street lyrics with a film noir edge to it all, pushed forward by Eddie's unique guitar style overall and his brother supplying excellent drumming skills. I don't think they should suffer much with Wolfgang now on bass, although Anthony will be missed.
B003QO8TOQ|5.0|tom cruise is back as ethan hunt and he is better than ever. i tell you it is rare to find a sequel that is better than the first one. i love these movies. and mission impossible 2 has one of the best hero villian showdown i've ever saw since star wars return of the jedi. this movie is awesome and i give a lot of respect to tom cruise for doing his own stunts. like i said in my previous review he was made for this movie. if you have not seen this movie then i re4commend you do
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Overall nice toy and prop replica. Very happy with shipping, I ordered it on Sunday night, and it came Tuesday afternoon!  Pros:  Awesome packaging  Fairly accurate replica of a prop on an amazing show  Black light is powerful  Loud speaker  The two ink nibs are really cool  I got it for about $20  Pretty durable, it's not indestructible, but I've dropped it a few times and it was fine c:  Cons:  A few inaccuracies... but they aren't really much to complain about seeing as how it's 20 bucks  It is really light, which could be good, but compared to the 11th doctor's it's a feather  The seam lines are... present  Getting to the battery chamber and removing batteries is a bit of a hassle  Bottom line, if you like Doctor Who; Get this toy/replica! It's both fun and functional!
B004I744AS|5.0|Quick look up, no more going page by page. Love the cover page, info and games. Best I have seen so far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow, loved this series of books ! I read all 3 books in 4 days. I just could not put the story down thinking about what would happen next. Love when a writer can create a story to play like a movie in your head while you read :o)
B004WR125O|2.0|I am using it with a Onkyo TX609NR (on top of my coffee table, completely not obstructed etc), ATT Router (Uverse (12 mbps), and it's ~ 20 feet from the router (in my basement so 1 floor away).  Signal is real iffy - I have no issues with any other device anywhere in the house, so I'm going to blame this.  I am currently looking for a workaround - either hardwire OR YOU CAN USE OTHER ADAPTERS that are not Onkyo.  I think there are probably several that would work, but you'll have to search.  There is a high gain antenna for $14 that woould prob be better for me (and maybe you) TP-Link TL-WN722N 150Mbps High Gain Wireless USB Adapter is the one I saw that works.  Does it look like hell, yes.  However, I'm having songs stop/skip/restart constantly... not fun.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This game is AWESOME! right as I got super addicted to it, my Motor Xoom went through the most recent update and now the game freezes every time I try to play it. super bummed. please fix asap!!!!
B0065CCT6U|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best album I have ever listened to.  Chris Cornell's voice is strong and haunting.  Every song on the album is great.  The songs are beautiful and emotional.  I highly recommend this album.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these fun and challenging games! there's lots.of options and its so addicting! totes rec you download right now!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I originally got this free version to try it out and well, it's probably the most popular game around so enough said.  I know free versions come with ads, but the ads on this were extremely annoying and distracting to me. I have other free apps and the ads are unobtrusive and tollerable. I went and bought the paid version and love it. One star off because of how annoying the ads are.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|Despite some other reviewers that complained about the blu-ray update, I noticed a real difference. To me, it was just like watching it in a theatre.  As for the \\"culture\\" issues with the crows, apparently none of these reviewers have been around a group of \\"jiving\\" blacks in the 50s-60s. I was in Chicago, and Dumbo hits their jive talk perfectly. I can not see why this would be a racial slur.If you're going to censor this, you might as well censor the drunk clowns as well, because it means that all white people drink and wear clown make-up. Then we're left with a perfectly sanitized 10 min PC cartoon that makes no sense. This censoring of actual cultural behavior is going too far. For an example of Disney hacking up the classics, see the new edited version of \\"Fantasia\\".
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I had downloaded the free version of this to see what everyone was raving about. Now I know. A great game that is challenging and addictive. Works great on my Kindle Fire. I went and bought this one because the ads on the free version were so annoying.  I read a review that said that the paid version would install over the free version and you would not lose your scores. That didn't happen on my Fire. I ended up with both versions and when I uninstalled the free version I lost my scores. Luckily I wasn't very far into it yet.

0307586901|5.0|Martha Stewart's Handmade Holiday Crafts is a weighty tome chock full of great ideas on how to decorate for the Holidays. Decorations range from easy- making a centerpiece out of wheat, to hard- handmade wreaths and cinnamon decorated bird ornaments for the tree!<br /><br />Martha Stewart's projects are all lovingly photographed and documented and look really stunning in their simplicity. I particularly loved the decorations for Halloween such as the jack-0-lanterns and the treat bags shaped like pumpkins. Other favorites were the giant bird silhouette window, the instructions on how to fold napkins and the cute Pilgrim costumes for Thanksgiving, turkeys, and sail's for the table.<br /><br />The photographs are all really well done too. There really is never a question how the finished item is supposed to look. The index at the end includes places where you can purchase items for the projects in the book, and also include templates. This book is a must have for the holiday crafter in your life.<br /><br />Review copy courtesy of Netgalley
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I don't know about you, but me, I like to organize my books, even sub-organize them into files of styles, authors, etc.  Although the basic kindle reader and the Kindle PC has the ability for organization at least one level, one can organize by genre type and/or add favorite authors.  Please note, even in these instances, the Kindle will not list the folders in alphabetical order which, for the most part would be another useful feature.  Including a favorite authors section as well would be a very useful tool, or create a 2 tier alphabetical sequenced list, even if the user doesn't create his/her list alphabetically.  Having the ability to organize, categorize and store my books in folders of my choosing is something I truly miss in the Kindle Android App.  I find it a very useful feature and I hope these ideas are implemented in the next update for this app.  Otherwise it works just like the Kindle for PC app, which lists your books in the fashion you want on the main page (your total collection).  Personally, I find this complete list both annoying and useful.  It's great to find the book your looking for, but since it'll be done by date of purchase or title, instead of author, even the PC and Basic Kindle have their limitations.  Now if you are reading this, I do have a type for you.  Since in both the original kindle PDA and the PC Kindle app will interact with each other with the Kindle's USB cable, you can organize all your books in the folder as you enter them, and when you plug in your Kindle, the file system will be transferred, which saves you a lot of trouble.  What I did was put a few favorite authors in the top couple of folders for easy access, then added folders by genre as I thought of them. I have to re-do this to in alphabetical order.  My advice here,  plan your genre folders first, then fill them with your favorite books/authors.  This will save you time later.  As for the Kindle Android App, this is unachievable from my experience at the time ofthis writing.  I hope they see fit to change the Android and Kindle apps to fix these minor but very useful changes.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|I had never seen \\"Planet of the Apes\\" or the old movies before I saw this. I really loved it but mainly because Andy Serkis (Gollum) is so amazing as Cesar the chimpanzee in this movie. James Franco is okay as is the \\"Slumdog\\" girl, but Serkis steals every scene he's in. You totally get lost in the movie and only when you stop and think about it do you remember that it's a man doing CGI. Most movies that set you up for a sequel suck. \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" is a rare exception in which I wished I was able to pop the next DVD right into my machine.
0812550706|3.0|Spoilers:  Fairly boring through the first 2/3 of the book.  Genius kid goes to military school, practices war games, and deals with inner demons.  Then, he graduates.  From there, the book starts to pick up and finally presents a great surprise finish.<br /><br />I can understand how this book won awards years ago, but, after reading more modern and much better sci-fi and fantasy books, it just seems ok.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|Recently, I saw a newly released Matt Damon movie, \\"We bought a Zoo,\\" and liked it quite a bit...and Matt Damon's acting. So I decided to try this movie. It was an interesting concept, but I think I mostly liked the movie because of Matt Damon (and Emily Blunt...). Also, there is another character who helps Matt to follow his heart and make a free-will choice... that I liked, too.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|The leightweight MicroShell from Marware has been the great protector for my new Kindle Fire. It's stylish and has a nice band to hold the cover shut when not in use. It's got a nice heavy duty shell to the Kindle now in case I drop it the Shell will take the hit - not the Kindle. The fold up cover for reading purposes is a nice touch also.
B0000640SA|5.0|Two parts to this review (I'd post two separate reviews, but can't because Amazon has all Memento DVD versions folded together)<br /><br />#1: Guide to Accessing Extras on 2-DVD Limited Edition<br /><br />While disc 1 isn't that bad (within a few seconds, I figured out that clicking \\"read\\" accesses subtitles, \\"comments\\" turns on the audio commentary, etc.), trying to find the extras on disc 2 can be very frustrating.  If you enjoy the challenge of mapping out the contents for yourself, more power to you, have a blast.  For the rest of us:<br /><br />I haven't gone through all 950+ reviews to see if someone has already posted this information, but I've found two websites that detail how to access everything(?) on the discs:<br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />Edit: Ok, Amazon removed the hyperlinks, and I can understand why.  So, I'll reproduce some of the information here, what I consider the most important pieces.  Do your own web search if you want more.<br /><br />To run the movie in reverse (i.e. chronological order):<br />. Select the clock icon (NOT the watch icon)<br />. Answer \\"C\\" to every question you're asked<br />. Order the photographs 3-4-1-2<br /><br />To access a menu of supplements (\\"Anatomy of a Scene\\" featurette, director's script, stills/production sketches gallery, international poster art gallery)<br />. Select the clock icon (NOT the watch icon)<br />. Answer \\"E\\" to every question you're asked<br /><br />There's plenty more, so do a web search if you're interested.<br /><br />#2: Blu-Ray: buy 10th Anniversary Edition, not the older 'original'<br /><br />I just received the 10th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray.  By chance, I visited a friend who has the original Blu-ray and was able to compare.  The 10th Anniversary Edition is not a re-packaging of the original with more extras (all the extras from the 2-DVD set are now present).  The picture is greatly improved (the original is 'soft' - the 10th anniversary edition shows much more detail).  Also, the strangeness of the menus on the 2-DVD set is gone.<br /><br />Note: The 2-DVD set allowed you to play the movie \\"in reverse\\", i.e. in chronological order.  That option is not present on either Blu-Ray release, as far as I can tell.  So, if you own the 2-DVD set and want to keep the ability to play the movie \\"in reverse\\", you'll have to keep Disc 2 from the 2-DVD set, and be satisfied with standard def for the \\"in reverse\\" version.e. in chronological order.  That option is not present on either Blu-Ray release, as far as I can tell.  So, if you own the 2-DVD set and want to keep the ability to play the movie \\"in reverse\\", you'll have to keep Disc 2 from the 2-DVD set, and be satisfied with standard def for the \\"in reverse\\" version.

B000002HAF|5.0|How in the world these guys never became a household name is beyond me. What an amazing band and album. An Indie classic if ever there was one. Their soft/loud/soft dynamic was definitely a precursor to all things Grunge beginning with Nirvana. Your collection won't be complete without it.

B005LAIGMI|4.0|So this was many months ago: Stunned in the aftermath of a brutal shellacking meted out by Chris Cyborg, MMA fighter Gina Carano entertained one of them standing at the crossroads moments. Which is around when Hollywood came knocking, when Steven Soderbergh decided to call and ask her to star in a movie. And here's HAYWIRE, fruit of their collaboration, a film that isn't high-brow or artsy or a Major Motion Picture. What it is, though, is gritty and action-packed and massively appealing. It just might make a movie star of Gina Carano. She's better looking than the Rock.<br /><br />From the opening scene in an upstate New York diner, your eyes are fixed on Carano. She sits at her table quietly, but there's a trapped animal watchfulness about her and you're instantly put on guard. And yet when the sitch goes sour, it happens in a shocking heartbeat and you're caught unprepared anyway (unless, of course, you've seen the trailer). Carano plays Mallory Kane, an exceptional employee in a private contracting company that takes on all manner of dirty ops work. The narrative doesn't follow a linear track. It shifts back and forth from the present and the past. As the film opens, Mallory Kane already has a bullseye on her.<br /><br />Mallory must work thru a labyrinthine puzzle to figure out all them what betrayed her. It all goes back to an eventful rescue mission executed by Mallory and her fellow agents in Barcelona - of which entirety we see in flashback. But all this is a superfluous info dump. It's the film's MacGuffin. Somewhere along the way, someone high up in the cloak & dagger community made the decision to sanction Mallory Kane. This then allows us to marvel at Carano as her resourceful, lethally capable character travels the globe bent on exacting revenge. From Barcelona to Dublin to New Mexico to upstate New York, she leaves a trail of busted up bodies.<br /><br />Even when Soderbergh is slumming, his stuff registers high on the watchability scale. HAYWIRE is his spin on the action thriller, and it's a well-crafted one. It's not just one fight after another. It takes its time in unfolding its narrative beats (okay, there are some slow spots). But HAYWIRE overall feels like the product of a master filmmaker letting his hair down and having fun but not neglecting his due diligence. It's obvious that Soderbergh set out to make Carano a star. HAYWIRE showcases her pretty brilliantly. Carano isn't half bad at the acting bits, and she is most definitely eye candy. But recognizing that she's a fledgling actress, Soderbergh populates her film with big Hollywood names. We're treated to hard-hitting scenes in which Carano opens a mean can on hunks like Channing Tatum, Michael Fassbender, and a slightly weasely Ewan Macgregor. The cool thing is these actors - along with Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas - seem to not mind playing second fiddle to a rookie actress. The performances are universally solid, with the biggest surprise being that Gina Carano does hold her own in their company. There's something about her, about her attitude, a sense that she's working hard but still not taking herself seriously. And when she smiles that flirty smile, there's a feel of wheels spinning internally. I believed that her character really was that intelligent and resourceful and undeterred. I already knew she was sexy.<br /><br />Soderbergh plonks her in diverse settings which showcase her versatility. We see her glamorous side as she partners Michael Fassbender's dashing MI6 operative on a work night in Dublin. We see her down and dirty as she gets to the business of eluding her assassins and dishing out payback. I didn't doubt that Gina Carano would be able to sell her action scenes; she's photogenic that way, too. Her fights are nasty affairs, no holds barred and sometimes not pretty to look at. Carano is explosive and marvelously athletic, and when she hits a body you don't doubt that her blows have a serious impact. And, to make it even more realistic, Carano also absorbs her share of punishment, lots of it. Soderbergh opted to not have a music score framing these no-quarter-given scraps. All you hear are the desperate grunts and harsh breathing and the thuds of striking feet and fists. It makes it even more believable.<br /><br />I heard someone mention this already, and, in fact, a cop in the film even refers to Carano by that name. But if the role of Wonder Woman is still being cast, why not Gina Carano? She's got the goods. And she probably won't even need that lasso of truth to whup on them villains. In any case, Gina Carano needs to do more films.re realistic, Carano also absorbs her share of punishment, lots of it.

B004T1Z9S4|5.0|Loved the movie and Russell Crowe.  Lots of action and great cinematography. Well worth owning on blu ray which made the action sequences much better than ordinary DVD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|get it love it live it.so fun but some is hated. some of them are easy. get it come one you will love it
B002ISID10|5.0|I love this band.  This was their debut and it rocked.  Incorporating techno sound with their metal crosses boundaries few are willing to dabble with.  I think it is amazing.  It is for the most part metal which is great.  But again it has some industrial sounds that are awesome.  The best part is they don't sound English!
B006H3MIV8|5.0|I don't understand all the negative reviews on here. I for one am tired of all the same folksy covers of Dylan's music. We have about 200 hundred albums worth of covers that don't venture too far from the source material and lack adventure and creativity. An album like this, featuring an impressive lineup of modern musicians across all genres has been long overdue. I'm not as old as some of you, but it's time some of you pass the baton to a newer generation. Don't like what we've done with your hero's music? fine. You guys are also responsible for disco. Don't ever forget that.
B004I744AS|5.0|Love this app. Hangman,  Trivia, word of the day with audio. It's interesting, fun and you can actually learn something.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|I have at least 2 dozen Christmas CD's.This year I purchased a few new ones.This is one of my favorites.  We are still enjoying it in Jan.guess I forgot to put this one away.  Michaels voice is so pure and enjoyable.  This is one everybody should have in their collection
B005IY3DP2|5.0|There is no denying how good Kasabian's previous albums are, but rest assured, Velociraptor! can sit high with the rest. Tune after tune, its easy to visualize how these songs will play out live on stage - with total brilliance from the boys.  Not a big sing-along person myself, but with tracks like 'Rewired', 'Man of Simple Pleasures', and 'Neon Noon,' I caught myself humming to them at first, and then after a few more listens, full-out uncontrollable synching.  Great listen all-in-all. Cheers!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|This app used to be my favorite<br />App. Last update ruined it. Place in books not saved, not able to remove books, if phone call comes in, instead of going back to where you were, you are now returned to a totally different book at a random spot, and books that you have finished, are now marked at only partially read. I'm uninstalling. Which is too bad. I've spent a lot of money in the store in books. They just lost a customer.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|I purchased this set not caring on what the package would look like, as long as the dvds would play as good as the store-bought. They are not that good, the quality is really bad. Some are really blurry, they look really bad that its like if they were cheaply copied or illegally reproduced. Now I understand why the cost is so low. I recomend that you dont buy this. I am not even  a fan and the quality made me not even want to see it...DO NOT BUY.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've tried several different Bible reading plans and I never could stick with them.  This app has such a huge variety of reading plans and devotionals, that there is certainly one to fit any individual.  I also enjoy the option of different Bible versions and the translation information.  Yes, I recommend this app to anyone interested in reading, studying, and  applying God's Word.  I do Love It!
B004N44SOI|5.0|I've just given this album my first spin, and upon this initial listen I thouroughly enjoyed each and every track. I've been immensely enjoying \\"The Herion Diaries\\" for a couple of years now(definitely a desert island disc for me),and so didn't hesitate when the oppourtunity came to pick this release up.  This outing is a bit more \\"Hit Song\\" oriented than the last album, which it seems was somewhat more riff oriented and had musical shades of light and dark within each song. These songs are either full-blown or moody unto themselves, as opposed to mixing it up within a given track.  Nonetheless, these three guys, as a band, seem to click in ways that most bands/artists only strive for. As a songwriting team they are almost unmatched. The level of musical craftsmanship on display here, coupled with such thought-provoking lyrics, outshines much of what sits on the shelves in the entertainment marketplace today. James Michael has one of the purest vocies I've ever heard and is a great drum programmer(something I typically despise)and producer.  If these guys stick together, they could well become THE songwriting team for the next decade or more. Axl had better take advantage of D.J. while he has him, because I could see Sixx: A.M. becoming the next supergroup without much to stand in their way.
0307949486|2.0|Maybe there was too much hype before I read this book, but I found it very slow.  I read 50 pages and put it down months ago, and then was told by several people that I needed to pick it up and wait it out.  I did finish it finally, but the first 250 pages are very slow as virtually nothing happens.  The second half of the book picks up and it was good.  However, since I never really liked the characters of Blomkvist or Salander, I won't be following them on other adventures.  I was disappointed.
0061726826|3.0|I thought the idea for this book was great. I thought the writing was pretty good.  I've read Before I Die and liked it so thought I'd give this a try.  Honestly I would've rated this a 4 or even 5 if the ending were different.  Happier.  However the ending as is leaves you hanging.  I was so so disappointed.  If I'd known how it ends I would have never read the book.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|EDIT:<br /><br />Ok, I have finally gotten this thing to work pretty decently.  I used the hactivated settings from the forum, and to be honest, they work pretty damn well, but there is ABSOLUTELY NO TRANSLATION from the hactivated settings to the user manual.  The hactivated settings essentially decimate all of the area from the analog deadzone up until the highest sensitivity area of the analog stick.<br /><br />Using the manual, I completely eliminated the deadzone, but the the mouse was unusable.<br /><br />Using Hacktivated settings and my logitech G5, I have actually improved my fragrate to 2:1 or better.  the only difference is, my mouse doesn't have on-board memory, so I can only use 800dpi and 500hz polling, vs the reccomended 900dpi and 125hz polling.<br /><br />I will use my logitech g9 instead, and it will probably be even better.<br /><br />NOW, the verdict...<br /><br />I WILL recommend this product... BUT be prepared for possibly experiencing extreme frustration.  If you don't have settings similar to the hackivated settings from the forum for the game you want to play, you will be utterly dissapointed.
0786955716|1.0|This set was the worst of the 3 that I purchased (dungeon, wilderness, city).  There are very few tiles in this set that I found useful and many were of a sewer system.  The dungeon and wilderness had much more useful tiles but...  This is my opinion on all 3 sets:  These sets looked like they would be good accessories for playing D&D but turned out to be too limited in the tile selections you get.  It is very hard to create a usable encounter map and the tiles move around too easily causing constant game interuptions (have to frequently reposition the tiles and miniatures anytime movement/action happens).  The sets were fun to look at and imagine what you could do with it but when I tried to actually use them I had inadiquate pieces available to complete my maps.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|The Shining is probably my favorite film of all time. Without question my favorite horror film ever. The picture quality is about as great as you can expect from an old film like this. The bluray has some interesting special features that are worth checking out as well. I have not read the book(planning to soon). So i cant comment on the \\"the movie disgraced the book\\" arguement that you hear alot. As a horror film, its one of the most pulse pounding experiences ever. You know what is going to happen, but as Jack's gradual mental breakdown is terrying to watch. A great performance by Jach Nicholson, a great performance by the child, and the wife as well.

B000H6H81Q|4.0|the mammoth came and it is very cool. it is robust, seems durable, and a great addition to the collection. my only objection is the plastic that the Schleich company uses as it seems almost translucent to the appearance and the details are not at crisp as the Safari Carnegie Collection offerings. this is a great item, but i think the Safari Wooly Mammoth has the edge.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|very good app! I can hardly get my phone back from my kids after installing it! definetly a 5*! i would definetly recommend !
B000026258|5.0|A number of years ago I discovered this piece as a listener of rock and electronic music. For the longest time there was no other classical music that interested me - this was the classical music I listened to before I listened to classical music. It is a timeless work, powerful and evocative in its harmonic simplicity and hypnotic in its rhythmic drive.  Though I have heard a couple other recordings including the Nonesuch and recent Grand Valley State, this ECM recording remains my favorite. The sound is only marginally inferior to the more recent recordings but the ensemble strikes me as superior and the tempo more fitting. Of course the caveat to this recording is that the entire work is contained on one track. This could be problematic for listening on CD players, but on MP3 I find it preferable.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I like the evermore app on my kindle but I have had issues sharing on facebook. I have to go to the web or my ipod to share. annoying.
1449389627|5.0|This book is both boot camp and body armor for anyone who is ready to shake up their world.  Scott does a great job of laying out, in his trademark clarity, what innovation is and is not, and how to power past naysayers and barriers if you have the will to do so.<br /><br />I don't think this is intended to be a feel-good book; Scott never shies away from straight talk about the hard work required of innovators.  However, something about Scott's writing always gets me fired up and makes me want to immediately get started on something big.  That kind of inspiration and empowerment is priceless.

B00004TWZF|5.0|This is one of the lesser known gems from Luc Besson, but not due to any lack of quality or beauty. Luc Besson collaborates again with Jean Reno (The Professional/Leon, La Femme Nikita) and Eric Cerra. Their teamwork creates a masterpiece of beauty, sound and character. I saw this in it's original French form, which was much more appealing and less grating than the English version. IF you liked The Professional, Nikita or The Fifth Element then...tune in for a treat!

B006MHWXMS|1.0|I was using this app daily. It's a useful app &amp; I got it as the FAOTD, so it was a good bargain. However, and a big WARNING to all those who use this app, after downloading today's update, upon installation it warns that it must uninstall the previous version first. I was foolish enough to accept and lost all my data; everything. If you choose to use this app, be sure you have synced with google tasks before updating.  For me, I will be switching to another app/developer. Maybe &quot;MyLifeOrganized&quot; will be the ticket.
B006W5JF9Y|5.0|The best part of this album, besides the fact that you get 76 good songs for $20.00, is that $12.00 goes directly to Amnesty International charity. You can take care of your charity donation and 5 hours worth of music in one swoop!  Also, I'd check out their fair trade items too, it is really good quality items that are hand made in regions that are desperate for help!  I love you Amnesty and all that you do!  Happy Anniversary and here's to many more!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't really expecting much from The Hunger Games,not even when I downloaded it onto my Kindle.I only did so cause I'd heard so many rave reviews about it~and cos I'm just a nerd for all things fantasy,I gave it a shot.  Wow,just wow.I was so blown away by all the characters that the ending came almost too soon.Just in case you have no clue what I'm talking about,the basic premise of The Hunger Games is this:It's set in America,but not just any old America.It's a futuristic version known as Panem,which is split into 12 different districts.Every year,a boy and girl tribute from every district are randomly selected by lottery to compete in The Hunger Games,where they will fight to survive in one arena.The rule is simple:kill or be killed.  What really struck me about this book was the way Collins potrayed reality TV and the audience's reaction to this sort of entertainment:just how far would we go to watch someone else suffer in the hands of the public?  Katniss Everdeen, our fiesty heroine and the book's narrator,is only in the Games after she volunteered to be District 12's female tribute to save her 12 year old sister Prim.Along as the boy tribute for District 12 is Peeta Mellark,who has had a crush on Katniss since they were kidsand who once gave her bread from his family's bakery when her family was starving,something Katniss has never forgotten.In fact,this was the part of the book that interested me the most:In order to please the public,Katniss and Peeta must pretend to be &#34;star~cross'd lovers&#34;.  I really enjoyed the book and feel that there was need for the violence in the arena scenes.It kept in touch with the grittiness of the plot,where unexpected surprises were thrown at us left,right and centre.I really liked the part were Katniss joins forces with Rue,a District 11 girl who reminds Katniss of Prim and what she has left behind at home.But without giving too much away,I hated what happened to Rue so much.She, along with Peeta, was one of my fave characters and I cried reading her part.  My verdict:I'd totally recommend The Hunger Games for anyone from 12+.It might not change your life but it will change your attitude to reality television forever.Bring on Catching Fire!!!!!

B004EPYZSU|1.0|I usually only contribute a review when I have some thing positive to say, but not this time. Wow...where to begin?! With all of the talent associated with this movie (both behind and in front of the camera) I naturally expected a thoroughly enjoyable and watchable film. I wasn't looking for a masterpiece...just a solid entertaining couple of hours. But I guess even the best of Hollywood can produce a dud every once in a while and that, unfortunately, is definitely the case here. It sure starts out with an intriguing premise...cowboys and aliens, for crying out loud! I mean, how can you beat that...right? However, about the only thing I can say I remotely enjoyed was the musical score. I won't try to describe the plot...there are already many fine reviews that have done that. Just want to add my advice to the prospective viewer and DVD buyer...walk away from this turkey...VERY far away.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|many people told me to read this, I'm very glad that I did. Keeps you on edge and keeps you wanting more.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|The departure of a very charismatic and unique singer is always traumatic and most bands do not fully recover (ex. Sepultura, Anthrax, Helloween and so many others). And so it seemed to happen with Nightwish when Dark Passion Play, the first album with new singer Anette Olzen. It was not bad per se, but besides not having many remarkable moments, the songs were composed before Anette entered the band and favored the more operistic voice of late singer Tarja. Also, the live stuff showed that Annette suffered on the older songs and lacked the same stage presence that Tarja had, which was one key aspect of Nightwish.  However, Imaginaerum turns the tide enormously. It is to Dark Passion Play what Once was to Century Child, a HUGE step forward. First of all, the songs have a cohesion, a common theme and unity while being quite different among themselves. Secondly and most important, they were designed to favor Annette's more interpretative, acting and somewhat pop singer voice while still being 100% Nightwish. And finally, Tuomas was quite inspired, and while my favourite Nightish songs come from Once, Imaginaerum would be the ideal album for them to play from start to finish one day.  Hard to single out some songs, but my favorites are I Want My Tears Back (which is kind of a Wish I Had An Angel with folksy keyboards) and Scaretale (a dark, progressive-aggressive song with lots of variations and an outstanding interpretation from Annette). But it also has a great opener in Storytime, a more classical piece in Ghost River (whose finale remembers Ghost Love Score), the instrumental and intricate Arabesque, the emotive Turn Loose The Mermaids, the great ballad The Crow, The Owl and The Dove (would be a radio hit anytime...), the fast paced Last Ride Of The Day and the instrumental title track that somehow sums up the whole album.  It does not mean that Tarja's absence is not felt, specially live on stage and more so on the older songs. However, it's awesome that Nightwishmanaged to overcome it and create a great album and one that enables Annette to shine. Let's hope this is not a one time shot and that Annette finds a way to sing the older stuff better (as well as a less timid stage presence).
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Really enjoyed this storyline and the idea of arenas being fought between teens and in different outdoor settings..The book was captivating and I just could not put it down, reading it through the night, the next morning quickly downloading the second book. I really hope the movie will live up to this!!!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I love this documentary. To put it simply its due to the quality of the cinematography. The BBC just does documentaries like American's should. This high def documentary has some quality shots, and keeps the viewer interested the entire way through. Each CD was awesome with tons of footage and LOTS of time. Each episode is pretty much an hour long, and each CD has multiple episodes. I would definitely recommend this documentary along with Wild China and Planet Earth...and when it ships Frozen Planet.<br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and will for a long time to come.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I thought the first book was rivetting but this was even more so..I was glued, catatonic, the housework abandoned...I don't like expounding on the storyline as I don't like giving anything away, all I can do is either give my stamp of approval or not..and this gets thumbs up!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I neeeded something that I could use to help me stay focused so I could study the word.  This app is doing just that!
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Well this was a darker and heavier book due to much pain, sorrow and evil. It was not out of place, wasn't expecting a fairytale ending, so I can't complain and I was reasonably happy with the conclusion and outcome regarding Katniss. Phew, I can relax now..that was heavy going but so awesome..
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I highly recommend this cover for kindle fire (it will also fit a nook). The cover is a supple, vibrant red that feels good to hold. I didn't have any problems with the cover closing completely that I read in other reviews. I have gotten numerous compliments on this cover as it is just that eye catching (in a good way). It also allows me to stand the fire in either the portrait or landscape positions which is quite handy. The elastic bands that secure the fire seem sturdy enough and I don't foresee any problems with them snapping or breaking. Very happy about this purchase!

B005MW7C70|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD. I even made a copy to keep in my car. I discovered it while checking out covers of Melody Gardot's \\"Your Heart is as Black as Night\\".  Beth Hart knocked my socks off, and I knew Joe was good already.  I am hoping these two get together again!  I am now looking for everything Beth Hart has done. Every track on this CD is great!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very useful. Different versions, notes, bookmarks, and you can instantly go to any part of it with just a touch!!

B00007E7K0|5.0|Yep, it's a Canon lens cap all right.  Not much to review really, except that it came quickly and was packed well and was exactly what I wanted.  And of course, that I found the original \\"lost\\" lens cap in a matter of days after getting this one.  That's okay - now I have a spare.
B000B8QF14|5.0|I was ecstatic when it came in the mail, I quickly had to play the DVD on our newest large 68in. flat screen TV. I put the DVD in but it refused to play the Dvd and said something about it not being available in your country. I was very confused, I bought it and its legit, but it didn't play. I went to my bedroom and tried that DVD player, and it said that playback was prohibited. I love Bullet in a Bible, the DVD and I really want to know why this is happening.

B00007E7K0|5.0|Like everyone else, I lost my lens cap, but it was for a 18-55mm, not a 58mm.  I searched Amazon for a replacement cap for the 18-55mm lens and couldn't find a suitable one.  Then I read the reviews here and found one reference to this one fitting my lens, so I ordered it, figuring there wouldn't be much lost if it didn't fit.  NOTE: the lens DOES fit, no problem, and is as advertised with \\"Canon\\" on the front.

B0063IH60K|5.0|What can I say - it's solitaire.  A perfect game to play when one needs a small break during a hectic time.  Everyone already knows the rules, it's simple, no surprises.  Unlike losing to angry birds while riding on the public transit system no one will be wondering why your face is frowning because this version of solitaire has the option of the player being dealt a game with a winning solution.
0691143692|3.0|This book is comprised of 28 short chapters on a wide range of different aspects of Byzantium, such as the Ravenna Mosaics, Greek Orthodoxy, Iconoclasm, and so on. This format did not work for me. I think the idea was to give the reader a grasp of the multifaceted nature of the Byzantine empire, but I felt I was getting the tourist's view - \\"Oh look, there's an icon\\" \\"Look, there's a mosaic.\\" This is likely just a matter of my preferences. I prefer social and economic history that develops a coherent and sustained thesis, or at least a traditional chronological political and military history, so that I feel I am getting some kind of big picture. I have to admit I only got half-way through before I put it down, but I only got that far because I picked it up in an airport and it was the only book I had on the plane.

B0002B15XI|5.0|MASH, also known as M*A*S*H, is perhaps better known as a long running TV series, but there was an award winning movie which came first. Featuring many of the same characters, MASH is about a crew of doctors and nurses at an army hospital near the front lines. While supposedly set in Korea, this was made in 1970 and is fairly clearly pointed at the Vietnam war. It shows just how pointless war can be, how people live and die almost by chance, and how the characters struggle to keep their sanity amongst it all.<br /><br />It's not a \\"story\\" as much as almost a reality show, and apparently portions of the dialogue were ad-libbed as the actors got into their characters. You see how relationships and loyalties get tested, how playing golf on a helicopter landing pad seems to make perfect sense, and how the doctors try their best to save their young friend from going into the army. If you watched the TV series it can be hard, sometimes, to separate how the characters were in the TV series with how they are here - there are numerous differences.<br /><br />There are all sorts of subtle items in here. For example, in one scene the actors pose in an exact replica of The Last Supper.<br /><br />Well worth watching to get a sense of what people thought about the Vietnam War in the 70s, and just to immerse yourself in absurdity for a while. MASH helps to illustrate that even amongst death and carnage, people tend to go on with life as best they can, finding love, joy, and moments of peace.<br /><br />In terms of the Bechdel test, MASH passes - barely. An opening scene has a table of nurses all talking with each other, and two of them end up being minor characters with names. They are talking about nursing activity. However, that is really it. Through the rest of the movie there are really only three female characters. One is a blonde who sleeps with the commanding officer, one is a feistier nurse that ends up \\"saving\\" the Dentist by sleeping with him, and then one is the infamous Hot Lips who falls for Major Burns. So we do have three females - but they really don't talk with each other at all after that opening scene. They are just there to be slept with by the guys.us Hot Lips who falls for Major Burns. So we do have three females - but they really don't talk with each other at all after that opening scene. They are just there to be slept with by the guys.

0634049011|5.0|OK, once you've gotten your \\"cowboy chords\\" and barre chords down, and have a little bit of being able to play songs under your belt, it's time to take it to the next level. With this book, you'll learn the fretboard---EASILY---and will be ready to propel your playing even further along.<br /><br />Barrett Tagliarano is one of my very favorite teachers and authors (Jon Finn is my other, along with Troy Stetina and Andy Aldeort) because he knows how to \\"get real\\", which is exactly what he does here. You will figure out how to look at the guitar, how to learn the fretboard, and how to get from place to place more easily. As well, you'll start to \\"figure out\\" the patterns on the guitar that put everything together. There are \\"secrets\\" that most players have to learn via trial and error over years of playing and study, but Barrett helps you figure 'em out relatively easily. If you follow his method, and truly STUDY and LEARN what he tells you in this book, in its series of graded lessons, you'll be a much more rounded and deft guitarist. Learning this book will get you in the \\"mode\\" for deeper guitar playing and would propel you to the \\"late beginning intermediate\\" stage....<br /><br />So, if you're ready, and you're needing that next \\"push\\", then don't hesitate---<br />Barrett's a genius teacher, and makes you WANT to keep coming back. Get this book, and work through it---you'll be glad you did!

Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I got a real good deal on this package through Amazon.com, so I can't complain too much.<br /><br />The video quality of the first five Rocky movies is not very good.  Some of the worst grain I have seen on Blu-Ray.  The 6th movie, Rocky Balboa, had better video quality (not great, but good), but instead of having DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio like the first 5 movies, it only had Dobly Digital 5.1.  It isn't a major complaint, since there is some great sounding DD 5.1 soundtracks, but it was surprising.

I did however still love the album it sounds great but come on RCA make it not look so ghetto.   ps. I am a huge Christina Aguilera Fan, I simply love her music. own all her others the resason for re buying this album is it got stolen out of my car.

B005DBFZQU|5.0|In my youth (a long time ago) while studying to play on the piano some of the compositions (i.e., the Papillons and the Sonata in F minor) on this wonderful recording that features the sublime piano artistry of Andras Schiff, I fell \\"under the spell\\" of Schumann's music.  Although, I was never able (due to a severe lack of talent) to play Schumann's music very well, I have listened to and loved his music since those days of yore.  In this ECM label two (2) disc recording of the works named above plus  Robert's \\"Kinderszen\\" Opus 15, \\"Fantasie\\", Opus 17,\\" Waldszenen\\", Opus 82 and the great \\"Geistervariationen\\" (theme and Variations) containing the well known \\"Traumeri\\" at mid-point, Andras Schiff plays most sensitively, rhythmically, romantically  and most beautifully.   I fell in love, once again,  with the beautiful compositions contained in this exquisite recording by Andras.  As I expected, the recorded sound is wonderful--as if the piano was in my abode.

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|This series was incredible from beginning to end.  This book is not stand alone, though.  So, read the first two in the series before you read this one.  I had not realized that the last book had been released yet, but once I saw it, even though it was close to 9pm, I couldn't stop myself from purchasing it and starting it.  I read to the point of exhaustion, then woke up and immediately reached for my kindle again.  These characters, I simply cannot get enough of them.  The story was great.  It wasn't enough, but I think a book the size of Texas wouldn't be enough.  The best surprise was at the end of the book.  The bonus material.  It was like I didn't really have to let go... not yet.  Their meeting from Christian's perspective was so interesting.  I would love to know this whole story from his point of view.  I hope the author agrees and decides to write something like that.

B00479SVBU|4.0|Once I figured out how the Soundfly works, it functioned well.  The instructions that came with it are not accurate. However, there is demo on YOUTUBE that does a good job of taking you through the functionality of the Soundfly.  You can program in several FM frequencies to select from.  The sound quality is good for a FM transmitter of this type but not CD or even FM radio quality. The remote that came with it is very useful for selecting a FM frequency, a MP3 folder or MP3 file.  I am using a 8Gb USB stick with the Soundfly.  The Soundfly shows you what is playing on its display and also broadcasts the information to your radio to be displayed for viewing. One thing that is a bit annoying is that once the unit is powered off, it always restarts at the beginning of your files on your memory device, instead of remembering where you left off playing a song, i.e. it always starts on the same song after it has been powered off and then powered on again.
B005UKJX4E|3.0|Most of the reviews for Tree of Life are either 5 stars or 1 star -- it's a movie you'll either love or hate.  Unless you're me, because I can't decide.  This is either a masterpiece, the best piece of visual media of our generation to explore issues of Nature vs. Grace (basically selfishness vs. selflessness, though I'd use different terms), fathers vs. sons, life vs. death, and the nature (or the existence) of God...  or the emperor has no clothes.  There's much to see here.  On the surface, the movie is beautifully shot, and its editing challenges your thoughts.  The score is great; the acting is super.  But then again, there are so many things that get in the way.  Supernovae? Dinosaurs? Jellyfish?  Really?  Do we need to see 25 minutes of CG scenes to remember how the universe came into being?  And there's all the whispering.  Many of the characters do it in voice over, effectively praying.  But it's so distracting and difficult to hear, it clouds the message that's supposed to be communicated.  I feel like I should have been moved more, or made to think more.  But maybe, just because I felt compelled to write this review, I have been.  Perhaps a re-viewing, or a shot-by-shot analysis, would lead me toward one camp or another, but for now I'll sit on the fence.  All that said, if you're the type of person who enjoys (or at least can endure) largely plot-less, art piece movies, then you should see it.  (With closed captioning on....)  Decide which side you belong on for yourself.

B00005JKLZ|3.0|In 1960, the concept of producing a movie following the story of H.G. Well's Time Machine was a good one. And in that era the movie was a stand out.<br /><br />However, what this 2002 remake has to compete with are all the great sci-fi and futuristic dramas that have been produced since that time like the Star War series, Blade Runner, The Fifth Dimension, Star Trek the movies and television series, and many more. Quite frankly this film does not measure up. The devise, a time machine, simply provides a reason for futuristic travel. Most other futuristic movies do not need a time machine. The adventure 800,000 years into the future provides the viewer with little more than seen in \\"Escape from New York\\". And many other recently produced movies come to mind when I view \\"The Time Machine\\".<br /><br />The film moves quickly and is entertaining on that count but it could be said that it moves too quickly to supply drama. So if one likes drama, it is not here.

B002RKSZN0|2.0|I first read Mansfield Park as a lit major in the 1970s and hated it. How could anyone who loved Miss Jane's Elizabeth Bennett or Emma Woodhouse find anything to like in dull and virtuous Fanny Price? Recently I saw the book on a Top Ten list by another writer and thought I'd give it another go. Alas, I found the novel just as dreary the second time around, but because I've written nine novels of my own in the meantime, this time I think I know why Mansfield Park is such an outlier. Austen wrote her first three novels -- Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Northanger Abbey -- between the ages of 20 and 24. She wrote her last three novels -- Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion -- between the ages of 39 and 41. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Miss Jane was starting her writing career over with Mansfield Park, and viewed through that prism -- as a first novel -- I realized that many of the novels failings are classic first-novel problems. Fanny's character is so good that she's a bad character for a novel -- we want some human failings in those fictional characters we give our hearts to -- at least one! -- but Fanny has none, which makes her very hard to like. The male character we're supposed to like -- Edmund, her only nice cousin -- is similarly good but dumb enough to overlook Fanny and prefer the racy Mary Crawford until the revelation of her true worldliness, all of which makes him a prig. Failing to offer a likeable character early on is a failing of many first-novel. Plotwise, Mansfield Park has two big problems. The first is the fact that for long stretches, Austen simply tells us what's going on, failing to show us the unfolding scenes so that we can \\"see\\" the story. In addition to telling the story rather than showing the story, Austen takes much too long to set things up -- the back story of Fanny's mother and her sisters and Fanny's early years at Mansfield Park, the introduction of the key secondary characters as they arrive in the neighborhood, and the interminable back-and-forth over staging a play. Everything in the novel that precedes the return of Sir Thomas from Antigua is set-up and it takes too damn long -- another first novel failing.

0525425578|2.0|I have read the first book (Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer) and did find it interesting.  The second book is just as interesting.  Not the best, but I was able to get through it just fine.  There were dull parts and I certainly do not think that juviniles would read this.  At first I thought this was the first book given that in the first few pages of Kid Lawyer, April's parents are divorcing.  Unless I forgot that they got back together, this is very inconsistent with The Abduction.  Several things are the same- Theodore still has braces, same teachers, same class mates.  Though it seems as though Theodore is the same age, same grade, in the first book boys were not into girls at 13 and none (stated obviously in the first few chapters) then in the next, the boys are just starting to notice girls and have girlfriends (Theodore and April are still 13, but in eight grade and girlfriends started to happed in seventh grade the book said).  Most of it is little things (with the exception of April's parents divorcing), but they bother me.

B005OK81HA|5.0|Between the newly released 3D concert blu-ray and this new compilation record, it's great to see the Scorpions providing a plethora of high-quality content during their farewell tour. Sting in the Tail was a fantastic final record with a great blend of hard-hitting tracks and powerful ballads. It appeared the Scorpions were done there, but a final trip to the studio has given the fans an added treat.  Comeblack is essentially the encore to Sting in the Tail, and while it lacks original tracks, the new takes on classic tracks are killer. The re-recorded Scorpions tracks are original enough to warrant a listen thanks to incredible production values. Meine's vocals are absolutely stunning and the instrumentals follow suit with Kottak's brutal drums and expert guitar work from Schenker, Jabs, and Maciwoda. In regards to the covers of songs from other bands, some may be turned off by inclusions like Ruby Tuesday and Tainted Love, but I fully support their tributes to the songs that influenced them. It's really cool to see a hard rock band like the Scorpions covering Beatles and Rolling Stones songs, not to mention that the tracks all fitting covers that do justice to the source material.  In what is likely to be the last Scorpions release, Comeblack is a fantastic send-off for the Scorpions' phenomenal 40+ year career.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|The spies in Tomas Alfredson's artfully crafted adaptation of John Le Carre's 1974 novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy toil away in mundane offices. Most of what they type and read is a mystery. When suspicions of a mole arise, former spy George Smiley is called in as suddenly as he was forced to retire. Throughout the film, one wonders not only about the mole's identity but about where these spies' work begins and their emotional lives end.  Though hours shorter than the 1979 BBC adaptation, this version takes its time. The movie, like the book, often forces the audience to read between the lines. Its color scheme is as bleak as the story's Cold War setting, and the camera almost nostalgically observes the drudgery of sorting through physical files and writing with pen and paper. The soundtrack and slower pacing mimic movies of the 1970s, but the cinematography and editing are simultaneously inventive and retro.  This very believable world is peopled with chilly characters, played by an excellent array of familiar actors. Each is tinged with suspicion and a hint (or more) of amorality. Beneath even the more demonstrative personalities lie opaque motivations. John Hurt plays the paranoid and cantankerous Control, head of the Circus (the ring of top spies). Toby Jones does well as Percy Alleline, an ambitious spy who gets in a power struggle with Control. Toby Esterhase, a Hungarian working for England, is played convincingly by David Dencik, and Colin Firth perfectly fits the charming Roy Bland.  Mark Strong's portrayal of a haunted \\"Scalphunter\\" is especially poignant, as is Tom Hardy's disturbed Ricky Tarr. Also memorable are Simon McBurney as the bureaucratic but shrewd British undersecretary and Benedict Cumberbatch, touching as Smiley's young assistant Peter Guillam. Gary Oldman plays our unlikely hero, Smiley. For the first half of the film, he hardly says anything. His dull and humble appearance is impossible to read. But his low voice contains a glimmer of cunning. Gradually Smiley's skills of perception and methodical tactics show results. While unassuming and vulnerable, Smiley is also unnaturally calm, and aware of when to use either sympathy or implacability to get the intelligence he needs.  A few common phrases (such as \\"bad apple,\\" and \\"trust no one\\") pepper the script, but clichés are extremely rare. Don't expect these characters to explain why they sacrifice their relationships and moral codes for a tedious job that is both dangerous and thankless. Some likely appreciate the sordid fruits of their labor; others might relish the gathering of information. The older ones hang onto past glories of World War II. Some may not know.  The plot jumps between characters and time periods. It is not always clear who is looking for what and why. Yet this confusion adds to the complexity that makes up the world of spies and secrets. The story is confusing, but the sense of alienation that lurks behind the Circus's jokes and jaunty boys' club mentality is all too certain.

B00004XPPC|5.0|This, to me, is the quintessential engineer movie.  Set in WWII, a British Engineer Battalion is forced to build a bridge for the Japanese over the River Kwai.  Top  notch acting, and pretty accurate, from what I can tell.  It's the story about the British commander, getting so caught up in the design and construction of it that he forgets he is doing all of this for the enemy.  I don't want to spoil it, but the ending scene is very poignant moment, and can probably be only understood by a true engineer.  In his success he realizes he has \\"failed.\\"  I can fully sympathize with him on a very deep level, because for real engineers it's never about the purpose or the intent or the money, the reward is in the challenge of the task and the solving of the problem.

0691143692|4.0|I like the way Herrin eschewed the likely tedium of a chronological treatment of Byzantium's history and, instead, highlighted diverse Byzantine socio-cultural motifs that, when considered as a whole, form an admirably panoramic warp and weft. Prof. Herrin's writing style is appropriately studious without being inaccessible to the non-student, I would imagine. Most pleasantly, I did not detect any of the subtle disdain for the Orthodox church that mars some other contemporary works on the broader aspect of Byzantine study. I subtract a star because a work of this unique structure, scope, and ambition truly ought to have featured copious footnotes/endnotes. The index is also less than comprehensive; believe me. Otherwise, a superb bibliography and several other bonuses (e.g. a fresh, well-constructed Chronology) do much to neutralize my quibbles. Herrin's book is a valuable addition to the library of any student of Byzantium. For me, however, Holum's groundbreaking \\"Theodosian Empresses\\" still remains the benchmark, at least for understanding the raw-yet-complicated foundational dynamic that made this extraordinary empire possible at all.
0439023483|2.0|The Hunger Games trilogy kept me reading, but was ultimately unsatisfying.  Why is it that teens under such duress never swear? Teens with hormones in overdrive never do more than chaste kisses, the heroine never has a committed emotion to anyone, the duopoly of simpering suitors follow her around as if she's some goddess incarnated/  Then there's the butchery.  So it's the same old thing: gratuitous violence is OK, but sex, swearing is not acceptable in middle America? Undoubtedly the film(s) will be as equally demoralising. Then the last book had this never ending computer game feel to it of the \\"heroes\\" cutting a swathe through endless idiotic levels of opposition. If you feel like letting your kids have nightmares, give them this series: children being butchered and tortured endlessly, the style of modern day literature. What happened to great stories with substance?

B00631VJLE|5.0|Lacuna Coil truly made an album worth the anticipation.  I became a fan when I first heard \\"Swamped\\" in 2005 and have enjoyed all of their releases up until their previous effort, Shallow Life.  While that was a decent yet lackluster album, it does not compare to any of their previous releases in my opinion.  However, with Dark Adrenaline, Lacuna Coil decided to bring back that atmosphere to their music that was missing from their previous album.  Here is my review of the tracks:  1. Trip The Darkness 9/10 - At first I was a little skeptical of this song.  I first thought it was ok but I have begun to like it more with each listen.  I had to take off my original 3 star review of the single.  This brings back the unique gothic sound that was sorely missing on the majority of their predecessor.  It starts off with gothic tones then swings into crunchy guitars and thumping drumbeats in the introduction.  Andrea's verses are really good and you can tell his singing abilities have improved even though I never minded his vocal duties in the first place. Cristina's vocals shine as well in the chorus and bridge.  Nice pick for the first single and sets the tone of the album.  2. Against You 10/10 - Starts off with some military type drums, but then it storms in with some killer riffs.  Cristina takes charge of the verses with drums at a fast paced tempo that are faster than any I can remember Criz playing before.  Andrea does well with a soaring chorus with Cristina in the distant background.  I think it's the middle of the song that makes this track one of the best on the whole album.  It's the guitar solo.  One of the best I've heard from them that makes me anticipate getting to that section when the song first starts.  3. Kill The Light 10/10 - The second song that was released.  This was definitely a surprise.  Once again brings back the gothic tones to their music.  I feel that this could have easily been on their album Comalies.  It's like a blend of \\"Daylight Dancer\\"and \\"Self Deception\\".  Cristina's verses are haunting and Andrea's singing is some of the best I've heard.  Cristina bursts out in some of her signature chanting in the background in later chorus.  This is a standout track that's for sure.  4. Give Me Something More 8/10 - One of the most accessible songs on the album.  I feel as if I had an Unleashed Memories flashback when I hear the intro to this song with Cristina's radiant chanting melodies.  The main guitar riffs have the feel of something off Unleashed Memories or the likes of \\"The Prophet Said\\" from Comalies but once the song starts to pick up it's tempo it feels like something completely new.  The chorus may feel a bit repetitive but not a bad repetitive like \\"Underdog\\" or \\"The Pain\\" from their previous album.  Instead it's an extremely catchy repetitive.  5. Upside Down 10/10 - I was blown away by this track.  One of the heaviest songs on the album and definitely takes me back to the days of Karmacode.  Think of the dark goth nu-metal heaviness of \\"Fragile\\" or \\"To The Edge\\".  This song may seem pretty short but it actually works out very well.  The song starts off with a bang and continues to maintain its momentum throughout.  The thrashy guitar solo is one of their best.  The chorus is one that will be in your head because of Cristina's powerful range and the rage in her voice.  6. The End of Time 9/10 - The album finally comes in with it's first softer track.  Not that it's incredibly soft but it's mellower compared to the previous tracks.  This captures the haunting melodies of their past records In A Reverie and their first EP.  I feel this in some ways is reminiscent of \\"Cold\\" or \\"This Is My Dream\\".  There is an effect on Cristina's vocals that make the song feel more somber.  The melodies to the song itself make up for that.  7. I Don't Believe In Tomorrow 10/10 - This will take you back to the heavy downtuned riffs and heavy bass of Karmacode.  The intro gives an eerie vibe and once the guitars andthrashy drums come in the momentum just doesn't let up.  Cristina's verses are incredible and the chorus is loud and packs a punch.  The bridge is the true standout point on this track when it shifts tempos into Cristina's fierce whispered chants in the background.  8. Intoxicated 10/10 - This is a song that sounds like nothing they've done in the past.  This starts out with an eerie intro just like the previous track then comes in Cristina with \\"LIE!\\".  I don't think I've ever heard this kind of tone in Cristina's voice before.  You can definitely sense passion that is darker and angrier in her vocals that takes it to a new height.  9. The Army Inside 7/10 - When I first heard this song it sounded like a rehash of their single \\"Spellbound\\" from Shallow Life.  The only difference is that Cristina and Andrea's vocal duties are flip-flopped.  Cristina takes her part in the verses and Andrea in the chorus.  Heck even the guitar solo reminds me of \\"Spellbound\\".  However, this has grown on me and I think it may even be better than the track I compared it to.  Great track to listen to even if it isn't as good as the previous songs.  10. Losing My Religion 5/10 - I think everyone knew once they seen the title that this was going to be an REM cover.  I like covers but this is average.  The original is classic but I've heard it way too many times and continue to hear it a lot on the radio today.  I'd much rather prefer they included an original song composed by them and this be a bonus track.  They included \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" as a main track on Karmacode.  Even though I listen to that song the least on that album, I felt that \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" more superior than this.  It's not a bad song.  I just tend to skip it.  11. Fire 7/10 - When I first heard this song I felt it was kind of like a throwaway from Shallow Life thinking it was too repetitive along with the likes of  \\"I Like It\\", \\"Underdog\\", and \\"The Pain\\" and way too plain.  However, this song really caught on.  Themain riff is catchy and, like \\"Give Me Something More\\", the repetitive chorus is very accessible and an easy one to remember.  12. My Spirit 10/10 - For those who enjoyed the more progressive gothic metal approach of their music before Comalies then this is your song.  This epic brings forth the melodies of In A Reverie and packs in the ambiance of Unleashed Memories.  The song is very haunting and gives me the chills.  The song opens with the dark atmosphere of the earlier work and continues into eerie verses sung by Andrea.  Cristina makes her entrance in the very moving chorus.  The guitar solo is an excellent way to close the song.  This masterpiece may actually be the best finale out of any of their albums.  Overall, this album was sure worth the wait.  Is it their best album?  That is a really difficult question to answer because I feel that Karmacode and Comalies are amazing from start to finish but this comes close.  The lyrics also show a little more depth than those of Shallow Life.  Also, one will notice while listening to these tracks that Andrea plays an even bigger role than he has before.  It is more 50/50 with Cristina and Andrea.  I know there are some people who don't care much for his voice but I always thought it was one of the unique qualities of Lacuna Coil that got me into them in the first place.  Give this album a listen and you'll notice his vocals are the best they've ever been.  Cristina's...well No Need To Explain.  They are captivating as always.  For those of you who kind of strayed away from them after Shallow Life or even Karmacode then give this album a shot.  In fact, this may actually be the best and most accessible album as an introduction for those who have not heard their previous work.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|I would recommend not purchasing this item and waiting.  Chances are George Lucas might realize that a good amount of his fans appreciate the changes that he makes, but would rather see the movies the way they were originally.  After reading reviews that talk about disappointing sound changes that were made to certain scenes or visual effects that have been altered to the point of becoming a distraction.  I'll just wait until George Lucas releases an ultimate edition that includes the original theater version, and all the altered re-released versions since then.  We might have to wait awhile longer until after the new versions of 2020, 2024, and 2029.  Hopefully by then we'll have the holographic room version that will fully immerse the viewer - by then I'll have forgiven that they ruined the Han Solo/Greedo scene and the great flow of the movies with so many new add-on's.

B004UXUUDA|3.0|A 2010 French drama \\"Sarah's Key\\" (\\"Elle s'appelait Sarah\\") has two stories to tell, one about a 10-year-old Sarah Starzynski (Mélusine Mayance), who hides her younger brother Michel in a secret closet on 16 July, 1942, when Paris police arrested the Jewish population at the orders of the Nazis. Before they are transported by the police, Sarah locks the door, not knowing that she may not be able to come back here again.  The other story, set in 2009, is about an American journalist Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas), who, after inheriting the apartment Sarah lived in (the fact Julia does not know), starts investigating the truths about the events that happened about 67 years ago.  Based on Tatiana De Rosnay's book of the same title (which I haven't read), \\"Sarah's Key\\" employs a double narrative in which the story goes back and forth in time, and like most double narrative structure, one half of the film is less interesting than the other. I don't think we need the story of Julia, a character we really don't care, despite Kristin Scott Thomas's fine acting for which she was nominated for César.  The real star, or I should say heroine, of the film is Mélusine Mayance playing young Sarah, who has to go through grueling hardships to keep her promise with her little brother. Unfortunately she exits the story a bit too early, and the film slowly loses momentum after that. Why didn't filmmakers focus one story instead of two when they should have known that the film is \\"Sarah's Key,\\" not \\"Julia's\\"?  Those who want to know more about \\"Vel' d'Hiv Roundup\\" may be interested in a 2010 French film \\"The Round Up\\" (\\" La Rafle\\") starring Gad Elmaleh, Mélanie Laurent and Jean Reno.

B004EPZ00C|3.0|Johnny English, Britain's (or perhaps the world's) most incompetent spy comes back in \\"Johnny English Reborn,\\" a sequel slightly better than the original made in 2003. This time the sequel has more action and on-location scenes (partly in Hong Kong and France), but its jokes largely remain the same - well-executed and sporadically funny, but predictable and nothing original.  \\"Johnny English Reborn\\" opens with Rowan Atkinson's bumbling MI7 agent training and mediating at the Tibetan monastery, who was dismissed from the organization because of the fiasco in Mozambique. However, the disgraced agent is called back to mission again by the agency in order to stop the plot to assassinate the Premier of China. Gillian Anderson plays Pamela Thornton, his immediate superior. Rosamund Pike (\\"Die Another Day\\") is Kate Sumner, an MI7 psychoanalyst and Johnny's love interest.  \\"Johnny English Reborn\\" sends up some scenes and conventions of the spy genre including James Bond films; the golf scene reminds us of \\"Goldfinger\\" and the climactic snowmobile scene, \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\\". But the film is mainly about Rowan Atkinson's character and his physical gags, some of which are funny (like a wheelchair chase), but nothing creative and brilliant compared with his earlier works.  Supporting players include Dominic West as Simon Ambrose, a capable agent Johnny respects, and Daniel Kaluuya as Johnny's partner, but not Ben Miller, who was effectively cast as Johnny's sidekick in the original.  As a whole \\"Johnny English Reborn\\" lives up to its name as far as the action of the film goes, but its comedy leaves much to be desired.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This is the first review I have ever written!  I bought this doll for my daughter for her 2nd Christmas, when she was around 18 months old.  She is now 4 and Zoey is in very good shape.  She has received an American girl doll and a larger Corolle doll, but this 12 inch doll is still her favorite.  She goes on bike rides and plays outside all the time.  She has been left outside in the rain, and still has the same wonderful smell.  As soon as she opened the 14\\" doll for Christmas, my daughter exclaimed, \\"She smells likely Zoey!\\"  I just purchased Zoey an outfit for Valentine's Day, because the original outfit was worn out and my daughter preferred her without clothes.  I am certainly a fan for life.
B003Y5D776|5.0|I originally bought this to use with a Macbook Air since those don't have audio-in jacks, only I rarely use that system.  On a lark I plugged it into my notebook running Windows, and discovered Windows 7 detects and uses it with no special drivers or anything.  The interface in Windows for swapping input and output devices is super simple.  Now I haven't tried it in XP or Vista.  There's a review here saying this doesn't work with Vista...to be honest I'm kind of skeptical about that, as Vista and 7 are basically the same OS, and I'm unaware of any big audio subsystem changes between them.  The interface for it is even pretty much identical.  XP, I don't know, given there was a major change between how NT 5.x and 6.x handle audio, though I'd suspect it would work as I know XP does handle USB audio devices too.  Regarding audio quality-sounds fine to me. There's some hiss when you crank up the line input far, but that's true of my input jack on my notebooks too.  This seems like it might be a slightly cleaner than the built in one.  The audio out doesn't sound any better or worse, but hey, that means it works!  At any rate, this seems to work with the newest versions of Windows and OS X, works without special drivers, and is pretty simple to use, so it's probably worth checking out if you need to add a line in and/or out on your computer! :)

B005C7MVC6|1.0|I really have no clue what is so great about this and Bon Iver's previous album.  I've listened to both albums completely several times trying to find what other people are writing about, but in the end I find the music totally uninteresting.  This is of course only my opinion, but I consider myself as having very open and eclectic tastes in music, and I really don't get Bon Iver's big success.  There are so many greater albums released this past year.  From this self-titled album I only like \\"Holocene\\" and barely \\"Towers\\".

B004A8ZWWE|3.0|Real Steel was the kind of sleeper hit that's a bit refreshing in this day and age of massive blockbuster extravaganzas.  Granted that the film as a whole is a semi-cliche' mellowdrama with rock 'em sock 'em robots, but hey, there's just something about it that just makes you want to see it.  Given that, it doesn't necessarily make Real Steel anything special, and contrary to a majority of viewer's reactions to it, is actually pretty overrated.  Hugh Jackman stars as a down and out robot boxing manager that's stuck reconnecting with his estranged 11 year old son, all the while trying to climb back up the ranks of the robot boxing world.  That's pretty much it in a nut shell, with Lost vet Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, and Kevin Durand along for the ride too.  The effects are good and the film's action sequences are wonderful, but the overly predictable story and abundance of wanna-be-hipness really hurt the film.  All in all, Real Steel isn't bad, but it's nowhere near as special as many have found it to be.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever... I could play this game all day if I wanted to.cant wait until I get all of the hames
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is a story about a young woman who is totally on her own. Because she is different and doesn't fit into society's ideals she suffers greatly.  The entire series is worth reading.  Salander does what many of us wish we could, take charge of our lives.  I would recommend this book to anyone, there are some graphic scenes but they are essential to the story.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|best calendar app for my needs that I've tried so far. great visuals. easy to use. worth the price. awesome widget
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Appeals to wide age range -- 4 and up. Thanks for creating. Good graphics. Simple but stimulates thinking in kids.
B000957O82|2.0|I like Will Smith as an actor, but I'm not crazy about this movie. Ya it made me laugh a few times, but the rest of the time I was falling asleep.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I currently own more than a dozen Invicta watches. I've got Subaqua Noma IIIs, Lupahs, Ocean Ghosts and many traditional styes as well. This watch has become one of my favorites, not only for the look and build quality, but the feel is simply amazing. My Subaquas are beautiful, but I find the crown tends to dig into the back of my hand, not so with my two I Force watches, which are lefties. I worked a trade show last week for the music industry and received many compliments on my I Force 1512, which is the black version. I was also surprised to meet many show attendees who proudly wore their Invictas, too. I will continue to grow my Invicta collection. Thank you Ayal Lalo and all the fine folks at Invicta. I'm a fan for life!
B000W4KT64|1.0|I do not like this movie. I wish I would have watched it before I bought it. I thought it was going to be just like the original hairspray, but it's not. It has the same story, but it is a musical. The original Hairspray with Ricky Lake is not a musical.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a pretty good app if you bored and need something to do very easy to navigate good grapics and i lieke the fact you can change things around but my one negitive is not being able to pick how many suits you have
B0054JZC6E|4.0|awesome game fun and additive for everyone and plus it is free you have to love free games bug not really good controls
B004EPZ02A|2.0|The Irish critic Vivian Mercier said of the two-act Samuel Beckett play that in it, \\"nothing happens, twice.\\"  With the Paranormal Activity franchise we now have a trilogy in which nothing happens thrice.  I can barely forgive myself for seeing the second one after thinking of the first one that if they had spent another day and another couple hundred dollars, perhaps there could have been some actual event in the film.  And now that I've seen the third one, I just want to stab out my own eyes and shove chopsticks into my tympanic membranes to prevent myself ever again paying for this inert junk.  I understand the idea of dread gradually building up over time.  I agree that in general, this method provides a far creepier, scarier, more satisfying horror experience than does a frenetic spray of viscera and gore aimed at the screen.  But waiting through scenes of endlessly panning camera shots (the use of a oscillating fan as a camera mount was a nice touch, however) for something, anything to happen gets BORING.  And my idea of an action film is [[ASIN:B001WLMOLE My Dinner with Andre (The Criterion Collection)]], so I'm not exactly ADHD in my entertainment demands.  I think a judicious editing together of all three films into one compact, 90-minute anthology would result in a very chilling, dread-filled, satisfying movie experience.  Yes, some of the mounting dread would be short-circuited that way.  Complex fear cannot be distilled and concentrated into some quick, easy formula.  But at least in my hybrid version of the franchise, something.  Would.  Happen.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|I really had no hope for this movie, and I was wrong.  I loved it, there were some really dark parts, but I think that the innocents of the main characters really helped move this movie along.  I do not believe that the main guy would have ended up with the hot girl, but besides that it was great.  How can you not laugh at lines like: \\"You're half Hillbilly!\\" \\"They cut off his bowling fingers!\\" and \\"There is something really wrong with those kids!\\" It was a really good movie if you gave it a chance and did not think of it as strictly horror or comedy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this Bible app - I really cant find one thing it needs. There are so many options,  reading plans, and different versions - there is always something for everyone. This app is TRUE BLESSING TO US ALL.  thanks so mu h for producing this app - another testiment to Gods love!
B000I9YWDO|2.0|It is a dry movie. Really, nothing worth watching. During the movie you expect to see something hilarious, but then nothing really happens. This movie might have been hilarious in 1999, but Amazon still listing it in top favorites is not worth it. Please watch something else.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it. all the different games keep me super busy and even my little one likes to play some of them.
0847835073|4.0|Lots of nice photos from famous photographers. A satisfying record of Monica Bellucci. Definitely have been flipping through multiple times and have been noticing new/different details each time.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|I love to read and have a huge library but I purchased my Kindle because, as I have aged my eyes are not what they use to be. I was looking forward to getting this book but it is not speech enabled. I greatly appreciate Amazon saying right up front if a book is or is not speech enabled.There are to many book choices out there .Publishers should allow Amazon to turn on speech enabled. Stephen King is so busy writing that he probably did not think about it.  thanks  randy
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always loved solitaire and this app is just like the original. Lovers of solitaire will definitely be pleased. Yepn
B0063IH60K|5.0|Absolutely loved the options and being able to customize the cards' backs to personal pictures! 5 stars for a free app!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Great way to consume google reader on the kindle fire.  I enjoy being able to swipe from page to page with the articles large and easy to read.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I think its a 4- star because especially if u r using a touch screen. it doesn't help kids with violence so I believe its a four star game
0439023513|5.0|im rather new at writing a review, but this trilogy was so good that i felt i needed to write one.  *Spoilers*  This book is simply amazing, even though it wasn't quite like the other 2 books it still delivered the whole package, the only thing i would change about it if i could, was the ending, it seemed like the war between the capitol and the districts ended a bit too fast, Katniss getting knocked out and all.
