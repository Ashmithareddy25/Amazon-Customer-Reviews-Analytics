B00EZ710LW|5|Love it.<br />When I first got this, I thought the color was to bright.<br />But when I wore this at the outdoor pool, the brightness was just enough.<br />It made me look cute and sexy. I love it.
B000HL1SOY|1|came in a bag all nappy at the roots... the only match to the photo is the color.. the texture does not match! ewwwww!
B0064R42RA|5|bello
B001SN7PQA|5|I bought the T-shirt for my husband. he's a huge Jimi Hendrix fan and because of this I don't think I could have gone wrong buying him any Hendrix shirt!
B004IYIMUE|4|awesome!
B00Q8R6ZSU|4|A little small but very nice otherwise
B00F96NF3O|5|It was a gift for my husband. He was totally surprised and liked the fit and color. It was true to it's size. Light weight and prefect for the summer.
B003MD8N60|3|I'm being very generous by giving these suits a 3 star rating... They are GORGEOUS suits but COMPLETELY USELESS!!!!! The damn sizes are so far off it's impossible to order a proper size.<br /> I've had to keep these suits not willing to return them and lose so much MONEY on restocking fees and shipping both ways:(<br />The pants for each size i ordered(sizes 5,8,12) were INSANELY LONG. Each suit pant had at least 7 inches that needed to be taken up!! Even after hemmimg the suit looks goofy, because the jackets are also made with really large arm hole openings and are just off in general. I don't know of any way to fix the jackets.  It's insanely disproportionate to an actual childs body!! Trust me I've been buying childrens clothes for over a decade and yes they all vary in sizing, these suits are unfixable. If we had to do it over again we definitely WOULDN'T  buy these suits.
B00FJ53B0M|5|Love this hat but going to remove the band. It fits floppy like a hippy hat, perfect for me.
B005N516AA|4|This is the best thing to come out of Rubies Star Wars pieces ever. Strong sturdy and pretty close on accurate. It is a shame they failed on the rest of the costume with very inaccurate robes and undergarments.<br /><br />Only drawback with the helmet is that the lenses will need to be swapped out for darker tint and the helmt may need to be resprayed to match correct robe's colour.
B000HKM2N6|5|This product was OK, it is easy to apply and easy to removed. I ended up having to carry it with me so I could reapply the make up everytime I accidently touched my face. Ea
B000V6T5FE|5|Loved this. Very sexy and fit really well. I had to wear a regular bra because my boobs are a little bigger and are starting to sag. I wear a black Petticoat underneath and it is really full.
B00LBYNCUY|5|Great shirt but definitely runs a little large...as snowboarding gear should be!
B004LVOBCM|3|Nice and soft cloth. the only issue was the size does not fit to me. besides all was ok.<br />I'd like that amazon or sellers. bring more info about sizing. In other brands the Medium size fit perfectly to me.
B00ENGRP46|5|What a fun way to help in the celebration of my husband's 60th birthday!  He wore it that night at our family celebration.  Perfect!
B00MEBMUEM|1|The only thing this dress resembled in the picture was the color. Otherwise it was NOTHING like the picture. It was extremely sheer and poorly made. The strap that goes across the neckline, was like a thick piece of string that almost choked the life out of me, and you can see right through this dress even with no bra or underwear. It's not worth returning, as shipping costs more than the dress itself.  Please beware..
B003PIVN8W|4|It's a little bigger than I expected. But other than that I like it. I ordered a small and should've gotten xsmall
B009MB2DR6|4|I do not think that this dress is too short, as mentioned by some of the other reviewer. Well at least for me, the length is just nice. I like it.
B00GB8DPDE|5|Really good materials, colors came as expected, beautiful, the sleeves were a bit more wide than I expected, I got them as gifts for my bridesmaids and they all loved it !
B00D8HJDZK|5|Grandson will like it for Christmas
B00KCO4KU0|2|Nice fit but stretches out
B008ZZ88QU|2|The color is true to the picture, but the scarf is too thin, it does not drape appropriately, and it is not pliable.
B0032A4QRS|4|Great for the price!
B00HFODIDU|5|Would recommend these shorts, purchased them for my son before we left on vacation and I ordered his regular size and they were true to size.  Good quality.
B008GO3KRC|5|I got two of these for Halloween and they are WONDERFUL!<br />They will be worn often, not just for costume events.  Really wonderful necklaces.
B00CIZN93U|5|I love this shirt very  comfortable. This is part of my waitress uniform.
B0096I8WZW|5|It is a beautiful jacket, very good quality and very good price. It's very elegant!.<br /><br />Es una hermosa chaqueta, de muy buena calidad y a muy buen precio. Es muy elegante!!!
B00L68F8FM|4|Fits good every where, except the bust area I think it's made for small chested women.
B00IGAODHM|3|I wish I'd gotten a size bigger, but if all works out, then I'm on the right track.<br /><br />I don't like how the sides poke me though...working through the fasteners will take some time to get adjusted so that doesn't happen.
B004C8V906|5|Very Happy with this product. It came in the mail extremely fast and the product is fantastic and so far up to date has met all expectations. This robe is a one size fits all it has great length to it and it is thick in material which is great for cold winter nights(25 degrees) to get from the house to the jacuzzi.
B00ASPQAEC|5|These are really comfy and cute. Fit true to  size and my 3 year old really likes to wear them.
B008F4GQV0|4|I liked this sweatshirt but the pink shade is very pink! lol. worth the money though
B007Z0XCD0|5|I ordered the Mohair Gauze Loop Cold Weather Scarf for a granddaughter who was planning a trip to New York City. She loved it.
B00C1EOQXA|5|They are exactly what I was looking for.  They are great for beach living.  Hurley is always top quality, very durable.
B00IOPUVU2|1|color is different fir is awful and the cheap fabric and the cheaper stitching. should have never fallen for the image . a bad purchase. will never buy cheap clothes again.
B005B8J4YE|4|Nice $ clip but as indicated in many reviews it came scratched.
B00LJOM5JK|4|Good coat, fairly warm. I'm 6 foot 4 and the sleeves were a little short for my arms.
B00FZR14JE|3|These panties are very comfortable, soft cotton and they don't show too much under stretchy yoga pants.<br />It's kind of difficult to tell from the product image, but they are very high waisted, and about an inch shows above the majority of my jeans/pants, which is hardly ideal. They are also highly unflattering. I personally wouldn't purchase them again, although it seems to be an almost impossible task to find decent looking, comfortable cotton underwear for a reasonable price.<br /><br />If you're only looking for comfort, these panties are perfect. If you're looking for something at least decent looking, these are probably not the correct choice.
B00M8YX68Y|5|Wife loves it.
B004G8PMSC|5|they are incredibly comfortable! and I wear them every crazy long musical rehearsal, so they help a lot when I don't wanna wera actual pants
B00LIEQ268|1|As other reviews suggested, I sized up for this. It was huge in the body though, and far too short. It was made for a very wide short person, but not a standard size person. It is far shorter in length than the described item online, it is the length of a child's jacket.<br />This is the second item we have had to return to this company because it is defective. We ordered three vests in September 2014 and also had to return them for being too short.
B00BCX5IWE|5|Dad loved it.
B004S3PNPM|2|For me, this was a terrible tint. I bought the tinted version specifically to take to Hawaii, when I had a spray tan on normally pale skin. WIth the first stroke of the stick, It turned into a white paste on my face; it was like putting a glue gun to your cheek. I immediately washed it off and had to find something else for my face.<br /><br />I have no idea why this gets the reviews it does. I am fair-skinned, so this tint should have worked for a very light fake tan. If you buy, you might want to get the regular version. Or buy the tinted only if you are fairly pale. I will say it works well on my scars, etc. when I have no tan at all.
B0043RJQBU|4|Shipped to me in perfect condition. Fast shipping. Material is a little thinner than expected, but this is for my 11 year old niece who will layer underneath it. Would order from again.
B00DZVMHT8|1|To small, it doesn't fit me at all. I have to give it out. I wkuld never order these from online.
B00E3VNHOI|5|Love these, fit great. Want more!
B00LE9ATTS|5|it wa beautiful  love it  this  top  is so pretty
B003JH8STQ|5|Love it it looks so natural.....
B00CKGBCBS|5|fits nice looks good
B00DQF689S|4|Very cute dress. Colors are spot on! My daughter absolutely loved it and felt like a rock star! The only tip I would give is make sure you measure or follow the size guidelines. It fit but was a little towards the tight end on my daughter!
B008FB9Z2U|5|Love them...so cute on him!!!;-)
B00DJ2TH28|4|Well made quality so far.
B000N8RWPK|5|Good buy
B00D3HU778|5|I just got this bra yesterday but so far it is very comfortable and I love the way it fits without any padding. My chest is pretty big and ordering bras online almost never goes well but this was a great buy. I might even get a 2nd one. My nursing bra I had fitted at Motherhood is a 38E and I ordered a 40DD.
B002S4E1X8|5|Sizing is right, color is right, nice heavy t-shirt.  I expect a long life from it.  Kid was ecstatic receiving it.
B0094E9KKY|1|The product is ok. The Hello Kitty image on the shirt was not completely on. The left side of the kitty face was not comoletely there. I gave this as a gift the a 10 yr old and when she opened it she noticed straight off. I wanted to return it but couldn't have the heart to take it from her because of her love for Hello Kitty.
B00EOT4KMW|5|perfect fit
B00GPSC4O6|4|I have bought cheaper ear muffs and they keep breaking so I decided to get a better made earmuff and these seem to fit the bill.
B0027B1VNA|5|This hat is so awesome!  Loved it the first time my wife and I tried it on our baby.  You can tell the product is made of high quality materials.  Shipping was fast as usual too.
B00S1T4X28|5|The color is beautiful and looks like the picture online. The top fit perfectly. I plan to buy another color.
B00HD7HHKE|3|These socks are thin and im certain I will wear through them in no time at all.  For th eprice they are ok
B00AJWZ7K2|5|Good value. Fit well. Got them for all the  kids in family . Everyone's happy ! Highly recommend.
B004OVEKBQ|5|I bought 2 pairs of these corduroy pants for my hubby for work. He loves them! After a few weeks, he was like, &#34;Order some more!&#34; So, yesterday, I ordered 3 more pairs. They look great on him, they are great quality and they are easy to care for (throw in the washing machine). Perfect for casual wear or dress them up a bit with a collared shirt and sweater for a business casual job.
B00J6A0SAC|3|Arm holes are really small, but otherwise what I was expecting
B0008EOG6W|4|I found these jeans to be a good buy. However they did seem to be oddly tight in the crotch are in comparison to other brands of the same size and style.
B00O9UCXG6|5|Look like a princess!
B00MUZNDCK|3|Great quality jacket! Nice and thick but it does run small and is shorter than I thought it would be.
B008H4HVTO|4|I bought these for prom, and they served their purpose without tearing, so I'm happy with them. They're slightly cheesy looking but for one event they're great. (P.S. Keep these away from Velcro!)
B00JJ52GW2|5|Love these shirts!
B0076R6O64|4|Fit as anticipated. Material was a bit thinner than expected. ( but still warm) That's the reason I gave it four stars. Overall, a good buy.
B00AZJ6T56|5|I am happy with it, it did show up a touch long in the torso but like all of that type of carhartt shirts the will shrink up a bit
B00B9FJFHY|5|It is very good item. I have years using it with great satisfaction. High quality and perfect fit. great job
B00194S94A|5|The maroon Blended Jersey shirt is perfect. We like this shade of maroon. We are very satisfied customers. Thank you.
B00OVYJ822|3|Very pretty fits around ribs but cups are not ment for larger breasts and doesn't stretch very much.
B000I6PVRI|5|I've had these about a year now, they are a great looking pant, and I always feel like I have my best days when I look/feel like I am in charge- I am when I wear these!  They do wear quickly, these are wearing at the cuffs, but they are worth it.  I have yet to find another pair of khakis that look good and fit well, and I always end up just wearing these instead.  I'll tell you this, I was here to buy another 2 pair, and thought that I would leave a comment here to tell YOU how much I liked them.  Totally worth the price, I'd buy them again in a minute-
B00KXQRBLC|4|I like the designer, Catherine Malandrino.  The color of this dress is beautiful.  The material is a rather thick polyester.  It is well made and fits well and the price is right.  I don't like it as well as the blue leather Catherine Malandrino dress that I recently bought at Amazon  but have decided to keep it.
B002NPCMII|5|Great Xmas dress for our daughter.  She absolutely loved it, and we did our santa visit and pro xmas pics with this dress.  We were sad to see it go, but now our friends little girl is going to wear it this year, so it lives on.
B00M2UN2LU|2|I usually buy these shirt from LL Bean and X-Lge fit perfectly, this shirt is much to big even in the length of the sleeves, and also dislike the fabric, well I tried so back to LL Bean, thanks anyhow, and appreciate your checking. Bill Tyler
B00BYISJ0U|5|Awesome shirt. Double-stitched collar, nerdy-cool heavy &#34;metal&#34; graphics - what more is there to say? \\m//
B00DDQWWTA|2|I liked them , the first thing I did when I got them was put them on and bend over.  When I stood back up the right leg had ridden up (I cannot stand that). I canceled the other 4 pairs on order.
B00CDRYQEE|5|Fits my daughter, who has wonderful curves, to a T!  This looks like from the forty's, but is also modern, if that makes any sense.  SO becoming and fiqure flattering!!
B007HQKXAM|5|my son loves this shirt. he is into all the hair bands from the late 80s and early 90s !
B0094G9EC6|3|I returned it
B003759XBM|5|Bought this shirt for the holidays. washed it once and it still looks good and fits well. I would recommend this.
B00EII2NAU|4|I love the fitting. and order the other colors.need more colors only three available. at the selection. need more choices.
B00712VSVA|5|Oh, this saves so much time, especially when you are in a hurry to get to events!  Just put it on and go!
B00K1GNFLE|4|Super cute and super soft! I'm 5'2&#34; 145lbs they're a little snug around the waist. Arrived earlier than expected, overall very happy!
B00BSOU2GY|4|I love the quality of the shirt for the price. I said it was a bit small because it is really for a slinder male . My husband is slinder so based on the picture I knew he needed a meduim it llooks kind of small. If fits my husband perfect tho his waist is like a 30 -31 so you understand what I mean. Most of the time need a small but I looked at the cut on this and said he needs a meduim, very nice shirt tho
B00NQ74M8K|2|Just got this today. I put it on right away. I am 5ft 3 and just under 200lbs. I ordered the XL as I read that this product runs big. It's huge right under my breast and tight on my lower belly (I had a baby 15 months ago; having a tough time getting rid of my lower belly). I don't know if the product is more than a under garment. The fabric is stretchy kinda. We will see. It did come in a timely manner.
B006GTA5M2|5|Perfect product. I loved it. The fit for me was great. Will get additional ones later.  Wearing for the 4th of July. Ed Ptacek
B005SJIRUS|5|this is the wallet i was looking for. i like it 'cause it fit our money as well as my cards. I don't put too many cards in my own wallet so i chose this one because it is small and hold not more than 5 cards.
B00CDQDXOO|4|First of all, plaid is awesome. Then you add flannel, even better. Now let's add a thermal lined hood! Wow. Wow. Wow. It fits well, looks great, and makes you feel like you're being wrapped in a large teddy bear. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the hood tends to pull the collar of the shirt backwards, which can be uncomfortable when it is buttoned. Overall, it's a great product. I wear it often.
B00KR1SIP6|1|I bought an XXL because the reviews said the blouse ran small.  Small is very understated. I gave the blouse to someone in my office who wears a size 8. Nice blouse. Not at all a good fit.  I will not buy from this vendor again
B011N5L5OK|5|Happy with product, good quality material,  feels great on wearing it and shipped fast.<br />Black xl fit me just great.<br />Biut it is a bit expensive but hopefully will last long ..
B008A1037G|2|The graphics are nice, but the shirt is so thin the teenaged girl who will be wearing it will need an undershirt.  A kids t-shirt for $25 should be top quality!
B007ZQ8YPA|5|Stocking hat was soft and cute - made for perfect pictures and warm ventures outside!  Baby's mother and grandmother were very pleased.
B0017KCVOK|5|This panty is light, confortable, special color. This likes to my wife so underwear or to sleep. Is recommended to wear in some place or to some skirt
B000SKI770|5|These socks are great.  Theyre only socks but are over-the-top comfortable.  These socks fit exactly as expected and so far have withstood the test of time.
B009LWMVIM|4|it ok, but the leather tan part is kinda cheap and what looks like metal bracket  on the glasses at the top section and silver rims is cheap plastic. Used for a photoshoot and worked great. real life use, it wont hold up well.
B001JBNDL2|3|I'm surprised how much briefs cost.  These are the cheapest ones I found but the quality are not that great.  the material is thin and the underwear itself is kind of shapeless.  I used to buy from Costo (but recently haven't found at the store), and expect these to be the same or similar quality but they are thinner and more shapeless.  Still wearable though.
B00CKXA1Z4|2|Shame because I really liked the neckline.  I understood the reviews suggesting that it ran small.  I guess I did not read enough of them so let me share it runs COMPLETELY REALLY small.  Depending on manufacturer, I can wear a medium or a large.  Size 12, 5'9&#34;.  I could hardly get it over my shoulders - I thought I was going to rip the material so when I needed to stretch it out to get over my bra, I just gave up.  Loved the green color, but if you're going to give it a try go for the xtra large;  I don't have the time to give it another try.
B003ID55PG|5|The turbin fits exactly as it shows on the image. I have a larger head size, and it still have plenty of room without feeling baggy. I love it and I can't wait to wear it in Spain this winter on our honeymoon!
B00GN7343Y|3|This shirt is cool. It doesn't fit as long as the photo suggests, but it is kind of cool as a cover shirt. I would have given it a 4 if the length and actual animal  print was as expected.
B00DX6VJ4Y|5|Great bra!!  I love that it is seamless and has room to grow!
B00B4GN34Y|5|It's a good rain coat, but the sleeves could be longer. I'm 6 foot.
B00HVD18LO|2|Perfect to look at, impossible to move in.  I'm 5'7, 140 lbs and ordered a large.  Looks and feels great while standing still, but if you reach down to grab your purse, it's like a straight jacket and it pulls so tight in the back you can't reach down (or up.)  Plus the nylon material is very noisy when brushed or moving.  Wanted to love it, but it had to go back.
B00GMDJCNK|5|I bought this for my mother and she loved it. Very comfortable, she wears it everywhere. Certainly would recommend it.
B00AAVKKY0|4|It's comfortable and soft, iron free. Fit is true to size, I am 5'8&#34; and 136 lbs, small fits me perfectly. Fear deal for the price.
B007CMUFX6|5|I ordered this belt a couple of months ago to wear along with a new pair of raw denim jeans I bought. The way the color has darkened and changed is fantastic, this is a belt that gets better with age.
B00A4MT63Q|5|I bought these slacks for my Mother for Mother's day.  They fit so well that I bought her two more pair, since it is hard to find pull on slacks her size where she lives.
B007IU94Z2|5|Fast delivery and now I hopefully won't loose a valuable pin, again!  Got enough locks now to share a few with my pinhead friends!
B00GRS3DRG|5|Cool
B00A65Z5JU|4|I am constantly getting compliments on this top. I purchased the burgundy one in August and loved the fit so much that I ordered them in black and navy as well and now I own three of them!<br />I wear them all the time. The fit on the burgundy one was perfect, the black (which I ordered in the same size) fit a little small but they both fit well. I'm 5'4 and I have a small waist and hour glass hips. My torso is about average in length and I like that the length of this top is able to cover my hips.<br />I have since bought other tops from this store and have always been happy! Fast shipping too and nicely packaged when it comes
B00B2NWGBU|5|I got this for my granddaughter and she loves it. It fits well and is very nicely made. Shipped fast with my prime. I would purchase from this line of underwear again
B006038882|5|excellent product, very comfortable'll buy more in the near future
B00ID1NJDI|5|I love how it looks
B00JZGNFWA|3|I like the shirt
B00IVDP580|5|Love it
B003NX8D64|4|This is a good jacket for running errands and relaxing around the house. The navy is a nice color that offers some change from the typical black and white. The jacket does run a little large, but that is to be expected with most fleece jackets. The price is also a big plus.
B004PYEQM0|5|Perfect quality!!
B002ZG8IP6|4|Great jeans. My husband always looks great in Levis. They fit excellent... the only down side is the denim is so thin. So I would recommend this for summer jeans... but now winter, if you're needing something strong & thick. Looks great on him, though.
B00O3QI2AC|1|DID NOT RECIEVE WHAT'S ON THE PICTURE...IT WAS JUST A UGLY TOP NOT A DRESS...TERRIBLE
B000T3BU84|5|Finally found a bra that fits perfectly and is so comfortable.  Love the front closure.  Will definitely buy another one soon.
B00J2FHF6Q|5|My wife and I absolutely love The Big Bang Theory so when I seen this onise I knew I had to get it for our little one, it fits perfectly and it's just freakin adorable.
B00PMLFI1I|3|This does tend to run small-I ordered a size up and it does fit. The material is thin. I am still trying to decide if I will keep this or not. It might be a too clingy for my taste.
B00JJYYCTS|4|Fabric is ok, but what do you want for 20$.  Length is good,fit is good. Only wish that the colors were a little better defined.  This is a polka dot dress.  When you look at the dots, it looks like they might have been white, but the fabric bled until they the dots were light purple...... seems a little weird.
B00D3D48F4|4|Bought this for my husband and he loves it it's perfect for minneapolis winter.
B008A03770|2|I wore the belt ONCE and the sharp little clips that hold on the studs were all pointy & sticking out making it painful to touch and very difficult to take the belt off of pants because the clips tug on every fiber. Don't wear this with any pair of pants you care about.
B003S808OE|5|Very soft, warm, and it stays on my ears!
B00BI4X4DW|5|Perfect
B00JSJR7S2|2|Somewhat cheaper costume, top is too big, bottom is too small
B00KYNFDAU|1|Ordered an XL but looks like it was made for a child.
B002K8PFE6|1|the packet description states it includes pink - ecru and white tights - - - however there is NO ecru (which is a greyish pale yellow tan kinda color). instead the pack comes with 2 pairs of pink stockings and one white. not satisfied at all!!
B008UDUK6S|5|Very soft and comfy, bought it as a workout shirt, liked it so much I'm using it as a summer tank.
B00R7L9W18|4|Beautiful dress. Looks as expected.  Runs small for u.s sizes .
B00IEK2H9U|4|i have quite a few buckles and finding these belts in regular non western stores are hard to find.Thanks to my wife recommending Amazon,I finally found the belts I have been looking for.
B0036Z0VQY|5|This is one of the nicest whales tail pendants I've seen! I love whales tail pendants, have a few in my jewelry collection, and this one is one of my favorites. Most of the whale tail pendants are pretty small these days and you pay alot for them. I was looking for a Hawaiian one that has a carving on it, and this one is gorgeous! Very beautifully carved and very detailed design. Excellent quality. It's also polished very smooth. I love the three turtles on it. Not just turtles, but Hawaiian leaves too! It is very huge! 2 inches wide, and a half inch long! It's the largest whale tail pendant I own now, and probably the most beautiful! Better than silver, or gold, much nicer and you can't get a silver or gold one this size! Great price! Wow! It is also not very thin either. A good thickness. It is flat and polished super smooth on the back. One sided. I highly recommend this for anyone who loves whales, dolphins, sea turtles, or just loves sea animals and the sea. I am one of those people and I just love this! You won't be dissapointed with this! I can guarentee it!!! Comes ready to wear on a beigh cord with bone adjusting bead so you can adjust it to any length you wish. Get it before it's sold out!
B0015PKB3U|5|Excellent product!
B00JZSIL9A|5|One word amazing
B0044QOGRE|3|Got the 6 to 12 month bodysuits and it's a little tight on my daughter. Other than that super cute and the design does not wash off!
B00OL4RPDQ|3|Not sure if am keeping this one. Is a little more loose then I was hoping for.
B00F57BV38|5|O my, this is a win and a half. I bought these for like 6 dollars a piece so I got 3 of them for working out. I don't care what I look like when sweat so I thought I could buy 3 for the price of a regular t-shirt, yay. I love these shirts, they breathe for working out, they look good enough, and they are so comfortable they are on regular lounge around the house rotation. Undershirts for dress clothes, etc. I can't say enough about how much I love these shirts, all the comfort you expect expensive athletic gear, and not even close to the price. Thick enough to feel reasonably resistant, and they wash out even the most intense workouts. Wish I had purchased 3 more!
B008VPS6L6|1|I now have to pay more to have them shortened then I paid for the pants. I'm 5' 11&#34; there made for someone 6&#34;5&#34;.
B000NICEAS|5|As expected
B000FISZ72|1|These hose a way too small according the page size. I use to wear the exact same hose and they always fit fine.  Have not gained weight from time I use to wear them, Very dissatisfied,
B00KD5BV5A|4|Great for our new baby.  Dianne
B004GXA71E|2|I needed a simple work out shirt in a hurry.  Since I usually like Champion gear, I ordered without paying much attention to reviews.  My mistake.<br /><br />This shirt fits very tight through the chest but has huge arm holes.  I think it may have been specifically designed for those who have built up powerful shoulders and biceps but who aren't actually a large size through the chest.<br /><br />The shirt appears well made and is tagless so it would probably be comfortable for the right person even though it won't work for me.  This one goes into the donation pile.
B009RUWE8K|5|Most of the hankies I buy my husband shrink up in the wash. These are of good quality and haven't shrunk. He really likes them
B002KIINF4|5|fabric is snug so would suggest going a size larger
B00IKHYVMI|5|I was a bit leery on buying this shirt but I'm so glad I did! Being a directioner from the beginning I excpectes pretty too quality in this short and that's exactly what it is! Amazing price , good fit, nice material! AMAZING 5/5! Will hopefully be buying more from this seller :D
B00K0XOXDC|5|looks great
B00KAKF2EY|2|Doesnt even light up just got it bought for me from my friend and it is such a rip off really  i put batteries in the control and it lights red and flashes but the bra dont even light very upset &#60;/3
B0060M6KYC|5|Very happy with my purchase. The petticoat quality is better than expected. I got the size small ( I am 5'2, 115lbs) and it fit perfectly :-)<br />The petticoat adds a lot of volume to my Melissa Sweet fit and flare just like I wanted! The fishy smell on the petticoat goes away after hanging it for two days.Very happy and highly recommend this petticoat.
B0042GFDAU|5|Runs a little big , but well worth it, not a cheap piece<br />Good material, I get it again or andifferent color
B00JTG16RC|4|Super cute!
B00B7GL2OO|5|The briefs are comfortable enough for day to day. I really enjoyed my purchase. I will recommend. The price-benefit ratio is good too.
B000V9M954|4|Good quality - nice styling - love all the pockets - fits everything. I bought it a little too big but it still works.
B00ELNQI12|5|Good quality, great for Praise dance ministry
B00JPN2EL6|1|Item arrived with a large hole in it. The shemagh was paper thin and shed terribly. I was required to pay return shipping on the item, even though it arrived damaged and in poor quality.<br /><br />Do not purchase.
B00JBXSRSE|5|Really excellent. excellent quality and fit.
B00BZ5V0LM|2|It was a weird dress. It in no way shape or form hangs like it does in the image shown. It's crumpled oddly and the bottom definitely does not look like the model is displaying it. It went straight down, no fan out, no form and weird crumpling.
B00KTD9PAE|2|This did not impress me.  The second time I washed the shirt, a button came off.  Since then other stitching/seams have started to unravel.  Can't recommend it!.
B00NUCETTI|5|I love this scarf! It's thick enough to keep me warm, but thin enough not to be too bulky.
B00857U05U|4|Good quality fabric. Too long for me, though. If you're under 5'5&#34; maybe get them in petites. But overall, I'm happy with the purchase.
B008S4ETJS|5|Love these socks!! Use to get them at Kohls and they stopped carrying them so I was glad to find them on Amazon!!
B00PMTMITU|5|love them!  they wash well..don't schrink in the dryer... think they'll last long!
B00362QQB6|2|the leprechaun and the fedora hat came in  the same box. They are not one size fits all. they both are for very small heads we can not use them
B00IYP3078|3|Runs large.
B00MV5M0HS|5|wonderful cami!  LOVE the way it fits and is very flattering
B00525SOM4|4|I got these jeans for my 5 year old.  Without using the adjustable waist inside, the jeans were the right length but too loose in the waistline.  By pulling the elastic tabs out on each side (they fasten with buttons inside the waistband) the jeans were able to fit him comfotably without looking bunched up outside.  These jeans will last him for awhile and I would recommend them to others.  The only thing that kept me from giving them a full 5 stars is that they seem to wrinkle a lot in the dryer.  In my humble opinion, jeans that are removed from the dryer immediately when done shouldn't come out wrinkled but these come out noticeably so.  Not too big of a problem but I thought I would mention it.
B003YPGQWE|5|The hat is a flattering style and not tight to mess up your hair. Also warm but not heavy.  I love it and am buying a couple more of these knit tams.
B002R7X6WI|1|the size was too small as expected.
B002T2T7WE|4|They worked perfectly for me, but the edges could be sharp and uneven which would be uncomfortable to wear. They are cheaply made, but for the price, it's expected. They are not uniform, and slightly vary in cut. I used them all over the walls of my bathroom for a Halloween party. Black light bulb made them glow, and it was creepy. I covered the walls with cheap plastic black tablecloths, using push pins. Then, I hot-glued the masks to the tablecloth.
B00JBXXEX2|5|I ordered a small and it is a bit too short, but that's probably because I have really long legs. I really love this dress and have no problem rocking it, I just can't bend Lol. Anyways, if you're not comfortable with it being a bit short, I would suggest order a size up.
B008VIMALA|3|The dress fits very nicely and is a good length.  However, it is cut MUCH lower than the picture shows (goes to about the middle of my stomach and I have a very tall torso) and I can't seem to get it to sit in such a way that it doesn't make me look like I have a giant muffin top (which I don't).  So, my only complaints are that it bunches in the wrong places around the hips and is SUPER low cut in front.  I like the fabric (strechy and comfortable) but not quite what I expected.  Still, I will wear it, I'm sure, just not to the places I originally intended.
B006SRTEZG|5|These are good quality thermals and the fit was as expected. Ordered a large size and it was right on for me.
B00D052NZC|5|I absolutely love these jeans.  Some of the reviews state they run small.  These are a &#34;super skinny&#34; cut and they fit like the name suggests.  Picture structured leggings and you will get an accurate idea of the sizing.  Anyway, the color is amazing and they don't stretch out at all after wearing them all day.  I would order them again in a heartbeat.
B004HVL08E|5|I love the colors! Had many people ask me where I got it.I am very pleased that I bought this item
B00ALZC5GG|5|Love this fleece.
B00MAXMB7A|4|Because of customer review of saying the product runs small, I ordered a large and it fits me perfectly. I am more of a medium. It is great, will be a perfect summer bikini and arrived in a timely fashion. DEFINITELY ORDER ONE SIZE UP and you will be very happy.
B00BZESX04|5|I love these pants. My husband is a retired Marine and I purchased him a pair of the original red sweatpants, and shortly afterwards realized how damn comfy these pants are.<br />The EGA looks pretty clear, but it does lack a bit in detail when you look really close at it.You can still easily tell what it is. I'd highly recommend getting a size smaller than you if you can. I bought these in a size L thinking that they'd hang off of me a little bit, but it ended up being that they hung off of me quite a bit. If you're looking for workout pants, definitely go smaller. These pants are pretty long, but they've got elastic bands in the ankle cuff so you can pull them up a smidgen if needed. I'm really satisfied with this purchase. It was well worth the money because the pants are well constructed and very soft-not to mention they came way before the expected delivery date.
B00JHNP6KK|5|My son used this swimsuit in a school contest. it fit as expected and looked great
B007AFVJ08|2|Too Small
B00C6ZZKFW|5|Love it!! A little loose (typical for my girl) but has the awesome elastic strip button adjustment on the inside waste.<br />Super cute. I don't usually spend this much on jeans for my daughter and I am glad these were worth it!!!<br />Would buy again.
B009ASH0QU|5|This was the perfect wig for my Nicki costume. Thanks Guys. I Love it! :-)
B00L9E6GY0|5|Fabric is a bit cheap but what do you expect for the price. It was exactly as I thought it would be.
B00GFH6GXM|5|It was a little small in the shoulders so I sent it back and ordered the next size up.  The material feels great and it's a very nice looking shirt.
B00MBK4PWG|5|I am in love with this hat!!!!
B000XTHOA2|5|This is a great wallet. It is exactly what I wanted. It is well made and a good design.
B00O7Y4KWO|5|Fits
B0042ZR9ZI|5|I'm a big collector of licensed Domo-kun merchandise and this hat fits right in my collections. It's a great hat to wear during these winter days. It's retain a lot of heat too (major plus!!!). I do wish it had more buttons to fasten tighter to the head; nontheless, it's a great hat for anyone to wear.
B00AY8M3LC|4|This has been an on-going problem with finding PJs for DD...the zipper is always straining to close around the thigh/butt area.  (Not that Mama would know ANYTHING about that.)  These zip comfortably without being crazy long or baggy everywhere else.  Pattern is cute, fabric is okay.  A little thin for the price, but oh well.
B00V5ZZLZS|3|Nice fit
B00N72T6J4|3|The shirt Is a little smaller in fit than expected. The fabric is also on the thin side
B000LQZKM6|1|Absolutely useless.  The first time I dropped my video iPod the case landed by my feet.  The iPod was fifteen feet away.
B00MUB9K1M|5|Great shirt, love Morningrise and Opeth.
B00M1TJ766|4|1.  I wear XL t-shirts and this one was too big for a XL<br />2.  It has a large white stripe down both sides of the shirt.
B00AQD5NLC|3|The pants were of good construction and material. The fit was a little off. While they fit comfortably on my son in the leg area, the waist was too tight when he was in a sitting position.
B004BDOPUI|4|They fit as expected and arrived on time.  What is not to like.  It is brutal hot outside after 0800.  I like them to walk in, early in the a.m. and are great if I have to wear a shirt around the house.
B00AW7ZYSO|3|My wife says it  is very comfortable and warm to wear, and fits nicely,but sheds consistantly<br /> and is visable on her white blouse and pants. Even so she likes it.
B001JBDATM|5|test
B001KYPGKO|4|Ok, if you're a girl, I don't suggest these pants.  They fit SO big in the legs and butt and everywhere that you certainly would be swimming.  If thats what you like, go for it.  The material seems more breathable than UFOs, but the sizes run real big.  I am a small in girlie UFO hipster pants, and the XS in these were still big.  And I'm 136lbs 5'4\\".  My waist measures 35\\", but you wanna get smaller than your waist measurement.  Again, not the most flattering for a girl's cargo pants, but the price is cheaper than UFO and I think the material is superior.  I never wore them out, so I can't comment on that.  I would have given them 5 stars if I saw them perform, I suspect they' perform VERY well.  Would be nice if they had more girl oriented pants though.
B00H8YZZOW|5|I have been a Godzilla fan for many years, especially from the &#34;Showa&#34; (1950's-1960's) era before Godzilla became a silly children's movie character. This shirt portrays the &#34;real&#34; Godzilla who stomps skyscrapers flat and vaporizes armies with his heat ray breath. This shirt is made from good 100% cotton material that fits well. The stark white-on-black silkscreen design of an angry Godzilla is well done and very striking. The shirt came with an official round green TOHO Studios license sticker that indicates authenticity (I assume). Overall, this is a good product at a reasonable price. It is a welcomed addition to my Godzilla shirt collection.
B001INGW0K|4|I bought this as a quick Justice of the Peace wedding dress. I bought up 3 sizes than I normally wear, and it was still tight around the mid-section, which caused the back end to raise up more. It was still pretty, though, and very comfortable. I think it'd be perfect for an outdoor or beach wedding. Pay close attention to the measurements, though. I normally wear an XL in t hings, and bought a 3x, and it was still a little too tight.
B00NXQQ7O6|5|Only things I would have added are a belt and pockets, otherwise it's a very comfy sweater to wear over jeans.
B008BUB5ZU|5|This was the second order I placed for my sister-in-law who always loves to don a bodysuit. A maroon plus a navy. The first order was for a purple and black. The quality meets her standard.
B00E0SCRE0|5|Order one size larger than you normally were in jeans or dress pants, it seems all workout clothes run small. The fit is great and there is a zippered pocket in the back of the band on the pants for your gym key.
B00CBB7LS0|5|good
B00DDJP366|1|I was sent the wrong item. The label on the package said &#34;Stone Rose Blazer&#34; however the bag contained a black O'neil hoodie.
B00HQ34R3A|5|This  is my second Yizzam shirt. I will definitely buy more. I generally wear a size 12 in blouses. The large fits very comfortably and it is a flattering cut. I wear the Monet &#34;Blue Water Lillies&#34; to work as a public school teacher paired with a skirt. It's very comfortable and I gets tons of compliments. I also use it to discuss impressionism with my students. I plan to buy more YIZZAM shirts.
B00DD0CE0I|4|Comfy but as with most ankle socks on big feet, they feel snug and depending on the shoe can ride down slightly
B000TJKH46|4|Nice, but I was hoping it would launder better.  Good heavy shirt, but difficult to iron and comes out of the dryer really wrinkled.
B0041393XM|5|This jacket is Perfect for NYC fall/winter weather
B00O9Z54X0|5|Made well for the intended application in the USA.
B004FKJHR8|5|Very nice product at a great price. It is easy to wear. I use it to type with and keeps my hands warm as well.
B008HBECJE|5|I really love these tights. It is the first time I have worn this brand and I love the way they fit. They make your legs amd bum look great and the colour and the pattern is awesome.
B007P0G6Q0|5|I love when you put on a pair of jeans and they fit as<br />expected. Especially when you're ordering online.<br /><br />Great color too.  My girlfriend likes them!
B001C7JMX6|5|Wow, total bummer.  This is the cutest dress ever!!!  However, I'm 5'9&#34;, so the part that with the gold band that is supposed to go under my bra area, fits above my bra area.  I'm going to try whatever I can to get it to fit, but I don't think I'll have any luck.  This dress is super cute and looks like it costs 5x's as much.  It's just not good if you are taller as the gold rope under the bra area sits in the wrong place.<br />I'm not able to wear it.  Darn.
B00ELC41K8|5|I bought these for my niece who wanted to start using the potty - just like her brothers! - around 18 months. It is very difficult to find training pants for little ones! So happy to have found these - she was thrilled!
B00B12XUHG|5|I don't use this in a wallet.  Initially I was surprised that it costs so much, but It actually is a better quality of plastic than most that I have seen.  I think it was worth it.
B007IDM89S|2|Good look but cheap looking after a few washes.
B006NO99FE|5|Great scarf, looks and feels handmade!  I got the dark grey, which is a very nice shade, true to the picture.  I bought it as a gift, but I'm getting one for myself too!
B00CM6RBJI|4|These jeans fit well. I have never owned a pair of Hudson's, so I was just guessing when I ordered these. With Amazons great return process, it's a win-win. I washed these jeans and when I first put them on, they are nice and snug. After a few hours of wearing them, they become a little loose. I might have ordered a size smaller, but these will work great. I am 5'6&#34; and the length is pretty long, so I roll them up for now. From past experience with Citizens and 7's, they will probably shrink up after many washes. Over all great jeans.
B009WQQE0S|4|Material very flimsy and thin for the price!  Expensive! My girls love it though and can't wait to wear it!
B005MRFALA|5|Light weight jacket, very warm, nice looking.
B000NXHDSG|5|Love this hat, left the first on on a bus in Australia which broke my heart .  This one is an exact replacement.  Perfect.
B001VH6W1M|5|These are comfortable, good quality, fashionable socks. They do what socks are supposed to do. And free 2nd day delivery by Amazon Prime really helped out since I had accidentally put all my black socks in storage and needed something fast.
B00K43BAPC|4|Is well made but they send me the wrong size, originally order a small but got an xs, and I still think that runs too small, is very tight on the waist, a medium size would be a batter fit.  I sent and email for an exchange, but haven't heard back.
B008H81A9C|4|For the price, it's great!
B00H5IS3YU|5|My daughter just loved it. it fitted her perfectly, she is only 13 years old, and usually wears size 14 in kids clothes, so I was expecting to have to fix the dress  thinking it was gonna a litlle bigger, but it was not the case with this dress. It fitted her wonderfully.
B00MLO2PGA|1|Poor quality.
B00DFQNQ7K|2|this is nice but is just not for me it dint do anything on my arms..it keep rolling down and hurting my arm..
B0015PKB08|5|I ordered these for my wife, failing to notice that they are &#34;extended size&#34;.  They were way too large for her, but fit me perfectly (size 10 men's shoe).  I love them, great golf socks.
B00FL1ZCII|4|There was a small slit in the fabric but for the price not worth sending back. Great cover up or sleep wear.
B00SH1ZBWG|5|Sexy
B00FGST62E|5|I highly recommend ordering at least the next size up or even two sizes up. The sleeves were tight but it looks great on! Love the material!
B00HY9098S|5|But still a great buy...somewhat small in the ankle area but not a problem for these nice quality socks. Such as others that have commented, I also misinterpreted the plus size on this item believing the cuffs might be super stretchy rather than the sock itself longer. But actually I did not find the size too large for my foot (or feet as I do plan on wearing them in pairs!). Fruit of the Loom is always a reliable product and again, these were a great value for the cost!
B00BBLCA8C|3|Wasn't a good fit for my head shapem but wig quality but one thing I was impressed with silkiness of hair not ratty and knotty like other synthetic wigs.
B007BLNNPA|5|I wear somewhat large I am 170CM . I hope that my data can help newcomers . By the way I must say that cloth is good Though it is not fit me
B00J1X4O5E|3|Very clingy. if you have a little belly u are gonna want to wear some spanx! lol super comfortable though
B00DEMDTD6|5|loved it
B00CPCDFGM|3|My 3 year old got it for Halloween and it is her favorite dress up piece. Unfortunately the front panel comes apart at the seems very easily. Hemmed it once but dont know if I can fix it again. Overall we got our money out of it.
B001CCJKWY|4|I RECEIVED THIS JACKET TODAY.I PURCHASED THE JACKET FOR MY BROTHER. THE LEATHER IS VERY SOFT, DURABLE LEATHER. THE JACKET IS A NICE FIT. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE.
B007O1XQUO|5|These are great stockings for a great price! I am very impressed by this purchase and I would recommend them for sure.
B008F4GVB0|2|The overall length is great, however the sleeves are very tight and very long. It's impossible to wear. Will donate.
B006WFX9BY|5|I am very happy with these socks.  I bought them for the cold, damp winter weather and they were great for walking outside in Germany and London on a recent vacation.  They kept my feet nice and warm (but not hot).
B0036UM7MK|3|I was very hesitant when purchasing this item because I never buy clothing online without trying it on first and unfortunately I should have listened to my gut. This garment, though it had a \\"slimming\\" effect due to  its' ruched detail, runs much, much larger than its' actual size. I am 5'6, 135 pounds and ordered a medium. The size of it made me as if I were wearing a burlap sack. There's a zipper in the back that I did not even have to bother using because the dress completely slipped over my head. I am a C cup and the front portion of the costume was much too big because of how long the shoulder straps were, which in turn just completely exposed my chest.<br />I purchased this item for about 34 dollars and when I went to exchange it Amazon did not  provide that option for me. When I looked up the price of a small costume, it turns out to be 48 dollars! Go figure. I'm still debating if I want to keep this costume and try to fix it myself (which I do not want to do because I believe spending 34 bucks for one night is plenty) or just return it and get my money back.<br /><br />Overall, the garment is beautiful when looking at (despite all the tangles in the frills). The length is very nice, not too short/ not too long and the overall aesthetic feel of it is very pleasing to the eyes. It does not look like a 10 dollar or DIY costume. I just wish it ran true to size.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!<br />-Naomie
B00BQN9BKA|5|This is very see-through. I'm 98# and 5 feet tall and the arms were perfect on me...most stuff hangs off.
B00KXR6UCW|3|Arrived when expected, shearer than I expected, color is good, fits looser than expected
B00CJQ2AYM|1|Nothing shows that this runs small, I will probably have to return as it was a gift and I am waiting for arrival.  Felt bad even sending it.<br /><br />Rats!
B00KT1FC7G|5|I LOVE this shirt. Durable with deep colors and quality stitching. Very pleased. I am 6'6&#34; and weight 300 lbs. and the XXL size is perfect. In particular I am pleased with the sleeve length. The cuff is right at the base of the thumb as one would expect.
B006U9LXY2|5|i bought a blue shirt looked on the internet for a while until i found the king of all ties, i am known to find ties to match my shirts on amazon by landisun and they all match to a tee but this one is so nice the king of all ties
B00B5VRCPY|5|my niece loved it ! She takes it everywhere -she is 5
B001MKZBD8|5|I absolutely love these pants and have been wearing them to my tribal style belly dance classes.  I will say that they are a little long on me, and I am 5'6.  They are also a bit tight in the waist to the point where I have marks on my hips where they indent from the elastic, and I have a very slender build and a small waist so this surprised me.  The front ruching is a little baggy on me, but I don't care.  I have been wearing these pants all over town and to class and receive many compliments.  I'm hoping the waist will stretch a bit with wear.  A very nice pair of dance pants for an outstanding price!
B00SMWW0QA|5|Great price for these good-looking trunks. They fit well and wash up and dry perfectly.
B001LRMXQA|4|I'm a bigger guy.  The waist fits right on the money, but the legs and seat are too loose.  I know a lot of bigger guys want things to fit that way, but I don't.  I prefer a slimmer fit.  The picture makes it looks like these shorts will be a slimmish fit, and maybe they are with smaller pairs.  My shorts are definitely not slim fit.  They're bordering loose.<br /><br />Other than that very pleased.  They look good, are comfortable and have a great combo of style and toughness.  Good price, too.
B000AS8ESW|5|I loved this Halloween costume. The stem hat for me stayed in place all day. I didn't have to do anything to it. This costume is very giving meaning that there was plenty of room in there. I was comfortable and it stayed in place all day.
B00CXBN6PA|5|nice styling and construction
B009GGVZDU|5|This is the best blue jean I have ever worn.  They are hard for me to find locally.  Buy them when I can find them.
B00C9XZCOK|3|Ok, so I had bought a pair of these some years ago and liked them so much I ordered another pair on amazon when my old pair started getting a hole in the knee, etc. and I felt weird wearing them to work even though it's not a big deal at most of my jobs.. But this new pair seems a bit larger than the old one even though they are the same size on the label. I don't know if maybe they shrink over time, but it was a little disappointing. I still like the comfortableness and hardiness of the material though.
B00EMAZKLI|3|It ripped after the first wear, but my daughter still loves that dress... after all, it was cheap, so I shouldn't expect high quality for that price... you really get what you pay for. After fixing the ripped part, it looks really nice
B00IZKRKQE|5|Perfect as described. Thanks so much.
B00787PF1C|5|loved this dress!!!, color is more of an orange not pink, which is what I wanted, fabric is soft, and comfy, fit as expected, arrived sooner than I expected, affordable, very good buy, dress to keep..would've have been perfect it it's free shipping..nevertheless, must buy.
B00F6QM54M|5|This set is exceptionally good, to include the quality.  I have no regrets in purchasing these socks, plan to buy more
B003BNZ4EU|3|This bra is okay, but I don't think it's worth the money. It's true to size (Maidenform has proven to be very good for this) and the fabric is very soft! However, I've only had it a week and the straps are already getting annoying. They're loosening up (or stretching, or something), I think. I had to tighten the straps quite a bit when I first put it on and everything was fine the first two times I wore it, but I've had to adjust it three times today alone. I think the band may be looser, too. I can assure anyone reading the review I did not get the wrong size or anything silly like that; I really think it's just the bra itself and the fabric it's made of. To be completely fair, this is the first Maidenform bra I've had that's not been great and lasted a long time. So, yeah. I would recommend purchasing another.
B00874DVES|5|I am 5'3&#34; and love the super low rise and the perfect fitting legs.  I have been trying to find jeans that fit like this for YEARS!  The medium size 9 are fab.
B00EA7TM1W|5|They dry fast when they get went. The material is soft and light which is perfect for hot summer days.
B004OTIYPG|5|Just like the picture shows. Love it. Was worried because of the experiences I've had purchasing other costume wigs, but this was just like the picture. No mess, no frizz.
B00GC5MML2|5|I own a pair of these pants already and love the fit and comfort of them. They shipped fast and were less money then I could buy them locally! I will be buying more!
B001283MZO|1|I've been wearing these briefs for years because they fit well, they were durable, and they looked good without being too metrosexual-looking (or having the brand name in giant letters along the waistband--I'm looking at you TOMMY HILFIGER!)<br /><br />Unfortunately, they definitely seem to have changed for the worse recently.<br /><br />With the last two packs I've ordered, the leg holes completely lose their elasticity within a laundering or two, leaving your junk totally unsupported and often flopping out the side.<br /><br />It's too bad. It's a hassle to switch to a new brand because you can't really try them on in the store.
B00M2GHDLY|4|I really liked the look of them, however I had to return. They are definitely tighter, not in a restricting way but they didn't leave a lot to mystery to the point I had several comments on it, so I had to return them.
B00H6BVI70|5|These are the softes panties I've ever got and very comfy!!! You can't go wrong wearing these they are flattering to any body shape!!!
B00SB39DLU|4|Super cute drsss. Can't wait to wear it!  It fits just fine, I did order a size up though
B0006JAMUI|5|I love the robe!  The colors are very nice and the quality is great!  It came very quickly!
B001RMO3NK|5|I have been using this for a few months now and it had served me well. It feels great to have got rid of my leather wallet that was a constant pain when sitting in my car. The side that holds cards (not the flap side) seems to have lost that initial grip since I stuffed one too many cars in there. But that's okay, I just bent it back using some tools in my workshop and all is well :).
B00AK3XPP4|3|I love phantoms!!! These were shorter than my normal board shorts. I'm 5' 11 and they come up about 3 inches above my knee. The photo shows at the knee but at my height.... they look like daisy dukes. I'll still keep and rock em tho.
B00165U7KG|5|very nice & cool shirt.  My son loved it.  The order arrived in great condition and fast.
B00ISM3BCQ|3|Cute outfit sadly the top fits but the pants is way too small
B001RNO4QU|5|perfect.
B000N3Q7AQ|5|Good pants, launder well and look nice.  Expandable waistline is nice.  Nothing bad to say about the pans as I wear them for work exclusively.
B007W0XRAG|5|Worked better than I was expecting
B006MK43U0|5|im a 46D chest and 32in waste,this fit wonderful at the top.i also ordered 2 more and they are just like the pictures.
B0088EYPEC|4|Buy it, It is very tightly stitched very well lined and it has a lot of pockets for your credit cards and ID.<br /> you have room for your money and what ever else you may need in your wallet. Look for the price can you really go wrong?<br /><br />Ciao For Now<br />Cicci831
B00J1O2GWG|1|For the price, this was terrible quality and way too small and too short!
B00DZSVFP8|1|I ordered this TWICE.  Both times, I got the short sleeved version!!  Even though it's MARKED on the package as long sleeve, shows in the photo, and all that.  It's not.  I sent the first one back.  I ended up keeping the second one.  For a SHORT sleeved nightgown, I would give it five stars.  But I wanted a long sleeved.  I have no idea why they can't get it right.  It's very weird.  The fabric is nice, silky and not sheer or see through.  Shadowlline is worth the extra money.  But getting the correct order seems impossible.  Hence, the one star.
B00KOH2A1Q|4|My daughter loves this!!!  The only bad thing is that the stitching does come out on the edges.  It doesn't affect its usage, but it is a little disappointing considering how much this item costs.  The mono fin is very durable and will hold up longer than the fabric tail.  Any child using this should watch the &#34;how to swim with your tail&#34; videos on you-tube before swimming with it.  It can be dangerous if used by a non swimmer or anyone not ready to swim with your legs bound together.  Adults take caution!
B00IXADBH8|1|jacket is cut very small .....i order a 3x and it would not fit .my nomal size is 18/20
B00SVWR1MY|5|Perfect!
B00KNRDPJI|4|Fits as expected and appears well made.  Nice and warm for our cold northern Michigan winter.
B005NZSZWM|5|This was an excellent purchase. I got it for a gift, son-in-law and he wears it all time. good price, good fit. Very well made!
B00AMHVR8K|4|A little stiff, but great for my husband who takes one a day and great price
B00JTQQRTE|4|It came whithin the expected time frame and fits well also very soft.
B00LQ0F4PO|5|Love this shirt!
B000EQM4XG|5|I love them, for wearing with my cocktail dresses and suits. They match my evening shoes. I love them so well, that I have ordered them, twice!
B003V2GMIS|3|The description says Long plain as day. These are in NO way LONG.  I'm only 5'9\\" and they are too short.  Must send them back.
B00DJMDB98|5|Asymmetrical zipper is very cool.<br />but the price is down for another 24,<br />should I return it and buy again?
B00A2XMHAQ|5|I bought these for my step-daughter that just came into my husband and my life after 15 yrs of her mom keeping her away. I didnt want her to be without Christmas so I bought her these but she never told me if they fit or not, if she liked them or not. I loved them that is the whole reason I bought them for her.
B007L99D2O|4|This robe is going to be a Christmas Present so the recipient has not received it yet.  Therefore, it is hard to review but I will say that the service was great, it arrived as the same color ordered and looks to be very comfortable.  Also glad that you had the larger sizes.
B00K14KM2Q|5|Super cute. Won't pair it together because it's too much pink and zebra but will do cute black pants with the onesie and a cute top with the skirt so it's like getting 2 outfits in one.
B0076R6OM8|5|Liked it so much I ordered another one.<br />My husband says they are warm and comfortable and I am delighted!
B003ITAFMS|5|Perfect, quality kit for the cash. No patches, oil, or solvent with the kit, but you can pick those up anywhere. Add in an oiling brush and q-tips and you good to go!
B004MW3H6Q|5|My earlier review of this product was subject to criticism .  I've decided to revise the review in light of those comments and to accentuate the positive.  New review follows:<br /><br />\\"Just the thing for convenience store robbers everywhere. Sure to be a hit in felonious circles. What the well dressed flash mob will be wearing this fall.\\"<br /><br />Thank you to Diego and ReelBigMike for this suggestion.
B006X13B5G|5|These fit just right n i wear a size9. These held up pretty good
B00NC93PS0|4|they are very comfortable.
B009P84EU0|5|I really love this dress!  It fits as expected and I've already gotten a lot of wear out of it.  Great brand!
B00OLIGKSI|5|I got these pants for someone as a christmas present and they loved them!
B001IAP4WA|5|Bought these for my grand daughter she loves these pants. They  fit her really nice and they look great on her.
B00DRUYOYS|4|A very nice and soft coat. Keeps me very warm. The color was darker than shown online. But overall the coat is WONDERFUL!
B001K5P6FS|4|This was purchased for our grandson who thought it was &#34;awesome&#34;.  He looked forward to showing it off to his friends.
B00KWG42RY|5|Beautiful holiday dress.  Such a nice change from a big poofy dress.<br />The necklace comes with it, which was a nice surprise!
B0050DT11Q|5|These headbands are soft and super stretchy. I'm a little disappointed with the hair bows that came with them though. The bows are made of good quality materials, but were crushed, bent, and misshapened and seem to be carelessly made. I'm hoping the bows straighten out over time. If not, I will be able to use different hair clips with the headbands, so its not a big deal.
B00114YKBY|5|Excelent product
B00HZ4AB0I|5|This is exactly what I was looking for and it is a nice affordable price. The material is just right for a little boy who is adventurous with his food. He just loves his &#34;Shabbos clothes&#34;
B00NAX296W|4|I usually wears XS, XXS. Based on many reviews, it runs small, which is true. I ordered small which is the smallest available and it fits perfectly fine except that it is a little long. but the elastic cuff really helps so the length does not get in the way of moving around. I love it as a lounge pants, wouldn't wear it for workout activity as it does not stretch at all even though it offers enough room. I don't anticipate the fabric stands wash well.  The material even though is not 100% cotton does not cause itchiness and feels comfy. But it is see-through. I have white which often has see-through issue. Maybe other colors won't have this problem.
B009FV848U|5|This is awesome it fits perfectly I went to a ladies night and everyone complimented me I love this sooo much
B00GZ0O5XM|4|I love this as a swimsuit cover up, except that the fabric doesn't really breathe so it gets pretty hot pretty quick but it is still beautiful!
B00E85KQZC|5|I was a little hesitant about ordering this top because of some of the reviews claiming it's too thin and cheap.  Very glad to see it is not.  I do agree it runs a bit big though.  I am 5'4&#34;, 175lbs, and bra size is 40 C or D (depending on bra).  I tried on a few different kinds of tops and was size 16.  Ordered this in 16 and wish I had a 14, but it works and don't have time to exchange it.  It did stay on fine in the pool without the strap, also.  Love the length, it's a little longer.  Overall very pleased with this swim top!!!<br /><br />Also, wanted to mention that this black is more like a super dark charcoal.  Would pass for black with any other color bottoms though.  (White, lighter grey, colored etc.)
B00M8GEL9A|5|love it!
B000K8QKSI|5|The delivery was so fast considering I just opted for standard delivery. It only took 2 days for it to arrive. I ordered it with a sarong tie. They were a great pair when I tried them on. I ordered the green one and it looked great. The material is soft and not sheer so it was not see-through. I can use it at a Luau party. I'm considering buying another one from the same vendor. Can't wait to use it on our trip to Hawaii this summer!
B004LFDXZE|5|Impressive fabric and fit.  Very durable.  Alo Yoga has broken the code.
B00MSUFZSW|1|I just bought this coat and am sending it back.  The wool blend fabric is very thin and not at all warm  enough for winter.  It shows what look like pockets on the coat, but they are really just there for looks.  The hood  comes with a collar that you tuck into the jacket, it does not even attach to the coat.  The worst thing, although I am not sure it is the worst is that as I examined the coat and tried to find a way to attach the hood, it turned my hands a dark shade of blue.  Just forget it.
B008YJNLXM|4|This size 5 swallowed my younger niece; she wanted to wear it to bed as she loved the material. I have ordered the size 4 for her;
B0063GHNY6|4|This shirt was exactly as described, it does run a little small. But, since it is a junior size, I ordered a size larger,and it fits perfectly.
B00J4A1PHO|3|It's see through.  You would have to wear a slip with it is you don't want your panties showing.
B00JLFQAQS|5|I work in a freezer The best socks ever ever bought.
B00AZTSSR8|5|shorts seem to be of high quality, look great, fit great and I would recommend them to purchase.
B007EKQMFQ|5|My husband works in the city and wind is crazy during winter time.  He walks from metro to his building and this helps a lot.
B00KDC8B5Q|4|It is not easy to put on alone the first few times but it is doable. I am 36-33-38. I have room to tighten in the waist and hips but the top is not very tight. If I went to the next size it would be way too small. I am also a petite person so this corset is a tad long for me. If I don't get it positioned on my body just the right way it can be very uncomfortable. If you have never warn a corset it can feel weird for the first 20mins. but after you walk around in it for a while it almost becomes unnoticeable. I have to say that it looks really good on. We will see how long it takes to train my waist. I must say I have only worn this corset for about a week and I already have a bone (corset bone) popping out.
B00EAYHIR0|4|It definitely could fit more than one me. I used a belt at the empire waist and tied a bow in the back. I had to pin in the sleeves on the bottom because two of my arms could've fit. Other than that, it is a beautiful dress just would fit an extra large woman or XXL woman better. I am normally a size small.
B00478NE54|5|I bought this for last Halloween and it was a huge hit! I love WWII era stuff and it fit the bill, I will be wearing this at least another year or two, especially since my hubby is a Marine vet so he can match me and not spend money on a costume ;-) The only complaint that I had was the material that goes over your bust is like a slip and slide. I am not that chesty so if you are sporting a curvier frame then me it might fit you better. It was easily solved with some tape that I put on my bra so that it stayed in one place. Also, since it is a slicker material it will ride up! Lol the husband didn't mind but to make it more family friendly you will either have to be adjusting yourself every so often or us clothes pins to just attach to your stockings.
B00LYI7J42|5|My husband loves this shirt. He is a martial artist of many years and likes such things as this. :)
B00NLIY0M2|5|I love it! It's soft and doesn't irritate my neck at all. The color is exactly like in the picture . Definitely worth the money
B006SRTD5M|5|Husband is very pleased with Duofold Men's Mid Weight Bottoms. Will probably order more Fall of 2014 for the winter.
B000BRMGJU|2|While this hat looks great and provides great sun protection, it was way too small for my husband and had to go back.
B001H0F3JU|5|I GOT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND FOR XMAS,  HE GO'S THREW SO MANY IN A YEAR AS A FIRE FIGHTER, HE WILL LOVE IT.
B00EUKK34Y|5|This fits beautiful and long I would buy this again.
B00ISTI7HS|5|My son in law was in an accident and had 3 surgeries on his hip, knee, and foot. These worked great, for when he needed to be comfortable and wanted to be able to get to drs appts.
B0047RHHNK|5|Extremely soft!  It's wider than I imagined, but looks and feels great wrapped around her neck.  No more shivering on those cold morning drives to work!
B00PJQEKA6|5|Cute outfit
B009H1A1PW|5|This corset turned out to be way better than I anticipated. Based on majority of the reviews I feared the sizing would be off, but the one I was sent fits perfectly. It looks beautiful and fits comfortably, perfect for special occasions as well as those days where you would simply like to feel elegant, yet sexy. The timing of the delivery was also weeks sooner than Amazon stated.
B00JTKQMZO|5|So soft, I love it! One side of it isn't as soft, but that's not the side you see, so it's not important. I got it in multiple colors and I'd say they're true to what you see on the screen. :)
B00KZZIZUC|5|They were a bit long before washing but after they are perfect length. I love them.
B00ALIKVAA|5|this was the best gift for him. he absolutely love it!<br />great quality and colors. I am going to have to buy him a few more since he thinks he's wearing it everyday lol
B00AE1MWZG|2|I liked the style, but hated the fit. I wear a size extra large (6'3&#34; 225#), this item didn't come close to fitting.
B00S2MFQ1G|3|Really nice dress for its price. Kinda big in the bust area but that is expected being that I'm smaller in that area !
B006ZUA9SM|4|Somewhat low cut for a wedding though! Had to pin it up a little.
B00C2WFZZY|4|I really like the gloves, but the manufacturer (or packager) fastened some big label right through the leather with a staple.  To me, that's a no-no.  Who wants gloves with holes punched through them?  Otherwise, I'd have marked five stars.
B001FAML3S|3|I bought this to put on my lap when I use my laptop. It's great at first but then it gets pretty warm.   It was also kinda hard to activate it. You have to fill it up with water and then squeeze out the air and I did everything the instructions said but the water kept spilling out. So I'm not sure if it should be cooling better than it does and I just didn't set it up right.   On the plus side I've used it on my head when I had a headache and that was nice and cool. I think maybe the heat of my computer is too much for it to handle.
B001CCYE8Y|5|EXCELLENT
B00DGL34EE|5|i got this pants one week early.  very very nice,<br />and the seller:in november i order some onother pants,  what make me very happy,  they send me a free gift.<br /> im very happy this pants to.<br /> great material,  great everything, and the price.<br />if somebody wrote bad review  , cause the person is very fat,  not fitt for the one size.  recommend this seller to everybody.  the  BEST ONE......<br /> me , more than happy.  THANK YOU: IRENE
B009AFR9G4|5|my husband was so surprised.  He has worn a stetson for 40 years.  He loves it.  It is everything that we could want or expect.  The only problem was that I was supposed to get overnight service and it came five days late.  I expect the $25.00 extra that I paid to be refunded.  I haven't tried yet but, I would hope that it would not be a problem.
B009CTUBFE|4|very good but the pockets are too deep.  the separate pocket for the cellphone is a great idea
B00K3W7LO8|5|This wallet is high quality and does exactly what it professes to do - blocks access to card information. The reason I purchased it is because I noticed that the security systems in certain stores were giving a unique 'beeping' sound when I walked through - different than the 'security tag' alert. After some experimentation I determined that something in my wallet was setting it off. I purchased this wallet for the specific purpose of seeing what would happen. The beeping stopped. Case solved. I read some of the reviews about the wallet being thicker than average wallets. It is only slightly thicker than my last wallet, but nothing that noticeable in my pocket. I fully recommend this product.
B002YQ2GF0|5|Excellent
B00FHN9UCY|5|Great fit
B00DD5FXVK|3|3 stars b/c:  Size fits true to form, but sent the wrong design. I still like it, but should have been $10 cheaper. No discount. And makes me look fat. Shame
B00UGTFGOA|3|It's okay,  I expected it to fit as a dress But it barely covers my butt so... Yeah
B00428BYZ6|5|I never write reviews, but this dress was worth sharing with others.  The material is so soft, very flattering fit even for large bust.  I am so happy with this purchase.
B004UUED5E|4|Girlfriend loved this piece and has had no issue when she wares it a few times a month.
B0076R6MVQ|5|I love it! It's warm and very comfortable!
B00FRAPU12|3|These are just okay. I am not a huge fan of the colors I choose however there are many combinations to choose from.
B00D753YDU|2|I wear size 0 or xs but this one is medium or large to me. I like the material but size was too large
B0072ICFUG|5|The large pockets will come in handy. The mens fit design and length are great. It was also affordably priced.
B00JQWD758|5|It's a good shirt. Fits nicely and is soft and comfortable. Has lasted through a couple washes so far. Will probably order again.
B00BGCPQ9G|5|great price and product
B00BSOVCO0|4|Size seems to run a little small, but I was able to easily exchange them for a large. They are stylish and very comfortable
B0056XNRDI|3|Lovely color and very soft material.  Warm and comfy.  I bought it for my mother-in-law for Christmas.  She's less than 110 pounds and I bought her a size medium, but it barely fits her.  It's snug, despite her being under 110 pounds and about 5' 4&#34; in height.  We were hoping the robe would be a roomier fit.
B00KSZWKR8|5|Perfect color and quality.
B00ODT1CZG|5|Great!
B004M6XUI2|2|I bought this wallet about a month ago and it fell apart. The pockets rip off really easily and the size is kind of awkward as well. I guess you get what you pay for!
B007647FNI|4|Fits a little smaller than advertised, so I would advise ordering the next size up.  Looks nice.
B007G7Z1I6|4|was really happy with fit and length.  I am 59 and was going to waterparks with kids and grandkids, felt comfortable in them.  Only wish they had cost a little less.  but would recommend to others, who do not want to bare it all.
B00H7MLE1S|3|The size I ordered is usually a loose fit, but this item as too  tight. maybe even tight enough that two sizes larger would be right.
B007P29CL4|4|These socks are made up of 2 layers---which are great for preventing blisters and wicking away moisture---however I am a little bit of a freak and don't like my socks riding up under my toes...They always feel like they have fallen down in my shoes.  I was trying to wear them for work, but they drive me crazy, so will try them out for running, but not for everyday use...<br /><br />So I have had these socks for a couple weeks now and have randomly grabbed them from my drawer...They have grown on me and are now in my top 10 socks!  I use them for hiking, running and for work.  Now that they have been washed and dried a few times, they fit great, don't feel like they slip at all.  They are warm, so I especially like them for hiking.
B000AXZMDM|3|This beanie is warm, but the sizing is awful. I ordered a small/medium and returned it because it was way too small. I can't really imagine the small/medium fitting anyone but kids.    After I got my refund, I ordered a large/X-large. I knew it was going to be way too big, since I have a normal sized head. I have to fold it once around the ears, and then shape it in at the top.     As another reviewer mentioned, this beanie looks ridiculous on your head. The way it's shaped makes your head look like something's growing out of it.    I would recommend this beanie if you want something warm and don't care about the way it looks. You might be better off getting a cheap one-size-fits-all beanie.
B00DJZJXA6|3|I got this wig to see how I would look with purpke hair.I liked the color but i perfer a more natural part. It also had that cone shape at the top and it was way too shiny, but I like the color.
B004PZHWIO|5|Husband loved them. Wears them out all the time.
B00EPKFEYI|2|Adorable but not good quality
B00LCUUAT8|5|I recieved my rhinestone letter &#34;D&#34; keychain & was very impressed, it was super shiny/sparkly, exactly what I was hoping for. I wanted a new/cute keychain for my new car that I will be receiving in a week. I am 100% satisfied & I will definitely be repurchasing this item again
B000Z15T64|5|Love my Carhartt's !!!!!
B004B8OFGC|1|Buy a size that is 2 times your normal and it will fit. Cool clothes, just really small. I think they should rename skinny not slim
B00C517EMO|5|COMFORTABLE.  FIT NICE.
B00I5L5NUS|4|Big one size,The next time will be measured
B001CKPV88|5|Shipped quickly, easy business transaction.... Plus, my brother loved it for his 50th birthday gift.
B001AQWK9W|3|Pulled them on and my thumbnail split the fabric from the elastic waistband on two separate pairs.
B00IOGFJBW|2|product too small, not very cute and not well made.  wanted to send back
B007JQKPXA|5|This t-shirt is well made.  It has graphics that are easy to see and read.  It was given as a gift and has made a lot of people laugh.
B005QP9GNQ|1|I got a size large but they must be in children's sizes so I needed an exchange. I've emailed a few times with no response. I guess I'll let my children grow into them one day....
B005CVCX5W|5|A perfect raincoat that is both wtaerproof and warm . My grand-daughter loves it.<br />The Hartstrings heart raincoat is a winner.
B00D5S18WI|5|Great wash and wear outfit
B0030XH5VQ|5|good
B00AV3BI0C|5|Perfect fit for my 6 year old.  Highly recommended
B006HT2SPS|4|may be different colors and more variety of colors. that would be good. the fit is so comfortable and great.
B007SOMEGY|3|I love the look of the dress, but is a little big.  I think the dresses should be xs, s,m,lg.  It would be much better fit.  Luckily I can sew, so I will make a few adjustments, because I think the dress is so beautiful
B002IK90ZG|5|These scrubs fit my father-in-law perfectly!  They are easy for him to get on and off as they have no buttons, just elastic, and easier/faster for me to help him.  (Fingers don't work as well when you're 89!) Plus, they have a back pocket and two front pockets for his wallet.  Also, there is no elastic at the ankle, which can be a problem because the scrubs with the elastic at the ankle ride up. It's not so easy for someone who's 90 (7/27) to keep pulling them down when they are cold.  Thank you for having such nice quality straight-leg elastic waist pants.
B00RUE3Y4S|5|LOVE these. Can't believe I used to spend so much for thong underwear. Ordered 2 more &#34;packs&#34; Dec 2016 Bought more but need to add:  They do kind of fall apart after a bunch of washing. The threads come undone...but decent enough for the price.
B00A7TVSDC|5|Nice quality of material. My daughter wore this to a princess birthday party.
B00CE15SF0|2|way too small
B00OVY3H3I|3|These are ok.  If I'd paid full price I would have been disappointed.  The elastic in the wings is cheap.
B00P4C2QBA|1|Cheap looking. Paper thin material. Enormous. Shapeless. The elastic in the mid section was stitched in poorly and the stitching was partially undone when I tried on the shirt. The v neck reminded me of my dad's old undershirts. Very poorly crafted overall. Not worth the money at all. Returns are a hassle so I am using it as a sleep shirt. Arrived on time.
B008XBJZ5Y|5|This jacket is so beautiful!  The leather is soft. The jacket hugs your body with a perfect fit.  I just love it.
B00ESAOL76|5|I love it! it fits perfect. I would buy it again. it can be worn casual or dressy.
B00JE87TNK|1|not good
B00G6SGJCS|5|It's all good!!
B000UZT6Z0|5|I bought this bra in black about 2 months ago, and I'm back today to buy it in a few more colors.  It is extremely comfortable.  No rough seams, easy to clasp and unclasp, not so padded that it makes you sweaty but thick enough to not show if the room is cold. :)  Also, I think it's genius having the strap adjuster in the front instead of the back.<br /><br />I think it's too soon to tell how it will stand up to repeated washings, but so far so good.  I wash on gentle cycle, in a lingerie bag, hang dry -- this is how I wash all my bras; I've never looked to see what the tag of this one recommends.
B00CIBCJ6M|4|This scarf was an excellent price. The material is very thin which is perfect for wearing with a turtle-neck sweater or accenting a more summer type blouse later in the year. It drapes nicely and the color combination of black and white could be worn though all the seasons. Glad I ordered it!
B00JKOKO6C|5|Fits perfectly, and is adorable on my 2 year old grandson.
B000A414PG|4|make sure you rinse before you use....I didn't and almost ripped my nipple off. another words I didn't read the directions first. I'm a size 34 B, and since I'm no longer in my 20's the days of going braless are no more...so this is were this comes in for my halter shirts and dresses...works great.
B005XUIE8M|5|Lets face it. This is a cheap alternative. Sure, I should have gone to mens warehouse, or somewhere else, but honestly, someone just died, it was approaching the weekend, I needed it the next day, and this was the only option I could find that fell within 3 catagories: PLAIN BLACK, Order by measured size, and available from Amazon overnight. It is a significant amount poly, so it is wrinkle resistant, doesnt pick up a lot of lint, the buttons are all plastic so no taking it off at checkpoints with metal detectors. Its just enough to make a redneck look proper on 12 hours notice.
B003299WUU|5|Good Quality Beret, Fit Adult woman perfectly. Halloween costume, but it might hold up for everyday wearing. Great Price!
B00K5R5Z6W|4|I HATE bra shopping. I was a D by the time I was 13 and I now wear a DD. I hate it. Full-figure (or as my family says &#34;Bodacious Tatas&#34;) bras are not cool. They usually cut in everywhere or look like they were issued with a US Marine uniform.  On a whim I purchased this one just to try it and I am so pleased with the fit and support that I am back to purchase multiple colors. Instead of squishing the girls together and making them BFFs, this bra does an excellent job of keeping the girls in their own space--nice lift and separate.<br /><br />I will say, one thing I had to get used to was that, on me anyway, the straps felt like they were wide, meaning too close to the edge of my shoulders. I got used to that pretty quickly though and I find myself wanting to get rid of all my other bras because this one is so comfortable.
B000J3GD3Q|5|Of course I brought the wrong size.  I love the underwear though. Very comfortable. Yes , I would buy them again
B00K8E74KM|5|Bought this bag for my daughter as her first makeup bag, and I loved it so much I had to get one too.  It is the perfect size for makeup and jewelry and I love that we no longer have to take multiple bags.
B00DVC90U0|5|Great pant, but a little too &#34;constructed&#34; - washing instead of dry cleaning will fix it.
B002HEX21G|5|I have purchased several pair in various colors; great fit with the comfort waist and wrinkle free.  You will not be disappointed with this choice.
B00LNV8OMG|5|Exactly as pictured and received quickly. Thank you
B00MGBWM8O|4|Quality jammies for kids. I have purchased several pairs of Leveret pajamas as they have the styles and shapes that my son like. Sizes are true and they hold up well.
B00DMKZGJK|5|very good quality
B00CHNNHIA|4|Its a great upgrade from the simple carhartt hat but mine was a little small fir my head. I am very worried about washing or drying this but until then it keeps me warm.
B00Z051ZHM|5|It's very very small but beautiful if you order a large size
B00UJ5IZSU|2|I ordered an XL even though I am a L and I couldn't even fit it over my shoulders, which are not broad.
B008DTSMNC|5|Even better than I like it, my 4-yr old loves it.  It's a bright red and very flowy and she danced around in it for quite a while when we tried it on her.  And this was on Christmas morning while all her gifts are still to be played with, so it was definitely a big hit!!!
B008DSL17W|5|I love this blouse and am wearing it over black pants - looks very very chic - love the bow effect - and the price the price is so cheap!  The material is polyester - you will see many Asian girls wearing this type of chic blouse - so dressy - now I have to get maybe red shoes to set off all the black I have on!
B000FGJL0E|5|This came in great and just in time for me to make my boys' halloween costumes (Mario & Luigi, bought one in red too). It fit perfectly on my 5 yr old but I had to reconstruct this one to fit onto my 2 yr old. I used black & white felt fabric to put on the L & M on the top front of the hat. They LOVED it!
B00NSS2Y9Q|4|Love the tights. Although they were a little to big. I just have to order a smaller size next time.
B00KQ6RHFO|3|Cute but these ran smaller than normal.  I'd order a size bigger next time.
B008S6HZHO|3|It took a while to come. But it was coming from china, so I understood. I love the pomp pom & its completely soft!! It keeps my head warm. I recommend it to anyone who loves hats.
B00BTPOF9M|2|My son is a size 11 and the Large (11-13) were too small. :( Had to return.
B008GT0D72|5|This baby side snap shirt and hat set is fabulous! The orange trim is tasteful and cute, and the fabric is VERY soft and holds up well after washing and drying. The set is perfect to take to the hospital for a newborn (to avoid irritating the healing belly button area), and to use for the first few weeks so that baby does not scratch him/herself. The shirt is perfect for baby to wear under a sleep sack, too. My husband and I love these so much, we also bought a green and yellow set for our baby boy!
B008DCO33W|5|This was a great purchase for me. I was looking for a different kind of shirt that would do more than just keep me warm and this shirt fit the bill. It was reasonably priced and it fits greatly. My only problem is that the hood is really small and does not really fit me, but i wear hats all the time so it doesn't bother that much. I definitely recommend this to anyone.
B007OUJIR0|4|I have always hated jeans, but these fit great and I don't have to worry about ordering them online. No shrinking
B005ZVUSW4|5|Our four year old feels like a hunter in this sturdy hat with his favorite brand logo. Sizing was accurate.
B00PQVT48M|5|Super, super soft!!!  Washed it once so far, still very soft and fluffy.
B00EV5WBDO|4|Easy, casual scarf. Arrived in a timely manner.
B00EYXEX8O|5|My son loved it!
B00G26Z3UI|5|GOOD
B00LHLAXDU|2|I bought these for myself, I am a size 14 and 5-8. normally I can wear a large in junior sizes quite comfortably, but as these 'run small' so I  bought an extra large. these did not fit even close. fortunately i have a large family and was able to give them to someone who could wear them comfortably and appropriately. she is 5-3 and wears a size 5. they fit her perfectly. also the rise on these hits about the hip. there is very little in the description to state what the rise is. the fabric is thin, but typical of a legging. they are well made and other than the size issue are great.
B005S0TF5S|5|Uniform black socks. They are comfortable light, cheap and black. If you need cheap and basic black socks for work these are the socks.
B00012O1DO|5|Good buy.  Fit good and was as expected
B00CPJOC94|3|The material is thin so I don´t know if they are going to last long, but they fit great and they ´re exactly as the picture.
B005HUC8JY|5|Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my husband from the cats.  It's a tradition.  Since he has not opened it yet, I cannot comment on the quality.  But it appears just like the image, even appears to have a ornament motif in the fabric that gives it more dimension.  I am satisfied.
B00135ZZKQ|5|Makes me feel strong which makes me lift strong,  Added 20lbs on my bench when i wear this shirt.
B00L3X3YDS|4|My wife loves the shirt, though it fits a little big compared to other workout shirts she has. The color is fairly close to what's shown. It's very lightweight and seems to do as good as the Under Armour shirts she has as far as workouts go. The material pulls the sweat away and keeps her as dry as it can. Haven't put it through many washings yet, but it seems to be holding up so far.
B005I3UM66|3|i've been a big fan of these socks and have had several pairs for about 5yrs.  i don't like these compared to the older models. these are thinner. the older models were thicker and had a great cushion
B00OM0GEPO|5|I adore mine.<br /><br />When I first chose this item, the price was out of reach, so I waited.<br /><br />I'm so glad there was a sale.  Since my arms are large for my size, I am always looking for tops that fit loose enough to feel comfy and cool during the summer.  These were just right and the feel and quality of the fabric and the flowing fit of the design is worth the investment.<br /><br />I wear mine with jeans or a skirt as a regular long-length top, not as a beach cover up.<br /><br />Waiting for more sales to get the other colors.
B00DD16EVW|5|Socks arrived quickly, fit great and worked great on hardwood floors.
B00LYI3U0O|5|Excellent
B00ACIGUBI|5|I have always been a fan of these boxer briefs.  I will most likely be ordering another package of these in the near future.  The fit is great, and the price is fair for what you are purchasing.  I like how the supplier got these out quickly, and I didn't pay excessive shipping/handling charges.
B00535QB8C|5|Great that DC is making a BvS movie. Batman is their best hero IMO. I'll be wearing this shirt in the premier of BvS next year. I feel that the quality of the cloth would last a long time.
B004157VMA|1|Cheap costume, size runs on the smaller end, had to go out and buy a different one
B002LKEGK2|5|I know, you see wool and you think \\"warm, great for cold weather, but not for summer\\" right? Well, yes, you're partly right. See, thick wool is very warm, but this stuff is very thin. This wool is actually cooler in summer than cotton or even synthetics as it breaths and wicks better than either. I have one of these microweight T-shirts, and it's great in the summer, especially if you might just get wet. It's also great for layering, I find a lightweight wool T-shirt under a loose cotton shirt makes for a good combo in many conditions.<br /><br />Now yes, there are a few caveats- merino wool is soft and not itchy. But that comes with a cost in durability. Simply put, this sort of very thin merino wool will not last as many washes as other materials will. OTOH, it doesn't get the \\"funk\\" that synthetics often do.<br /><br />To make your wool last longer, hand wash in cool water with Eucalan or a similar product, line dry. Good news- they are machine washable in a pinch.
B008ZW0WXU|1|The bear is so faded it looks like a circular black shadow. Grey cuffs on the arms, not blue like in picture.<br /><br />Sending it back.
B0006YZ0BE|4|Though they likely won't stand up for more than a couple of years in normal travel,  these inexpensive and easy to use tags are just the ticket when you need to ID your luggage the night before a flight.  They're sturdy enough & attach securely to luggage - and are certainly miles ahead of the airline-provided paper tags supplied at check in for use when you've forgotten to ID your bags.  Hard to beat these for the price.
B0050CJ0HC|5|I'm 5'8 feet tall for 123 lbs. I Bought the small size and it fit perfectly, fabric and color are nice. Great deal!!! Amazon prime made this purchase even better it arrived in two days.
B00K6PUCC0|5|Brother loves it!!
B0050SPOHQ|3|Nice Oakley bag , good size but no rubber bottom which if I knew before hand would not have made this purchase
B0001YRWUG|4|Truth be told, I am a little over-weight.  That means bending over when I wear a belt is unconfortable.  Over-alls eliminates that problem.  I work outside a lot and these jeans are sturdy and comfortable.
B009OL7734|4|Good value for the money.
B009QZKVOU|5|Adorable
B006RDRSFE|5|great product! would encourage anybody to purchase!
B00488EKT2|5|This scarf is really soft and warm. Bought a few for Christmas, and loved it so much I kept one for myself!
B006R62SKG|3|It does not fit to size, thats for sure, I ordered a large and it wouldn't have hurt to get a size larger.  After loosening the back a lot I managed to get it where it would fit, but the clasps are really hard to fasten.  Once I managed to get it on it fit decently, it's wearable.  However, it really is a beautiful corset!  I planned on wearing more often than I'm going to, but it was worth the little money spent on it.
B00R5OJ2I0|1|Way too small. I'm a usual medium and could barely get a large over my head. Order at least two sizes up.
B002SQHCEG|2|i didnt get the fit i expected from this...this bra fit my breasts perfectly, but never gave me a lift even when i adjusted the straps...i would not recommend this product
B00C9C6S0S|5|This is one of my favorite black dresses. The satin feels so good on my skin, and it fits my curves perfectly. The length is just right, and the side patch adds a unique style to the dress. I will definitely recommend the Sleeveless Black Satin Dress with Side Patch.
B0008KLZMO|5|Very good shirt for the money. I am happy with this purchase, I would buy again. This shirt would cost much more in a retail store, so I am happy I saved the money.
B00HHH6Z7Q|5|This is one of my favorite fitting shirts. I generally wear a medium in designer size and a large in non designer size. I purchased this shirt in a large size, it is very comfortable to wear and fits great. I am a built individual so for anyone wanting a great workout t-shirt, this is the one. This shirt is now my favorite around the house/casual/workout shirt and I am definitely purchasing a few more.
B00ICT5VIW|4|I expected the shirt to be a bit longer than it was. But great shirt, very soft.
B00NXWMP00|5|Beautiful
B00E7HQ862|4|The design was very appealing to her, the texture of the dress is so soft she wears it directly on the skin (its a hot summer). The pullover is too small but fits her.
B005OFLT7O|4|Good fit, slightly pricey in my opinion
B008SD4N7M|4|Very pretty gown for the price.
B00CLX0HUC|4|I am a lady and I purchased this power rangers pixel blox men's black T-shirt. This shirt functions very well as a t shirt, it fits over the head and then covers your torso very efficiently. Just be careful if you are wearing it out, the gender police do like to question your knowledge of power rangers and minecraft.
B00A16PXKA|5|This is so cute and works well for the plus size figure!
B00519BD0G|4|These extenders have been a lifesaver. I bought a larger width bra with the same cup size and it still made the cup bigger and overall uncomfortable. With these extenders I have been so happy!
B005SICKWU|5|Product was as stated in order.  Great quality and they really do work on smart phones as I tested them out once received.
B00EOWPECE|3|The women's sizes ran a bit on the small side which worried me if it would have shrunk during washing & drying. However I appreciate how quickly I received my credit when I processed my return. I reordered the shirts in men's sizes as they were roomier.
B00412DEJW|5|this costume was amazing the fabric is really good material evryone loved how good it looks well wort the money
B005CSOZ92|5|I was looking for a simple, not so heavy sweater to use mainly on flights or in not very cold weather. I didn't want to spend a lot of money: I forgot my last, much beloved travel sweater on the plane. I wasn't looking for a fashion piece - more of something well-tailored that would provide the function I needed.<br /><br />This sweater fits the bill perfectly. I used it on a plane for two 10-hour flights and it worked perfectly. The hood is nice because you can cover your face from bright light if needed. The tailoring is good and I believe I will get YEARS of use from this thing. It is also quite warm without making one feel hot and I think it will serve even in  quite cold temperatures - say for a short walk, going out in a car, etc. without the need for a heavy jacket.<br /><br />Definitely excellent value. I'm not typically a brand shopper but will take a closer look at Champion to see if their products always deliver like this.
B00DCEHF1I|5|Very fast delivery - Thanks. Perfect fit.
B00MHTQG82|3|It was very well made but just too small.
B00JRC7GD6|2|I had to attach the cape myself Velcro would not stick
B00ANBWGEO|5|Very soft and silky, comfortable and you can wear them inside or out they are so pretty! I have had many compliments!
B00MVMT7Q8|1|Worst product I ever bought on Amazon so far. Just don't waste your money and time with this! The dress is terrible ugly and cheap looking.
B00EJ55MC8|1|If i could give this no stars, I sooo would. I am 4'11. I weigh 115 lbs and have a 36 inch waist. I ordered a small and it didn't fit. I gave it to my 13 old and it fit her but literally tore apart while she was SLEEPING. Runs wayyy to small and the material is suuuper cheap. Don't even bother!
B00BSDWZ60|2|Very thin. Not made for colds but for show in pocket.
B004S06LTC|5|The perfect work pant
B000WTMGNI|5|Exactly as descrbed. Quick shipping. Color as descrbed. Have another pair and wanted a different color. Would purchase again foe sure.
B00CRN01T8|5|MEDIUM SIZE..Amazing! Buy buy buy buy Let me tell you the top has some bright orange and the bottoms as well. The colors look like they can always be tacky, but once you put it on they complement your body so well. The top comes with adjustable and removable straps. It has wire on the sides and very good padding in cup. I am a 34C/32D but its adustable to fit a smaller cup like a B cup  It also has ruffles. The material is very stretchy kind of like bicyclist shorts/track shorts spandex.Even though it's not a thong it can fit like one if you have a big bum. It looks just like the models picture. It has no stitching on the sides or elastic where the leg goes so the bikiny rides up easily when you walk. This is by far the best bikiny I have ever purchased. It is extremely sexy and classy. Will complement someone with tan skin very well. I will be purchasing more from this seller.
B000ROFZCW|4|Great mask, I would give it 5 stars but I have a large head, and it was rather tight on me. Made my eyes squint!
B001FOR2CY|4|I probably should have looked more closely to find the length of it. My waist isn't that wide, and this belt is built for someone bigger than I, although it does fit. Kind of a pain to buckle and un-buckle. Still good quality, though.
B00KBZSYMK|3|My dermatologist told me its time to start wearing sunscreen every day, but I just don't like to deal with it every day.  Also I sweat alot and don't like to constantly re-apply sunscreen.<br /><br />I found these shirts with UPF50+ and thought I would give them a try since my favorite UPF50+ shirts are relatively expensive (about 4x the cost of these Hanes).  They appear to be of decent quality and fit ok but I don't like the shiny polyester they are made of.  I have TASC UPF50+ shirts that are made of cotton and bamboo which is not shiny and feels good on the skin but as I previously mentioned, the TASC shirts are very expensive and I don't use them for &#34;sweating, getting dirty, and working outside&#34;  The Hanes that I am reviewing will get the sweaty work duty due to their low replacement cost and hopefully provide UV protection in the process.<br /><br />Thanks...<br /><br />Thanks...
B003P2VQ8A|3|I order online to avoid running all over stores for my size.  This was the first time the fit was a bit small.  Great support but the first thing I do when I get home is take it off.
B00IALI7A6|5|These jeans just happen to fit my frame great. I have normal legs and a practically nonexistent behind. The way they fit when you try 'em on is the way they'll fit forever, courtesy of the spandex. Wear like casts iron and look good doing it. What else do you want out of a pair of jeans?
B00248WUOA|5|Excellent
B00EBWRNYY|5|Size was perfect and the quality is great.  50 washes in and the artwork is still solid.
B000UT18NE|5|cap is very soft, my 6 year old loves it!
B000ULJDSY|5|It's exactly what I wanted & it fits great I love the no iron feature. I will ,order again. Thanks
B00864NP3Q|5|Daughter is a first-grade teacher.  She LOVES the Big Bang Theory on TV and sings the song often, to her husband's dismay.  She had a chance to wear t-shirt to school one day with crazy pants for a &#34;Crazy Friday&#34;.  Even if most of the kids don't watch the show, the other teachers did--and loved the t-shirt.
B007TXB7GC|5|Great gift, good quality, soft material, good color.  The pentleton shirts are on the expensive side, but my husband loves them a lot.
B005964SKI|3|more or less it is what you expect at this price.. It is not a &#34;Polo &#34; of course having the half price but nevertheless quality could do better..
B00C7TJJZE|5|My granddaughter loves it.
B00JJUPGEW|4|This is a perfect fit, great price and the perfect amount of poof.  The only problem was when I opened the package, there was a very strong chemical smell in the fabric. gonna rate it 4 stars just due to that, otherwise it's going to work perfect!!  I would recommend this petticoat, just wash it up really good.
B00IKBX2RY|5|I was hesitant to buy two sweaters,b but I am so &#34;HAPPY!!&#34;  that I did, I am loving the both of them!!!  :)
B00GW7XNYK|5|very comfortable
B00ACIGM84|5|Have worn Hanes briefs for many years.  Although the sizing and product name has changed over the years, the quality that I have purchased is still good.  Would recommend this particular item.
B00A65MXWM|5|This a very cool decoration for my house.  It's very nice and was easy to hang up.  I like the sturdy material.
B00KDCBN56|4|It was too large for my weist I totally need something smaller
B00JPMY5DC|1|From the quality (or lack thereof) of the merchandise and the return process this would deter me from ordering merchandise from your website again.  I ordered two identical tops from Amazon, one came from Amazon,  one came from Moontree.  In order to return them, one had to be returned UPS postage paid by Amazon, the other by USPS, postage paid by myself.  Two trips for return of one order.  Very unsatisfactory.
B0009MZW34|5|These socks are simply the best I have ever had on my feet; so comfortable in all the right places.
B0009WKHNE|5|Bought this passport ticket holder as a gift and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the leather.  I had it monogramed and received it two days after I ordered it.  It came in a beautiful give box with ribbon.  I looked all over for this exact style and only found it at Royce.  I received something like this from a travel agency and it is so convenient when traveling through the airport.  This one is thin not bulky, but yet holds everything related to your travel in one place.
B001O2JG4Y|5|Keeps hands warm on those especially cold days when worn under your heavy winter gloves. Not bad by themselves on milder days.
B00LLIVQN0|4|Love it!!!!
B003U8XXGM|4|I loved these pants but I believe I ordered a size too large. Most clothes I buy 14 so I thought this would be the same but I believe a 12 would have fit perfectly. Great quality material.
B00T2WBJJ8|4|I bought this to wear postpartum. The fit might be a little iffy for some of us on the bigger size. I'm size M-L on tops and size 16 jeans, and I think I was testing the limits of the stretch of this product. Anyone in the S-M sizes shouldn't have a problem.<br /><br />My favorite part of this product is that its stiff, so wearing it made me work on my posture and sit straight. It was great for postpartum use.<br /><br />I took off a star because it might not work for some of us bigger gals. Also it looks really bulky under clothes. I would only use this to exercise or while lounging at home. Overall, great value for the price!
B00B7972I6|5|I bought this sweatshirt because I love Sherlock and I also love hoodies. It arrived within a week & looked very well made like it will last awhile. The words printed on the front are great a bit bigger than i thought but thats fine! It does seem to run about a size small; I ordered a medium and it fits more like a small so I would recommend buying it in a size larger just incase. Still an amazing product and a great buy. Definitely recommend to any Sherlock fan
B001DCHFMK|5|An absolutely beautiful color, fit my Grandson perfectly! My daughter loved it!!
B00DYR9CW8|4|a little large
B00MI5HCOW|5|its super good!
B00M5CV9AQ|4|I'm 5&#34; 4 157 lbs with a 29 inch waist I ordered a size medium and I don't think it's tight enough I should have gotten a size small other than that I love it
B002R093OK|5|Good fit
B0051U1706|4|The material seems really thin like dress socks. The socks can be a bit warmer. Kinda feels like the same material as panty hose.
B00IZHK7NK|5|Fit well, high wasted. Little thin.
B00A8NOIH0|5|Cargo pants with a tailored fit. True to size. I bought the 29 inch length and the pants were a couple of inches longer than that but not enough to require a hem. The flat front works well on a short man with a bit of a belly and is slimming. Overall, very nice pants.
B009RV1K6Q|5|I hate the new smart fabric or whatever Hanes calls it so these boxer briefs are perfect. I do wish they came in more colors though.
B005NK3XDI|5|Good product, good quality at a good price. Deliverd on time with proper package. Just like in showed the picture.
B00BH6VFOQ|4|OK..this is my second pair.  My first pair was black and my girlfriend threw them out because she was mad at me.  The second pair is tan... I bought the to replace the first pair.  On both pants the waist buttons broke....go figure.  For the money I still give them 4 stars.  I replaced the button with some snap ones from Walmart sewing section.  They're still the cheapest kevlar pants you can buy.  But they are made in Pakistan...so .
B00M9NQ42E|5|Arrived as expexted. item is well pack. The dress is beautiful, fits me very well. it's a &#34;free size&#34; and I'm 5'2&#34;, 180 lbs.  I washed it alone in cold water and add some vinaiger to stabilize the colors in the washing machine at delicate cycle. I hanged it to dry. The colors stayed beautifull.  Fabric is very soft on skin. Can't wait to wear it.
B00HWF8FBM|4|This is my third Champion's sports bra. The fit is comfortable and suitable for light workouts. This is not a bra to use for jogging because it does not provide enough support. But, it's great if you don't want to feel like you've been put in a corset.
B005FJ277K|4|I really like this wallet it is thin and the outside is durable. I have had to repair one of the card holder slots and it needs repair again. It pulled out at the stitches even when not over filled (don't like a full wallet and don't have much to put in it :-(
B00B45627K|1|Shirt was to small sizes run a little small
B00W01O08U|1|Didnt fit
B0076IKJTG|4|The pants are cool to wear.  Unfortunately they are a little tight around the boys and upper thighs.  I got the same size I always buy.  As a guy I never try on pants first anyway, I just have a zen trust they will fit.  If you have big thighs these pants will fit a little snug.
B009T65MRM|5|I just like it, it looks great, it has very good textile quality. If you're looking for great looking and nicely done clothes for kids - consider Bonnie Jean.
B00L9SW596|5|This is such a nice coat and I'm glad I bought it by impulse.  The only complaint I may have is the inside zipper feels a little cheap - but the look is so classic and I love the charcoal grey because it matches just about anything.
B00GUZATBY|1|Very very thin and see through
B00MMMSG8C|3|The leggings aren't as substantial as others I've bought.
B00D6THP8M|1|Don't bother ordering this one...I've ordered twice and both times I've received a cancellation notice from CafePress due to the shirt containing content which violated their Content Usage Policy (CUP). ?!<br /><br />I cannot figure out why it's still listed for sale if they aren't going to fulfill the orders?!
B00387EEYK|5|Classy belt that will impress.
B00GQORTBC|5|Shipped quickly, scarf is very soft! Love it!
B00N5APHEG|3|The top to this PJ set is very short.  The bottoms are extremely long.  Crazy.
B00D1RASRY|1|Tried these with my son - they are hard to hold and use.
B00NML84UW|5|100% recomendado
B00A9VDATS|4|I think if i can choose again, I will choose W30. Now, I am slimmer than before. The color is my love. I can say a fat man also wear fitly. It is really loose.
B00JB75CS8|5|I love this bathing suit. Comfortable and stylish!
B00FSBY2W8|1|Ordered this outfit to find that on the behind part of the pants it reads HELLO backwards. Also returned it and it has been well over 4 weeks and still have not gotten a refund back. I have ordered from Amazon several times and have been very pleased but I will have to rethink another order since it has become so difficult to get my refund. So not only am I out the money for the purchase of this outfit but I am also out the money it cost me to return it which was almost 17.00. So now I am out almost 80.00 with nothing to show for it.So before you order this outfit you may want to think about it before you spend 80.00 and have nothing.....
B00KC3DO2Q|1|XL way too small. Poor material.
B00BS4WHOE|5|I love these gloves.  I purchased &#34;coffee&#34; and have been wearing them for 6 months. I have small hands and they are roomy like gloves normally are for me. I think they are soft, pretty, light-weight, and functional. The grip on the palm if very helpful for driving and I feel I can safely drive.  The I-phone feature works well enough for quick and easy use, but for texting I prefer to take the gloves off. I have been using them in CO. I noticed a small hole forming in one of the gloves and plan to order three more colors now.  For 6 months of use and how I have used them, I am pleased with the quality!
B004EKDHXY|5|I have 3 of these bras.  I had to order 2 more after the first.  It is so comfortable that it is the only one I wear anymore.
B00HX0CT2M|5|I was nervous ordering on line, but thankfully it fit just fine. . . . 5'3 and 140 pounds, hides my &#34;muffin top&#34; and is just the right length. Perhaps I'll order more.
B003DW9O7M|5|Woop woop
B00YXNEG9Q|1|Horrible fit.  Even worse return policy.
B00DEZS24E|4|It works pretty good couse almost every brand has a different neck size and they vary a lot, so the different sizes come in handy.
B003VVPBS6|2|I bought this in my third trimester with the best of intentions, but ended up havng an emergency c-section that made it really uncomfortable to wear during the first month postpartum (when you have to wear it for maximum effect). It was a waste of money for me, and i found it much more comfortable just to wrap my hips and waist in wide bandages.
B0063KEC8C|5|My Daughter is Whovian
B005Z6LRJC|5|The fit and color are perfect. The pockets are holding bottles very well so far. Warm enough for stop lights and wicking away enough for long stretches. No chafing or pulling.
B00DNT5X5M|5|I think this is great underwear for girls, which it should be for this price. I was looking for light, soft underwear, which would fit well but not too tight  but also STAYS in place, moms of preschoolers know what I mean. Great quality.
B00EYXZ4S2|5|I'm not going to rate bad but if it was a bit bigger it would be perfect it looks nice I have to say try making it bigger I know it would sell more.
B000Z4ZX0S|4|I have a 7 month old and we LOVE Zutano. I have run into issues with the sizes so I buy a size or two up and she fits into them well! This hat is an exception. It fits her perfectly!
B0018AH40U|5|This was a very nice suit... it arrived as expected and performs well in the pool. I have ordered several of these and use them daily for workouts.
B00DGWRV1U|5|My husband loved this shirt! He's obsessed with bacon and has a slight belly to prove it so this shirt was a hilarious gift for his birthday and he wears it proudly. He normally wears an XL and that's what I bought him and it fits great. :)
B00EDPZFK8|5|This dress is made up of two different layers and the knit portion is gorgeous. It's lightweight and the skulls look great. The dress portion underneath is somewhat sheer and very thin, but since the layers are separate I can just wear a different dress or tank top under the knit portion and it looks fabulous with leggings. Overall it's exactly what I wanted/ expected.
B002MGB5CC|4|Very comfortable. Love the flare leg.<br />They ate long. Im five feet tall and have to roll them up or i step on thfm
B0009WL3ZA|3|IF you don't care how you look. I used this brand almost exclusively with my second child because it was comfortable and came in large cup sizes... sort of. The large cup design is the problem. The bra kept it's shape for a short while, but before long it was clear that it had gone from lifting and separating to forming the famous uni-breast that sports bras are famous for... to some of us, at least. Whatever had made it work must have washed away, and this bra looks like it should launder well. It was subject to some shrinking, though, further affecting the appearance, and the shapelessness and discomfort of having everything crammed into one place in warm weather killed the comfort that had at least been there in the winter. It works, of course, it opens, you can nurse a baby. You just look like a blob the rest of the time. Not really worth it.
B000WHM270|5|excellent gift with good price
B0037SLMCM|5|It was perfect.
B00LN5Z1XC|5|I love the softness of the sweater. The Batwing sleeves give you plenty of room for movement and the High Low is perfect. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B009XB61JQ|5|It was a present for my dad and loved it, just turn the buckle and belt color changes without problem, one has two excellent product, congratulate, and shipping was fast and smooth, I congratulate you.
B00BCUPB8S|4|Love these jeans. The fit at the waist and are very comfortable. The only complaint is the pockets are very short. Can't put anything in them.
B0018OKO80|4|They are good.
B00P0CHN8U|4|Great came very quickly
B00L3EZL9W|5|Came just in time -- on a Sunday, no less! -- for granddaughter's 10th birthday.  Size 12 fits her just great.  Like the cute skirt and clever top, too.
B0091EHMIY|5|These shorts are really nice. They fit well and are made in the USA. The material is quite nice. I plan on wearing these on a hiking trip in 2014.  They have lower pockets that hold my cell phone on one side and my id/credit card/cash on the other. They are very practical yet stylish.
B00I03HBQU|1|These fit well but didn't come with buttons for either closure.  I bought some and fixed it because they jacked the price up immediately after I ordered them.  They fit great but the quality control is garbage.
B00579RW9G|5|Very nice.  Good price.
B0009MZW34|5|Thorlos spoil you for any other brand...
B00J1LW5ZC|4|I knew it was going to be a little large before I bought it. It is easily remedied by wearing a black knit hat underneath.
B00VZAO3Y8|5|I like it very much. I am 1.72 cm and 76 kg. Medium fits perfect.
B004E0CP1E|5|This is a nice shirt and the price is very good!<br /><br />I recommend the gray one but if you like other colors also are very good
B00L31E6T6|5|Love this bra, highly recommend it
B002DMTJDM|5|The colors are very vibrant and good looking. I have gotten compliments on this shirt  and I'm always asked where I got it.
B000Q7GJAC|2|The hat was really large enough for my big head, however the crown was so shallow, I didn't feel like it would stay on my head if I moved.  I returned it.
B00FX7KC76|5|Ok
B0002TOZ28|5|These are a good sock. I bought a second order. The fit very comfortably. I even run in them and there is no obvious sign of wear in them. The only thing to keep in mind is that if they are folded in on themselves when they get put in the dryer they will not fully dry. So keep that in mind. But i still highly recommend them.
B00NC6PIWO|5|This is a very well-made shaving kit that should last for quite some time.  On the tag Alpine Swiss states that “we take great pride in our products and their workmanship.”  I have one of their laptop cases and was quite pleased (and somewhat surprised) at the great price point in relation to the high quality.<br /><br />The 1200 D Ballistic fabric is tough, one of the toughest fabrics that I see used on backpacks, luggage, and some clothing.  There are faux leather touches, including the handle, that add to the look.  The “leather” is a pebbled one that shouts class.  What my husband needs is something that shouts durable.<br /><br />It is quite durable and it was obvious the moment I held it in my hands. It’s not water-resistant (I tried), but this type of case is not likely to see a lot of water.  The zippers, both on the top and front side, are very solid, work easily, and have solid metal pulls.  No cheap plastic here.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />►  1200 Denier Ballistic<br />►  Measures 9.5” x 6” x 5”<br />►  High quality, self mending, smooth materials with large zippers<br />►  Outside zippered pocket, clutch handle, main zip pocket with wide opening<br />►  Made of rugged and durable ballistic polyester, which expands well<br />►  Block to imprint Initials or name (we do not offer imprint services)<br /><br />The case is lined and padded on the bottom.  It accordions out and can hold quite of bit inside.  The stitching is clean, straight, and there aren’t any stray threads to clip, something I appreciate.  Everything about this kit is perfect.  It can be used as an overnight case, travel one, or used to store toiletries at home.<br /><br />My husband definitely likes the look and is quite pleased with it.  I do have to agree that it is definitely handsome plus quite functional.  No overnight trips planned so in the meantime we are planning on storing a few extra essentials in our emergency kit.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.r review.
B004DQSMH0|4|Somewhat large but stylish. I love it.
B00MH52J64|5|Excellent.
B009Q6W9DU|5|The raised velvet begs you to touch it!!! Amazing looking shirt nice stretch super comfy. My son absolutely loves it!
B00DVA0EPC|1|The jumpsuit is very short and fabric is really cheap and it's also very translucent. It does not look like the picture.
B00559R8OW|5|5'0 110lbs , small costumes usually fit me a little loose this fit was form fitting maybe due to the corset top no alterations needed.  It is really cute .
B0050AFY2Y|4|Good boxer and good fashion the size are perfect fit as expected I love it and I will buy more later.
B00JXOPSM4|5|Arrived on time and fit/look great.  Although that might not be true for every body, it works on my g/f perfectly.  She wears a size 4-6 jeans and smalls fit her great.
B002S63YR0|3|the dress is pretty true to size n the wings r big n pretty although a lil akward, its see thru so i had to wear something under it, n the corset eyelets broke as soon as i tried to tie the strings, luckily the wings hid them, but for the money in only wearing it one time, id recomend it
B006QHNE1S|4|Good quality material, the correct size such as is expected. It is a very elegant shirt and very good price.
B005DDYOZG|5|Very nice fit...there were just a bit long in the lenght..but they shrank up nicely...just have to hem them. I also wore them with a shirt and tie to a high school graduation, and received lots of looks and compliments.<br />a
B00CHNND4I|5|Awesome hat, very satisfied
B00M2G9CHW|5|Love the dress, fits my bridesmaid perfectly!
B001NFTS04|5|Great price and hat has held up. I bought it for a costume but have used a couple times since.
B007C91QKA|5|Ziggy or Aladdin Sane- what a cool T shirt. I get lots of compliments on thiss shirt. the cotton is ssuper soft. My only issue, and it is small, is that Ziggy's face could have been a little smaller on the shirt. I think when the shirt is tucked in that it would look better if they had scaled down the image. Wear it all the time nonetheless
B00PDT1FSY|2|Way too large
B002UUIIM0|4|The training pants seem like a nice product but their sizes are off.  My daughter is tall, average size (not skinny) and 41 pounds.  I chose the Xlarge for 39-44 Lbs.  They are way too big and would have leaked around the legs even after washing.  The sizes of their products are more for stocky kids.  So I am returning them and purchasing  the next size down. I will have to pay for returning them but they waived the shipping on the smaller size order.  They were very helpful on the phone and they arrived in three days.  The same goes for the Waterproof covers.
B009NWPUVA|5|I received the scarves as predicted for delivery date and they are very beautifully made, the ornaments are just awesome and I will wear these with different ensembles to work and for leisure. The packaging was well done. I will order again from this seller anytime, the price of scarf is reasonable and the quality is real nice.
B00C7I8S8O|5|Very pretty. It holds all my plastic containers that I use to take food to work.Very roomy and long strap makes it easy to carry.
B00NJGQERK|4|Ordered two sets hoping for more variety but just got 2 of each color. Still a great buy and would probably buy again.
B00HVVMTSM|5|This bra keeps the girls in check!  It was nice to find a supportive bra that wasn't so thick and unwieldy.
B00LEY6GM2|5|Got a billion compliments!! Very stylish LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
B00MS4RNKG|3|Took a bit to get them on, may work for others. Gave me no relief.
B00BUL9XNS|4|Fit is exactly as expected colours are the same as in photo. Material quality is lovely and plenty of compliments.
B009M02FHA|4|I really like the comfort and material of the shirt as well as the fit. The fit is on the snug side but not super tight like other compression shirts. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I would prefer not to have the contrasting stitching on the sides and shoulders.
B00IKCMPPI|4|This is a good match to the rest of the costume, and is similar to the 2014 version of the story with AJ.  Not a big expense either.
B00ACI365G|5|First time I haven't received a billing receipt in an Amazon Package.  The hoodie fits perfect.  I'll be the talk of our dog friendly community!
B00JE5B0QK|4|Very nice jacket! Great quality for the price!  The inseam ripped right away, but the outside still looks great. Great deal!
B000W0D1K4|4|Good but, it kept rolling down a bit.Thought it would have been a little more close at the top. Good for the price. Denise. Trinidad
B00TDGNFW2|5|Great dress also arrived on time! I was able to enjoy a 1920s themed party dressed to impress. Very satisfied!
B00Q3IDE5Q|1|It wasn't the same that i order, i didnt like the one I got
B00BFQ3OCO|4|Bought these for my husband and he really likes them.  He tends to like the ones with a little give these days, now that he's got a little more cush in the toosh.  Only four stars because they're a little more baggy in the legs than I thought they'd be.  They wash up nice and return to prior wear shape with drying.
B002ZVRVFY|5|This is a well made shirt. Was a gift and they loved it. Shrunk a little after first wash but was expected.  Would order again.
B00NO0DTAQ|1|Very poor quality. I received a broken scarf.
B00B79M7V8|2|It didn't fit but even if it did there is no way I would wear this shirt out in public.  The scooped neck goes down past my boobs and is just too revealing for me.  I would be returning this product if I could find the original tags for it.
B00EDTN9FW|5|i will definitely buy another from the same jeans with different colours if exist its amazing with good quality and nice color
B00QUGO7Z2|4|It's cute but I need to return for a size smaller.
B004S08HG2|4|My son uses these for soccer and tap. Work great and have held up well after a years use and he is tough on clothes.
B000L7L5B0|5|Great
B001SESA6S|5|These are great: nice soft organic cotton. They're a little plusher and smoother than the onesies I had with my older kids. The only problem is finding them! Target has them sometimes, but stock is always low and sizes hard to find. Wake up retailers! There is strong demand for good quality organic products at affordable prices - especially when it comes to baby/kids' items. I would love to find these in long-sleeve.
B00847AR4K|5|Great quality.  Very happy with the product and fast delivery.  Glossy finish.  Certainly worth the price.  The closing strap actually slips under the metal fixture on the outside of the wallet
B00LOUBMCK|3|The only thing,  it faded on me already....
B005CSOCTK|2|This product was not what I expected and had a ripped seam. I wanted a hooded sweatshirt and it was just a tee shirt.
B008B81LP6|5|I bought this because my two boys wanted to be Batman and Robin for Halloween. My husband then proceeded to purchase a full body superman costume to wear with them. I decided I better join the gang. Short of dressing up in a leotard as cat woman I wasn't sure what I would do, until I found this! I wore it with dark skinny jeans and tall red rubber boots. It gave me a cute costume that wasn't any trouble to prepare or wear while chasing my kids around.<br /><br />Beware, as other posters mentioned, that it runs very small. I am 5'7&#34; and usually wear a med or large. I bought the XL and it fit well, but was definitely very form fitting.
B007L5MUBO|3|I got these because I was (duh) throwing together a costume for our local Renn Fest.  I got the extra large because while I'm not fat, I'm not necessarily the smallest guy, and I wanted to have some bagginess and room.  Even so, the extra large fit well in the waist (were even a bit big), but were REALLY short.  I mean, they only came to just below my knees, and I'm 6'1&#34;.<br /><br />So, these might work for someone that's Hobbit size a bit better, or if you have full out knee high boots.  My boots came to mid-shin and I could BARELY tuck in the pants, let along blouse them.<br /><br />The material overall is about what you'd expect for a costume shop; not necessarily great, but workable and decent enough for a costume.  It was actually quite breathable, and the pants overall were comfortable.  Just too dang short.<br /><br />I kept them anyway, mainly because if I ever have to work in a flood they'll be perfect.
B003PBTGX8|2|leg opening is too large, also i don't like the color.<br />dark stone wash is more favorable for me to have
B002QB0URO|5|This was a gift for my grandson (who is picky).  It fit fine and he loved it. Vivian
B002MGB5CC|1|Purchased a large, came in a large package, the pants said small & were child size had to send back.
B00HUONXJE|3|the coat is very warm, but the small problem is that the buttons isn't very well secured, i already had 2 popped out without me noticing within the first week.
B00EAIXXR0|5|Great shirt, especially for the price!  It is nice enough to wear to work but also casual enough to wear on the weekends.
B00FVWIRH0|4|At $4.50 a glove, these are worth having even if you just want them as emergency gloves in your car.  Super warm, and waterproof - I  bought these as a frugal option to clothe my 4 kids ages 4-10yrs old.  (The gloves were a little too tight on my husband, fit me perfectly, fit my 10 year old well, fit my 6 and 8 year olds with room to grow, and though my 4 year old barely reached the base of the finger tips, she was happy to use them as mittens.)  These are a must have for us during our rainy season where temperatures range from 20-40 degrees.  It only snows here twice a year, so these were perfect to outfit my family for two winters and plenty of time playing in the snow! (Maybe they would have lasted longer had I not washed them in the washing machine.  Unfortunately, they fell apart - my bad) Note: I also had the kids wear a cheap acrylic glove under these when we had a &#34;wet&#34; 20 degree snow day - everyone stayed toasty and dry. This is a great buy for any parent on a budget!
B00TKWAZAY|5|Great
B00DGOKCZK|4|I recommend for eventual swimmers
B00D3WPALG|3|Their cute but they are too slippery.
B003ZSB3NW|5|I use to teach zumba, and for the price of this, the quality was really great. I've had it for a few years and it still looks brand new!
B00O8WPX8U|4|Kind of big, but alright.
B00DFYIXPM|5|Love it
B004W5MOHQ|4|Not bad, but the color was not my favorite.
B0138PLV6U|5|Very comfortable and warm! Fits perfectly and makes for an excellent gift for a friend. Fabric blend is both environmentally friendly (50% recycled materials) and financially affordable. The availability of colors is also a huge plus. If you know someone who is a fan of scarves or want one for yourself, I'd highly recommend this one.
B00SLFHCIE|3|Wish it was a little tighter but not too bad. Quite satisfied
B001AOPZMI|5|I loved the size, colors and feel of this Sarong. Would highly recommend. Really have nothing else to add but need to reach the word count.
B00IO90SBK|5|Love this shirt. Have gotten tons of positive comments about it.
B0098V48XM|5|Fits well and is light and perfect for Autumn.
B007TU6DYQ|5|Beautiful! Excellent quality and fit!  Made my 15 year old teen very happy!  Wears with jeans and boots all the time!
B00FCFU57Q|4|Luv it.  Just could be slightly smaller.
B000EBJYBQ|5|Run a little large but comfortable and durable. Nice to wear when it is cold out or when i need to get dirty
B00FEES1Q2|5|I bought this jacket for my son-in-law. It fits perfect and he loves it! It did take a while to get here but we are very happy with our purchase!
B00AOC4078|4|They are soft, warm and fun.  I actually meant to order the medium/large and wish I had.  The small is VERY small, really child sized, but that was my error, not theirs it says that pretty clearly in the description.
B00GFIV7R6|5|This shirt fits great. I like the colors.
B00LAFSNDK|1|Shirt ran ungodly small. Got a 3x and it fit like a 1x...
B00BBW6QSG|4|It's a great shirt, although it was smaller than expected, and it's not quite as thick as I'd hoped.  Overall an okay t-shirt though.  I would order this, over any of their other styles, because the cotton is thicker.  Apparently all t-shirt brands are making their shirts thinner and thinner, so now you have to buy the thickest available, just to get a shirt that's going to hold up for any length of time.
B00910VFS6|5|excellent QUALITY and super comfy haha came in great packaging no rips no tares nothing absolutely immaculate :)) I might buy another lol
B007GB5W0O|5|Excelente.
B00805CXBQ|5|love it
B008P7ZZ6Y|2|way cute until it randomly came apart at the seams. I was so embarrassed! It didn't even fit tight, it was loose like in the picture and out of no where the seams came undone and I was left showing a whole lot of side boob in public with my kids and parents. Very poor construction
B005GQ4JP0|4|Comfortable fit, size is fairly accurate, the chocolate brown color is very nice, material is not high quality but is comfortable. Could be priced less for a better deal.
B00IPDFCA2|5|The bathing suit is beautiful but too small. The different sizing makes it hard to order something and have it fit. The product arrived early and was in grape shape, no flaws. My daughter is going to love it!
B00F4INFAK|2|Size chart was wrong , up date that and we might order again, my daughter was so unhappy that she didn't get to wear
B0047O3RIC|2|Yuck! Got the nude color for a strapless dress but am sending it back.   The few upsides include:  * the top seems like it will stay up  * sizes seem true to size    The big downsides include:  * the fabric is completely see-through (I would need a slip for the slip)!  * Very little smoothing  * VERY poor quality -- besides the super thin fabric, the bottom has no hem and was just cut across with scissors and UNEVENLY with jagged edges at that!
B009P54TYO|4|These pajamas were really cute.  The fit nice and were sent as expected.  Had no issues.  My son really liked them.
B00A0HYXXI|5|Color is a true blue and not as teal as photo shows.  Fits great for my daughter who has a longer torso.  She's worn it for a year now and the quality is great, it still looks new!
B00CD9SZD0|5|runs a little bit small. Very flattering
B00Z0O78RE|1|I ordered XL. What came is more like a petite size 2. I gave them to my little sister.
B008L625CG|5|Adorable! Amazing quality, great price and nice packaging. Makes a great gift! My niece LOVED them.
B007UO4618|5|Show your rebel pantera spirit and sport this killer cap. Miss you Dime!!!!! glad the behind the music Pantera was on this week. \m/ \m/
B00DON35ZW|1|I like the hat but the decoration fell apart as soon as I took it out of package. Very upsetting to me
B008R50TYM|5|Hard to find sizes and wrinkle free. Great for business casual as well as under suits. Will continue to buy. Great price and nice color.
B003H6DC9K|3|These look and fit great - until you sit down.
B003JD3WIW|5|Well... like other reviews said the fabric of tutu is very fine and thin. i was little bit disappointed at the first time but the volume of the skirt was great i l've never seen a tutu looks fluffy like this. I like the wide band and the white ending parts as well. i totally fall in love this skirt. I matched this with a black bra and a bunny hairband and it worked perfectly.<br />I will keep an eye on the seller cuz he or she has definitly a great taste.
B00Y2EP23A|3|Nice and comfortable.
B00JGIXDP6|5|love this top, moves well, and looks great under a sweater
B00GG056SY|5|Great jacket! Short, sweet, and classy. The color is gorgeous and the buttons add the right amount of pizazz to make it fun.
B004HX7054|5|Love this outfit on my little man. Fits well and is very soft
B00EHJMF5I|5|still love them
B00B5BHXA8|4|These cufflinks are so handsome!!! I'm very pleased!  They are a gift for my best friend and I'm sure he will enjoy them!
B00HVT9Y9Q|5|I am right in between an XL and XXL in most brands of shirts.  So fortunately for me, this is a perfect fit.  Good quality shirt at a great price.
B004LLI6AA|5|I have a baby boy and I am tired of buying blue cloths to him, so I tried this one and he looked awesome and the attire was a lucrative deal for me as I got socks, hat  and a wonderful additional accessories.<br />Although the size which I took is 3-6 months at that time, but my son who is now 8 months and one week is still wearing the Creeper & pants and I can assure you that my son is 9.5KG now.
B004070POU|1|These fit tight on my friend who is a size 10. I cant even get them on and I'm a slim 13 at most, but I wear 11 in Levi's.    Roxy has a terrible problem with sizing; everything is marked 2 sizes too big.
B004HVE8Z6|5|This credit card holder is so durable.  I bought my first one in Hawaii years ago and it has held up so well.  I've had one for years and it holds all my credit  cards. I bought this one as back up but don't really need it yet.<br />Outstanding product and service from this company
B000798I9Y|5|Didt buy these for anything special other than i like baggy pants. they are cool and fit well. will be buying a few more pair of different color
B003KQ696A|5|I gave this beanie a five star rating because it is straight quality! It's not too tough and not too soft, but just right. Also, if you live in an area that is cold, not cool but cold, it'll protect you from the elements. Good stuff!
B00382E6SO|4|Son loves it for the design - not as soft as others I have purchased though.  I think the graphics make it more rough.  But he doesn't mind and he's had eczema since he was a baby - this doesn't irritate his skin enough.
B0046NCI70|5|Love this costume.....it was a big hit!!! Well made & comes with jacket & hat.
B00D2CMHYA|4|This product desciption says cowhide, but it looks like synthetic.  Nonetheless, I've had an older black one that been so easy to use and keep organized.  Would order again.....
B007WA38OQ|2|The material is not of good quality and the size is extremely small
B00FB6H6FU|5|A++++
B00LCCZLZE|1|This is too small and the quality is not what I expected.
B00N5PQJS4|4|Fits good , ordered as recommend on page. Sleeves are somewhat large and the elastic at the bottom is loose. I did use while in the mountains and it maintained the warmth. I would buy it again.
B009VI0H7S|4|The shirt fits as expected.  It did not shrink in the dryer or anything.  The material I a little thin so who know how long it will last.  But I do like it.
B00CDPADEI|5|When I opened the package and saw how small the dress looked, I was a bit weary. I am 5'2 and 145 pounds, so I'm not a teeny gal, but I put the dress on, and it fits like it was made for me! The material is soft and flowy, the design is cute as all get out and the fit is loose but form friendly at the same time. I am very happy with this dress.
B004J4BGHY|5|This is a great shirt.  The graphics are great.  The material is very soft and light.  It is a perfect summer shirt.  It is not going to stick to you like a fried egg on an old cast iron skillet with no butter on the surface.
B00BWJ2TR0|5|This is my new favorite undergarment.  It's great under pants or a skirt/dress.  It gives a little control but is great for helping a full figured woman wear a dress without her thighs rubbing too much together
B00RJSKZIS|4|I received this dress today. It looks cute but it is a bit short.<br />the material doesn't stretch but it is a good quality.<br />i am 100 lbs and i ordered medium.<br />it fits but i just wish to be tighter.
B00FNN8UVA|2|This just did not fit right. Shoulder straps too loose and fall off
B00CIZC0VW|1|Very disappointed looking at the picture you can tell its Sheldon but when I got it it looks nothing like him at all, what a WASTE of money
B009P2RG2Y|5|I order for my son and he loved it , quality is great and fit him perfect. We got it fast too
B00K755NFA|5|Buy your normal size though. Most of the reviews said they run small so i got a large. I need a medium and the company i making this happen for me :) The quality is great. It looks just as good as the pictures. I'm 34&#34;under my boobs, 31&#34;waist, and 40&#34; hips. I'm 5'8&#34; and 150 pounds. I hope that helps you pick your size.
B002SW3EUG|5|My lo is 7 1/2 months old and didn't mind wearing these at all. They're polarized so they block the glare without making it too dark. Now we just need a day at the beach!
B00N9W8W7E|1|The 2x would fit a size 14
B003L7HXV8|4|I give it 4 stars based on the looks of it. It looks pretty but unfortunately I haven't been able to wear it yet because I need to figure out how to make additional holes to make it fit.  5 stars if it would have fitted.
B00CVSDVZU|4|Cute paired with white skinny jeans and a white tank.  Lots of compliments!
B00ER6U198|5|Beautiful dress fits perfect
B00L3SYYNC|5|Keeps my little one perfectly warm even in a cold house!!!
B008191BDM|3|The width is fine but the shirt does seem shorter than most others.
B00LWAKFF2|5|Good stuff! Feels good looks good!
B00PGLMU06|5|This is exactly what i expected from a bra in this price point.  Good fit- not as nice as the really expensive ones- but it does the trick!
B00USQ02IG|1|way smaller than the size I ordered. I returned it.
B001AIKKL0|5|SOON AS I SEEN IT I LIKED IT. SOON AS I PUT IT ON I FALL IN LOVE WITH IT. I ALWAYS WANTED ONE. VERY HAPPY!
B005NFLRC2|5|When you put this on, it feels like you're wearing PJs...and I mean that in the best way!! It's really comfortable for denim. How great to have a great looking, flattering skirt that is also comfortable?! Highly recommend this.
B0012XY2X0|5|CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS BRA.  LOVE IT.  IT PROVIDES GREAT SUPPORT FOR LARGER CHESTS.  I'VE TRIED OTHER BRAS AND THEY DO NOT COMPARE.  MY ONLY WISH IS THAT IT CAME IN OTHER COLORS-IT MAY, BUT I'VE ONLY SEEN WHITE.  THE SHOULDER STRAPS ARE NOT TOO WIDE AND I AM ABLE TO UNSNAP THE CUP WITH ONE HAND.  HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS TO MY FRIENDS.
B00P92S9MA|4|Need 2 more larger size
B00MB0OJP4|1|Terrible
B000M67LRM|5|Heavy weight material just like in the &#34;old days&#34;.  Did not shrink after first wash.  Works well with boots.
B0013HEIXO|5|Bought this gift as a present and the recipient loved it. Great quality, especially for the price, and a really beautiful color.
B0072DEWCK|5|I bought my first one several years ago and liked it so much that when I wore it out I wanted another one like it.  To be honest, this may not be the exact same model I had before, but the style is just the same.<br /><br />I like the smaller size, I'm only 6' 3&#34; tall and I don't like large wallets.<br /><br />I also like the two currency compartments.  I use one for cash (yes I still carry cash) and the other for receipts.<br /><br />The quality is great and based on the last few weeks, I expect to use this for years to come.  I may buy another in case it isn't available when I wear this one out.
B00LIOV3AS|5|She loved it
B0018LIDA4|5|My father likes playing chess very much and so I bought this tie for him. He says that it is so cool and extraordinary that he couldn't even imagine
B003FISUC4|5|I like it and it fits just right.
B00IUGM9H8|4|I was not sure about getting this through the internet, but I was not disappointed as it fit my tall frame and large shoulders, even the sleeves were long enough.  Being the last one in my family to get a Carhardt, I am very pleased with this product!
B00TYMTU5G|4|This is a cool T-shirt, but understand that fabric will shrink after 1 or 2 washings/dryings to a size smaller than purchased.
B00CHXOZP4|5|They are adorable! My regular size is 9,5 and it's fits perfect! Soo comfortable! I did order another pair! Highly recommended
B00QLWII32|4|Overall these shorts (I bought the gray ones) are great but there are a couple issues. First, they don't have a gusset. If you're not familiar with a gusset, its the lining sewn in the crotch area. If you wear these shorts for running or anything else that makes you sweat, the lack of a gusset will make you look like you peed your pants. If you normally pee your pants this will probably have zero effect on you. Second, the waist is pretty high. They come all the up to my belly button. The nice thing about that is they don't slip down. Bad thing is you look a little like Urkle.<br /><br />Some good things about these shorts are the fabric is soft and comfortable. There's a small pocket that can hold a key or even an ipod nano. And although they are described as compression fit, I think they fit like typical running shorts. They're not too tight and run true to size. I'm 5'1 and 125 lbs with a 26.5&#34; waist and the medium fit perfectly. But by far, the best thing about these shorts is the legs do not ride up. I didn't have pull the legs down once in a 5 mile run. Yay! For that reason alone I'll buy another pair and let strangers stare at my pee pee pants.
B00DDSLA3C|4|I bought this cap for a friend as a birthday gift. It arrived in great condition! Fast shipping! I'm very pleased with my purchase. Great item...Exactly as Advertised!
B001PUFOU0|5|This was made from polyester (which was disclosed).  I'll admit that my expectations were low and they were met.  It was a bow tie that I needed for a one time event.  Self-tied bow ties look much more substantial than clip ons so I highly recommend it.  Shipping was fast or at least adequate since I didn't even notice it.  You won't find a better bow tie for the price.  Dirt cheap. Quality is acceptable for a few-time uses.  I wouldn't pass it off as an heirloom or anything.
B00CYPXPHO|5|Love it!
B009R1BZPM|5|Everything was met as expected.  No problems with the entire experience.
B006GG53NQ|5|I like it very much. It's just a perfect gift for a guy.  He love it...I thing.  The material is very nice and soft. Also, is very beautiful.   The only thing to change is, that when the delivery agency ship this item, have to make more care to packing it well, in order to save the packing as well as they can. My box was damaged. The item was OK in all senses. Thank you.
B00E64MYXW|2|The upper legs didn't offer enough room for comfort. Material was nice, but legs skimpy for larger men. Too tight.
B00KBZT87K|5|i like
B000VTPBDQ|5|Socks feel great & are virtuality seamless. They are priced very competitively  plus they are made in USA. I will buy these again in another color. I ordered men's Med. and they are true to size.
B00CR352VU|5|These little booties are so worth the money.  They fit as they should (which isn't always the case with baby shoes/booties), easy to put on and the best part is they stay put! Every baby should have a pair of these.  They are light enough to put on a pair of little socks first, especially in winter, but yet light enough for spring/summer/fall wear.  BEST I have found.
B000SZNW3E|4|Everything I expected except my favorite color is no longer available.  Perhaps the best product since nylons were discovered.
B0083SC450|5|great coat,perfect quality, NOT that warm, but warm enough for winter in New York, my daughter loves it.<br />Highly recommended
B00QZW0Y7G|2|Made for small built. I am an XLW. The material feels nice.
B00J504PPW|1|Pants fit fine but its like they sent me a shirt that was 3 sizes to small! Kind of disappointed over the shirt not fitting. Pants fit so I guess they got that right at least...
B00FX9ZVN4|5|This coat looks great on him and is very warm!
B001V9LTJK|4|Very cute and fits nicely besides the straps being too loose on me and not being able to tighten them.
B008MB9668|5|It was a real nice big scarf.  I thought I was getting a small scarf and cheap looking, but this was pretty big and feels nice.  Love it!!
B00OIKLYRQ|4|Very good quality, better than I expected. Just wish they were a bit bigger around the upper elbow.
B00RKEAPZO|3|Length is great but these are tighter than some I had previously purchased.
B00PVMIV8A|5|Fun and flashy!  My little girl loved these pants!  I want some in my size.
B001C1IRHY|3|This hat absolutely does the trick, it gives my 4 month old a good area of shade for us to enjoy the beach without having to bring a tent or an umbrella. The downside?  She just doesn't like it, she will tolerate it, but would much rather have the full range of view without a hat.  Sometimes it can be a struggle to keep it on or to make sure the tie isn't rubbing her neck because she wants the brim pushed back.  When we need her in the shade it's great to have, and folds up small- we take it off if it isn't totally necessary.
B005X5FG2O|5|I am a 38E, this bra has allowed me to get back into working out and even.. running. It is comfortable, looks great and best of all, it works. It holds it all in without squishy you out the sides so your arms are not hitting the sides of yoru breasts while working out & lifts and seperates so you don't wind up with a \\"Uni-boob\\". Hands down the best bra of any sort that I have ever owned.
B00BMEJRKM|5|Great jacket for those who love rocker & moto fashion style.  Great craftsmanship, good fabric, & strong zippers.  Great for a night on the town or as a signature piece for your wardrobe.
B009Y9QCCS|5|My favorite socks for hiking and with work boots
B00CQCPPJQ|5|Love this jacket. It is very well made and seems to be warm and comfy! Print is super cute too!
B00N8GIFLO|5|i love it very much. it is stretch, and fit me very well
B00R9DYH7S|5|High quality.
B00EPP15VE|4|The only thing I'm disappointed about is the colour. It says peach but it is actually more of a neon orange. Not as nice in my personal preference.
B00BTPOO70|5|I liked the costume.  It just ran small.
B00CSYU59C|5|the 5 year old girl that I purchased them for loves them.  they are very good quality for the price
B004WKT424|5|This bra is so comfortable, it almost feels like you're not wearing one. Great colors and the straps are amazing. Delivery was prompt and on time. Thank You
B009LMQVCO|5|love this shirt. The material is clingy, so careful to those of you who don't like that. It fit as expected and it's great for breastfeeding my baby. Very comfy too.
B000OQN9CQ|5|Excelente
B00OV3B1CI|5|Very good price and I love the color.  It's perfect for spring.
B00QJBJSZW|4|to small
B00MQKPJBC|1|Too tight of a fit. Xlarge is a 7 to this manufacturer. Those of us with a 71/2- 7 3/4 know that won't quite do.
B0027VT5TW|4|I had to do some alterations on this. It was a little too big (I'm an 8/10). Once I did, it looked ok.
B00ZI7ZQX6|1|What a joke this but was lol if I could give it no stars I would
B00I0XXS5I|5|I love this dress! I'm 5'3 175 lbs and the large fit perfect. Now I want to order one in every color!
B00C4XUPY2|4|I believe this is a good value item, magnet is strong and looks nice, also came boxed which means a great deal when presenting as a gift.
B00OD4ZQ1M|5|The shipping was fast and the item was as described . Although there was a handwritten note on the tag that said &#34;happy birthday&#34;. This was awesome it also had a small hair clip for my little girl.
B00GTH6778|5|This dress is super cute. It is very short, more tunic length but adorable with black leggings or super opaque black tights. The bottom is very bubbled and does remain flared. The quality is very good for the price. The top is a stretchy black completely opaque fabric with a tiny faux leather trim at the collar and cuffs. The bottom stripes are stretchy lycra scalloped trim of a great quality. The small fits a size 6 ladies US. The top is flexible in regards to size, as it stretches. The bottom is so flared that any hip size from 2-10 will work. Really haute couture for little cost.
B00K6RKL24|5|High quality product!  My son loves it and wears it every day in Boston
B00P8777VA|5|Bought this for my husband and he loves it!!
B005D7KSU2|5|I ordered this because it looked simple and versatile, but upon opening it, it's much prettier than in the photo. quality seems good, and the fabric is very soft! Fits true to size. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B00GJ8DOGE|4|they socks
B00VMB3AK8|5|Nice weight fabric but a titch too small at the bottom.Typically I wear a 2X but would get a 3X next time.  Fast ship!  I love the color!
B00L40ZYNS|5|This capri is labeled Slim Fit, which is not mentioned on Amazon's description.  It's is tight fit and it shows your carves quite elegantly, which you don't normally expect from a pair of cargo pants.<br /><br />The rinsed black keeps the pants from getting stained easily, meaning not easily visible.  This capri is perfect for a relaxing summer walk around and bike about.<br /><br />The material is also thin enough for warm weather and strong enough for rough activities.  It stretches a little bit to allow you to bend and kneel comfortably.  You can do some light garden work in it without any problem.<br /><br />I recommend it!
B00KIHPZ14|1|I fit into size 12 clothes and they are slightly loose on me.  This skirt is stretchy which is the only reason it goes on at all but I would give it a size closer to 6-8.
B00R25GI7K|5|This A beautiful boot!  A really good fit and looks wonderful!
B004GCI9Z6|5|This is a lovely dress and like all the Bonnie Jean clothes it is well made, and will last to be passed down through the family.
B00N7KLOP0|5|The only brand of bathing suit bottoms I buy now.  I ordered a large because I didn't want them to be too tight around my hips, and they fit perfectly. I'm 5'7 and 145lbs.<br />I love these!!!!
B0008EOG3A|5|Nice fit, even shows off my son's butt! Great color and seems to be well made.  Reasonable price.
B003JUPXLE|2|I run 5-6 miles a day 5-6 days a week, and I sweat like crazy (I mean, you can wring puddles of sweat out of my shirt). With that said, I've tried Band-aids, tape, these things, and Body Glide. Body Glide is the only product that really worked well. Once I start sweating about halfway through the run, these things fall right off. Band-aids are, in fact, even better at staying on. Not to mention the fact that they aren't too comfortable. I recommend using Body Glide instead of this, but if you don't sweat a lot, I could see these working better.
B00R9QV2TQ|5|Work good. My baby is 5 months old and they fit pretty good. He hated outside because it was too bright but with these he loves it outside!
B0065QDSYI|4|They get the job done.  They're pretty good but the fabric a little scratchy.  Not my favorite, but a good, cheap option.
B00ELC41K8|5|these work well for potty training. i've used these type of training pants on 5 of my kids during potty training. they will catch little leaks but won't prevent wet pants if your child has a full accident.
B00S0V2EDW|3|Needed to be smaller. Very good equality.
B00DI0L6JS|5|This is a shirt built for comfort--around the home or at a park; also great for travel because of the pockets.  While not the world's best looking shirt, it may be the world's most practical shirt.  Highly recommend.
B00265CZUA|5|The costume fit perfectly and was machine washable.  It was the hit at the Halloween party!  My boyfriend looked very sharp in the costume.  I would recommend to anyone.  The price was reasonable and it shipped on the day it was supposed to.
B00IPUJURQ|3|The seam was torn upon taking it out of the packaging, I was able to sew it but didn't end up wearing it anyways. It is ok for the price but I wouldn't order it again.
B00F4DMONO|3|Comfortable singlet.  Somewhat longer than expected.
B00809MBGE|5|Love love loveeeee
B00MEB6YV2|5|Expensive feel and quality for an outrageously great price! The fabric is very forgiving so I'm exchanging it for a smaller size to really show off that booty;)
B002GHC2EW|3|This is a really nice looking hoodie. The heather grey looks nice with jeans and it's not too thick or thin. It's right in the middle. Fits well and seems pretty durable even though it's not that thick.  Not much more to say about this but one thing I didn't like was that the zipper was kind of sharp and I sometimes caught it against my chin. It didn't cut me, but I definitely had to grill my zipper for a second.  I'm about to get a few more of these probably in black and navy blue. I recommend getting these for those chilly nights. One negative is that it's short, and the xxxl long is too long.
B00742VS3U|5|My toddler is very petite for her age so finding underwear and potty training items is very difficult.  She weighs 21lbs and these training pants made it possible to potty train!  Thank you Gerber!!
B00CWAB0Q4|2|Too much of a hassel to return. It's thinner than a hoodie and not quote the size it was supposed to be. This is not a coat.
B007SP36HE|5|Very fast shipment. I ordered by 5pm one day, and got it before noon the next. The fabric is a little thick, so becomes a bit warm if wearing for a while. Probably not as bad if you aren't under stage lights though. It's a nice golden color that adds a great touch of color.
B00OIONUPQ|4|Sexy dress, I'm 5'3 113lbs but have C cups so for my frame, my breast are considered big (even thought it's just a C). The peephole neckline was a little too much of a plunge for me because my girls are practically given full access to. If you have smaller breast it won't be a problem. I ordered the smallest size and it fit very nice! It's wasn't too tight and still had room for extra space (i'm naturally very slim). The material is cotton and I like how it looks on me! I'll just wear a granny bra to lower the girls so they aren't being exposed too much, HA!
B00QUWX4LE|5|Nice backpack, my 7 year old loves it
B00KLV6K6G|5|These are now my new favorites. After moving to a beach area with bike riding paths, I realized that I needed something other than boxers for support, which these briefs provide. These also look better than the all cotton briefs. Just about the right coverage too. My pants size is 34 and the mediums fit just fine. Colors aren't bad either. I would like to see offered a 3 pack of all grey and all black with a black waist band. Waiting for a sale to pick up more!<br /><br />Update: I first chose medium as my pant size is 34, but they shrank slightly (I used warm instead of the recommended cold water) and were uncomfortable.  I measured my waist and it was actually 36. I purchased the large and they are just right.
B00M0L42Z6|5|Was am white elephant gift. Because it was something I bought myself and it. ... Just wasn't quite what I expected. So I re gifted it. Lol, no one picked it Don the non Christmas bag it was in I think. But my teacher wanted to find out what that was and she was sooooo excited. She instantly fell in love with it and didn't even show anyone else because she was stealing it, lol. It turned out to be an amazing gift.
B0084ANB7C|1|Bought the shirt in XXL and it's more like L in normal shirts. Just keep that in mind when buying. Otherwise, love the colors and fabric.
B007W2N6Y6|5|Good quality, quick shipping. Bought for my husband-and now I'd like one!
B004D38QFQ|5|GOOD
B0018OKO30|3|Started 38x34 (normal size)....way too big. Went to 36x34 (too small). Overall, Levis Jeans used to fit me perfect. Now I can't order on-line as each pair seems very different. My normal size is 38x34 but I have some that size that fall off me and a 36x34 that fit perfect.<br /><br />I would love to order online but the size differences will force me to buy after trying on. Sadly these will be returned!
B00OACNDQW|1|LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. The wig is a lot redder and the style is totally different. Don't buy it.
B004DCADKS|3|Fits as expected, however, the materials used do not seem to be up to Levi's normal standards. I typically buy my 559s from the Levi's store and they are thick/durable denim. These are thin and already fraying. I figured all Levi's would be made from the same denim but I guess I'll have to keep going to the mall for my jeans
B00EIGGK4M|3|ok quality but it is very fashionable
B002HOH974|4|I purchase this short sleeve coat, just because the price ....it turn out very good. I like that it has thermometer / pen pocket on the sleeve. The only reason I didn't gave an excellent rating is because after washing this coat the fabric gets fuzzy
B00PD95OKY|3|I like the jeans...they are just too low waisted for my ample backside.
B00OXH45DE|1|Runs extremely small.
B002IRIIXO|5|Fits well and I love it.
B003EH83I2|2|The actual wallet is a very bright, very glossy red.  It looks better in the picture. Fine for a woman, not so cool for a man’s wallet.
B000A2KAWG|5|I love these jeans great fit and I already know they will wear well.
B00QEDLOMK|5|It fit just as expected.
B00FBD2G0I|5|These are my favorite crew socks. They fit great on size 9 wide feet and do not cut circulation off in calf/lower leg like some socks do.
B009C95YYW|4|Comfy shoes for home. I washed it and still looks great! Love the color and design. Very basic padding, if you want more padding this is not your choice.
B00PS8E4A6|4|Very cute. The arms of the sunglasses are a little long though.  When my baby sits back on a chair or in his stroller, the glasses come off his face.
B00LHT0X46|5|Product was as expected, for a great deal. Everything was great and I would highly recommend to anyone.
B00HF1K1FG|5|Very comfortable and well made. The material seems durable and doesn't wrinkle easily. That's it really, but the box is telling me I need to write more words to post a review.  Okay we're good now!
B00K6M8SK6|4|Loved the hat. My head wasn't small enough to fit the wonderful hat. I gave it away.
B0048KUH1U|1|this bra is sized small and the wires broke through the middle on the second time i wore this bra.  also i called this company for a refund and the phone number was not correct on the paperwork
B003552QJ0|5|comfortable, roomy, feels nice against skin,  perfect under any sweater or blouse.  definitely would order more.  Very happy I found this garment
B00RDD98CS|5|My wife loved it for our little grandson.  Says it is very well made.  The design is embroidered on and is very nice quality.
B00J7REX9Q|5|This is a great quality outfit! It fits snug, so you need to have a slim (but not perfect) body to fit into a body tight material suit, but it looks just like the picture. The material is very stretchable and breathable. This came with glasses, that was not mentioned and I wound up buying another pair, so just keep in mind, it is a pretty complete kit. The belt will need to be modified to fit more snug, but that's an easy fix. No Halloween costume is perfect out of the box ;)
B008TNNGF6|2|I never complain, but this product did not live up to my standards.  The white collar is very ratty and too small for the shirt.  The shirt itself fits, the collar does not, it's too small and it chokes.  We now need to find a new costume for Halloween - how frustrating.
B00HLQEZ5M|5|Just got this as a gift and I love it! For the price of this you really cant beat this.
B00LCXSUFG|4|nice shirt, a little bigger than the normal size
B00XUK8RX4|5|Love it
B000FBMFVG|4|I needed some light-weight pants to wear while mowing in hot weather.  Mediums were a little large for me (36X29), but my wife put elastic in the cuffs.  They now work well when I'm sitting on my tractor.<br /><br />I would prefer light-weight pants with belt loops.  I might buy another pair.
B00MBLP1FA|4|The brown bear graphics are so cute, but the fabric is not what I was expecting. It's got that stretchy polyester feel, much like the crazy pants my mama wore back in the 1970s.  Doesn't seem to retain warmth very well and it's just not that soft/snuggly.  My bad, for not being familiar with fine Peruvian pima cottons. It's also a bit on the small size, compared with most other brands, but that said the proportions are perhaps better. This fits my little one quite well.
B00GRWAD16|5|The arms were long enough, but too snug behind shoulders when brought arms out. I really think I like the jacket, so exchanged for a large and hoping I will love it. It is the style and textute I was looking for and a fair price, but I want that perfect fit too. London Fog has quality jackets, I had one fall jacket that I wore for 15 years, even for camping before it finally got a big rip. This trench coat will be used more for dress up though.  ***Received the large size and I am completely happy with it!  Fits great and looks great!
B00FQ20BYC|5|This costume is the real deal in a hoodie form that you can wear all day. The tail cinches so you can wear it up or down, and the hood cinches too.  There is padding in the hood so the ears stay where they are supposed to.  The costume is comfortable to wear, keeps you warm on a cold October day and brings joy to kids and any adults that ever played Mario.
B001VH7TUK|5|I have spent lots of time and $ trying to find a halfway decent 38H sports bra. Anita Women's Extreme Control is, without a doubt, the best sports bra I've ever had! Highly recommend.
B00149YRB4|5|Received so many compliments when my baby wears these sunglasses.  Very easy to put on and take off.  The best part is they do not slip off while your baby is moving around.  Plus they look cute and cool!
B003JF5GYS|4|Loved the cover-up. Was a bit larger than I expected.
B00CPLHFAA|4|Good
B0090OSGQW|4|I really lke the camera. It's fantastic but for a senior person the settings are complicated. My son is computer literate and he helped me go through that part of using the camera otherwise I would be lost. It's very well built because the case is heavy and isn't as flimsy as some new cameras. I like the wheel adjustment at the top of the camera rather than on screen touch settings on newer cameras. It's one of the last few cameras that has that adjustment. To me as an elderly person it is easier to use than going into the camera and adjusting the picture settings every time you want to take a picture when the lighting is different. The big screen on the back to view the picture is also great. The pictures come out sharp and clear because of the large amount of megapixels the camera has. I would definitely recommend this camera to others because of the previous features I spoke about.The price was very reasonable for the quality of a point and shoot camera. You will have to buy a bigger camera purse for the camera as the one that comes with it is way too small.
B00NL19PXI|4|Cute tee but the X large seen a little small.
B00KE8HBJQ|3|Very thin fabric.  Two holes appear in the middle of the fabric, wasnt even on the seam.  Surprised at the quality of this Hanes product. It is very colorfast.
B003V4AL5G|5|Very nice. It fits all my credit cards well. The credit card pockets are tight but I prefer it this way so my credit cards don't fall out. Better safe than sorry. The leather is good though it is not the best quality compared to the $100+ wallets I have but should be very durable. There is some light leather smell too. The stitching is doubled-stitched so it should hold up quite well. For putting cash in, there is only one pocket without a zipper. The wallet itself is one of the slimmest wallets I have though if you have like 10 credit cards placed in there, it does feel kind of big.I ordered mines from Amazon and have not experienced the damage some people reported. Amazon wraps the wallet with a plastic bag so it should be fine. Not sure about other vendors though.
B00PGQ8XA2|4|Nice look and fit
B00TF7GAVW|5|My husband wheres them around the house in the hot summer.  Comfortable.  They wash great.
B00W6UJZTO|5|Very comfortable, looks great.
B00PCXQCBG|5|Very nice! VERY VERY GOOD QUALITY!
B005JJ2PIW|4|I got this for my four year old. She is average for her age and it barely fits. It will be fine this year but it definitely won't fit her in 6 months.
B007NXAQJC|4|Bought this for my girlfriend for the Oktoberfest in Munich. Looks really cute and fit as I expected.
B00O0E0KFM|5|Super cute!
B00A65Z5JU|3|Is too big but kept it.
B00CQNY6A4|4|I thought it was a skirt, I  didn't read carefully. It's very cute  definitely buy!
B00GEZX1NS|4|Tight fit, but looks amazing.
B000TAADTO|5|It's now mid-2013.  I've had them for a year, and the fit is still perfect.  Snug, but not tight.  No worn-out spots.  I'm now a fan of Wigwam.
B00C77PACW|5|This top is snug and delicate, but just what I was looking for.  It creates a feminine touch to any outfit and can be dressed up or down. Worth the price!
B00DV68FW0|5|Socks were to my home quickly and exactly what is pictured.  Excellent seller, excellent product, what more could anyone ask for?
B00G3NK1DE|5|We ordered this top for our cheerleaders to use in a dance performance...super cute!  I would say they would fit anyone who wears a small-medium top usually.  We did wear black tanks underneath because when they bent over it gapped open.
B00K1JOLOQ|5|Hubby loves it. Nice quality tee that's perfect for riding. Scary looking clown!
B007F52GOQ|5|A gift for my husband and he loves them!
B003CTE17O|5|Fit my wife as expected and looked and felt well made.
B006W77SYQ|1|Will be taking these 40 waist pants in about 4 inches.  Labeled correctly, not sure why they are so big.
B0043XYLX2|5|I got this item when it was on sale for $48 - complete bargain. The quality and detail on this garment does justify the now full price it seems to be again. You won't be disappointed.
B00LCV61YA|4|A bit pricey, but online inventory is short on these jeans. Material feels more like a pair of Khaki's than a sturdy pair of Levi's.
B00411A5HW|4|enjoyed it as a halloween costume but the hat would fly up when she walked and it was difficult for her to sit with the  at the bottom of the skirt.
B009FBSRAA|2|The skirt has a VERY tight waist. Far too small. Not usable for anyone over size 12. The color is nice, sequins are sewn with white, very visible threads.
B005X5HEOW|5|I took up Zumba and the bouncing that is involved was really hurting my gals...this bra has worked so well to reduce the bouncing that I bought another one!I wear these all the time now.One reviewer said this bra had too much coverage in the front but I feel that if one has &#34;f&#34; sized gals and finds a bra that reduces the bounce this much then Im not going to gripe about the front of the bra!For me its perfectly fine so long as Im not trying to show the world my cleavage!The straps are nice and wide..it also converts to a racer back style bra that is a breeze to convert to.I am so glad that I can work out now as my gals bouncing was a very big hinderance to my being healthier!
B00NPC09OW|4|Got as a gift. It replaced an older one I was using. If you carry minimal plastic its good.
B007ETEZOC|5|Size medium t-shirt featuring Sheldon's Friendship Algorithm including the loop counter.  Just saw the episode featuring the chart and they match perfectly.  A lot of fun for my teen to wear to school.  Medium true to size, quality t-shirt.
B0085IU27A|5|I bought this to wear over my lingerie for my soon to be husband for the night after our wedding. I bought Ivory as it was cheaper than the white. I'm glad I did so. I love it's color. While Its not white like my lingerie, it looks so good on my skin. It has this yellowish hue to it that makes it look so luxurious and not cheap looking. My mothers longer 90 dollar robe looks like this. So for a 19 dollar robe that is a steal. I already have a white robe and hate it. I dislike white on my skin, so if you are pale with a pink undertone, the ivory is a great color. I will buy this again when I need a new robe. I'm a 5'3 and 126 pound woman. The small/medium fit well. It is meant to be short too. So if you aren't a short robe type of girl then I suggest looking at others.
B00WHIXPWI|1|Pretty dress but was tight and waistline did not fall in the right place for me.
B00DNOIXFO|4|This jacket is a little tight for the size, but otherwise it is very soft and warm, and the color is perfect.
B003NVKOSG|5|Great
B00KK6C9V2|5|Looks great! I am 5' 10'' 160lb and large is a bit loose exactly how I wanted it to be.
B0051D4RT6|5|This is my 3rd pair of this model Jean and I'm sold on the style, cut and material.  PLEASE, don't change a good thing.  It seems that once I have found a jean that fits and wears superbly well, Lee or Levi, etc. will discontinue the style.  This is a near on &#34;perfect&#34; product, at least for me.
B005QR7KUU|5|I love love this belt and it fits me great and med. fits me great and im a size 6 in pants
B00J2R1C3Q|5|He absolutely loved these shorts.
B00N211ZOE|5|My Granddaughter loves this Elsa Hoodie.
B00IGGI4TE|4|I am very pleased and happy with this top. I have a lot of Koi scrubs and this one is very summer looking top. It is very stylish and comfortable. I love the prints and the details. Will use this product again.
B001G7HTYG|5|Good for the price will buy more
B002UZNNRA|4|Wears fine
B00QNBHW8S|4|I can't give it 5 stars because the size is so off, but if the size was right, I would. Please note that when I say &#34;fit as expected,&#34; in this case that means I knew to order the 3x for my 1x size. Size up! I love this thing! I wear polar fleeces around the house like sweaters. I prefer them because they're lighter weight and have pockets. I got tired of paying $40+ for the Columbias, only to have the zippers break within a few months (zippers I rarely use!). I recently purchased a shirt from this company that I really loved (size was also wrong on that), so I thought I would give the fleece a try. It's perfect for my use, around the house. It's lightweight, warm, and it has not only nice deep pockets but inside pockets as well. And I LOVE the fuzziness--it's cozy! I've been wearing it for four days straight now and haven't had any shedding or pilling. The zipper seems well made, too, but at this price, it's okay if it breaks in 6 months. I'll just order another one. In fact, I'll probably do that now just to make sure they're still around when I'm ready for my next one. I got mine in the Pearl color (off-white), and it is as pictured. Oh, and as for the sleeves, yes, they're long, but I did not find that a drawback. The fleece rolls up into cuffs easily and if you're chilly you can cozy your hands in them.
B003QCGS6Y|1|it does not seem to be right size but is the size that was ordered.  i also returned one and had to pay postage and i paid full price of $28 because i didn't understand who i was ordering from
B00CB9W2DG|5|delivery was fast and its the best poncho i seen i will be putting this on in the winter even in the cold mornings
B004GCIN2A|5|Very supportive if you are very active and have large breasts. I would recommend it for running or playing tennis.
B0055GFVV2|5|Bought this for a flight costume to make it more steampunkish and it's about double the size than in the picture. My husband's costume will look much more awesome with this pinned on!
B00BFFLB6G|4|VERY CUTE & GOOD QUALITY, JUST ALITTLE TOO SMALL.  ORDERED SIZE 14 FOR BOY WHO WEARS 12 HUSKY JEANS.
B005KDXQSU|5|SPECTACULAR
B0019ZCSSW|5|When I took them out of the package, I thought, \\"Uh oh...too small!\\"  But they fit like a luxurious glove on my 61 year old body.  I will buy more 'cause I'm worth it!!! :-)
B00DPEO9Z0|5|They fit my child well enough at 7 months old with some wiggle room for some more growth so he can wear them for some time. Very happy with purchase .
B00WE7T2H4|5|The Inside Out t-shirt is good quality, but it does run a bit small. The large size says 12/14, but actually fits more like a 10 when washed. The XL size says 16 on the tag, but probably won't be that large when washed.
B00AFYZ8EO|3|I liked the pants, but had to return them because they were way too small.  Looked more like a child's medium than an adult small.  I should have read the review on them before purchasing them. But returning things through Amazon is so easy it wasn't any problem at all.
B0073MLZ70|1|This wallet lasted no more than 4 months and really began to fall apart after 90 days. This is another example of American companies buying products made in China that inherently made to fall apart within months. Very Sad to say the least! The best Wallet I have found is available here at Northstar Leather http://www.nstarleather.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=NSLC&Category_Code=WalletsM#.VXb2is9VhHw .....OR .....Duluth Trading: http://www.duluthtrading.com/store/product/working-mans-bi-fold-leather-wallet-80512.aspx?ev3=recently-viewed I was more than happy to spend $50.00 for a real wallet. I have bought wallets from both companies and Northstar is a small family owned company that has been in business (The 100% American Cowhide Leather) business for over 46 years. I love real leather and Duluth has great products too albeit imported...but a hell of a product for sure...go check out Northstar for the best All American Hand Made Here in The USA Leather Products.<br />Do you know what the best thing is? Its 100% Made In The USA by Hand American Cowhide. That should tell you everything you need to know.
B00JQRQR3C|5|no Problems
B00JV55OVA|5|Cute and worth the money.
B004VJMFB8|5|Absolutely beautiful sweat shirt!  So excited to get it.
B00CE3IAXU|1|The pants on this outfit are huge.  I purchased 3 different sets at the same time, two in 12 month size and one in 18 month.  The pants on these are at least an inch longer than the 18 month.  The other 12 month is true to size.
B00GI2A9BE|5|Love, love, love this top.  The quality is amazing!  I was worried that it would be too small from the previous review, but fits my 34 full b's perfectly with no fear of falling out in an invert, without giving them that &#34;loaf&#34; look.  The gold straps are non binding, and I can't wait to wear this.
B00QOF3YD0|4|Love it
B00I1LTYH0|4|GOOD ^^
B00OS0VI5O|1|Case was ok but the writing on the case was faded and you could barely tell the scripture of the word Faith on the case.
B00PX4DKZU|5|My son loves it!
B008GOVO7A|5|Nice fit and works great for photographs.
B00MBAIFPE|3|It fit as expected but it doesn't look as good as it does in the photo... unless you wear it with a tank top that matches closely in color. Then it looks ok.
B00UMDAFMI|4|A tad larger than I expected, but I sport it anyway! 😊 if you have a small head, be cautioned in buying this! Unless you like big hats.
B00FKHMCHC|5|Great gift
B004W6K4N6|3|This is a nice, quality jacket, but not my style. It's very warm and very long, but too long for my height (I'm 5'4'' and it was way past my knees). It ran big, at least one size too big. I ordered a M and it felt like a large, with too much room even when zipped, which is not flattering with the down jacket material. I'm not a fan of the color either..a little too dark, I was hoping it was more olive, but it's brown. The zipper embellishments are nice. The faux fur on the hood is not the best quality and I didn't like the belt, has a heavy ornate look and too matronly. Returning it. Too bad, was a steal for the price.
B00F4I6AJI|5|Very pretty!
B00AKCHMRW|4|Love this Rachel Pally dress! I think it is fair for the price, as the material is a bit thin and I imagine will not last for too long. Eventhough it is definitely for a person with a smaller chest, it needs a bra as the material is very thin. Luckily although it has an open back, a regular strapless bra is concealed well. Also very long.
B00VLO6FJE|1|Horribly ugly, doesn't fit well. Looks nothing like it did in picture..
B00DEZS24E|5|The price is fair, there are multiple sizes and the packaging is quality.  They are sturdy and work as promised.  I am very pleased.
B000V6YS2E|5|These gowns wash and dry, so easy to care for and they last forever! I wish they made a long robe.
B0081STN4W|3|Sexy, yes.  Comfortable?  Nope.  Is this important?  That's for you do decide.  They leave nothing to the imagination, to be sure.  They're not really cut to be filled, as it were. The front of the garment doesn't really support well; not much of a pouch.  On the other hand, if you're not intending to wear them long, they're good for that.  The material isn't especially soft, so if you're imagining that, go ahead and disabuse yourself of the notion.  Still, they look nice--and maybe that's all you expect of them.
B00AK4J2MS|5|love it
B008OV7W7G|1|These sunglasses are the POSTER BOY for &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. They arrived with many scratches and the lens quality is so bad I could not see through them.  AVOID this product, save your money.
B00RJQDT92|5|Love them
B00258293Q|5|so cute! looks just as the picture!
B00DRH8E9W|4|Definitely different and fun to wear.  But expect your sack to pop out at times!<br />Make sure that string is high and deep in your ass to hold the better angle so it doesn't pop off so often!!<br />Hardons don't stand a chance though!...lol
B004ARVYXQ|1|These Hankies are cheap.  They are NOT 100 percent cotton.  The fabric content was not written on the package.  After they were washed, they began fraying around the edges.  DO NOT BUY.
B00CA2X68O|5|Super fluffy and full. It's a little lighter than I expected, but I love it
B00O208JY8|4|so cUte!
B00EJTKJE0|5|This was ordered for a flower girl dress and it turned out beautiful!
B0009MZVL2|5|Used these today for a half marathon and they held up just as beautifully as in training.  Fit is stellar and the thickness is just about perfect as far as I'm concerned.  No more cheap cotton socks!
B00HE6104S|5|Good product...
B00JTIJLUE|5|Nice shirt...
B00U8EUOYU|5|very cute retro look. good quality.
B002WGEJKM|4|Fair socks for the price.  Fit well and are comfortable.
B0012Y1DAE|4|the bra cups fit perfect but the circumference is a bit fitted
B00K0KDL7O|5|Good quality, reasonable prices....... Love it❤
B0000ZFDSE|3|The bra is comfortable, unfortunately, the large band of elastic on the bottom makes me itch.  I am allergic to elastic which is why I chose a bra that was mostly cotton.  I was dismayed when I put it on and began to scratch almost immediately.
B00K5V3NO4|1|Very thin. Would not purchase again
B00GLQG0JC|5|I love it
B00BHX5FS6|1|It didn't look like the picture what so ever!!! It was too large and just an ugly top. I wouldn't wear it
B005GYPZYG|5|These are great. I require that my underwear stay in place through martial arts classes, climbing, or assorted other running and jumping, can be worn all day without stretching out or bunching up, and is comfortable. My girlfriend requires that it not be old faded four-pack blandness from Kmart. These are perfect in every respect!<br /><br />They are form fitting, and hold everything in place, but avoid both the tiny-pouch squashing syndrome of most pricier boxer-briefs, and the saggy baggy low hanging crotch area of the super-cheap ones.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!
B0050DT11Q|4|I have enjoyed using these hair bows. My 6 month old daughter doesn't try to take them off so I guess they aren't uncomfortable. I will say that some of the alligator clips were sticky from the glue on the inside (where hair goes) but we have only used them on the headbands so far. I guess we will see if they are still sticky once we have enough hair to wear them alone!
B006HT41LW|5|I ordered these Monday and they were at my door on Thursday.  The fabric is lightweight but not translucent, great for summertime.  I'm 175 lbs, 5'9\\" and the large fits perfectly.  They're nice and stretchy at the top, very comfortable.  I usually prefer something that isn't so loose at the ankles, but these are and I still like them.  They are loose, but not bell bottomy.  They would be great for yoga.  Because of the fabric being thin, my underwear line is pretty visible. I probably won't be wearing these out in public unless it's with no line panties or a long t-shirt... they'd be great to slip on over a swimsuit.  The fabric is akin to t-shirt material, just a bit thinner and stretchier.  Very soft.  If they break down over several washings, I will update this review.  If you don't hear back, you can expect they're durable as well.  If they hold up, at $10, I'll be ordering a few more pairs.  Uber lazy-pants!
B00O2XP6ZU|5|It's a cute dress and I wear it for work. It fits perfectly and it's great for work, Lil parties or going out semi fancy. I totally dig it :)
B00997L5Q8|5|I ordered these dresses for my nieces to wear at my wedding in July.  They are very nice quality with a pretty rhinestone embellishment.  The girls love the dresses and the price is 1/3 what you would pay at a department store.  They were shipped to me in a small box with the dresses folded neatly on hangers, and wrapped in pink tissue paper, which was a nice touch.  Would definitely order from them again!
B00GRWNN5Y|5|I absolutely love this dress!  I normally don't write reviews even though I do read them.  But this dress is better than I could have imagined!  The colors are bright, and the fit was perfect!  This has become my favorite dress of all time!  I highly recommend it!
B008FQ1LHC|5|The shirt Is a decent tshirt quality. The logo is what makes it. My son is a Taratino fan and got a huge kick out of this understated homage to Quentin's films via the burgers joint that is often mentioned...
B00NBLJI12|4|se siente sencilla
B008R99IOU|1|Its a very oddly made sweater. Super wide..much much shorter than pic...and closer to 3/4 length sleeves. IT DOES NOT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE PICTURE (except the color & pattern, hence the 1 star). Unless you're like 4'7\\" and shaped like a huge upside down apple from waist up...this sweater will NOT fit. Don't even try to risk it like a did. You're only option is returning it to China at your own cost (no return shipping label provided). We need to start listening to reviews and quit rewarding these people using sweatshops, as I'm pretty sure a 4 yr old made my sweater..lol.
B003R7LCV4|4|Over all great warm socks. They are much thinner than another pair of Carhartt socks I bought.<br /><br />Maybe I have angry shoes or odd shaped feet, but I wore through the back heel (where my shoes rub) fairly quickly. These socks are fairly thin, which I liked, but if they wear out this quickly I think I'll look elsewhere. They didn't even last one winter.
B00DW9YXB8|1|The fit runs a little small
B00M0EMRD2|2|The colour looks worse than originally advertised. Looks more brown than this. Not a good purchase in my opinion. I wonder if I would ever wear this.
B00DIIU20E|2|Socks came on time and fit well but two pairs out of six pair had holes in them
B00K7D8U6G|5|Love it.
B00589DHTE|4|nice product, just that the sleeves was shorter than I thought. great never the less, would recommend it to anyone.
B00O60P2JO|5|Perfect for my little girl! Fast shipping.  Thank you!
B000VWFK7K|5|No complaints
B008K9XDGQ|5|My husband really likes these type of belts, and these were just what he wanted.  It arrived promptly with no problems.
B00COQC92U|5|great fit, great material and very well made. much better quality and fit than some of the &#34; well known brand names&#34; that i bought.<br />i will buy from this company again without hesitation
B002496W52|3|I like the flare leg and I saw they ran a little big so I ordered them a size smaller. They shrunk a little and now they fit a little strange in the upper thigh area and they are now a little shorter then I would like (I'm 5'6&#34;.) The little bit of elastic in the back makes them comfortable but no matter how tight I tie them they slide down. Overall I like that they have a little more shape then normal scrub pants and I still wear them but I am unsure if I will buy them again because I don't think buying a different size will solve the problem..
B00KTY53IQ|1|Did not receive it.  That is lucky for me since I'm sure with the sizing, it may have fitted my 3year old cousin.
B00IYP7H72|5|Super cute, was the perfect gift for a four year old little girl!
B002YDDBDE|5|I bought this for my grandson for a play.  It looked great.  Some costumes can be expensive and do not include the beard, gloves and glasses like this one did.  It worked out very well and can be used for years.
B00B7YY3JC|4|Made a great present!
B00N4ML2TE|4|Shipping was quick and the material is very soft and nice. Its also a slight high to low bottom.  However the sizes run a bit small.
B00MZM3Q3Y|5|Nicely cut, comfortable, a perfect fit for a cold day of hiking. Love it.
B00JFR8J4I|2|I have these in blue,black and red also purchased three of the days of the week type from Amazon.  These are comfortable but unlike the other Asian leggings with the days of the week on them they are not lined in the package area so they are virtually see through and won't work for lounging around unless you're home alone.  The others are much better value even with the piping in the cup area that I don't like the looks of.  They are comfortable and  lined in the cup area only which makes them more discreet, definitely not see through, yet supportive enough to wear around the house without being on display.
B00SLG3YDU|1|My baby is 10 months and it was tight on him!! Way too small 😢
B00GPKQ5O4|5|great fit, real nice fabric, high quality sewing, style and pattern is very nice
B004VTGSR0|5|Perfectly sized robe - thick and cozy. Ordered a large for my 8 year old and it's a perfect fit.
B00APSRI1G|4|I really like that Dress, I am 6' feet Tall and I cane say It is somewhat to long, I would step on it if not holding it up.
B00EVTRG9E|5|It's a little small but overall it keeps warm and it's very comfortable. Thanks!
B000ENT6N0|5|My daughter needed this for her dance outfit. She's pleased with the product. Can't say that I've seen her wear it, but I'm sure she'd tell me if there was a problem.
B005S69PUC|4|This is such a cute baptism outfit! My son is 3 months old and 15 lbs and it fits perfectly!
B00WDMUUVC|5|Great item
B004Z4TSN2|5|I bought this backpack for my daughter to use on her first day of school and let me tell you she really really loved it.It was very cheap and it looks very durable, I hope it last's for a long time.
B003T9VLPM|4|Haven't owned khaki jeans since I was a youngster and they always fit well.  Still do.  Good quality, prompt delivery, just what I expected.
B004E2WFUS|5|nice prop very usefull
B00SAGYQMY|4|Excellent product for price. A bit small but they didn't have the size I wanted. Would buy again.
B00J8B5PRK|1|An XL fits like a medium! Wouldn't buy again!
B005Y0R35Q|5|I am happy!
B00EYN6EZO|4|Really speedy delivery!  Very satisfied with the fabric material.  Good quality.
B00BKT6AO0|5|Great Shirt fits well for my type of work~~  Kids just thought it was great to surprise them with this shirt !
B00NQEAICC|2|I expected a tighter fit especially since they had 40 percent spandex.  Ordered a small and they were to big and kept sliding down.
B00CEH0FV6|5|Absolutely loved everything about this underware: material, design and feel. I am 5'6'' and 130lb and small fit perfectly.
B00DCEMCPC|4|This suit fits well, no need to go up a size. The only drawback to this suit is the placement of the straps in front. They are a little too close to the armpits. It would earn 5 stars if they were placed a little farther out. Very flattering fit!
B00D7MQKWA|5|Just as perfect as the photo.
B0007QMUH8|3|Comfy, but I was hoping for a more similar fit to my beloved but expensive Hanky Panky boy shorts.  Alas, these are not so flattering, but for the price, maybe worth a try.  For the record I'm a small in hanky panky and ordered the 5 here, which was the correct size.
B00C577ET6|4|fun and comfortable! a bit more pink that i thought it'd be but that's okay! =] super cute and fun
B00CE145FE|1|My husband is a very slim tall athletic build. 6 feet 145 lbs, etc. We purchased a XL for him. The sleeves were waaayyy to short and the shirt was way too tight. We weren't expecting a very loose fitting shirt but we weren't expecting it to look like he had on one of our 7 year old sons t-shirts either. The material isn't great either. The design of the shirt matched the picture, but that doesn't make up for the fact that he can't even wear it without looking like he's Winnie the Pooh. I tried it on, and I usually wear a med-large in women's shirts and it fit ok on me, but mind you...I'm petite also. Next time...just skip and order something else. I read that it runs small, but it didn't say baby doll size though lol.
B000UA0OXS|1|Creases around buckle. Cheap.
B007R7I5ME|4|These are very colorful, but also very fragile.  We purchased these for the children's section of a museum, They are not durable enough for child's play, but would make a nice display.
B00HU0C12S|2|Wasn't done right and detailed.
B0055LIS94|5|I bought these for my wife and I love them on her, especially with an outfit that I got her to wear with them
B00DSJU3BQ|5|I was worried about the size, and ta-da!! It fit me perfectly!(I am small and thin. almost 5 feet.)<br />It is comfortable and elegant. The color is beautiful. The material is fine and soft. I don't know how it will come out after washing yet, but over all, I am really happy with my purchase. I would buy other colors!
B00L9GH4E4|5|This shirt is a scream!!
B00EB12RNM|5|I ordered a size 5 (I'm normally a 5-7) and I can slide those off while buttoned. Love them everywhere else though, just grab a belt.
B0012N2MNM|4|love this bra ,cup size is great .wish i had ordered a 38 b compared to my other 36 b's its a little snug - hope it dosen't shrink
B00MMOVMGS|4|After one week we have received so many complements on the hat, however the stitching on one of the braids is coming undone (you can see the plastic tube) so I will have to resew it.
B00ACIH7UQ|2|One star for price second for 100% Cotton.<br />Very bad design, annoying,  uncomfortably thick butt seams that cut in bottocks when your sit.<br />Compare to Dockers where the seams are very fine and on the sides and center which makes them unnoticeable.
B00J0D394W|1|Dress doesn't Look anything like the one in the photo!!! It's looks like it's been washed 30 times!!  The breast pads are annoying!!! I give this dress  two Big thumbs!!! Buyer's beware
B00FGAO84I|3|Bra is comfortable and the fit is okay but the shoulder straps won't stay up, which I hate!  I will try tying them together & see how that works.
B007F0WJI4|5|I got this for my 13 year old son, and couldn't be more impressed! The colors are vibrant, the hood is lined, and it's very well-made. My son loves it! He hasn't taken it off since he opened it Christmas morning, with was yesterday!
B00B7E3DSE|5|Great buy!!!!!!

B004VBPS88|4|These cycling shorts fit fairly well; however, they are just a tad big -- note that even though they seem to be a bit big, they are not uncomfortable..  . After a strenuous 15 mile ride, my bum was much more comfortable having worn them than previous rides without the shorts.  All-in-all I'm pleased with these shorts, but I think I will order the medium size next time instead of a large.
B007KFZFO4|5|awesome  as a sports bra - especially when you are well endowed on top
B00NNK5RQQ|4|Cute top.<br /><br />One problem:  The top has a darker red than the pants.  Makes it seem as if it's not quite a match.
B00G7N14OU|5|Excellent
B00FH5P7KQ|5|Wore to a formal wedding-got a ton of compliments. Great quality.
B006EVQGNO|4|These mittens have been great for my infant. The only reason I have them 4 stars is because the Velcro has started to separate on one side of one of the mittens.
B005SICJZ8|2|The gloves will probably keep your hands warm; but the four different pairs I purchased have threads hanging out all over, and random colors interspersed, and they look terrible.  If I had kept the shipping label, I'd send them back.  They were to be a Christmas present, but I was too embarassed to give them.  I don't know if they work with the smartphones.  I value fashion in addition to function, and I couldn't get past the fashion to test the function.
