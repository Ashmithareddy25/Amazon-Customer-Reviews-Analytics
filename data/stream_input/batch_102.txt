B007HUIYOA|5|This product was delivered on time and what I received matches the description exactly!<br /><br />Thank you
B0115NK3FW|5|Worked out great for my project; thanks amazon,com!
B0009T6EA2|4|Didn't end up using this but shippin was fast and arrived earlier than expected. No need to return it as I plan on using it in the future but the product is very good quality and came with everything pictured!
B00G66ASPE|5|fits perfectly.
B005HR2JJ6|5|At first I thought it was a little big and looked &#34;different&#34; from eagles I had in the past. Once it was on the fender, it was PERFECT! Even &#34;contemporary&#34; looking and I like that different look.
B004I0LHQE|5|Great product and fast shipping
B000VTULPY|3|Like it, don't love it - does no go far for the price unfortunately.
B00XXV2L0U|5|Works great!
B00C4Z4HKS|5|Great decal.
B002TS4Z98|3|Love the decal and was excited when it arrived.  However, after following the instructions that were enclosed, I was not able to affix the decal to my trash can lid as planned.  The &#34;backing&#34; pulled away and the decal broke apart so I had to trash it.  Maybe mine was just a dud.
B00RW1CF4Y|3|The cover fit my Hyundai sonata sedan very well. My low review here is because the fabric seems far more permeable to water than I think it should be. I want a car cover to keep my car DRY but found the fabric to be more like old fashioned tent material - permeable or breathable - and anywhere it touched the car, during rain, it would soak through.
B000CPI6VI|5|Excellent product...
B00LG0VS90|5|These fit my 2005 sportsman 700 even over the winch controls. They are not overly thick and they have large ventilation grommets for airflow. The soft fleece lining is comfortable. For the price, I am impressed.
B000VLF990|5|Great fit and easy replacement for stock tailgate bar.
B001OZJNOY|4|The grease is great, good Amazon price too.  Problem is shipping.  8 tubes no dents, 12 tubes slightly dented, 9 tubes REALLY dented, one tube dented so bad the red grease burst through (opened!) the aluminum pull tab.  I can use all the product on my earthmovers, worst dented 1st, no return is neccesary.  I buy & use a lot of heavy equipment stuff.  It aint my local UPS delivery man, he handles ALL my parcels like he paid for them with his own money.  The packaging is a complete joke.  YES, I will buy again, this is the best grease I know  for my big &#34;strip mining equipment&#34;, I absolutely LOVE Lucas 10005 grease for big excavator bull ring lube and dozer trunions!!!!  SIX STARS if tubes aren't smashed!
B001C6OZ5W|5|this is a good product for the price. I bought two back in December.  got into an accident. parts was stolen off my truck during the repairs. I everything replace except one wiper arm.
B00T5G53ZM|4|Item works as described.<br />connects to android, and allows the<br />functions described. Well worth it.<br />best of all it's bluetooth, no wire!.<br />Also size is smaller than other similar<br />products.
B00MHQA15Y|1|These bulbs fit as expected but one only lasted for 4 days before it blew.
B00YI78VN4|4|great
B006GV7UKK|5|Well made, perfect fit for my 2014 Tacoma extended cab with manual transmission.
B001ARWZJG|1|The product photo is much sharper and more contrasty then the decals.  The vinyl seems high enough quality but the print is not good enough to use.  Also the description says they are cut to the edge with no clear showing, but they arrived as haphazardly hand cut clear rectangles, so you have to cut them out yourself or they don't look good.
B0029Z2TOO|5|very bright, white color, i hope it will last, good producct
B006HHCI3W|5|great product !
B000O5DZVW|5|Exactly as described, works great
B005JCSYV6|5|Great product that one must buy if needed.
B000C55MVU|5|These were great.  The truck rides much better and it seems more level when towing my 25 foot travel trailer. I actually had a rusted out shock mount so I didn't personally install these. The shop that welded on the new shock mount installed these for me. There is a heavy spring on them and I wasn't quite sure how I was going to compress it to install them. You will need to compress the spring to get them on the vehicle.
B00LC8ZL76|5|Perfect.
B00BRRLPC2|5|Very high quality emblem with very aggressive mounting tape.  Make sure you have the emblem exactly were you want it before placing into position. There is NO tweaking to this mounting tape.
B00TUKYGP6|5|The sides started to rip so the stuff inside started to fall out in two places. I believe its from the Club that I am also using and the heat from Arizona but overall an excellent cover!
B00IUR1GH6|5|i have alot of upper resperatory.so i bought this to ride on the road, back and forth to work mostly. It's very comfortable, easy to breath through, filters the dust and polen, washable, and makes me look like an alien. The Wolfsnout shows this mostly as an off-road dust filter, but it can be used on the street as well. I looked at several different options for a dust mask but this one provided everything i wanted. I'ts much more money than a hankerchief but offers better filtration.
B009DJRCN2|5|Looks great!
B0024ECDL4|4|We bought this to hook up a second hose at the campsite when we go camping.  Works like we thought it would.
B004H8V0QY|5|very good
B005NFNSJM|5|Ok everyone, i have used about four different types of RV/Travel Trailer covers over the years, this one by far is the best!  It fits great, has all the tie-downs in the right places, has a &#34;throw weight&#34; device to get you tire downs to the other side of the RV with no effort.  Just a great cover and a great price.
B00IS941D2|5|Excellent bumper, very solid and looks great. Would highly recommend.  Install was a direct bolt in and only took about an hour total including removal factory bumper which actually took the longest. Fog lights fit perfectly. At first I thought I was going to have to splice the wiring but once I cut the loom and freed up some slack in the wires it fit perfectly, a little tight but I just put some zip ties on to keep the wires from pulling where they connect to the fog lights. 100% satisfied customer. Thank you eautogrilles for making a top quality bumper at an affordable price. Had spent a lot of time looking at bumpers and am so glad I happened across this one.
B006DDHZ1K|5|Did the job
B00469FOL6|5|Griot's products are the BEST.
B00FMV0WFA|5|Works well. It's nice to be able to store the smaller items where they can be found rather than digging down to the bottom. Removes easy to access things below it. Just grab and lift out. Stays in place the rest of the time. I would recommend this if you have the need and would certainly purchase it again.
B0002NIMGE|4|I used it on a 2015 Toyota Camry and it fit very well. Doesnt slide around and provides good grip. Just seems cheaply made. Materials are cheap. Craftsmanship is like they pulled a 7 year old right out of a village and threw him in a factory and this was his 3rd attempt after getting beaten and threatened to throw his family in prison if he didnt get the next one right.
B004J9FAYE|5|Worked like a charm
B009TC9PG0|3|As far as a quick fix for cold air this product works fine. My A/C has been leaking coolant for a while and I currently do not have a whole lot of time to get it fixed do to work. With that said I typically refill about once a month. I was hoping the the leak sealant advertised in the product would help but alas it is still getting worse. I now have to refill about once every two weeks since switching over to AC pro. I am not sure if the two problems are directly related but over time buying the more expensive stuff with a leak stop in it is not working. If all you need is a recharge then A/C Pro is great but if you are looking for a band aid this product will get rather pricey pretty quick.
B000BZN7LS|5|Updated starter for LS Engines  Works great.
B000COO1UO|2|The rubber/plastic deteriorated very quickly.  I keep this in my tool box and away from sunlight but after just a few months it started to show many cracks and pieces started to break away.
B000C2FVHI|5|Quality made part and engine holds 40 psi at idle.
B0022ZJX1I|5|Possibly the best grips out there. Last forever (unlike the pro tapers which typically last a month). Everyone who rides my bike asks what kind of grips they are!
B0007OWD2M|5|Best I have ever used, also good for porcelain and chrome. Buy for
B0049IM0P2|5|I have had this cover for 4 months now in the Florida summer sun and am impressed with the construction and fit. Unless you want to spend 3x this for a custom made cover buy a Goldline. No problems at all, just cover any sharp edges. Tennis balls work well for gutter spouts.
B000W0KTKY|5|A+
B00XQVA6GI|2|I thought this was the perfect solution for my Jeep. It's a bit flimsy and doesn't keep its shape but I figured it would work. I had this in my vehicle for less than a week. As you can see from the photos, it's not holding a lot of weight - less than 5 lbs. It is holding a hard had, safety vest, PPE, photo belt and lens case which are empty. I took my car into the dealership for service and used the handles for the FIRST time. One came right off and everything went on the dealership floor.<br /><br />I sent a message to AwesomeWare through Amazon on Tuesday, 8/11/15, and I have not yet received a response.<br /><br />Wishing I would have spent more and went with another product. This is useless if the handles aren't attached.
B0101BNF6I|1|I now understand the &#34;legal disclaimer&#34;... be sure to notice!
B001O7PNW8|5|Quick shipping, I ordered two different ones both arrived together.
B001FI2GXU|5|Cured my code warning installing this works great!
B000BGM51A|3|Unit arrived was obviously  used not newant other then that it is ok
B00HCJRLRW|3|there's gap between the key and the case.  key keeps on coming out of the case.  quality is good tho
B00B5KYS84|5|Very nice item, fits very well, thank you
B002929M3I|5|Fit perfectly and looks identical to the OEM
B00NA9QN5E|5|Excellent
B000VJPRYO|5|Excellent
B00BXPTRFU|5|This is a really nice quality keyring.  The finish is nice, the spring loaded opening seems strong yet easy to use, allowing access to 2 of the openings.  Nicely packaged and comes with a split ring as well.
B00HLUWN34|5|Great helmet!
B00M3NEBMK|5|Best face masks we have found for those long walks/runs in the frigid winter air.  Light-weight so you don't feel like you're suffocating with just a minimum of condensation buildup
B00CMX20H4|5|Great horn.  Works just like they said it would.  Very loud and it gets other drivers attention in a hurry!  I wish I had installed it a long time ago.  It installed very easy on my 2007 Yamaha Road Star Midnight Silverado!
B00HYYNYIU|5|Second set not disappointed !!
B00SCG9TD8|5|Super bright. Used for map lights in my 2014 f150. No flicker
B0085OLXF4|5|Good quality.  Not much to say about it, it's a key chain. It is well made.
B0056NTPNE|5|Easy install and it looks good. I'm hoping that out on the highways and bi-ways, someone about to have a fit of road rage will see it, and have a change of heart ...
B000E3482O|5|I want to thank you for making it so easy for me to get just what I needed.
B00K94P97Q|5|JEFF FROM BURIEN WASHNGTON IS A &#34;BOSS&#34;
B000CN4XWQ|5|ok
B0023VBTUE|5|Good product. Easy install.
B00D9C2CDO|5|This bag was great.  We just completed a 1200 mile round trip vacation to FL and this bag worked out great.  My concerns before were stability and wind noise with this on top of the minivan but the Keeper bag surpassed all of that.  It was easy to pack, close and strap down to the cars existing roof rack.  It saved a lot of room inside the car as well.  I had one issue with one of the straps vibrating at highway speeds but i tightened it at the next stop and it went away.  During the trip we hit a couple rain showers but everything inside the bag stayed dry as a bone.  On the trip and when we got back the bag folded up easily for storage until the next time we need it.  I would definitely recommend this.
B000CPI5XM|5|Stays stinky longer in my BMW.
B007Y69IMY|5|Does not include Gaskets. Product gets a High 5 but should state in the ad that no gaskets are included.
B00GHHFKBY|5|Looks great as poster on room wall . Noce seller.
B00SS461KI|3|Put it on the car and in less then a week, already noticeable fades.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Perfect product works well
B00EDFM6R8|5|Nice quality &#34;bulbs&#34; with SMD wedge base. A pleasant color and intensity for over the sink and under the vent hood in our motorhome. Might be too long for some applications.
B004PJKPVG|5|Great price for a great product.
B001DBTVGE|5|Works great
B00K32J8LC|5|This is so much easier than a bar of clay!  Make sure to buy Chemical Brothers Luber Clay lubricant.
B00CD7EE64|5|Works great, perfect fit &#34;07&#34; Trailblazer. Not sure if this was first purchase. Or second. But liked the one I bought to replace driver rear, went ahead and replaced the other side. Came fast and in good condition.
B008R099CA|4|Good
B002U729UA|4|I bought this stuff for the wrinkle black finish on the engine of my 2007 Harley Davidson Night Train. I read about it on a forum I am a member of and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />My engine had a few places that had heavy grime build up that I couldn't get clean and looked like crap when I applied the S-100.<br /><br />I used a tooth brush and a lint free cloth to scrub the grime off the case. With a little elbow grease it came out great. On top of it, the stuff smells great.<br /><br />I gave a 4 star vs 5 because when I received it, there was a pin hole in the bottom of the bottle and it was leaking. It was not a significant amount, so I just transferred it into another bottle.<br /><br />I would use this product again.
B00CSC75AQ|5|Perfect fit, Perfect solution, Perfect price.
B008KV4MD2|5|So far so good.  Has been working well.  DIrect fit for my Onan Marquis 7000.
B0094JIQB8|5|Great starter. Mower has never started as good as it does now.
B0018Y44Z4|5|Fits nice
B00Q37SN94|5|This is a great product that is well made.  The company selling this item is knowledgeable on there parts.  I had an odd issue with my particular atv. But I contacted the company and they helped me out and got me the right part.  I WILL be doing buisness with company again when I need parts.  Thanks Art!
B00Q1F81YA|5|Perfect fit, cheaper then dealer.
B007HFT034|5|You need a replacemnt plug this one is worth it.  I have 3 now.
B00SVEPPPM|5|Pure HRC quality
B00R5Q8CPW|5|Got here fast, look great
B009T7IAUC|5|Great pads almost no dust which is a big plus for my aftermarket wheels!!!!
B00F344NXI|3|They look good but rubber is easily torn when installing.
B00HAPKSVE|3|My original post said high quality seals and they are but since then the seals have failed but I believe it's due to the underside of the seal would not recommend for 04 Nissan Titan
B0105DUDPI|5|Awesome paw,looks great on the car,THANK YOU SO MUCH,PAM
B000B90MIU|5|Great way to stay organized at a great price!
B007RZ1B2M|5|Nice sticker. Good seller.
B00ND9PZLE|5|no problems, works great
B003AVTI0O|5|fits perfect well made
B000E35WJM|3|These were the only push on fitting I could find, the ones that I had on my FASS system were easier to get on and off.  These worked as expected
B0035UDHZ2|5|works great extra hand!
B00CO85X94|5|I bought the matching sticker and it is very cool for my laptop cover. But, I was worried the Keychain would also be large. But it was perfect.  Small and flat....perfect to hang from my belt loops or off my purse.
B0012ETJ1O|5|Inferior Product
B008L0EXJA|5|Love two brothers. I also bought the silencer tip for my 2012 Honda CBR1000RR. Makes a huge difference.
B00818AO6I|5|Excellent Product!!!
B00KMDSNAE|4|It fits pretty good on there the delivery was a day late but I'm very well pleased with the outcome.
B00OOJGMOQ|2|looks great but the battery died within a week
B000JFHMRU|5|perfect
B00ECHN0O0|5|These are bright and dont draw too much amps, so you can use them in the factory harness. Also I felt they where bright, not sure why some said they weren't/ also they fir the standard trailer cut out, so they are perfect. Even came with die-electric grease on it<br />Good buy and great product
B000X1Y4IU|5|Fits and looks great.
B008CE0TNE|5|Bought Two
B00DSD66WC|3|This isn't the highest quality sticker.  I'd recommend putting on a journal or something indoors, NOT on your car.  It wouldn't last long.
B009DK8USM|5|excellent, my 4Runner is like new!!!!!!
B00KRQ7VC2|4|The rings fit perfectly into my rim and it is solid metal not cheap $hit whoever said they dont fit snug is probably doing something wrong... the shipped sooned then the estimated time. the only problem I have is that I orded blue ones and NOT pink .. but seeing as they cant be seen really it doesnt really matter I guess.. and I can always paint them if I want to.  everything else was exactly as described!
B00B9YLVU4|5|Bought a set for my 2014 Avenger. Ordered the Blue Streak color, around Aug. 9th 2015. Moldings arrived in about a week, well packed with cushion mat'l. Color match is exact. Install was a breeze, just prep the site well with a few swipes of alcohol and make a masking tape level line. Best to install when everything is nice and warm, so tape sticks to car better, The little tape prep primer stick sent really won't do all 4 moldings, maybe 2 , if you work fast.<br /> Hopefully these will stay on the car without flying off...I would definitely stay away from automatic car washes or high pressure sprays until tape has time to &#34;season&#34; on the car and bond well.<br />  Price was best I could find by at least 30$, so if you're thinking of a set, get them..They may not save the true dents from careless folks parking next to you, but it'll give a little buffer to spread out the impact. Avengers have flimsy/thin door panels to begin with.  The pics are of my car, installed by me in the driveway.
B000CFME2A|5|works well
B001CQWM8E|5|Great price for good looking mirror.
B00ZSPP45I|4|Nice. But time will tell on quality
B00P73KWE4|5|Great for my hunting supplies and my buckets of corn
B00ISA3HNQ|1|Looks great, fits great..... However the receiver/hitch is welded crooked. About 3 degrees off, not square or level with the ground. When inserting a luggage carrier into the receiver the carrier or any hitch is crooked.
B00BCRMBSO|4|GREAT PRICE  FITS CAR SEATS VERY WELL
B004O2SB88|5|Perfect
B00ONGWV7W|5|Good quality, very satisfied.
B00AYE2XWU|5|Great product. Delivered on time and works as advertised.
B000BYGD2O|4|Exactly what I needed.
B007NQ7LSI|5|Super easy to install, took about 15 minutes. The only tool you need is a riveter and you are all set. I've had it on for 6 months, so far so good.
B0013AFUW4|5|Installed easily an d looks and works great!
B006WQSXSW|2|These were easy to install on our Yukon XL.  They fit like OEM.  They don't sound like OEM.  After a few months, they are noisy, roaring at highway speeds.  Go with Timken or Moog or OEM, avoid these.
B000B6NQHW|5|Direct plug in for 2013 Audi Q7 with towing package (and many VW's too)  If you have a blanking plate with 4 screws by your receiver this is what you need to plug in a trailer's wiring.  Remove the screws and screw this in the plate's place.  Turns it into a 7 round - you may need a 7 round to 4 or 5 flat depending on your trailer.  Those are available at ANY auto parts store or big box.  This part is not.
B00VNBDWPK|5|WOW...Seriously awesome. These replaced a nice set of hid lights and a bundle of wires and a ballast for each. I have had multiple hid sets, last 4 cars. The Light is Bright, better than hid kit. Pattern/Spread of light is also best I have seen! I delayed getting these because I have only had my latest set of hids for maybe 2-3 months, absolutely glad I decided to try these. HIDs to these are like a bag phone to an iPhone:) Do not know how these are not taking over the entire headlight lighting space...nice work!!!<br /><br />FYI, first review I have taken the time to write and I use Amazon many times in a in a given year.<br /><br />Photo: HID kit vs.<br />opt7 as the product pics show,  a single wire set that plugs into default light harness, one for each side. Installed during lunch hour and still had 50mins left after I finished.<br /><br />And lastly, these lights are not gonna fix world hunger or save the planet...but they have sure made me happy:)
B0053ZNNC4|5|Thank-you
B001A0J2JO|5|a driver should have the best mirrors on his/her car., something like this for better view
B00KS3BJ7C|5|Great LEDs! I tried buying incandescent and LED bulbs for my application in the past, only to be met with disappointment and frustration. These arrived as expected and perform better than I expected.
B00HHG910A|5|Since I never seem to remember where I put my keys, I purchased these key finders. It can take a little bit for the beeping to go off once you press the button, but it gets the job done.  I've only had to use it once or twice since I've purchased it (go figure...), but it's a relief to know I have it when I do need it.  Edit:  I've ammended my review from 4 to 5 stars given WTR's excellent customer service and finding that the delay is intended feature (sleep-mode) rather than a defect as I initially feared.  Of course I jinxed myself with my initial review and have since needed to use the remote several times.  Searches that could have taken me 5 minutes were cut down to a fraction of that and I am very grateful for that.
B00TDCV6DG|5|light works great, fast service, no problems
B009PDC0XS|5|The car dealership wanted to charge me $200 to purchase and program a new keyless fob. It took me less then 10 minutes to program for my 2009 Saturn Outlook it was so easy!
B000E2AQXU|5|I will not use anything else now.  The nut is the way to go and no more cursing over not having the right sized oil filter wrench..
B00LHUI4XM|5|I bought one for myself and one for a friend.  We are both delighted, really dresses up our new personalized MSU license plates (GO GREEN!).  Easy to install, the screw covers are a really nice touch.  We bought:<br /><br /> Cruiser Accessories 76100 Tuf-Shield Clear Flat License Plate Cover (2 Covers)<br /><br />to complete the look, and keep the plates clean.  The bottom two tabs on the frame need to be bent out a bit to accommodate the plate and cover but no big deal.
B00T94BKFW|1|flickers after a few months
B00DRA4470|4|Very nice and a bit tricky to place on so be careful but I think it looks cool and adds some flare to rims
B010UA5UHW|5|Great product and very fast shipping!
B0027XGIKO|5|Perfect
B000C3ZCTE|4|Good quality, works great so far
B007OW6I12|5|100% factory original.  Solved that pesky error code.<br />Zero complaints.
B00CA5M5QU|1|Two different brands
B00OU1P514|5|SUPER FAST SHIPPING&#62;&#62;THANKS love my fellow vets
B0068ERNNE|5|Can't beat the price and worked well in a rain/hail storm in Arizona<br /><br />I also expected to feel cheap but felt high quality
B00EMLYQYY|5|nice
B00UU83YR8|1|This is a HORRIBLE product!  Purchased one new at Costco two weeks ago and it has leaked some sort of black ooze all over my auto's leather seats.  I can't get the black gunk out!  We do live in Arizona so the heat likely affected the &#34;oozing&#34; process. This product is made in China and lists the ingredients as 100% polyester except for the base which is &#34;100% polyester with PVC dots.&#34;  Save yourself some real headaches and DO NOT BUY!
B00WH3V926|5|love it!!!!
B011IZN85E|5|Exactly what I expected.
B00DBEOHYW|4|ok
B00SXJLLBW|5|These really are as good as everyone says. Easy to use and holds everything well
B007GR4E9S|5|Pretty easy to install and about 5 times brighter than stock turn signals. They are VERY small but big on light.
B001656PKC|5|Very ez to install...the instructions were a waste...you don't have to loosen bolts at the heads..just be careful when you are placing the reused screw rings .. place them behind the pipes where they can't be seen. I watched a couple of videos to get an idea..They sound awesome...Low and Rumbling..Loud but not too stupid loud. I have leather bags, not a problem
B003G0U3BM|5|Perfect fit and helps keep the back area of my Toyota Prius clean.
B00L2T68YK|5|It was a gift for my husband and he loves it.
B000C2AOKC|5|Perfect fit for 94 GEO prizim
B00ABPQQRA|5|It looks awesome on my 1996 BMW 328i, every time I look in the mirror I smile. hah (:
B00LLMJ142|5|Perfect
B00KVOC5K8|1|These bulbs are no where near as bright as other LEDs I've ordered. The packaging offers no protection for the bulbs, and they don't even give you the correct license plate bulbs.  You pay the extra money for the full kit and you just get extra, useless bulbs.
B0049VXLN4|5|Arrived early, easy install. Will see how they work this winter.
B005GYI1GA|2|Cheap junk
B0013BF3XE|5|good
B00JGJGLWW|5|Works great, perfect length
B007TG7IIK|1|Impossible to install on my 2008 MB R350. I had to return and pay shipping.<br />Had to go to MB dealership to buy the OMG  $100 for the set.<br />Waste my time and money on S/H. Don't buy.
B005WKJEZ0|5|Fit perfect, cut to length came with zip ties!
B007ED9JFS|5|Very nice product
B0009XQUKC|4|Useful tool. Works well. Comes with all the attachments that I have needed to test fuel pressures. Would purchase again.
B007TYCXO6|5|great product -- works nicely.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Amazing quality - well worth the price.
B004VKWGG6|5|Good filter, does what it suppose to do, still won't filter out stinky gas fumes from older cars though...LoL
B000C3BB26|4|Installed easily enough no leaks about a better design for the base would be optimal.   1994 Nissan Hardbody M/T 4WD *Update: As of 01/06/2017 still no leaks or cracks *Update: As of 06/23/2017 still no leaks or cracks
B001D3LPYS|5|Perfect size!  I was looking for a handlebar bag for my 1999 Shadow ACE that would NOT touch the tank or interfere with my seeing the control lights and speedometer.  It also needed to be big enough to hold my toll transponder and sunglasses.  This easily holds them and more!
B00029WYBM|5|Great
B00J5943BY|2|Before buying Por solvent, read the instructions cafefully regarding the amount of solvent to add to the coating.  You will see it is so little you will ask your self &#34; how can so little solvent impact the viscosity of the coatint&#34;.  As for it being the only solvent to clean your gun or hands, skin, lacquer thinner works extremly well and at a much REPEAT much lower price.

B00ASYJFEK|5|Very nice lights.

B0063SZLWA|5|great buy, thanks a lot.
B008SBW8AI|4|Fits perfect no issues
B005KLS9QG|4|I only wish it had a metal 90 degree elbow at the carb end of the cable but otherwise works fine. I used this on a 2001 GasGas EC 300.
B00OU67Z80|4|This thing is BRIGHT!
B00WFZO94G|5|Super bright works well for bumper lights on my peterbilt they rock  thanks  //Kieth @humboldt county ca.

B00Y3XV806|5|These wheel covers are perfect for my car. Saved me a bunch of money compared to getting rims. They look great, durable and were easily installed. I have them on a black  2012 Mazda 6
B000WYYP14|5|firestick brand antennas with tunable tips are the best cb antennas.  period.

B00QC28M4G|5|These things are so bright they make Neil degas Tyson seem stupid.
B00A14ONO4|5|Works perfectly in my 1995 subaru and was easy to install. Great bargan.
B0006H8BEY|5|perfect, well made.
B001IV1KRC|3|Works fine but it's way bigger than I thought it would be. Takes allot of volume of water to activate it.
B0006Z9SRK|5|Gentle suds that get your car clean.  You don't need to spend a lot of money on a good, basic car wash.  Save it for the waxes!
B00E1SJ2W4|5|Product was perfect fit, great quality and was delivered very promptly. Will buy more products from this company.
B000K36BCI|5|Great for securing Sun shades
B00PGYS674|5|Fits the 2015 Jeep Cherokee great. It is a bit different than the OEM, but will do the job nicely. Easy DIY job. I'll probably order again in the future.
B001TK7CYM|5|Great product for the money!!
B003BZD03K|2|won't allow the water connection door to close when in use.  We had to add a second adapter to move it to a position where we could close the hatch around the water connection.
B006FDVZF0|5|Nice product!
B00IO952ES|1|Not one to write a review, but felt I should. Not happy at all with this product. We ordered them for a 2007 Chevy Tahoe. The first set came so badly warped it was noticeable just looking at them, took forever to get new ones out. Because you have to send in pictures and videos showing the defective parts and wait for them to review it. Real convenient...... Then we finally get new parts out and those are warped as well. Needless to say every time we had new ones sent out they all came warped and make a terrible noise when driving, turning and stopping. Had mechanics look at the (3 different mech.) and every single one said they were garbage. I guess you get what you pay for. Gave it 1 star only because customer service people were very friendly.
B000IMG6O4|5|a fine tool
B00Q62KJDO|5|Protects the tractor seat and prevents sweating to the seat when your doing a big job!
B00ZLPABGC|5|very trim in design and effective especially on the driver side
B000BQRG00|1|Only lasted one year.  Will not hold pressure.  Took apart several times but still won't work. Not sure why I even give it one star.
B00B9F15UO|5|Perfect fit
B0064N6088|5|Got the wrong ones . Easy return
B00F7GYU3A|3|PROS:  the shipping on this item was indeed fast.  The price was right.<br /><br />CONS:  the sticker it's self has some pretty obvious issues with print quality and resolution. Along the entire image, you can see the lines of the printer head going back and forth as it printed out the image.  We would have expected the blacks to be solid black, but it's not.  Think of how an image looks if you print it our on a printer that's about to begin running out of ink, that's what this looks like. To be clear, It's not terrible, and this is me being rather picky.<br />We haven't put this sticker on the car yet, but I'm interested to see how well it stands up to light and heat, if it will fade or not.
B000GKAZVI|3|No complaints but the foam seems to be very low density, a higher grade of foam with more of an elastic texture would be preferred.
B00EOX2OKS|5|they work and do what they are supposed to do.
B00BU8MV1M|5|its good product. you save much
B010LTYNA2|1|The batteries do NOT last more than 2-3 minutes. They fit perfectly. The Charging System is convenient. They just don't work.
B002B8XIHG|5|More than just a tire tool, haven't bent it yet, used as a lever and other &#34;not a chisel or pry-bar&#34; uses.
B00OXZD9F6|5|This fuel filter fits my 2002 Silverado. I verified it on the K&N website. They had another one that was the PF2500 (mexico) that should fit also. I went with this one to be sure!
B000CHH5QI|5|Just as expected. :)
B008QR1ANA|2|Nice price but sheds as you use it. I bought red and get little red fibers everywhere, which really limits how it can be used.
B000C5C524|5|The real deal &#34;oem&#34;
B00B3DHDTE|1|Over-priced, cheap knock-off sticker. Avoid Boston Decal Works.
B00B5ZY07I|5|Received the product timely and it was as expected. Easy to install. Looks great.
B00407V6YI|5|Perfect color match to factory spec
B00B1AKLL6|3|The product does what it says it does. The pinch sensors on my car are a little sensitive, and required pulling on the deflectors to close the window immediately after installation. I have noticed that two of them had slid down (even with 72 hours of cure time). Time will tell.<br /><br />I think if I would look at ventvisors again, I would look for in channel ones that have the tape, and a continuous tab all the way around, instead of 5 separate tabs.
B00OVB7LGA|4|Satisfied
B002ERC8PM|4|Recommend pouring this out completely into a different container or be prepared to dump it into a funnel quickly as the top is not at all conducive to  a 'nice clean' pour, and A/C oil is friggen messy!
B0000AYCF5|3|a little wimpy, I will only use on a small trailer.
B009WDX1NE|5|It's okay but difficult to install
B00AMNKRHQ|5|Inexpensive, superfast shipping, and they got the job done.
B00AQAF8NI|5|Needed these for whiteout conditions and night time snowboarding. I've tried many goggles and the I/O series are the best hands down. Rarely ever fog
B00HNBPLSK|5|This is an absolutely perfect match.  These suckers are difficult to find in my area so I'm going to purchase another as an emergency backup.
B001O0HOK4|4|Wish these weren't us much as they were and that sold singles but now we have a few back ups.
B0002Q7ZJQ|5|The diagram on the directions is very pixelated and hard to make out, but luckily it was pretty straightforward.  The plug on my '04 rodeo was in the jack compartment as described, but it was taped up out of sight to the bundle of wires going to the taillights.  I wound up flexing the panel surrounding the jack compartment out of the way (no tools needed) to get a better angle on it from the tailgate side.  The included grommet fit perfectly in the grommet hole below the jack.  There was a smaller grommet facing out towards the side of the vehicle in the jack compartment as well - it is smaller and not the right one so don't be confused.  The correct grommet was not really visible from the inside of the compartment, it was much easier to see from the underside of the vehicle.  All in all, the installation took me about 15 minutes.
B000F0Z81G|4|fits well, adhesive not the best to fit the dash. but it works
B005J3L35O|5|When periodically topping off the water on the 6 batteries that power my golf cart, I was using a funnel and in spite of being careful, water sometimes overflowed and caused a mess on the garage floor as it was corrosive.  I ended up getting a pad to place under the golf cart and this helped, but still the overall process was laborious, time consuming and hell on my back.<br /><br />This battery filler has been a great solution for me.  It's very precise in that it will not overfill as it has a valve that automatically shuts off (it will gurgle while the water is going into the individual battery cell) when the battery water level reaches the spout.  Additionally, I no longer have to break my back and can almost stand straight up while adding water to each battery.  By using this battery filler, I can top off all 6 batteries in about 10 minutes!  My cost was about 16 bucks and it arrived in two days with my Prime Membership.  Some of the best money I've ever spent.  I like this thing so much that I bought one for my buddy to use for his golf cart.
B00IEYEDU2|5|Good Value! I have these on multiple trailers and have had zero issues. Personally I prefer the bias ply over radials on a trailer. Just seem to hold up better and run cooler.
B0019IQ8SA|5|PERFECT !!!
B00CMQRNQ4|5|Part fit just right
B002GTKAHQ|5|It work grate on my cb750.
B00DIFW8EU|2|It didn't work for my VW CC 2013.
B009DJTZ4G|5|Great price for good product
B001QXRPUI|4|It cleans and shines my leather sofas, but if you miss a spot, you will notice it.  It does leave streaks if I don't wipe it completely even.  I do like it, and it smells nice.  Lasts much longer than their wipes, which is why I bought it in the first place.
B001EOYJSU|5|Very easy to install on our 2010 Subaru Forester
B00155237W|5|Really like this product, use with the Chrome 30630 perimeter.  Looks great and protects your plates.
B00CFNHOKE|5|great deal fast service
B00POMG9J0|2|It look messy the paint
B00FEZ65J6|4|Good warning light for the price, lights are very bright, and like the memory recall on pattern selection!
B001TPUCKI|5|Fit perfectly
B00FYX2LXW|5|improved and thicker than previous version i have purchased. nice purchase. easy to instal.
B000BUQODG|5|Well made product
B0052LZ9BW|1|Returned........The parking brake handle does not fit 2012 Malibu Lt
B0001XPC04|3|Works fine but cheaper looking than I expected
B004HOM28I|5|I bought this for my Tiburon almost 2 years ago and the quality and fitment is as precise as stock. No issues or leaks and no cracks in the rubber portions yet. Hope to keep it that way.<br /><br />Oh and just a heads up. the return line does not come with the roughly 1 1/2 foot hose from the return line to the reservoir which I highly recommend you replace as well. Also replace the small pre-formed hose from the reservoir to the pump. Don't try to cut your own, it won't work. I tried so many times with all different kinds of hoses so you will have to get that from the dealer unfortunately.
B0058V5VJG|3|Look at the picture closely.  It only has one locking screw on the inlet side.  It gives you options on the input angle but you can only lock down one.  If you are running two input lines from two batteries you might want to look at the XSCORPION DAGU3224G, it has 3 lock screws on the input end but you also lose the option for 0 AWG input.
B000K38UN6|5|Works great. Easy to use. Already prevented a dead battery breakdown.
B00S9JI164|4|So far this has been a very good product.  It doesn't the same voltage as my original Alternator, but it is close.  For a 15 yr old jeep, I am fine with it.
B000ILRPWM|1|Real cheap quality and not what I thought it was not at any fault of the vender.
B00KXBNYF4|5|Don't waste your time or money, it can't be programmed except by a dealer for about $65
B00KUI13C6|5|Nice n bright !!!  Clear daylight white. No bluish output. Fits perfectly.
B004LERDV0|5|Great buy, perfect size for our RV. And I can't brag enough about how sleek it looks!
B0073MEBQ2|5|Installed 3 months ago very please with it no problems
B000N9M48O|5|works great
B000VAODAW|1|I ordered this for my '08 Altima SL, didn't fit. I then ordered one for an &#34;S&#34; model & it fit just right.
B004O40BR0|5|The mats are very good quality and fit exactly as promised.  I would highly recommend.
B000BYELQY|5|Excellent quality, great performance in the rain.
B00H1O2XTE|5|Work great
B008MISDH4|5|Fast shipping, best bang for the buck
B001UHQXQ2|5|This product works great with the claying towel from Auto-Chem!
B000VUM6BU|5|Super strong and extremely low profile
B0058WXNOK|1|Didnt work at al
B00XQEZEYY|5|Love them
B0033WNJBO|1|This 13390 does not fit the 2015 Outback in spite of what the Amazon site says.  You will not be able to get the rear-most muffler hanger back into position.  Impossible!  Furthermore the 2&#34; receiver will be about 6 or 7 inches forward of the rear bumper cover which will require a 7 inch Curt receiver extension.  The bottom line is buy Curt model 13206 to fit the 2015 Outback.
B00YC35X3U|5|Looks like a well made tool for the price. Does the job for replacing struts so you can retain your camber angle.
B00079FOK0|5|good mask and couldnt beat the price!
B0036TOFY4|4|They work great, 4 star becouse they should come with the rack
B0026N6YJ0|1|Product is insufficent. It's like it was used.
B00PSOYFP4|5|I  really like my plates
B00WH1ZC80|5|Great Thank you
B00UMQ5P8O|3|It is great quality ! Very thick and durable ! It looks great ! I have a 2015 jeep rubicon and it's a nice black accessory ! I had to remove a tab on the gas cap...in order for it to fit....you'll probably need a little help... Me and boyfriend had to put it on together lol.
B000AMBHGO|5|Works good an almost direct replacement.
B00H47INHY|5|Direct fit
B007KCXHQA|5|Excellent
B000CRCSTW|5|Product worked well
B002MA107S|3|These worked okay, but I much prefer the &#34;TMS KAYAKCARRIER-CP5672 Kayak Carrier.&#34; These are somewhat difficult to load the kayak on when you're by yourself even on a fairly low car. The kayak dramatically increased the height of my car where it would no longer fit under my carport. I prefer the other style where you can just slide the kayak right up the back of the car and it sits like it does in the water.
B000P6UPBI|5|Quick  delivery.  Well built product and easy to use.
B007TBWA92|5|Great quality
B00Q34E0T4|5|Hard to stretch and get on the steering wheel but once I did I love it. It is so soft and matches my seat covers beautifully.
B000GOF4TC|5|Works perfectly and replaced a 6 year old VDO replacement.  Blows hard and strong ... not noisy.
B000BXKY8E|5|works great
B00BH3Q1R0|5|Worked great.
B007NZ3X2M|5|Super deal ! Blazing fast shipping . Described good but price unbeatable.
B00VXD3A4Q|4|Works quite well with 3M polishes but deteriorates pretty quickly.  Not high $$ so order a few extra.  Bottles of polish outlast life of pads.
B00374DYFO|5|I have a first gen Tundra (2001), and the transmission wasn't bad or slipping, but under full throttle or under load going uphill it would jerk from 1st into 2nd gear. I dropped the pan and changed the filter and added the Lucas in and the jerk is gone. It is getting better with each mile also. Added bonus, the trans temp is about 30 degrees cooler all the way around.
B00A75BS8Q|1|you get what you pay for
B00INVEUS6|4|Didn't measure it but it didnt feel like 25'
B000C9SJUC|5|This fuel tank cap was a perfect fit for my 2003 Cavalier LS Sport. The tether and rubber seal had both broken on my old one, so it was time for a replacement. This is an actual ACDelco fuel cap at a great price, way cheaper than at an auto parts store!
B00M0D4F4W|5|Super bright day or night. easy install.
B00899GMII|5|One of the keys from my '05 Pilot broke, right where the metal part meets the plastic.  This worked great as a replacement.  You need to transfer the internal components to the new shell.  When you transfer the remote lock thingy, it's a good time to replace the batteries.  The other thing you need to transfer is the transponder chip.  The transponder doesn't need batteries, it's just a little rectangular thingy in a plastic housing.  The new shell had a housing which fit the transponder perfectly.<br /><br />Once you've got everything transferred over, you need to take it to a locksmith to have it cut (my old key worked for that).  All in, it was less than $40 (including a new rubber cover).  I don't remember the price that my dealer quoted me, but this was a lot less.
B00CZC7SDS|5|It fit my 2004 XC90, and my check engine light went away.
B008K7PV90|1|They look cool, thats about it. They dont fit right so the throttle never snaps back and the glue that holds the inner sleeve does not hold up. Avoid these.
B007IPBEGY|5|Real OEM original sitckers.
B000GOJW9K|4|Exact fit and was easy to install in my 2002 Acura MDX.  Works perfectly.
B000HS4QA0|5|Just what I wanted!
B005KOZ25Y|1|This thing is deffective. It doesn't even work properly.Could barley see the screen
B001KQD7YY|1|the plastic part broke after less then 4 months of working<br />Eyal
B001T9IAFI|5|Was actually GM. OE parts ! Great !
B000YPB2TY|5|Put in use the same day. This is a great product and was had to find. Thanks for the fast shipping and price.
B00XURSK2U|1|Definitely NOT light beige, it was super dark almost like a brown color
B001D8TGJE|5|Love this brush for washing my horse trailer and my vintage sports car. Good quality.
B0022ZZ0AG|5|Instantly noticed a huge improvement on my 2012 Honda CBR1000.
B007HRQ4S6|3|City Water will not shut off.  Can only use via water tank.
B001EOV492|5|quality very good
B00GTHI2LW|5|It actually worked. This is the third sensor I`ve tried and works great. Will get on for my 1986 Bronco-2  vintage also. Great product.
B00B2AUWC8|5|Worked like a champ on the 32' Airstream, Slower than the old one - but hey its slow because its meant for heavier loads. Light is a little dim....
B005HR1K46|5|Good
B00H3TY3FY|5|Item as described and price was excellent and much cheaper then local dealer even including the international fees on credit card. Also very surprised at how quickly it arrived from the US to Australia before the estimated delivery date and so easy to track the item so I knew when it was to arrive at the delivery address.
B0077T241A|1|Made in China crap
B004EN4ZFK|5|Finally got to use these the other day. Got stuck in the mud. Put these on and drove right out.
B002J858HQ|2|this product does not last long and is not very strong.
B009DK00O4|5|Went on no problem, no modifications required, and looks great now its painted
B00QSIFZW6|3|These are beautiful on my car but messed up my wheel studs, not cheap to fix. Wish they had them in steel.
B00OVBTB7C|5|Top of the line LED's, work in Mercedes 2010 E350, no errors.  Very bright white light - 6000K, no blue.  I've tried a bunch through Amazon and this the best brand!
B00O2XJ0PW|4|good quality, however due to my negligence i lost the bottom ring
B0002SRCKG|5|Highly recommend to any technician
B00H7R2R28|1|With this on the key fob, it did not fit into the ignition. So it did not work for me. It did look nice on the key fob, but if I cant use it, its of no use to have it on.
B00A46G6JE|1|Listed wrong application. Dose not fit the S40 volvo. But it did fit my 2003 Mitsubishi outlander front.
B001SGHK1W|5|High speed mode... hope you have a strong alternator lol
B002H8U3KK|5|If your four wheel drive has 4 buttons, this is the blue fluid you need for your transfer case.
B0000UZ514|4|This is a very nice trash can but it is so small, I wish it was bigger.
B004K7VLJ8|3|White box parts.
B0083WO48Q|5|Light weight, very comfortable, and extremely functional!!  It also provided shade for the dog under the table at the beach!
B006KBLEJO|1|Said it would fit my WRX, but didn't, returned.
B000VAW3N6|5|fixed a problem I was having with my 04 GMC Canyon z85
B008NGGX0O|3|Not bad...you need to make sure they are tight and/or use zip ties on the end so they don't float of move to much.
B00OWS4J76|5|I love it. Went on in a quick 10 minutes and it looks great.
B002807VWU|3|They are &#34;chrome plated for lasting beauty&#34; however, after about a month or two, these are already rusting. It amazes me how factory lug nuts can stay rust free for such a long time, through all kinds of elements and numerous tire changes, yet a set of wheel locks can't achieve such greatness. I'm a little disappointed, but the purpose here is to lock the wheels up, not to look pretty I guess.
B005JU5UX8|5|I thought I'd have to make time to find a mechanic to switch out my blades, but these were so unbelievably easy to do myself. So glad I bought these.
B003RVT35W|5|It was very easy to set up it took only about 1 minute !!!!
B007A2FP7E|5|looks great on G-6 Convertible
B00QXUFCAY|3|Even though it they were suppose to be error free, I still got the* License Plate Lamp Out* on my 2015 Jeep Cherokee. I have ordered the decoder so maybe that will fix the problem.I will contact you when I install the decoders.
B000DN7Q3S|5|Good product, good value.
B0031I1ZUW|5|I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this cover. I have a 2005 Polaris Sportsman 700 with front and rear bumpers and this cover fit just right. It has a bungee cord all the way around the bottom. The cover reaches to about 4&#34;  from the ground on my machine and the bungee pulls tight around the tires.
B00VKX71C6|5|It works fine. I am please easy to installed and use.
B00XE5DHRQ|4|What I expected
B000FQ7BN8|4|OK
B00X9Y2H8M|5|As described
B0075XHDHI|4|There OK
B00TPKKS3A|5|Works great at a good price
B000YC7GBA|3|The pull ring is not big enough and not formed well.  Hard to get a finger inside it to pull
B00NI1L9P8|2|These smell horrible. My whole car is filled with a plastic/rubbery smell.
B00CHZNBWK|1|Hard to see through goggles when wearing
B00029KA8G|5|I suggest putting this on in the summer of you live in a northern state. I tried putting it on when I first got it but it was too hard because it was cold outside ( I didn't want to keep my car running for an hour). I came back to it this summer and it went on easily.
B0041TN6XE|5|perfect
B00CLFFI0O|5|Great looking numbers.  Easy to apply and the adhesive is very strong.
B00BG9EGVS|3|The picture associated is not the same product. The mirrors are NOT square, they are circular. All in all, they are smittybuilt and serve the same function.
B00IJHWCSY|3|It's okay. the material is too brittle. it will brake at first contact.
B0001EW4FY|5|Fits well,and serve it purpose.
B0083TY6I2|5|Fits perfectthanks
B000X221VQ|5|fits like a glove in the words of Ace Ventura...really it is perfect. Bring the garbage down to the drop off, take the recycles to the curb, or transport a defrosting body without messing up the car. IT IS AWESOME and TOTALLY worth the cost!
B00RYN23CY|5|Looks great and sticks on easy
B004ZF31PC|4|They were installed on a 05 Mazda 3. Installed took a bit of time not the 20 mins some claim. The kit had the headlight plug on the wrong side of the grommet so I had to cut the wires and reconnect them on the other side. This wasn't a big deal but it wasn't a plug and play install. You will also need to buy the adapters so the metal clip can hold the lights in place.<br /><br />The lights work great and really brighten up the road. Especially over the OEM lights and for $50 it's cheaper than using the high end Sylvania bulbs that only last a few months. I would buy these again.
B000CITK8S|5|Very good product. Don't know what I did without it. Everyone needs one. Batteries are always up and fresh
B000NVW1LM|5|That's very good staffed for you car make my car run great
B000CQFWLY|5|Works great and keeps my Corvette battery from draining when I need to store it. It's also good for when you need to do a lot of work on a car that requires a disconnect.
B007VXD5C4|4|Light are more red than orange/yellow as described.  Still waiting for replacement bulbs.  Will probably switch back to factory lights if bulbs don't show or are of same color.  Looks odd with different colors.
B001FAK4B4|4|Package came fast and just as described. Easy install and great price.... Happy overall on purchase.
B003D704IU|4|This is step 3 of 3.  Leaves a haze after buffing.  Not sure if this step is needed.  I did Rubbing compound (paste style) then steps 1 and 2.  Wash vehicle between steps so no carry over.  After waxing it looks great.  All done on a black jeep and black shows every swirl & flaw.
B00JA3BMDW|4|I think temperature may be off by about 5deg. Compared temperature using contact thermometer and Fluke non contact thermometer (used at same distance) and both were on average 5deg warmer on a series of tests. Not bad for the price since i am using mainly for rough temp measurements.
B00GUA5RAM|5|Easy to install
B004GC5OVS|5|Perfect fit! Great price! Fast delivery! Packaged very well!
B007QFKOCQ|5|This is a true OEM part
B00FBKSBA0|5|Excellent delivery time... product is satisfactory.
B0067ESVYU|5|All great products, above and beyong, thats why I keep coming back
B00L87VOQ8|1|The product has a malfunction.
B0081SCR1S|5|Pecards is the best leather conditioner there is.  It goes on easy, has absolutely no chemical smell (unlike Fiebings, which just smells awful) and it will last a long time.  Highly recommended.
B00XB7XJO8|5|Great addition to my bike
B00480J4J6|5|This worked out just great. Saved me over $140 compared to buying it at Autozone, $70 compared to the Toyota dealer. These are difficult to install, but there is a great video on youtube that will walk you through it. Light is bright, so no quality drop off. Same bulb that had been in the car.<br />Remember to wear a rubber glove so you don't touch the bulb.
B0049MM468|1|Was unable to get the can of freon to discharge. The devise that does that seems to be too short.
B0033DMGP8|5|Worked perfect with my 05 sti. Dont forget to buy a genuine subaru thermostat,  and some subaru coolant conditioner.
B0026JK8FK|5|Filling smooth, nice upgrade for my acura
B0077K8TPY|1|Misunderstood how much I was getting so it was much more expensive than I originally thought....
B0073W3FYG|5|Bought and mounted on my HS828 Snowblower  (1990's vintage).  Only issue was the vertical bolt that secures the swivel fixture to the bracket has a square shoulder, yet the bracket has a round hole.  Result of this is that you cannot get a tight connection, and since the electrics are grounded down through the bracket to the snowblower chassis, you have a lot of sparking.  Solved this be re-purposing one of the extra bolts from the assembly process, which had no shoulder, in order to get the tight connection.  Enabled horizontal swiveling by purchasing two (because they are thin) lamp washers (have a curve to them) for 14 cents each, and placed beneath the bottom of the swivel and the top of the mounting bracket, with the vertical bolt running through them.  These washers act as a spring, allowing a tight connection and eliminating the sparking, but allowing some give so that I can swivel the light back and forth.
B00BQHABMS|5|Good price and fast shipping
B00LO0M918|5|just right.
B005ESNRL2|5|I love it. He is my co pilot goes with me everywhere.
B006ZOGYUU|5|use all the time
B00GI2IJTI|5|great decal! :P
B010OB452S|5|Nice detail, good quality
B00L9QXKRE|4|I like this product.  The passenger side isn't a perfect fit.  I have a black interior and 3 kids so this was a must!
B00CQAQZ42|5|Exactly what was represented. Quick delivery.
B00BCRM9RM|5|Love It! It fit and is very comfortable
B011BPONW8|5|I needed some lights to use as a turn signal indicator on a small trailer I will be towing behind my motorcycle. I like the fact that these were 12 LED lights, so they should be bright enough for the job. Others I have used in the past were only 4 LEDs and too dim to be seen well enough in the daylight. These little lights deliver. When you light up all 12, even with just a 9v battery for testing, they look bright and full. The size is perfect for what I needed.<br /><br />They arrived just a couple days after I placed the order - super fast. I got a bonus too...I don't know if this was intended of if they just made a mistake when picking the order, but it wasn't just two lights that I received...it was two *pairs* of lights. So 4 lights total. This is a great price for 4 lights! Now I can replace the old 4 LED ones I have with these brighter ones too!<br /><br />I didn't see any dimensions in the product description, so here they are: approximately 3 1/4&#34; x 1 5/8&#34; x 1&#34;, not including the mounting plate and screws sticking out the back. The mounting plate is about 3 1/4&#34; x 3&#34;, with the oblong holes about 2 3/8&#34; on centers. Also note that it appears the wires will only exit out the back, even if you remove the plate. There are no tunnels to exit them out the side for a flush mount.<br /><br />Really I couldn't be happier with my purchase, with the possible exception of wishing they came in black instead of chrome...but I could probably take care of that with a can of spray paint if I really wanted to.
B0084L5A02|5|Bought autozone brakes...squealed. Bought OEM brembos...squealed. Finally purchased these and no squeal. I've had loud brakes the last 8 years. Finally awesomeness.
B004X9BUH6|2|only lasted a year
B000C55WMY|5|VERY HAPPY WITH BUILD QUALITY
B00Q8AQPHS|5|I am an avid MM collector and these mats are a welcome addition to my memorabilia!
B00I49114I|5|Rubber plug, Toyota Quality. Fits snugly.
B00JGE2PUE|5|Yes very much so
B0013916XW|4|Excellent product,
B004QEKG8C|4|I'm very satisfied with this one to-date. I did a lot of research, including reviews here and on other sites.  I decided on this one due to the overall great reviews, the price, the low weight, and that it folded (and for this price).  It was very easy to put together and the directions were clear enough.  The only thing I wish they would change on the directions is to have a size chart showing the bolt size they mean--the directions just give you the bolt number.  If the front had a graphic with the number that you could match to the size, it would have been helpful.  In short, use the 8 smaller bolts for the bracket that attaches the two sides of the carrier in the middle; the medium bolts attach the pieces underneath (for example, the support arms).  Why only 4 stars?  It is not perfect; the directions could have been more clear (and the graphic) and as some others have noted, it does fit &#34;sloppily&#34; in the receiver.  Based on other reviews, I purchased a hitch tightener with this, which solves the problem, but it is another piece and added expense.  It folds nicely and does not come close to hitting any part of my 2014 Jeep Cherokee when folded up.
B00BITJERC|5|Excelent
B000OQITW6|5|stronger than kleenex...holds water well...perfect for mommy's purse!
B00GJKXW8M|5|I have now purchased 12 of these lights. Puttin a pair on each truck to use a rear scene/back up lights. Mounted off back racks. Very bright and work great.
B000I66JEM|5|Fantastic
B0065FRBZ6|4|Probably not pure leather. But does what it is supposed to. Keep some zip ties handy
B0009H51KS|5|The correct part for my 2000 Dodge Caravan at a reasonable price and it arrived promptly.
B009ZMD2UO|5|As described
B0001XPC7C|5|love having this to keep my change organized for my car
B003NFP1TY|5|The set is exactly as ordered.  I truly love it!
B001DKT0DO|4|The adhesive part is a little smaller than I expected (just a little square instead of a full circular adhesive). It lets you easily adjust the mirror after you stick it on.  The mirrors are a good size and eliminate my blindspots when switching lanes. They make it easier to back into parking spaces without having to adjust mirrors or sit at some weird angle.  Ignore anyone that says &#34;Oh you don't need these, you just need to adjust your mirrors properly&#34;
B00E0SJ9RS|5|My 1985 honda 250sx runs like a charm.
B001DKRKGS|5|Hold the extra large cups
B000C9JS66|5|Check engine light went away and no more low pressure issues.
B009AZDC3I|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B00BYQ627O|4|great oil thanks
B00K0VMXDQ|5|I researched a lot of jump starters before settling on the Scorpion, and so far, I am very happy. It arrived 1 day earlier than expected and in minimal, efficient packaging. The nylon zipper case is compact and slips under the seat of my car, or in the saddlebag of my motorcycle easily. The indicator lights showed a full charge when I turned it on, but I charged it just to make sure. As chance would have it, two days later my neighbor was trying to jump a car but the cheap-o jumper cables he was using were not carrying enough current to get the job done. Perfect opportunity to give the Scorpion a test run. 20 seconds to hook up; car started first try and I was done in less than one minute. No unruly cables, no second car, no shuffling/hand pushing vehicles to make cables reach. It was awesome! Since I have no plans to use it to charge my phone, the only thing left is the test of time. For now; 5 stars and 80 bucks well spent. Note; I'd say it looks more like a lobster than a scorpion :-) UPDATE; On a motorcycle road trip the batteries in a cell phone and camera were both dying. I plugged in an i-phone with the adapter that came with the Scorpion, threw it in a saddlebag and charged the phone as we continued riding. Once that finished, I used the USB cable that came with my camera, plugged it into the Scorpion and that worked out fine as well.
B00BARY7D8|5|These things work perfect. Took away the blinking light problem on my 2003 dodge ram! And no warning lights on dash at all!!
B0099Z4MJ2|5|Did the job! seems sturdy enough for a back yard DIY'r.  pay attention to the online videos!
B00G1Y4PWS|5|Perfect!
B00EDFM83A|5|Work great in my RV.
B00D8DKIW6|5|great fit, comfortable, and the support is point on.  Just watch the screws that fasten buckle part that the strap clamps on to.  They will get loose on you.
B006YBB35U|5|The quality of the product exceeded my expectations!! The fit and color match were perfect. I will definitely use this product again in our vehicles.
B007LICL56|5|Looks great!!!
B00OFB848A|4|The stickers are nice but I bought these items cause I put in the &#34;search &#34; line ... Patches ... for clothes not stickers.  Im gonna keep them and give to someone but I really wanted a Patch.  I can't find them any where ...
B001DX7UGK|5|Great product and everything was great after installations.
B005OXD55A|5|Worked perfect and it was a lot cheaper than the dealership.  Just make sure you understand that you will have to bring it to the dealership to  have it programmed.
B0009IR05G|5|fit fine
B00LQO8OE8|3|Works as advertised but it's just a carabiner clip.  You can do the same thing by buying one for 99 cents at home depot.
B00LUP7GQA|3|It is well made and the adhesive sticks well, but note that it isn't actually made of carbon fibre (not that I'd expect people to believe that it was, but the description might lead to unreasonable expectations)  and that it isn't black, but rather a dark grayish-brown-tint.  I wonder if I should not have purchased Yamaha's regular tank protector to get a color match, since my machine is metallic black.
B00JSJMUBQ|5|Perfect size for our Honda Civic.
B009OBW2DY|5|Ease of operation
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works perfect on my Chrysler 300
B007HRNJWU|5|A perfect fit and easy repair.
B0006SU3QW|5|Stuff works amazingly! And cheap compared to a hometown store!
B006B27CCU|5|Good price and quick service!
B007JZKBVW|5|They work Perfect!
B002WSX6W2|5|High quality filter. Applied nice an snug to the filter housing. I've done EXTENSIVE research on filters for the W203 with M271 engine (C-Class Mercedes from 2001-2007), and this was at the very top.<br /><br />The three main front-runners would be Mann, Mahle, and Hengst. The construction and overall pleat number of this filter outweighs the MANN by a long shot. The difference between Hengst and Mahle are minimal, but Hengst comes at a better price and seems to be easier to find. Since MB does not make a polyester fleece filter for the M271, I'd highly recommend this filter as the alternative.<br /><br />FYI: Personal opinion here, but when using a paper filter in the M271 engine, I would bring your oil change interval down to 8,000 miles max. The only reason why your gauge cluster recommends 13k miles is because that is the recommended interval change with FLEECE filter. Hope this helps! :)
B00ER07OH6|3|Parts came in as expected but they are a slight bit confusing due to no directions. I would buy again if i needed to do so but to reiterate directions would be nice.
B0051TPJKG|5|Good price and delivered on time!
B00QQYXI1C|4|I liked them, except the mounting screws included were too short. Good value for the money spent tho...
B00TT7RWYC|5|Great product, Great experience with the seller. The product os very bright and easy to install. Each light came with 10ft extension cord and i was able to complete install with everything that was supplied. I bought other lighting kits form OPT7 and they work using the same remote and keep all the lights on the same color or mode. My kit arrived damaged from shipping, contacted amazon and the seller sent out a replacement right away. Highly recommend the product.
B009EVP6QO|5|The hardest part was getting the stock plastic cover off of the door itself.  After that the install was a breeze.  I keep tools and a tow strap in the bags and so far there has been no sagging.  They are holding up well.
B00068YAR0|4|Hi quality.  A bit expensive but definitely a substantial piece.
B006FLMGGO|5|it's flexible enough to squeeze into a shipping box.  very thin compared to that of weathertech, so not as heavy.  but after it's been sitting in the car under the sun of a day, the rubber forms back into shape of trunk.  the edges that folds upwards were bent from shipping but like i said, after a bit of heat, it folds back to the shape of trunk.  since they, it's been rugged and very durable and useful.  no complaints here!
B004H78NQ0|1|These caps corroded and fused to the valve stems. My tire got low and I couldn't get the cap off. Had to go to the dealership to get the caps removed. I'm sticking to rubber caps for now on.
B000C5WD2Q|5|Has been installed for about a year and no engine codes. Perfect for the Tacoma plus i believe its the OEM manufacturer
B00TJDAEK0|3|the seat covers don't fix the make and model it was purchased for..... wont be getting any great reviews from me
B00BYS6YDO|5|Did its job
B00OA9FCSM|3|Six months in, one of these has a single LED that slowly flashes after it warms up.  No biggiue since I used it as a courtesy light, but I've be replacing them with something more durable.
B00144D77E|4|OK
B001AVSIOI|2|I have a Chevy 2500HD with a trailer that when loaded is about 7500lb. After one trip of about 600 miles I pulled the pin to remove the hitch and noticed how dented and crushed the pin was. Not to mention that it flared the edges of the receiver hitches pin hole. I have put many miles on this truck and trailer with the factory pin and have had no problems like this before.
B002V0NG4E|5|Product was as described and was very pleased. Shipping was quick & great - it arrived a week sooner than the estimated delivery date.
B00WG8LHT2|1|I was hoping these would be problem free, but I seem to of spoken too soon. My passenger side angel eye is flickering now and I have to replace my bulb (both actually) after only a month and a half! install was perfect, connections were tight, must be circuitry since its LED.
B000BO913C|2|Sucks!!!
B00563HXV0|3|seems ok. hopefully it will be there if I ever need it.
B00K953GUW|5|JEFF FROM BURIEN WASHINGTON IS A &#34;BOSS&#34;
B000GTTFC4|2|Keep hitting when turning, starting to crack at that point that is hitting. Plastic
B0084NCHL0|5|was exactly what i needed ty
B002DU3S9A|1|Might have been fine until I noticed it said not for California.
B0052YDXRQ|5|They worked out perfectly!!!
B00Q87Q6KC|5|it is a perfect replacement.
B00BFE4XM6|5|Wow fast and it's perfect thank you very much
B000QFN3DU|4|The adhesive is kind of meh...
B000NZUP66|3|FITS PERFECT!
B000CIUB4A|3|Ok, so this was my first engine rebuild and was a bit of a learning process...  For anyone who's not done this before, I'll pass on (what should have been obvious to me in retrospect) some tidbits.  When you have the cam and the crank lined up, your most important things to take note of (I've a 93 Grand Cherokee 5.2L v8 (magnum) is that there is a dot for the cam that should be pointed straight down.  When its straight down, cyl 1 should be at TDC.  I mention this because the crank (this one) gear has 3 keyed/marked positions, a circle, a square and a triangle and they aren't particularly well lined up with the keys.  Most that have 3 positions are marked by a 'dot' (for 0 degrees), an 'A' (for advance), and an 'R' (for retard).  Thinking I knew what I was doing, I lined up the crank and the cam to the circle and dot (respectively), but I didn't pay attention to where the piston was (or rather where it's supposed to be) - I was only look at the dot.  Well, 4 or 5 bent pushrods and 8 replaced exhaust valves (maybe it was intake, I don't remember), I thought to do something intelligent and asked someone...<br /><br />Moral of the story, cam dot goes down, piston one goes to TDC.
B00SCQYZDC|1|ZERO Stars for this item. Decal was poorly packaged for the long trip from China to the United States. Arrived damaged. Unrolled to inspect and compared to original DODGE  4X4 decal and they do not match. There is no overlay to squeegee if you were to attached the wrinkled, thinner than adequate decal. Don't waste your time and money on this item.
B00WJMLQSM|4|This is a nice quality wiring harness with sturdy wiring. My one complaint would be the switch, that seems a little flimsy. But even for that only time and use will tell. The rest of it is very nicely made though .<br /><br />Sample Provided by vendor
B004RFKBEO|5|Heavy and well constructed.  Easy assembly.  Shipped in 1 week, not the 5-6 weeks listed.
B003Z4BBSI|3|these do fog in the rain
B00XEH89EK|4|There are many positives about the 10C and a quick search on this website and elsewhere will quickly reveal…and I concur with most.<br /><br />My warning has to do with the clamp unit.<br /><br />I ride a cruiser-style motorcycle with an upright riding posture, and occasionally I wear a Kriega R30 backpack over my leather jacket.<br /><br />On a recent ride, with the 10C clamp-unit-attached to my full-faced helmet and the backpack on my back, the following occurred:<br /><br />The 10C clamp unit got caught on the backpack strap after I did a head check for traffic on my left.  My entire head was abruptly stopped from rotating back to facing traffic ahead of me.<br /><br />The clamp-unit attachment sticks out about 1 inch below the helmet, so it can easily snag/get caught up on anything protruding on your left shoulder.<br /><br />This is a design oversight/flaw that can and should be rectified immediately by the manufacturer before a 10C user gets hurt.<br /><br />Dead or injured Sena consumers make for lousy PR material.
B00WFIK88O|5|So good
B00DCMM46G|1|No good for taking the burr off of a knife blade after sharpening on a waterstone. I saw this on a youtube video that praised how great it was for deburring a knife blade. However, it's not up to the task. I prefer either a piece of leather charged with chromium oxide or a horse leather strop with diamond spray. This 3m product is really a waste of money. You can buy a piece of sandpaper for a fraction of the price that will do a much better job, especially if you attach it to a piece of glass.
B0001YIUZC|5|Good strong lift. Works well
B000C846VE|4|I replaced broken fule cap with this it good !
B000QFORK8|5|This product was recommended by an Auto Upholstery Repair shop that I had work on my car seats.  It seems to be working pretty well although I will only know later that it worked.  It is intended to stop the new leather from deteriorating and to condition the old leather as well on the car seats.
B003SZKM66|2|Fit of gasket is poorly fashioned. And they WILL AQUIRE moisture inside upon washing vehicle.
B0075OWK4I|5|They work great:)!!
B002P8EMK4|5|Works great and easy to install. I'll be ordering a new mirror assembly for the passenger side soon since this one worked out so good. The mounting fasteners (washers and nuts) were a nice bonus since the old hardware is easy to drop down the door panel.
B00A5UEOLG|5|Good quality. Had to go to you tube for instructions.
B000C9S4RU|5|Works wonderfully and definitely one of the cheaper routes.
B00XZ2O60U|5|Very pleased with the purchase.
B00684TIVE|5|Good replacement product for the original that was ate up by the riding mower when my keys fell out of my pocket.
B008N21330|4|Good for the price
B00L81X6OM|5|Perfect factory mats.  Fit my 2015 GTI 4-door.  Very fast delivery.
B000BUOSGG|5|I just love this little dish drainer. it fits perfect in my camper sink
B0041TRSHY|5|Inexpensive replacement at a fraction of the cost if you got it from a dealer. I use mine for my 2012 Juke. There is no need to take out the glove box to install it.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Love this
B004OAY5RQ|5|SEMPER FI
B00KTHXXTE|5|Worked perfect (make sure you get the right case for your current remote.)  The 'ring' part of our remote had worn through but the remote control worked fine. I was tired of trying to super-glue on pieces of plastic, etc.  I opened the old one, swapped the electronics - like brand new.
B002VIDPBA|5|Work As Advertized
B000F2TU5E|3|Fits OK, but there is a seem right in front of instrument panel.
B000GZINTY|4|Super bright, using it behind my clear ignition cover on a CB550.  I've used a few other products from the vendor, all great.  Just wish these were slightly more flexible.
B00JXZJ3H4|5|A PERFECT PART
B000C5A0A8|5|Out of all the Monroe stuff I order, these are the only but a few parts I'm impressed with. Identical to the Volvo parts.
B004J0WNAC|1|Did not fit my vehicke.
B000CNHX0U|4|A little short on my 08 charger but it looks all right
B004HE554Q|5|satisfied good price!!!
B0041PXMIM|5|nice adjustments, can not go wrong
B00MR2QKIA|5|As advertised, nice fabric, looks good and works perfectly
B000C9SRD6|5|This is made by GM so it is original. Fast ship and reasonable.
B001HVHO82|5|51 extra gallons of diesel fuel for my truck, it is great to choice where and when you want to fuel up at the best prices. Especially nice while towing my fifth wheel, because not all diesel fuel stations have easy access with a fifth wheel trailer connected. The tool box part is not very deep, but it is still large enough to hold quite a few things and everything that I need to bring with me.
B00BOFETFC|4|Lines up well enough, not quite a perfect fit replacement for the OEM light I busted out, but it'll do. No instructions included, so I'm insanely relieved to have the factory harness prewired since I've never wired lights from a relay before.
B007THZMWI|3|Works well electrically. Has a strong plastic smell which it leaves on your hand after handling. Would gladly pay more for a refined version of this unit.
B006X98A7C|5|I own a rather old APC Battery Back Up. It's fourteen years old and the original battery in it just went bad. Hence, I purchased this one as a replacement for it to get it back up and running. So far, so good. This is exactly as described and expected with prompt shipping. So far, it works as it should. It fit perfectly into my BE350U APC Battery back up. In fact, it was the same exact size as the OEM one. Now my system works again for my desktop computer, monitor and extra HDD and I couldn't be happier. I didn't really want to spend $44.00 for a brand new battery back-up if I didn't have to. At under $20.00 for this on amazon, if I can get two years out of it, I'll be very happy.<br />Overall, a very good deal I can recommend without hesitation. The only caveat I had was with the packaging. For something so fragile, the battery terminals could be easily broken off in transit, the battery arrived inside a bubble envelope inside another bubble envelope.
B002L9D6YK|5|A+
B00HFK2RGI|5|Crear item for the price the quality is amazing
B00TEJ8VEA|4|The vinyl decal looks great. Cuts are clean and crisp. Material looks to be to notch. However, based upon the image, I thought it was black. I didn't notice the description that said it was white. Will have to find somewhere else to put the decal.
B000HBM5TQ|3|No problems, Came as expected good product.
B00WH1ZC80|4|Does what I needed it to do.
B007VREENY|4|Good quality.  So much easier than my old cheap auto pars store jack.
B007Q92GT6|4|The zipper sticks a bit, otherwise it's good.
B00JN0U4SQ|3|Radio reception not as good as factory antenna.
B00ZLIWL58|5|They are easy to install and great quality!
B000EFOZEI|5|Great hubcaps, great price!<br /><br />Good-Buy!
B00IKJ09RW|3|These are not smooth rotors, they have some texture to them. The packing for them was terrible, I hope they aren't warped!
B00T6JAESO|5|This is a great alternative for a factory Rocker C light.<br />Few mods needed. Very bright and great quality.
B0006SH4KU|1|It smels to muthch like grape juce.
B003I3POSO|5|Looks awesome, sounds good, gonna buy a 2nd one for when I true dual my truck out.
B00GS2VSQY|1|This not fit my 2003 Honda CR-V
B003554TB8|5|I ordered this for a move from Rome, Italy to Zagreb, Croatia.  Though I have only taken one trip with this bag it was easy to pack and stayed put during high speed highway travel.  I will be using it in the future to augment the cargo space on my VW stationwagon.  I highly recommend it as an alternative to rigid carriers if one is not needed.
B005RQWB18|3|The look great but one of the bulbs was red, I ordered all blue :(
B006H34BUY|5|I bought this for my Sante Fe. It works like a charm. I keep it in the side pocket of drivers side door, and use it every time I get in. It picks up the dust like a magnet. All I do to clean it is shake it outside.
B00T5DJMWA|5|Great seats love the easy set up!
B00HZOBP62|5|Fits perfectly in my 2015 Odyssey :D
B000IOL9XK|5|compliments bike well
B000EVYGQY|5|great tool.. just what the doctor ordered.. works on most vehicles then you can reset as well after you get the error codes..
B00V7FLV2I|5|Exactly what I needed. I moved from a state that does not require front license plates to one that does so this is a perfect adapter for my car. So easy to install also.
B00GG9FB8U|5|Amazing product!
B00B11SZEK|5|Very pleased with this wheel step.  It's heavy duty and stable on the wheel.  The step plate has a sharp tread so there is no problem with your feet slipping.
B005CEHTEY|5|Great for light sanding or working up from heavy sanding before cutting compound.  Saves me hours using the 3000 pad before cutting coumpound
B000CMJ2KA|5|Mercedes originals rusted. These are a good replacement,nicely chromed.
B00TZKWJK0|5|This new carb worked great , fit just like the old one did . Great shipping and great item
B004UTCJ2E|3|Doesn't fit quite well, but cute
B0002TDUW4|1|If you want your truck to look pretty and don't use it for work than this is the product for you. It looked amazing at first.  I followed all directions and waited a week for it to fully cure before hauling anything.  It has been 3 months and it looks like crap.  There are huge chunks that came off and the metal is exposed.  This is NOT good for work trucks!
B00KYYMMM6|5|I finally got it to work on my 2010 Tacoma with these directions!!  1. Begin with the key out of the ignition.  2. OPEN and UNLOCK the DRIVER'S side door. CLOSE all other doors including the trunk.  3. Within 5 seconds INSERT the key into the ignition and PULL it out TWICE.  4. CLOSE then OPEN the DRIVER's side door TWICE.  5. Insert key INTO the ignition then REMOVE it.  6. CLOSE then OPEN the DRIVER's side door TWICE.  7. Insert the key INTO the ignition and LEAVE it in ignition.  8. CLOSE the DRIVER's side door.  9. Switch the ignition to ON then OFF.  10. REMOVE the key from ignition.  11. The door locks will now cycle to confirm the vehicle has successfully entered programming mode.  12. PUSH and HOLD the LOCK and UNLOCK button for 1.5 seconds on the first remote being programmed. As soon as you let go PUSH the UNLOCK button and HOLD it for 2 seconds.  13. The door locks will cycle to confirm successful programming of the remote. If you have any additional remotes to program repeat step 12 if you have no additional remotes proceed to step 14.  14. OPEN the DRIVER'S side door. Programming is now complete.
B000CPI0R8|3|Works as described. Leaves a residue on paint and doesn't penetrate light rust
B00NTOCPVG|5|Super bright as it says. ..
B00158SFNK|1|This was not worth buying. It failed the first time I used it. I was actually upset since I used it for a cooler that plugged into the car outlet of my brand new car. I first heard a clicking noise and then it failed.
B000V53VR8|5|It is the same as my 2013 OEM Ford Expedition filter.
B00NVBW5EY|5|A simple easy solution to a vexing problem.  I thought theses contraptions wouldn't fit when I got them but they slipped into that space between the seats just fine.  On my way rushing to golf yesterday, I dropped my phone into the abyss.  I was able to pull the phone out in just seconds without going under the seat from outside the car or hurting my hand.  Money well spent.  I should order another two for my husband.
B001RMMHHE|5|Perfect size for washing the car
B00MTHPAN4|1|I got 2 pairs and didn't even work
B00Z0F9XCG|5|Replaced 3 of the festoon bulbs in my car that need this size; very happy with illumination.
B00JIEX722|5|!!! SUPER FREAKIN BRIGHT !!! Despite the reviews here, I was still skeptical about how bright these would be; I've used tons of different LED bulbs and some are good while most are not!  These, on the other hand, are GREAT! It's ridiculous how bright this little bulb can get.  My application is on a 2004 Suburban's interior lights.  I had previous T10 bulbs and festoons but I got some new festoons that were extremely bright and my old T10 LEDs looked too dim.  I bought these 'hoping' I could get something close to my new festoon's brightness but knew that was prolly not gonna happen since the festoon's are so bright.  Well - these bulbs are BRIGHTER than the festoons!?!?  I don't even know how that's possible but I give the bulbs an A++++
B0030VECMI|5|Nice easy installation.  Literally takes 2 minutes to install.
B00IK2MNZK|4|Item not exact fit but works .Started on first pull that is a plus
B00BGYBY2W|5|Works great. Fits my key fob. Still have it on my fob and it still looks new. Will order more but the way this one holds up probably wouldn't need to. Might get more just to change colors.
B00C5A9324|2|All plastic only metal is sides were latches are. I don't think it will last very long. ( save your money )
B002QLHQ0S|5|Product was as described. Fast shipping
B000OZSABW|5|Great product
B004PWDDA8|5|Quick mailing, great price! fits perfect.
B005P9T8TA|5|Looks good. Fit well
B008LODWTI|5|It's great!!!!!
B00HQ3BSNW|5|Love it
B004OFPFUW|5|Awesome I love it. Fits my Prius c perfectly
B00KTI086E|5|They were delivered very fast and they work great! The dealer programmed both remotes and cut the keys for $50. Now I have a spare in case I lose another one. Would recommend this option to any one who lost a Fob or just wants to have extras.
B004C6EKOK|4|Nit a bad bag that looks OK and so far has been holding up just fine
B00FUT7IP6|4|Great coil packs
B002UCAFXI|5|This does a 110% job at cleaning almost any vinyl or plastic composite surface compared to spray 9 that does about 9% job.  I love this more than any natural cleaner I've ever used and 101% more than spray 9!
B000C9I8PS|4|Item as described, perfect fit.
B00829HYTQ|2|This is the second product made by Aisin that has failed me. Luckily, I did not put this on my truck. It looked to have hair-line cracks in the inside and outside housing and I was not willing to run the risk. I returned it to AMAZON, I am now very skeptical about Aisin products. They used to be built very well and lasted. Now I am not too sure about their quality. I put a brand new Aisin Brake Master Cylinder on my truck and it failed with 6 months. Buyer Beware !
B00HFLBRI6|5|Great fit
B00M9MWHXA|5|Excellent product and a sick look. Highly recommended. Seller shipped super fast. Got it days before expected.
B003XGYDE2|4|Good quality for the price, quick delivery
B001G7L2Y4|4|ok
B00020CB2S|5|JUST WHAT I EXPECTED
B00ZOKJVAG|5|I was not sure about how the sticky would work, BUT THEY DO!  Triple digit temp and these babes are keeping my car cooler.  I have seen worst days.
B00BPKR6Y2|5|Possibly the greatest wire out there.  It is the most flexible wire i have worked with.  I will definitely use KnuKonceptz for all of the audio/accessory runs i make in the future.
B00L6FWK0G|5|Love it. Thanks
B004SR7JVO|5|This little unit saved me a big expense. I thought my actuators had gone bad. In all reality what was happening is this unit was getting wet and when that would happen it would not hold the actuators in. and they would grind. Since I have gotten this I haven't had a single issue. I love it!!
B007USCM7E|5|good product and good price
B003O59X9C|5|Fit very well on my DRZ400SM, but I had to cut the ends out for my bark busters.
B005PZMKZI|4|Get what you pay for. But non-the less, they look good in my car. Good product for its price.
B0032H6WNW|4|The top is great and exactly what I was looking for; especially for the price.  4 out of 5 because, like others have mentioned, it does flap fairly violently at high speeds.  The plastic clips to secure the back straps to your Jeep are a joke and the culprit.  I wish they would have produced something a little more durable.  I cut out the plastic clips and bought ratchet tie downs with s-hooks to replace them.  A week in and I hear zero noise and my commute is 75% highway driving.  It's amazing what a difference they made.  I recommend this top but plan the extra $10 to buy ratchet tie downs with s-hooks and with a little re-fabrication; you have a solid safari top.
B00NGYOM7O|5|Looks great and stuck on easy.
B007HGCFAS|5|fits perfect as a replacement.
B008UOLOB2|4|Nice product, cloth is located in the base of the bottle***
B00KSZ5F5C|1|I applied it the hood and roof of my car. It bubbled up horrible a week after I did it! I'm going to have to tear it all off
B000GVEGV2|5|Installed on an 08 Rocker C. Allowed me to transfer tag to swing.<br />Couple mods needed. Overall excellent fit and finish.<br />The light is very bright as well.
B001O7PNNM|5|This product does polish away the very outer layers of the clear coat.  It has a gentle abrasive (not as aggressive as rubbing compound for example).  If you follow the directions it works extremely well.  There are some oils that give it a temporary sheen, but the product still does what it is supposed to: My truck had very oxidized layer that made it look like it had a milky film.  Washing would not get rid of it because the clear coat was oxidized and this was embedded in the material. After using the product I noticed an improvement, but in the sunlight I could see that it was not perfect.  I applied two more times.  This did the trick.  I followed up with Mothers caranuba wax for a lasting shine, and to also remove a little more oxidation.<br /><br />The difference is night and day,  Point is: that if you use this product and still see oxidation or water spots, or swirl marks you probably need 1 or 2 more applications,<br /><br />I used a motorized buffer.
B000BZJE9C|5|working good fit my bmw e46
B00BCRMA9Y|1|Thought these items fit the 2012 Chevy cruze. None of the bottom seat cover stays in place and the back seat bottom and top doesn't even fit at all.
B000OO105Q|5|worked for what I needed
B00KWNUHXU|5|The cover fit nicely and has kept the rain out. It was easy to install and i did it in under 20 minutes solo. 2006 ford f350.
B000CIK9LA|5|obnoxious droning is now gone. awesome.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Love it.
B0024IWDII|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00DVHG882|4|They really good, stops a lot the vibration and are real dependable if you decide to go down one day.
B009NCLF96|3|There's no heat sink on the back. It's just a piece of glass and mine was off centered. When I have my dome light on auto, the leds stay lit at about 10% power. It's not distracting just annoying. So far it only does this while driving not parked.
B00UG52P7U|2|Looks much bigger in the picture really small and not all that functional.
B004JQ0FHY|5|Came quick as promised. Still have to install the new part, but it's Identical to the old one
B00IYHD3VE|1|Junk
B000CQBG1O|5|Easy installation.
B008968LXK|5|Pretty. Went on easy.
B004ND823C|5|Again, great to get a replacement for a favorite key chain that was missing some small parts.
B00IRBPCEI|3|Very neat! Won't open the pliers while screwdrivers are next to it. Small gap in the pliers while closed, won't be a sturdy keychain, maby if closed on carbine.
B00DYN3IKY|5|A bit expensive but works fine.
B0002Z9O8C|5|Perfect for my 2007 Jeep Liberty.  Easy to install and take off when needed.
B0017OZZT4|3|My  seat cover are running (like a panty hoses,when something catch it.) because this was made with cheap stuff. Its only been in my car for  two months and one month my car was not working. Love hello kitty but will not order from this place anymore. Will get out  of store next time. Everything else was fine.
B00063X7KG|5|Works great. Product box was severely dented and possibly opened but product was perfectly fine
B00OU67Z80|5|It's super bright. Comes with dc and ac charger and red lens. The flip up thing is an inverted stand, which is nice. Keep it by the back door for coyotes, walking and take it in the boat. We can see clearly for 5 acres. Glad we spent a little extra to get a tgood one.
B0009VIQ1A|3|I got one of these when I was 16 and used it for 16 years, until my partner decided it needed to be washed and ran it through the machine :'( I loved that thing.  RIP.<br /><br />Not sure about my new one, I see that it leaves greasy streaks on my paint and windows.  I try to not dust when the car is super hot.  This is now currently sitting in the garage, and I am using generic target one which just pushes dust around...I can't decide which is better (or worse).
B00B5LMFR4|4|It works. It was cheap and that shows in the quality of the materials.  One of the buttons doesn't work very well but when I removed the black rubber covering it I was able to access the mechanism of the button directly and it worked fine.  There is something about the rubber black cover that doesn't work very well. But given the price this is a very good deal.  Bright light.  it does everything it says it will do.  Except, of course, I haven't tested the seatbelt knive or the window breaking spike.  But they appear sturdy.
B0090JVTYI|5|Fits perfect
B000IY6VE2|5|I purchased this compressor as a replacement for the worn and knocking unit in my 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport, along with a Four Seasons 83106 Accumulator, liquid line & expansion orifice, and suction/discharge manifold. After thoroughly purging the condenser and evaporator core, I installed this new compressor and other components, filled the system with appropriate compressor oil, pulled a vacuum, and charged with R134-a. The compressor kicked right on during the charging process, as expected, and was very quiet. Once the system was completely charged, I was able to get 42 degree air out of my center vents on an ~85 degree day.<br /><br />The compressor works well, is quiet, fit perfectly (including the wiring harness), and had a nice smooth and quiet pulley bearing, especially when compared to the one it was replacing. I've had it for about a week and have been impressed with its performance. Driving it yesterday after the car sat in hot sun all day, the A/C was able to cool the car down quickly and pull the high humidity out of the cabin. I did quite a bit of research on compressors before settling on this one, and (so far) I'm glad I did. It seems to be a high quality unit, well packaged, and looks nice, to boot. I was also pleased to find out that the unit was manufactured in the United States, as noted in another review and confirmed by the label.<br /><br />The attached photo shows the compressor installed in my Jeep engine (right side of photo near the red cap).
B000UVUAFO|4|not bad works better than expected
B000FW7V50|5|THE BEST..........
B002RLCLYI|5|Looks and works great.
B00H1IC3RM|5|Exactly as described and delivered very fast.
B00079Y7NK|5|Great looking jacket no doubt and for a lower price it's amazing a bit heavy and stiff but hey that's how motorcycle jackets feel after all amazing jacket
B001L9KI56|1|Didn''t fit well on my grip (Honda CBF300) so it twisted instead of working throttle.Even with rubber band it fell off since it was too loose. Not a loss, it didn't do the job for me. Maybe a larger grip would work but I will buy my next one from another company.
B001GC2LVM|5|These work great and fast shipping
B005T5RUDQ|4|EXCELLENT will buy again for other motorcycles I buy
B001LF6JLM|5|Good stuff
B003R2RCH2|5|Love it! Got a few weird looks and a few thumbs up while driving around town. :D
B00CQ7WL4I|4|Product was as advertised
B004HOXKS4|5|Amazing filter
B00MH4663C|5|Nice
B00OHV5ENQ|5|Work good
B0001EVUB8|1|Received this today and tried to install it but ended up pulling it back off. The Passenger side wasn't bad although I am not a huge fan of double sided tape but the Driver side would not line up due to the piece being deformed. I probably held it in place for thirty minutes trying to get it to hold the correct form but had no luck. Its a shame as I like the looks of these installed but this was a waste for me.
B00DYXTO9S|5|Great sticker for the price. The color of the sticker makes it seem like it would be green with white lettering, however, the seller clearly noted that the white represents the vinyl and the green is just a background to show what it would look like installed on green. Seller states unless you notify them of the color you'd like, white will be shipped by default. I was stoked when my decal arrived. It was installed on my white 2014 Evolution X. I have dark tint, so the white on black looks pretty awesome. I'm pleased.<br /><br />***PLEASE NOTE: If You Do Not Notify Me At The Time Of Purchase Stating The Color That You Would Like, The Default Color Of [White] Will Be Shipped.***
B004SR7JVO|5|Works fine
B00C0SQ8KG|2|NOT Cree LED. These are led bulbs. I kept the light bar because the price was cheap but it's not what they advertise
B007XE8C74|5|real nice code reader
B000CMF3U8|1|garbage they changed the design and they don't work write on the older cars now its a total piece of junk
B00HJ6QI0O|5|Worked great.
B00IYIL61C|2|We have four of these radios.  They are used for talking to my kids on our sidecar motorcycle.  Also they are used to hear GPS directions, and occasionally take a cell call.  I am not impressed.  One big disappointment that is not clear from the product description is that you cannot conference 3 or 4 radios and use a cell or GPS.  You may only speak with only one rider if you wish to also use a cell phone or GPS.  There is frequent radio interference (noise) between the radios (they are a few feet apart mind you - not a 100 yards apart on separate bikes).  One unit the battery failed to take a charge and was replaced under warranty.  The radios do not reliably connect to a new Garmin GPS, nor to a cell phone.  Sometimes the connect, sometimes they don't.  The radios need occasional repairing with themselves and the GPS/phone.  For us the battery life is far less than advertised (4-5 hours max ride time with intercom on - note this is not talking 4-5 hours but merely with the intercom on 4-5 hours).  These radios are loaded with current firmware R1.06 and were purchased from Revzilla.  On the plus side, when working, they are loud enough, and the kids love them.  I would not recommend them, especially for the price.
B002WH7ATS|5|Was a direct fit for my 2006 Town and Country.  No modifications needed except for moving over the overflow hose holder from the old fan assembly.  This is an relatively fix.<br /><br />The fans seem to be high quality.  I'm happy with my purchase.
B00COYNZKC|5|It was scratched and does not fit my 2015 Corolla. Will be returning it. Very disappointed in the quality also, it looks cheap.  Update: I got a friend to get this to fit my steering wheel and I totally take back everything I said. It is gorgeous and I get a ton of compliments. It is not the best material but it doesn't make my hands hot or sweaty so I actually am in love with it now and would recommend it. It matches with the pink and black and white zebra shoulder seat belt flaps and looks like a set.
B0097N2LDA|3|Can't beat them for the price... I thought the strips were kind of small, but they are really bright...... excellent!!
B00MATVMC4|3|Not great quality but will do in a pinch
B00MB0EX46|4|Photo is different then what is actually sent. Photo shows 4 holes for mounting and the one received has 2 holes. BUT quality is great and still fits just fine on my car.
B00QJVLJBI|5|great product even works on side windows.
B00PBEN5PW|4|It was just what I wanted just like the picture
B00F6EWHEM|5|Item arrived on time and as described.
B0007IJR22|5|Good price and fast shipping
B008S0VYTA|5|perfect!!
B000JFL7ZS|5|Works perfect!
B00D8RYGOI|5|Great light bar for the money. No complaints worked great every time. Didn't have issues with water in the lense like other cheaper light bars. Top notch service and products. Thanks!
B00KTHSYXO|2|My old electronics didn't work in it.  Bought one with new electronics and it worked fine.
B00KTJ9I46|5|Works as advertised,comes with Instructions.
B00EYPGQTQ|5|Great quality. Nice fit. Fit my 08 FJ perfectly.
B007BJ79P2|5|Beautiful thanx.
B000ELP6HW|5|This product worked great,  fit well, no problems so far and came with a roadside assistance program
B0007WTE08|4|JUST WHAT I EXPECTED
B00GONV6PA|5|Got so quick,installed quick!!looks great.
B0013REXSO|4|nice product
B00PFFG1EO|4|I have a Porsche Cayman S 2006. The problem is: Porsche do not publish full details of the OBD messages for their cars. They want owners of these cars to pay their service department who have very specialized hardware and software to read and reset the codes. At the time I bought this I did not know that and hoped this would help. It did work with the car, and an iPhone app I downloaded, but could only tell me the most general stuff about the car. All the Porsche specific stuff I wanted to know was beyond the capability of the app.<br />To be fair to this device: it does what it claims to do. It allows you to connect to its wifi network with your phone, and it will allow you to see a lot of information about your car. It is not the fault of the makers of this device that some car manufacturers hide the details of the car interface for their own reasons. On the other hand you should know before you buy it whether it is likely to do what you need it to do. If you have a Porsche, and you want to read and reset service codes, then this is not going to do it. What I ended up buying was a full &#34;PIWIS&#34; tester from eBay, most likely one stolen from a real Porsche service center. Sadly, for that model of car, only the real interface designed by the maker is going to give you all the information and control you seek.
B00ODF45R2|5|Very Cute!!
B000O0KGH8|5|OEM part-highly recommend.  No reason to buy any other.
B003WDMUC8|5|Perfect must have accessory for all motos added my own customization to my bike and looks great
B00J6ZI566|5|Awesome!!! Hitch fit exactly perfect. It was so nice to have a product that had no problems mounting up. Installed by myself in about 1.5 hours with zero modifications to the vehicle or hitch. Great product Reese!
B008DHDK4K|5|This is my second plate.  Beautiful shine and looks great on both of my cars
B00JO0T7GU|5|Fits perfect!!! Hope I don't lose it ...
B00EO93LNQ|5|Not cheaply made and fit exactly as expected
B00X6DE35Q|4|When this product arrived it came in a big box, shipping was very fast learner, the design is accurate it looks the same as the photo the shades for the windows on the other hand are like fabric on cling wrap, they fell off over and over again, it was very aggravating. When I welt to use my sun shade. It kept slipping down and falling, I have to tape it for it to stay, it said guaranteed fit for my car, I think that should be removed asap
B000TYHQ18|1|i baught because they were cheap to find out to put them on you have to take the front forks of the bike apart. totally not doing that. so they were sold at a Garage sale.<br />i advise not getting them unless you absolutly need them or unless you are like a motor head that can put them on yourself.
B007ZH5JLQ|4|Radiator fit my 2.4L 00tacoma, the only thing is the fan shroud didn't fit on this particular radiator.  but still good deal
B00MUUETKU|5|Ordering/delivery was quick, fast , and EASY!!
B0007ZHA92|4|they were a lot better then the other ones I had
B00AZ4SGT8|5|easy to install and they work great
B00YYIVH2Y|4|Good quality but still a bit small  for my car even though it say large, but it's great to use when animal is on board.
B000EQR87S|5|Works like a charm took care of code show!
B00UKJMVXA|5|i installed the fans and shroud over a month ago. They are quieter than the stock fans. I have a 2004 mazda rx8 4 speed automatic. Been through some serious 95 plus days in Boston traffic for hours. Only thing is I don't like AC, so I didn't test super hot days with the ac on. These fans clear the battery tray and take the extra heat off the automatic trans cooler. Im ready to by a fan setup for my 87 Rx7
B000W0RQ8C|5|Great product
B00CE1IZDW|4|Works great just need butt connectors to make it work.
B004I8M03K|5|I was skeptical, but they were perfect, best price on the net and arrived on schedule.
B00IQ2P6WG|5|The lock is sturdy and fits perfectly on my tow hitch.
B007L72U1C|5|oem at a good price
B00RW4LL6O|1|Terrible quality but to be expected at the price the item is sold. The driver side came unglued and flew off middle of the interstate at 70mph. Luckily no vehicles were behind me. So to sum it up, please be careful of something like this as this could have caused a major accident or potentially hurt someone.
B00B2ACY4C|3|Ordered them for my 2004 Tacoma for the dome and map lights, and they work &#34;if&#34; the truck is running, but not if the ignition is off! Well....let my clarify that. They &#34;do&#34; flicker when you open the doors, but do not light up like they should. Same with the map lights. Pull over...turn the engine off..turn on a map light and...flicker flicker flicker...no lights. Had the alternator, starter, and battery checked...all good. That's why the three stars. They work great if your driving or the engine is running, but I sorta like my dome light to come on when I enter the truck, not after I'm in and driving! If someone knows how this is an easy fix, let me know so I can add the two other stars.
B00C7Z0BZ0|5|fit my heritage with my windshield, perfect fit for the price, its great just wanted a dust cover for inside my garage and this is it
B003G9G4X4|5|This part was easy to install, look for video on YouTube, and a great price.  It has worked well heating the water in our travel trailer this summer.  Also, very prompt delivery.
B000CINVA6|5|Great product and very easy to apply.
B0058U69RU|5|Ugly bolts stick out
B005JPJDGS|5|Good stuff, but pricey.
B00Z5QQZXU|5|I will finish replacing the rest of the lights in my travel trailer because they do not put of any heat. They are not as bright but I like that fact also it doesn't hurt my eyes.
B004GZQSEC|5|Awesome product for the price, easy to install!
B00CIJ3T1S|5|We like it!
B00IMTSQES|2|This cover is beautiful but I've only had it on my steering wheel is a few days and most of the rhinestones have fell off already in witch really sucks . I paid good money for this and its already garbage.
B00H8DFKS4|3|Not too bad. Bulbs flickers once in a while.
B000BQW9N4|5|This is the best product I have found for all leathers. Leaves the leather soft and pliable, but not slick like so many other products.
B00JQZST80|1|3 out of 5 purchased either do not light up appropriately or have holes that do not align on the mounting bracket.
B004I6H59G|5|Great quick fix !
B00KTIVQEW|5|Thank you ! I saved alot of money ordering it here than buying it from the Dealship . Works great !
B00KB9FCEY|5|I love this sticker!  Both funny and direct, it gets my message across to please keep the recyclables out of my trash.  Great quality, too!
B00X0G3U5I|5|Is this cat not stinking cute!  Looks great on my little car.
B00I8IPD8K|5|Fits perfect!
B003D6Y216|4|Good stuff.  Brings up the &#34;shiny&#34; real nice.  Use after 39060 for best results.  Used this on my black jeep and after a wash and finish 2001 looks great.  14 y.o. and 140,000 miles.  New emblems coming.
B010Q4PW4S|1|Wouldn't stick to my car
B001OMVCIC|5|Works very well and easy to install. My truck is dropped so the springs are shorter than normal. I put these on to prevent bottoming out when loaded or empty. 5psi keeps it riding well when empty. I increased it to 20-25 and took the family on vacation with the truck bed full of baggage and an ice chest. Went 800 + miles with no problems.
B007VB03RG|1|This item does not fit a 2012 Subaru Outback.  It is not a very easy installation.  To get to the point where you need to insert the new bulb and find that it is too large to fit through the hole, is quote frustrating.  I then needed to get things back together to run to an auto parts store to buy a normal replacement bulb.  Not fun.
B00KN0UOEE|5|As a professional detailer, we have a subscription to this stuff. We don't use it on everything, but the high end monthly customers request it to protect their investment.  Use it on interior and exterior to protect from UV rays and fading. Leaves a nice finish without being greasy or super shiny.
B00FALVU8A|5|Easy to use. I use it as part of the chemical guys black paint kit
B00LD1F3UC|3|Installed on  a 2007 Subaru Forester about a year ago. 40,000 KM on it so far and there are no problems yet. If you are getting the check engine light for your cat you might want to consider replacing the rear O2 sensor first or at the same time if you're frustrated.
B00GI781GE|5|Very bright, bulbs are a little longer then stock 3175 bulbs but they do fit and work with no problems and no heat
B00KTI0AIA|4|They WORK!
B00CH8R5RE|3|I really like the quality of the mats - no issues there.  Just note that when you buy the &#34;complete set&#34; you are not getting the cargo mat which I would have considered a &#34;complete set&#34; otherwise it should say &#34;front and back row&#34;.  I should have paid closer attention to the pictures which does not show the cargo mat.
B00NN8MYA0|5|Arrived on time, as described.
B000P76ETY|3|First, I hate metal ties.  I get why they're necessary, but I still hate them...<br /><br />Secondly, this stuff is fiberglass - or has fiberglass in it.  Not a big deal unless you have to remove it after usage as the fibers get eeeeverywhere.  If you've ever had to go poking around in the attic with fiberglass insulation and have gotten that stuff on you - thats what it's like.<br /><br />Thirdly - and I probably just got a jerk for my smog guy (CA smog...) - they gave me grief at the smog station for not using the &#34;stock&#34; heat shield stating that it affects emissions and exhaust gas temperature, but couldn't really back it up with any useful facts or information or site anything that stated that the wrap was an 'illegal' modification to the emissions system.  Suffice to say, despite my arguments, he wouldn't touch it unless I put the stock shield back on which pretty much meant I had to cut this stuff off.  To be honest, the only reason I really wanted to put it on was so that I'd get the benefit of a 'heat shield' without having a bunch of hot metal in my way if I needed to stick my hand down in there.  Oh well...  wonder what they'd have said if I had carb legal headers...  I think he may have used his poor english as an excuse not to explain himself.<br /><br />To be fair, I used this on my stock jeep headers - again, wasn't really for performance reasons.  On that note, wrapping cast headers with a fairly non-uniform shape is a PITA!  Used lots of the metal ties...
B0000BX6RG|3|like
B003XWYCVU|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B0050LU2GQ|4|This is a well made placard holder and it is much nicer than another style I bought where the hook snapped off after several months of use. My only problem with this one is that the hook was to small for the mirror in my Tacoma truck.  The mirror has a wiring harness going into the back of it so the post is a bit thicker than a standard rearview mirror.  My &#34;fix&#34; for this problem was to remove the small round magnet from the hook part and I super-glued it to the back of my mirror.  Before gluing it I painted the magnet black and once it was glued on it looked like part of the mirror.  It works perfect like this and I think I like it even better since I don't have the hook part hanging from the mirror all the time.  This is a very well made holder and it looks like it will last a long time.  Minus one star since I had to modify it so it would work for my vehicle otherwise a great product.<br /><br />I just saw they have another version available for this holder which has a small chain you can adjust for larger mirror posts.  If your mirror has a thicker post I would definitely recommend that version.  If you get the right version for your type of mirror I believe you would be very happy with this holder.
B00E9FPSSG|5|these are cute, i bought 2 to match with my bf and he likes it also. they are very durable, still on the cars and they haven't even faded with this Texas sun which is a plus cos all the other fade -_-
B00I8IU150|5|Fits perfectly in my 2013 FIT
B00LEBLI82|5|Worked Great in RV.
B006GJK8MY|5|Very good product
B00T74VX24|3|giving this 3 stars just because they is no charger cord for the Samsung Galaxy 5,  one of the reason I bought itother than that seems to work just fine
B00RC1NW1O|5|Great price on an equivalent item.
B00COYNZX4|2|Poor fabric.
B003DNJ732|1|Flimsy. Tore easily.
B001IH8PXI|1|The lock does not work!! It won't slide up or down. You have to fight with it and even then it doesn't work properly. This item is not up to the same quality as other Reese locks I have bought in the past from big box stores. Don't waste your money. They however offer a full refund.
B000C920CA|5|I think this is the best amber bulb out there. The amber coating is either in the glass or very well fused to the glass, I can't tell.
B00P9OF04I|2|Definitely improves the look but unsure if it really improved light transmission. The spray sealer that finishes the process gives it a wet look but the lens still isn't clear on my headlights. The white haze is gone but there is still blurriness when looking through the headlight. Might just be my headlights but I feel a multistage sanding kit might have been a better option for me as I was hoping for a big increase in light transmission, not just  making the headlight look better visually. I will do a comparison on my wife's car as a comparison to see how much actual light output changes and update this review with some pictures.<br /><br />Update: I did my wifes car yesterday and I spent extra time with the buffing pad until I was sure that everything was uniform haze and there were no spots visible when wiped with a wet cloth. I cleaned it really well and after applying the sealer spray I still show the same effect as on my truck where it's more of a blurry clear look. I was extra careful not to over apply the spray as well thinking maybe that was an issue when I treated my truck headlights. With her car I just did one headlight and from in the car my wife couldn't tell which headlight had been treated based on light output. It definitely looks nicer as it doesn't have a white haze but I don't think there is much if any more light output. Not very satisfied and wish I would have gone with a multi step sanding and buffing kit than this two step kit. Oh well, live and learn. I added some pictures of the headlight cleaned and treated and the one that I didn't treat.<br />Bottom line: If you want your headlights to look nicer, this kit does do that but they are not crystal clear and doesn't greatly improve light output.
B00EO2MWNI|4|It seems to be pretty decent quality. I'm not sure how much torque it would hold up to though.<br />I usually use a breaker bar to break.bolts loose first and then use this to help remove fasteners a bit more easily so I'm not too worried about it breaking.<br /><br />I will say that it was a bit awkward to use under the car, but over all not a bad product. It's definitely something I'd recommend but not without a breaker bar
B00M3Q78AO|5|Great sunshade to block sun and keep steering wheel from getting too hot.
B000RXNLK6|3|I used it as a lubricant for clay. It does not leave any residue. I am not really sure it is any better than water.
B008JYXYNY|3|When it works it is great .... however, once it disappeared into the seatbelt holder in the car and that was a problem to get it out.
B00A1E1LOO|5|Love them!  I put them on the gas tank of a red 1980 Yamaha SR 250 that I put an aftermarket Frisco Chopper tank on.  It gives the little motorcycle the Then Came Bronson look.  :-)
B004A6MBDO|5|I'm completely satisfied with Services and  products  I will recommend
B00594B1KA|5|works great good quality
B00EN34U9W|4|went on my guitar case!
B009DJRN18|5|Delivered on time and item was just as described
B000FW2MCM|1|This compass is a piece of junk, DO NOT BUY. No matter how it it oriented it will not read the correct direction and cannot be calibrated to do so. It reacts the same in a vehicle or outside the vehicle so it is not electronics or metal causing the problem.<br />Save some money, use a different method to get your directions.
B002935IV2|5|Perfect for long trips. We traveled 17 hours by car to Orlando and the bag performed as spected we also used  2 extra straps
B002MQCYO0|5|I've been using Plexus on the (plexiglass) windshield of my airplane for years and am very happy with the results.
B001FCJTNG|5|Awesomr
B006N9FLLU|5|perfect fit excelent qualityAAAAAAAAa
B00BNVK2TY|5|works as advertised.
B001TZEIBM|2|This did not shoot the product well
B0094JKMII|5|it installed easy look good
B000E67166|5|Works as advertised.  No problems so far.
B00FWOKKGI|5|Works really good, wired up easily on the back of my flatbed pickup, I would buy another if I had something that needed a brighter light at night
B00B5K9WO4|5|Racing beat tries to con you into buying their second section, this bolted right up to the main cat with the pick up line for the 5/6th port. Do not buy this if your cat has the pick up right on the header. You need a different one for that. I have an 87 so I'm fine.<br /><br />also my cat is hollowed out.
B00IIOH6BQ|5|I can't give this jacket enough praise.  I'm not a girly girl and definitely didn't want something with designs all over it.  This one fit the bill.  It's got style, it's an amazing waxed cotton and it fits like a glove.  I'm typically a size Large in most shirts/jackets but this runs a little small on me.  I got an XL and it's perfect.  The armor is sold separately but also well worth the money.
B00UGZ2AIE|5|Awesome !!!
B00JSAB3MM|1|from the picture it looks like there bevoled but there not. I needed them to be bevoled, so no I'm not happy
B00GIXEPFO|4|Fit great on my 2010 Charger, too.
B00062ZJ4O|2|Would not by a second bottle
B002QGVWBW|5|The battery worked just fine. Great deal.
B006X8CXT4|5|Great price and fast delivery. Easy install but the whole bumper had to come off
B005PPU64A|5|Fair price arrived on time
B00GKTZAHS|5|Great price and great quality.
B00PJBN67E|5|Can't say much more than - these guys are so cute! I have resisted putting family decals on my car for years. I just never found a design that quite fit us. That has changed with these minions. Cute. Big. Easy to install.
B000AMBNPY|5|Fits my driver side and passenger door perfectly, easy to apply, super secure and easy to remove as well.
B00M3RCEQG|5|Love it . Perfect price
B004ZF44NA|5|Had problems with bulb when I first got kit but customer service was great A+ helped me out sent me new bulbs no problem working now great product will buy from again looking to get fog lights
B00DIIL6D6|5|This was on two 9 hour trips this year. Just be advised that the Tablet (we had an ipad air) must be out of any case that it is in. This is setup to take the Tablet only as the opening is narrow. MY son actually left his hinged case on and put the back half of the case in the opening so that the screen was outside the plastic cover. We did test the plastic cover and it does work with finger touch. The other pockets are handy too. He stored snacks and drinks and some pencils.
B00KTJ0EYO|5|1 for wife 1 for me and goes well with red Avalanche.
B00OCAIBM8|5|It's great being able to lift the armrest without everything falling out.
B001FC7DUC|5|Keeps the air flow going out of the RV
B013TKQTL6|4|The most practical propane tank holder. Its compact, light weight, and easy to use and store !
B0030DM8JK|5|so far so good...
B0072W0ODC|4|Ok
B00VHOE3RE|1|This is a peice of crap item. First of all it came opened.<br />Second the suction cup doesn't even suck on the screen lol what's the purpose of it if it doesn't suck on the screen?<br /><br />And it really came in a busted dusty opened box
B00XWBJN34|1|Too small for anything except a phone😠 I would rate 0 if possible.
B009LN7UKA|5|The people at Detroit were excellent.
B001F0NNA8|5|Perfect fit for my 2002 grand am. Installed in about 10 minutes. All you need is a 10 mm socket and a flathead screwdriver.
B00CHQ0F1E|5|assortment was a good deal
B00BQE5JAK|5|I use these lights for my Burgman 400.
B00WS3P37C|3|its ok
B00F66T7XE|4|Ah i finally found a nozzle that works with my Pontiac. The old one fried in the Arizona sun. But at $22 it was not cheap!
B0031P6FJG|5|This arrived super fast and is a perfect fit replacement to the one in my travel trailer. The plastic handle on mine broke and would no longer tighten up the clamp. This was an easy and quick swap out replacement!
B00O2RP93U|5|Great!
B0006NE3KE|5|Always had difficulty with glue type plugs. This thing was quick and easy and it works.
B006C1NTEU|3|Too small, hard to see.
B00002N9G3|5|A tool I find indispensable for my farm truck
B000CB0K34|5|Quiet & quality belt
B00LUS7RKW|4|I recently installed this cv axle shaft on my Grand Prix. It was to replace one that had a leaky boot. The workmanship and quality looks to be great on the axle and it is functioning very well. Recommended.
B00U8O8BHW|5|part fit perfectly  no problems
B00CJ0B6KC|3|Did not fit 1988 Coleman popup camper.. also thinner than original, but probably would serve the purpose if it fit... apparently, there are two sizes of these.
B00G0LJNAQ|5|The right product for Malibu 2012 2LT
B005A7THWA|5|Love it! Got a few weird looks and a few thumbs up while driving around town. :D
B00Y3U5A6C|5|A very well-made jacket, particularly at this price point. The fit and finish, including all stitching is secure and the jacket presents well.  I normally wear a large in similarly styled items however I suspected this one might be a bit snug so I ordered an extra- large and it fits like it was custom made.<br /><br /> The synthetic outer shell appears durable although only that's always a speculative consideration.  The jacket is sensibly armored in all areas one might anticipate and with the exception of the rear panel which is a little flimsier than I would prefer, it seems as though it would provide a reasonable degree of protection in the event of an unfortunate mishap.<br /><br />The jacket has effectively located zipper closure venting, velcro closures at the wrists and waist, ample pockets including a hidden interior pocket for mobile devices. There is reflective stripping on the lower sleeve area. The removable interior quilted lining makes this a jacket that can stand up to most weather conditions.<br /><br />I received a sample for evaluation.
B008IXMEPU|5|I Bought them for our Tractor and they work get.  Gives us more warning.  love them wish they had more of them.
B004VFJM68|4|Perfectly good cross bars so far (3 months). Minimal road noise, usually only over 70mph, and if I don't have the windows down its barely audible. Holds my 14', relatively heavy kayak well. Bars sag a bit when its strapped in super tight, but they hold and are perfectly straight when the kayak is removed. Easy to mount and reposition. I wouldn't recommend for anything heavier than a kayak or canoe, but it works perfectly well for my purposes.
B000CPJRPW|5|Mil-spec fit works as expected. Do not use any set screw or clamp to hold any decorative cover on. doing so will dent the switch and it will no longer work.
B00DGVRXD2|5|oh man oh man oh man..... to use a gas can without it sucking the big one.  These things are so worth it.
B00GUF74HQ|5|Life saver
B001FAGKDU|1|Absolute garbage.  Light duty fabric, poor stitching, and lousy fitment.  Things started to pull apart as soon as I began installing them on a pair of stock 2005 Jeep TJ seats.  Within minutes a strap and a bungee had pulled loose.  Their stitching had unraveled.  First and last Rugged Ridge product I'll ever buy.
B00JJZ1SQC|5|Good stuff!
B00CB0459E|5|Had them on my 2013 Challenger R/T for 8 months and very happy with this purchase. Deep throaty sound, but not overwhelming obnoxious. Glad I bought Solo.
B00FK336QW|4|it worked fine
B00BH110LY|4|Classic not to overwhelm flashing but just enough plus their hard to steal so I know I'm going to have them for a long time very satisfied
B00QRHDIPY|5|I used this solar panel when I left my car at the airport car park for 2 weeks.<br />The electronics on modern cars still drain the battery (even when the car is laid up) so it is a good idea to connect one of these trickle chargers. On some cars , the cigarette lighter socket is still live when the ignition switch is 'off'. In which case the device can be plugged into the cigarette lighter/accessory socket. Otherwise the other cables are long enough to reach under the bonnet and connect onto the battery directly. The device is then placed somewhere inside the vehicle that also can catch the sunlight (dashboard/sunroof etc).<br />Nice item at a good price.
B0069ARUKI|5|I have used it a lot in the last 4 1/2 months.  It works great & it was priced right. Quality!
B0094HYFVA|1|The listing says that this will fit a 1999 Chevrolet Tracker, it does not.  It is close, but too long.
B00HWHUKDG|5|MY THIRD SET OF HASH STRIPES,QUALITY VINYL,EASY TO INSTALL,FAST SHIPPING,SUPER SERVICE,THANK YOU
B00CYGFC10|3|Thank you
B00563HXV0|4|Does the job. A little pricey for what it is, but works well.
B00CC71RK6|5|Excellent
B00XNS9PFW|5|As advertised.
B000CRO4IK|1|I thought this was going to be great for me but the dime and penny slot does not release the money, I try using my finger nails, it's so difficult that when I need two pennies or a dime I use the nickles or quarters, not happy with this product.
B0002JSZ8I|5|Excellent item
B009PHKPI6|1|The description says 6ft long cable.  The cable is 3.5 feet long which makes it hard to attach to another power source.  I returned it.
B00VVWZD3A|5|Perfect, exelente.
B00EC0Y7T4|5|Awesome fit and.  Looks like new.
B00G2TV7OG|5|Lights are bright
B001GG2EUG|2|The color change use to be pink and is white. Lol
B00NC2IDTI|5|Please with purchase
B0006IX87S|4|Great price.  Just what I needed.
B002PQJ95O|3|nice
B00SP203MA|5|Great item and fast shipping
B00IYZ488S|5|Fits nice and snug, feels like high quality
B00QEXY5CQ|4|Received a set of H8 size bulbs for my 2016 Santa Fe Limited to replace the halogen fog lamps. Installed as easily as the factory bulbs, and they look great! Decent brightness and they match the HID Xenon factory headlights almost perfectly. Have only had them for a day, so can't comment on durability/longevity at this point. But for now, very pleased with them.
B00DSSYKSO|5|Very good. Made mounting the oil temp sensor so easy.
B000C8PA50|5|Although the filter is made in China which I don't prefer much, but it is hard to look for car filters made in U.S or EU nowadays.  It fits nice in my car and the installation instruction just gives you the shortcut steps.  You may have to search for more details of installation on the web.  Thanks to Google and YouTube.  Performance is good but not great for the this reasonable price.  My car A/C air flow is a little of improving and cool faster that could help to save gas too.  The moist air odor is still present when I turn on A/C for first couple minute and gone afterward.  Would I recommend this type of filter to a friend?  Answer is YES for budget use and NO for high end luxury car.  But I still give 5 stars for its price.
B00NUCOJRK|1|That chain is no good I wish I would of never spend my money on that piece of junk
B000WJFJLE|5|Great product, fast shipping speed, good price.....Great Job!  I will be back.  A++++ Seller
B00RUD2HII|5|I love it its so pretty on my car
B00K6BRETI|1|Devil's Hair, more like nut hair. This stuff broke 3 times with a 2500lb winch. Spend the coin and get good stuff or your friends will be pulling you out of the mud.
B009AJMXI4|5|Love them. They look amazing on my car, fits perfect.  Very easy to install on your own.
B003C1LV7K|2|A piece of crap , my small spray nozzle from box store works much better.  It was under 5$  . Terrible misrepresentation in videos and adds.
B00DCO081W|4|Great but make sure you replace your transmission mount as well. If you don't you get horrible vibrations. My package came with a note describing this and they were right. Wish I knew this first so I could replace everything at once.
B000BYERBI|5|Great product
B00651CLCS|3|I lost quite a bit of reception. I live about 20 minutes outside of St. Louis, and did not get clear reception on my Jeep. I have it installed on my 2012 Jeep Rubicon. It looks awesome, and a breeze to install.
B000UD0CTQ|1|Did not work for me. I was not able to use it remove the filter on my Honda motorcycle. Useless waste of money.
B00F6XAPNS|5|Perfect fit for my 2000 Tundra.  In fact, this was the ONLY mat I could find, short of $400 and higher dollar custom jobs that fit. And it was under $70
B00P9EJGR0|3|It's ok, I don't like the cheap strings,  and it sits not 100% on top so kids see it right away and want to pull on it
B00LXFXUSU|4|A+
B0036GNUF2|5|This is a great product for people who travel a lot and need to keep their car in working order when they return months later!
B000KZ20HG|5|Worked great!
B004ME11FS|4|I bought several of these, rather than 1 of longer length, makes them easier to handle when I don't need 50 foot or more.
B008BTO3OQ|4|came very fast and looks exactly like in the picture haven't installed it yet but its good quality. only 4 stars because i think your just paying for the brand more than the product
B005LI7ZHM|5|thank you
B00ANNWE1C|5|5 Star
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Great product i hit a deer at 55mph and the deer hit two of the lights dead on and they both srill work just bent the mounting bracket so if you want some tough lights buy these they will take a hit from a deer at 55 and still work.
B000CSIPX4|5|Easy way to shop, just what I needed
B003E8A95G|4|This frame is great, but it's not black as pictured.  It's actually chrome.  Fits perfectly and very cute to look at.
B00HLBG0UK|5|My husband LOVED THIS item!!!  great quality!! and great for the price!!
B00JNEAQIA|5|this is just what I was looking for. a great product and for the price. I replace my chrome  for the black ones made my rims look better. thanks
B00D9C2CDO|3|Too big that doesn't fit my Subaru Forester rooftop rack nicely. But still could with the eight straps attached to it
B004V753SW|2|I could not wait to get these and at long last they came. Very nice detail, not cheap at all. Got everything on and then found for some reason the brake lever was either defective or it's not designed exactly right. It fit perfect and looked like the stock brake handle but when I tried to apply the brakes with these, I could never build up pressure. As soon as I took them off and put the stock ones back on, my brake return to normal.<br />They did give me a full refund which I highly appreciate. Just very disappointed because I REALLY wanted these bad. I might end up ordering again just to see if it was just a defect or not.
B0006HPA02|5|Great wires. Exactly ad described.  Will buy more.
B00W440Q68|5|Thanks, needed it my lever broke on me. it was easy to replace it.
B008G1ZFKK|2|The left mirror came broken, I had to JB WELD the lower outside post. The mirror on the passenger side is blurry. Installation was easy but mirrors are junk.
B00563C76G|5|Awesome fit and great feel in the hand
B005H5XU6E|5|This was perfect and well made too!
B00480J4QY|3|not as bright and white as i expected.
B00FGXEJRG|3|got it and it broke before I could get it installed
B000KZ06L8|1|Used junkyard crap
B007CLNIJK|5|Good quality part at a great price.
B000CD57I0|5|What a difference this made in our 2002 E150 XLT! Night and day. The only compliant is now it exposes all the other issues with our suspension!
B003G9I4DW|5|Fit perfect it was an exact match as described
B009NUY4PU|5|Fits and works great.
B000EQ2O9U|5|It works.
B00TBHXC4E|5|I've been looking for something to clean the zip-in windows on a Shelby cobra and air-plane windows which are something besides glass (maybe Lexan?).  This stuff works very well.  It is \\"non-drying\\" which means if you leave any residue it will be there, as streaks, forever. You have to buff it.<br /><br />I don't know what the ingredients are but you're supposed to wear gloves and glasses for safety.  I also used it on the dashboard of my 1983 Mazda RX7 and it did a good job, no greasy residue to collect dust.
B00Q8MBSR8|5|Over priced
B009FUF6DM|2|Shrinks after washing.
B007H9QRAY|5|Excellent product made of heavy gauge metal would order this again no problem highly recommend these. ..
B00QLDH9YA|5|Easy to apply.  Garners lots of smiles and questions as to where to get one for themselves.
B000C5CA1U|1|Does not fit. No metal contacts are in this piece of plastic. The peg that keeps signal in turn position has to be taken from old part (same with the metal contacts and their springs). The 1988 F150 Ford has a peg the is too big for the hole in this plastic piece. I had to modify hole to accept plastic piece.  Then the retainer friction grip cap snapped while trying to install onto the Ford pin.  Completely useless piece. Can't return because I had to modify hole to accept the round Ford pin.
B00LOX4SNM|5|Looks awesome and came earlier then expected.
B000M5Y72A|5|Very bright and clean .
B004GHI7VW|4|OK
B000C8PA1Y|5|great product
B00EA0ZB7I|4|Great LED Lights for the money.  Mine has already lasted longer than the guys that told me &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;, when his brand name went out on him.
B010TT94SA|1|It's a cheap  plastic I will buy from Memphis shade next time
B00CKCZNTY|5|Again these were bought for my husband's new car. He as well as myself were every pleased with the belt covers. Quality is very good and they were easy to install and very comfortable. I think I may order some for the rear seats also. Company was right on time with my package and would do business again with them. Thanks so much.
B001G8AIMU|5|tried and works well
B000CCDLEI|5|Clean, clear, basic, functioning electronic oil pressure gauge.
B000P6UT2I|5|Used it once so far did the job like it should will update after further use of the otc puller to let you know how it is holding up
B00B3W5H5M|5|Fits perfect, hard to beat OEM replacements.
B00WMK3O7W|5|One of the best ways to spruce up your ride is to toss in a new set of four-piece carpeted floor mats from OxGord, the leading innovator in automotive mats and accessories. These premium needles punch carpet mats to ensure these mats last for many years along with o binding which make these mats look great and are a great value. These mats are designed with the nibbed backing that keeps the mat securely in place and the universal shape that fits most trucks, cars, SUVs and mini vans.
B00JXOHWFU|5|Perfect fit
B0047D2FWM|5|This is one of the nicest hydraulic floor jacks we've ever owned. My husband primarily uses it on his late model race car. It operates smoothly and the lift keeps the car precisely in place and stable. It is well built and has the full 19&#34; lift. When you lower the car, it is smooth and 100% controllable. Very happy with it.
B0024E6V30|5|we  do not have an in line filter under the sink, so this seem to keep our water more potable
B000BOAZM8|5|WORKS!!!
B004TCSWCS|5|I would recommend them
B000CIRQZ2|4|Good product, fair price, great phone support.
B000E495BM|4|Exactly what I needed.
B003DNL8ZC|4|Unit does not have outside mirror pockets. Also, a bit oversized for the Toyota Camry XLE.
B00OYI9XW0|2|Direct replacement for the original part on my 2003 Eurovan. Installation was a little tricky because of the tight location but I got it in with minimal loss of coolant (most of which soaked me). &#34;Check Engine&#34; light for ECT sensor fault is now gone, so the computer must be happy -- and so am I.  UPDATE: Well, my rating just went south (from 5 stars to 2 stars) on this sensor. My &#34;Check Engine&#34; Light returned and now it is clear that this sensor went bad. I ordered another one from a &#34;Real&#34; parts store and now I see that this one was a Chinese knock-off. Not good. On the plus side, I'm getting really good at replacing this part..
B008G34SFG|5|OUTSTANDING! Fully loaded with bulbs and great fit!
B005JU5XE4|5|Really like these wipers, so much better than the factory ones that came on my Accord.
B00CS7T0IQ|5|Great price for good looking mirror.
B00BITJUGW|4|just like the factory ones that came off of the car. Perfect fit and true to color.
B004TC3D18|4|its black paint...what can I say...
B00I8J2XI2|5|Just like O E
B00EZCL08K|5|great deal fast service
B00I8OK7X0|5|bolted right up
B002Y1MZEW|4|It does slip down a bit when I am riding but if I have my half helmet on it is ok. I like the design and graphics a lot. The material is not too hot as I have ridden​ in 90+ temperatures and not had much discomfort. All in all I think it is good and worth the price.
B004LPAP2I|5|I used this product on my wife's black 08 lexus which I wax every 2-3 months and I've got to say it's an excellent product It's really good to use if your strapped for time as,well it left the car looking wet the only thing I found was that it would not remove some water spots that were left by a,sprinkler but for fine scratches and light imperfections this is a great product I highly recommend it.
B0051SERD2|5|Made one man bleeder actually one man.
B000AM8B22|5|What you would expect from Reese.
B007QV1RLM|5|great product
B002UC4SWM|5|love it great price
B0073JD8I2|3|Great shipping speed but the cat eyes fell off within a week
B00Q3JTUDU|5|Purchased this steering wheel cover in the large size and it fit my 2013 Ford F-150 perfectly!! Has a great feel and very comfortable!
B007CLNIZY|4|Not quite as good as the OEM but works and at significant savings!
B00G6188EM|5|These are pretty amazing. Very visible and get your attention quick. Which is a great thing as anything that makes you more noticeable on the streets can save your life. I've yet to add them to the front wheel, but they will be added.
B000NPUJQC|4|not the best but good to hold all the socket you have
B000YCBHP6|5|Excellent
B00S4HFNXK|5|I was interested in seeing how these would be better/worse than the traditional tube style fenders that we toss over when docking or to keep the boat from from banging while in the slip, but I never got the chance to find out...they are PERFECT on the pier.<br /><br />Originally I thought they would be best on our rented slip that has a sailboat, because at home we have a smaller boat that has a shore station.<br />So there I am, packing these fenders along with everything else, getting ready to spend a few weeks on the boat, and my beloved spouse says 'Did you think this through?'<br />Sailing is new to me, so was puzzled for a moment, and then did a big Homer Simpson 'DOH!'<br />But then she nods wisely in the direction of our neighbor across the way...<br /><br />I've always hated the look of the old tires on our neighbor's pier. They have a gorgeous canopy and stunning lights...and then TIRES?<br /><br />Having a bumper isn't an issue for our boat on the shore station, but what about our guests that arrive on their vessel and dock on the OTHER side?<br />Well, the size and shape and even the color of these fenders are just right on our off white pier. They fit perfectly (placed horizontally) and look great!<br />I'm thinking of buying another set so that it goes farther along the pier and has a more streamlined look.
B000C7VYHY|5|good fit and as described
B00004Y61N|5|Tops off my bed caps
B002UWHDWY|5|Perfect replacement. Worked as designed.
B00DN34QB0|5|The relay is reliable at about 50mA(coil) and is nice and snug in the socket.  This is a terrific deal for ordinary tinkering and gadgeteering and, presumably, beyond.  I am using one of the double-pole version to remotely power-down my router.
B001NI7KE2|3|SUPER!
B00K4EJB98|5|Great product I've had it installed for a week working 8 hours a day Mon-Fri with no issues. Cord is plenty of length (installed in a station wagon) I love it.
B008ETMV8I|4|These really are as good as everyone says. But I found that the bigger straps wound up being more practical for me in the long run.
B000HEBR3I|1|Please Do Not Buy it!!!<br />I purchased this item last week and it broke the first day. I had at home two used D batteries. I tried it and it wouldn't suck the water up the main spout. I thought it was because of the batteries and went to Walmart to get two new Alk D batteries. When I put the new batteries in and tried to turn the on/off button on, the button broke. Please note, no matter how stupid a person can be, it would be very difficult to break the on/off button the first day. Well, it broke.<br /><br />Don't buy it and save yourself some money.
B00BFDG4QU|5|Fit my 2000 Accord perfectly. Shut off the annoying CEL until my EVAP canister finally went out.
B007ED84XG|4|Love it! It is a tad short for my window but I still love it.
B00DI3DV6G|2|handle broke the first time I used it.
B000BQR100|1|Variety in shades....They DO say that styles may vary, but they don't say that the actual PRODUCT may vary, a LOT.  I ordered two of these.  So, the one is a terribly flimsy foil-type, bright on one side and dull on the other, just like aluminum foil.  It might last a month or two at best, is difficult to fold.  And I've had similar types of auto shades in all my vehicles which fold up nicely.  This foil-type sticks to itself instead of sliding into itself like others I've had that were made out of some sort of woven material.  The elastic on this foil one is so thin that I think I could probably read type through it when I stretch it.<br />The second is a bit more sturdy, made with a woven nylon or polyester-type material, but it is black on the back side (my old ones were kind of silver on both sides), might last 6 months.  I think it will hold up better, but this is where the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; comes in.  The elastic is better.  I presume that this one is the one that is getting the better reviews.  But, it's pretty cheap.<br />They have the same exact packaging.  I'll attach two photos of them, one of their fronts, one of their backs.<br />I see on the reviews that I'm not the first customer who has ordered two and gotten two entirely different types of shades.  Had I received two of the sturdier types, I might have chalked it up to ordering cheap goods and getting what I paid for.  Silly me, I ignored the reviews about the flimsy materials some people complained about; surely, I thought, those were sent in error.  Alas, I suspect scamhood.  They fall into that gray area where they are so cheap that it would probably cost as much to return them as the products themselves cost.<br />You've been warned, Love.
B00YD4FRN4|5|Perfect
B004GC2OOS|3|easy to install and secures tightly to the vehicle. the only problem is the mirror shakes a little and somewhat annoying. It works.
B006WQSD1O|5|Excelent
B001E9UWDG|4|Very good
B00BITJF0S|5|Excelent
B007EEVIR4|2|It's works and I don't have a back fire in my 4wheeler  anymore but after a week it began to leak gas underneath
B000CRKOKW|1|didn't work.. it came off..
B0009TSA9K|5|Prefect fit for my 1996 bayliner with 350 Lx  Mercruiser. Comes with one gasket you will need the gasket for the push rod plate.
B00MTHPAN4|3|Look cool but found out they are illegal in Ohio
B00TIG4T7C|5|The helmet is amazing. I got it in absolutely pristine condition, and on top of that, I ordered this helmet on a Wednesday, I got it Thursday. I must live right next to the store that sells this, that's unheard of, and I had the super basic shipping too! They have the speed thing down.<br /><br />The helmet though. It's a little on the heavy side, but with all the features and whatnot this thing is just so awesome. That's about the only gripe i have with it, and it's not necessarily a bad thing! everything takes a few tries of getting used to it to change configurations seamlessly, but it's nowhere near as tough as it might seem to be.<br /><br />BEFORE you buy this though, watch some Youtube videos about this particular helmet. It's definitely going to influence you to either not buy it, or to hit that buy button as fast as you can click it. Excellent value for the price. the size chart is on point, and i have kind of a rounded head, so this helmet's narrowness and length does not bother that. Stick to the size chart they provide.
B00IGCS9GQ|5|OEM product with exact fit and at cheaper price.
B000LQMYZC|3|OK...not bad just make sure you order the right amount to purchase or one will arrive
B0009NWQWI|4|I purchased the clips since I don't have a roof rack.Used the Cargo Saddlebag on a 2013 Honda CRV, worked as designed, I had trouble putting the metal poles together because of a burr in the shaft prevented the pole from locking properly. I had to use a hacksaw to cut the burr down inside the pole so it would lock. I also had trouble figuring out how to use the straps that attach from the bumper area to the pole frame of the saddlebag and get them nice and tight. It would be nice to have a better bottom strap that has a racheting cinch mechanism. Overall good product (somewhat expensive). Someone stooped and asked me where I purchased the bag because they liked the design.
B0069AODCG|5|Five stars from me. I was aiming for the metallic look, just like the ones emblem pros sells, but these will do for now until I am ready to cough up $80+ on the ones I really want. Don't get me wrong tho! These are AWESOME for the money. Gives the rear end more character. The material is good. Feels like the kind that will stick on for a wile. Highly recommended it if u don't have the $$ for the metallic ones or any other but still want ur F body's rear end to stand out in the mean time.
B00KLIWMCU|5|I didn't realize how much of a difference using this thing would make on my car. My car is significantly cooler after being parked all day in the sun. It is also a very nice folded size to fit nicely in my door.
B002DLYR8A|5|Great goggles! I used these to make my own steam punk accessory, turned out great. Lenses can be changed.
B00WNF5L3Q|5|So good
B004L0AAQY|5|IT PUTS LIGHT WHERE I NEED IT THE MOST
B00MROKC2I|5|Perfect
B002MH96HW|1|piece of s*** product. offensive take this bull **** down.
B00H9L1PZW|5|Great price!!
B0010E00T6|5|Great product and easy to install in my 2010 Acura TL
B00R19G8RW|4|Product was good investment for the price.
B004NFXA7I|5|It really works. You must follow directions or it will be hard to use. Thanks
B00KTNBW32|4|Works as advertised.
B0080MXQFQ|5|the product was as expected, good seller, recommended 100%.
B003TPW5YM|4|Great smelling.  Great foam!
B005ESUMSS|5|Fits perfectly
B004NEPCDY|3|Does not fit right
B001BYB6HU|5|THIS HELMET IS GREAT!
B00W2XE7L6|1|didn't fit
B000AMLWH8|3|I like this product, it cleans the interior surfaces quite nicely. However, my wife was completely turned off by the smell. It's not awful, but it resembles vinegar, and that's a nonstarter - especially if you can't leave the windows open for 20-40 hours.
B0066RE1W4|1|Poor design. I bought to replace original however the thread was different for my bmw 323i. Then when I tried to remove it the head striped. I finally got it off and  with pliers and a quarter. Save yourself the time and money.
B00FH43KTW|5|Good product! Very good quality
B002OUMVWY|5|By far the best sewer hose.  It's very strong, doesn't sag.  Perfect.
B00BCRMAAS|2|It did not fit my 2015 Ford Escape, but the service on this item was amazing.  They handled the problem quickly when I let them know it did not fit and to my great satisfaction.
B000NZ6S1C|5|Great fit easy to clean.
B00AGZ0FLS|5|Needed a couple extra mount points for tie-downs on my flatbed trailer. These worked great and are very sturdy.
B000PA03AC|5|worked perfectly
B009656B44|1|This doesn't work for a newer body style Hyundai Sonata ..... Don't believe the part numbers/rock auto or Amazons listing. The part I received wasn't right. The front bolt hole was way off and had to be drilled out and then we had to eyeball adjust the toe because it was way out of whack. I wouldn't have used it however we were stuck because we already had battled removing the 3 studs off the old one since they couldn't include the extra $1 worth of bolts ;-(
B003VBGGU8|5|Love these things! They work great and are nice sturdy clips to hang my bistro lights from our awning!
B00F4PB8LQ|5|This stuff really does the trick ... and weirdly enough, it also seems to keep dirt off your wheels. I use it maybe twice a month and my wheels are always shiny and dirt-free!
B001JEIHAG|5|Good product!!
B00D8RYGOI|3|Very bright light bar, even half lit, I order mine and received if after installing it come to find out only half of the light actually worked. After lots of trouble shooting and wiring still wouldn't work. So sent it back and waiting for a new one. Will update if the new one works.
B00498HC46|5|The mirror was shipped fast and packaged safely. It was an exact match to my car. Installation was easy with the right tools. Great experience.
B00PIYZLUM|5|Good stability, easy to position.  White is a little hard to see at times on a lighter colored car, so I think  I'm going to make a yellow background board and use the stand.
B000HPZQ4S|5|Just like the Moog box says  that these links come in, &#34; A Problem Solver&#34;. Don't waste your time and money with anything else.
B005GKKCX4|5|Great shocks...great price!
B003N5GJJU|5|This decal is so cute and it stays put until you're ready to remove it. It's also easy to apply and the quality is better than comparable decals that you find at dollar stores or convenience stores. It looks so cute on my car's back windshield, but would also be perfect for laptops, notebooks, netbooks, windows, cell phone cases, etc. Great purchase!
B00T5G53ZM|5|Huge money saver and works well. Functionality of a $3-500 scan tool for $20. Your smartphone does all the work.
B0002JMEQW|5|I was very satisfied with this flush kit. Other models did not appear to have compressor air inputs to allow for continuous air flow, but this one did. It could be the photos of other products were poor and just didn't show the input. Regardless, I was very satisfied with this kit. It worked very well to purge my evaporator core and condenser on my 2001 Jeep Cherokee. It was money well spent!
B000GZLUBM|5|Great quality and looks super.
B007P2F786|5|Took about 1 minute to bolt on. Worked great on Polaris Ranger 800 & inexpensive.
B0006IX87S|5|It works, not sure I can anything more than that!
B00HVVVEYM|5|This thing is great. It has made it through a 800 mile Florida round trip and two camping trips, with firewood being carried for the camping trips. I use additional straps and would advise doing that. It rained during every trip I've had it on so far and nothing has gotten wet. I've used lots of bags over the years and this is the best ever.  BTW: the picture makes it look like a rigid box. It's not...it is rectangular but not rigid at all. You could probably use it for any size from 'full size', all the way down to a wadded up ball. Very nice
B000O5G2RG|5|Installed on my 02 Van.  Same hitch really save us on previous van in accident.  Reasonable installation time.
B0007RVLOA|5|This polish is easy to use . Amazing results on stainless and aluminum.
B00BYNJAVW|5|Used these on a gmc sierra 2006. Work great ride is so much better. Easy to install. Would recommend.
B00VM4ON56|5|Great little LED , used it as a reverse light. worked so well I bought one more...
B00LQHR9GE|5|Good light on looks and lumens
B00LG07MZE|5|Awesome product. Thanks for keeping my car cooler on this hot sunny days 😏
B0001CMUV4|5|Got really tired of watching my bikes swaying back and forth behind my truck every time I use my carrier, so I decided to pick this up and I'm glad I did. Works perfectly with my Curt Class III receiver and is very easy to install. Not only is the wobble completely gone, but so are the annoying sounds that came along with attaching anything to my receiver. Definitely worth the few dollars.
B004J0ZCTQ|3|Nice and compact but the o ring in  the center pops out when you disconnect them.
B009XRKL50|5|Just what it says.
B007LIBWU6|5|looks cool, prompt too
B000C15CRS|5|Perfect fit
B005GXHKKE|5|Great product,was able to be programmed within 10 to 15 seconds and works great
B00MG687JW|3|Unfortunately I couldn't charge my LG G2 cell phone with it!
B004YF1U5G|5|This is the product you need if you have a G37 and do not want to drill in front plates. Easy to put on,Easy to take off. Now it is expensive in my opinion but this is the only solution i was able to find. Supply and demand. But this product got the job done.
B0016H0O6G|5|Very fast. Good product.
B00JN2N5C6|4|Looks much better than stock antenna. Easy to install.  The only &#34;con&#34; is the reception is good but not as good as the stock antenna was.
B003JR0KR4|5|What can I say?? They buff!!
B00AJQUU9G|2|no this is bulls***, they are lying it is not a lower unit they are a scam
B000CEBXRS|5|Works as advertised to isolate my main truck battery from my accessory battery when the truck is not running.  There is an audible click that confirms it is in service.
B000FCP74C|4|Installed on my 93 grand cherokee (v8).  I'm pretty good at installing stuff without needing a manual, but I found myself going back and forth a lot - it was kind of hard to tell what they were trying to do.  In more than one instance, the part diagram was more useful than the actual install instructions.<br /><br />My major concert at the moment, the piece that attaches to the throttle-body... its a plastic opening with a metal piece inside.  Hard to describe, but it would appear that (guessing here), the plastic was molded with some sort of lip on the inside so that the metal ring could be inserted (during manufacturing) and would catch on that lip.  That lip is NOT particularly thick/strong.  I found that while attaching it to the throttle, there was so little of the bolt sticking up that I had to press down pretty hard on the top of the intake to get the bolts to protrude through the top with the rubber and metal washer with enough thread to actually attach the bolts.  I took it off thinking I'd done something wrong and found that the plastic holding that metal ring on had broken off in several places while I was trying to tighten it down.<br /><br />My advice would be to do a test fit before you do anything else with the mounting bolts and rubber gasket thing in place to make sure you have enough thread poking through the washers to bolt it down.  If you *don't*, you might want to see about using something else in place of the rubber gasket as its quite thick.  You might be able to shave it down, but you'd probably spend less time running to the hardware store and cutting a new one out of something thinner.<br /><br />Also, the instructions suggested cutting the splash shield... either mine disappeared at the hands of the previous owner or there isn't one..  wouldn't spend too much time thinking about that one.<br /><br />Lastly, the metal 'box' comes with a rubber weather strip - there are only two bolts holding the box in place, and they're those all-thread bolts with a bunch of rubber in the middle.  As a result, there's a fair amount of play in the box.  There's enough (at least in mine) extra on the strip to wrap it around the portions of the box that might come into contact with the chassis.  Mine seemed loose enough that it would probably have rattled had I not.  The instructions could have stood to be a bit more clear on some of this stuff.olts with a bunch of rubber in the middle.

B00BOX2R44|5|Good product -appears to be of good material - fit exactly as I had hoped and was shipped quickly.  Will purchase again from this company.
B000HPS58C|1|this item allows for changes  to the camber of each side of the front end individually which the factory set up does not permit.  if you are having trouble with your allignment and need to make that adjustment (which is unlikely) these would theoretically work EXCEPT that they can not me tweeked or adjusted once installed.  so if you wish to use these to properly adjust the camber on your some how messed up truck, good luck knowing exactly what degree to install them in order to fix your problem! the item itself is a good product but i dont see, without a machine telling you exactly how much to correct, how they could be installed effectively.  also when i returned them i only recieved a 115 dollar refund when i paid over 140 for the 2 of them!
B003125D6A|3|since it's just a plate the engine vibrations make the lights bounce
B0055BXZKQ|3|Definitely cuts down the heat but doesn't eliminate it completely.
B007KPTTV4|5|Love it
B000WJ9NDE|3|useable
B000CM3I9Q|5|It fits perfectly on a 2004 Ranger pickup!
B00Y16E92O|5|Very good product
B000VBAAMG|5|Perfect. Thank you.
B001N1HEUO|5|Very handy, wonder why I waited so long
B00GBOMLPQ|5|Fits my 2016 Tahoe perfectly. Easy install and looks nice.
B002ZKJ0VI|5|Work like a charm
