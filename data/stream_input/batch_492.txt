B0007DAZW8|5.0|I first have to admit that this album is fairly repetitive. <br />There, now that I've laid out the base, I can honestly explain what makes this album excellent. <br /> <br />The limited lyrics. <br /> I find these fascinating because it allows you to concentrate on one phrase for an entire song.  You can either ignore the repetition, or you can really think about it.  In my opinion, this whole album is very negative in its view of the effect of technology on modern life.  From track two, \\"Prime Time of your Life,\\" I interpreted this as a call for people to realize that now, right now, they're living their life.  Prime time on TV shouldn't even be worthy of your notice because you're already involved in a much more interesting story yourself.  Certainly I'm reading a lot into this, but their lack of definite lyrics gives a lot of freedom to the listener.  I enjoy being able to think about their songs like this. <br /> <br />The loops. <br />If you notice carefully, these are not really looped, but elements are introduced and removed at different times.  There is a very subtle interaction between all the elements, and I enjoy listening for these changes.  Even the timing of when the samples are introduced and re-introduced is very interesting. <br /> <br />This album probably works on two very different levels.  One, if you're really dumb and just like the repetition.  Or two, if you're willing to listen for all the subtleties in the music.  I wouldn't rate this album as high as Discovery, but I think it's a work that can stand on its own.  Before you trash it, give a good listening to someplace without too much noise where you can hear and concentrate on the details.  Once you've done this, then if you don't like it, point taken.  But at least look for the skillful structure Daft Punk wove into these songs. <br />
B0007TKNII|5.0|Sorry for the play on words, but I had to go there!  This musical is deep and rich on DVD.  The music is full, the atmosphere is sleek.  It is like a Broadway production.  The cast is exceptional, the direction is flawless, and the music, oh the music of the night is fab-u-licious!!!!  This is a real treat on DVD because all the flaws I saw on the big screen seem to have been displaced.  This IS a must for musical fans, much richer than \\"Chicago.\\"
B000929AJQ|5.0|First off, I gotta say the amazon review is completely wrong:  Trent reznor is not a one trick pony.  If one listened to 'The Downward Spiral' and then put 'The Fragile' on right after, one would immediately notice the differences in composition, instrumentation, singing, EVERYTHING; same goes for all of His albums. A one trick pony would be... Celine Dion... yes.   I will say that there are elements from 'The Fragile' that I immediately noticed. Actually, it would be more accurate to call the elements 'samples' or 'instruments'.  The bass in 'The Collector' is very similar to that of the bass in 'Into the Void' on 'The Fragile'.  A synth that comes in the second half of each verse of 'Everyday Is Exactly the Same' is the same synth in 'We're In This Together Now' of 'The Fragile'.  There are undoubtedly more similarities that exist between the two albums ('With Teeth' and 'The Fragile')but they, the albums, are completely different. 'The Hand That Feeds' could almost be on 'Pretty Hate Machine', with that reverb on the voice and the straight-up drum beat, but then the solo comes in and you're like, 'That wouldn't be on Pretty Hate Machine'.  Ok, here's one way to look at it; compare, 'The Bends' by Radiohead to their later 'Kid A'... that's all I should have to say.  Compare 'Pretty Hate Machine' to 'The Fragile'... Same thing, only, I think that 'The Fragile' is much, much more expansive, intricate, and deeper than 'Kid A', don't get me wrong.  That one trick pony comment just really made me mad... don't believe it! Whoever wrote that is completely wrong on that point.  I do agree though, that is perhaps the most focused NIN album.  Trent Reznor is definitely the most talented musician/songwriter alive.  A good summary?  I'd say a concentrated Fragile, with rock thrown in... and AWESOME production. BUY IT!!!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I'd been hearing about Napoleon Dynamite for some time and finally at the urging of one of my friends, sat down and watched it. This film is definitely a sleeper, you will need to watch it multiple times to truly appreciate it. Jon Heder does a bang-up job as Napoleon Dynamite, a not so typical nerd. Napoleon lives with his brother and grandmother who is injured early on in the film during a ATV accident. Enter Uncle Rico who comes to look after the boys during his grandmothers absence. Uncle Rico is stuck in the year 1982 his football glory years and cannot get past the fact that he was on the bench during the State Championship. He's pretty much Matt Foley in other words he lives in a van down by the river. Napoleon and Uncle Rico clash from the get go to hilarious results. There are some side-splitting scenes including the time machine bit, throwing the button and Napoleon's lament over not having any skills that girls would find attractive (\\"I don't have any good skills...you know like nunchuck skills\\"). When a new student, Pedro Sanchez, enters the school, Napoleon befriends him and the rest is history. Not much happens during the running time of Napoleon Dynamite but ultimately I could not keep my eyes off it. Heder does such a fantastic job as the main character that we are left wanting to know more about him. The dance sketch following Pedro's speech was no less inspirational than Rocky taking Apollo Creed to the brink in the original. Napoleon Dynamite celebrates diversity and leaves the viewer with a great almost simplistic message...it's not what you look like on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside that counts. This film is nothing short of a diamond in the rough. A Must-Own addition to your DVD collection. Highest Recommendation.
B00005R8GU|5.0|I like Mike Bloomfield quite a lot as I like Butterfield's harp playing. But the real star here is Otis Spann. I was never before able to aprecciate his talent , but here he shines. Even more than Muddy, who sounds a bit bored on the first couple of tracks but then gets it on. However, the best track s here are the live bonuses. Muddy's strong vocal performance and his amazing soulful slide work blew me away. First time I heard it I got real chills. <br />Just buy the expanded release. The live set is blues extraordinaire
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Sometimes you have to be patient with your people watching, and this is the kind of movie that fills that roll. If you are an uninvolved person you might just see these as self absorbed characters... but they are actually a lot deeper. <br />I found something profound here... although I am a guy ! If you look through the reviews here.. the guys like it... and the girls don't. This might be a reverse chick flick... so if you aren't in the mood for an action flick guys... just get this. My partner and I were at different ends of the spectrum on it. She got bored, I got enthralled. Ms. Coppolla hit on something here... maybe it's everyones middle age angst.
B0008ISM40|4.0|I've rarely seen such mixed reviews!  However, they all agree on the fact that this is an unexpected direction for Trent to take.  What With Teeth boils down to is nothing more than just rock album done NIN style.  This album is not a dark journey where the songs all meld into a single theme like The Downward Spiral, nor is it an epic concept piece like The Fragile.  This is about making a record you can listen to and enjoy for what it is at face value.  I'd say it's built like Pretty Hate Machine, however I disagree with the other reviewers that it sounds just like that album.  With Teeth definitely has its own sound. <br /> <br />The first listen will be strange, since you have all these expectations.  I promise you, you will be somewhat let down as it's not going to be what you expect.  But on subsequent listens, you'll know what kind of album it is, and you'll start listening to it with a new set of expectations, and this time you'll begin to appreciate what With Teeth has to offer.  That's when the true beauty of this album shows itself.  This is why there are so many negative reviews...people aren't giving it a chance. <br /> <br />Trent Reznor begins the album in a different way.  Instead of something loud and angry, it's something somber, quiet and melodic.  The song is \\"All The Love In The World\\", which is one of the best NIN songs I've heard.  From there the record launches into a nice variety of styles.  You have the afore-mentioned loud and angry songs (\\"You Know What You Are?\\", \\"Getting Smaller\\"), and you have your beat-driven songs (\\"The Hand That Feeds\\", \\"Only\\"), your experimental song (\\"Beside You In Time\\") and your ballad (\\"Right Where It Belongs\\"). <br /> <br />I personally like \\"Only\\", which is slightly reminiscent of \\"Down In It\\" without the heaviness.  Also, the one-two combination ending of \\"Beside You In Time\\" and \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" is simply beautiful (word to those comparing the last track with \\"Hurt\\", this is NOTHING like \\"Hurt\\"..it'ssomething totally new). <br /> <br /> <br />You've heard songs that sound like this before in other NIN albums, but they don't sound exactly like any song.  It's a great record...these songs just scream for being done live!  Any NIN fan should like this, and any fan of rock should find this fresh and invigorating in the genre.
0440180295|4.0|I don't feel like I got into this one as much.  Lots of fun as far as Vonnegut's well-known writing style, and just as far out.  I think the book will hold more meaning to me as I get older.
B0008ISM40|2.0|First off, I am (was?) a serious NIN fan, owning all the prior haloes.  I thought the Fragile was the best album Trent ever did.  With Teeth, on the other hand, has no bite.  I get the feeling he slapped this together in under a year.  The deep full instrumentation from his last release is gone, none of the songs grab you or even wake you up.  The last track is probably the only one I liked.  I really hope it will grow on me, but after 3 listens I wish I hadn't spent money to hear the downfall of one of the great bands of my youth.  Yuck.
0440237688|4.0|I was required to read a modern fantasy novel as part of the course requirement for a Children's Literature course which I am currently enrolled in.  I selected \\"The Giver\\" and was very pleased with my choice.   <br /> <br />I found it to be a thought provoking book that encourages the reader to evaluate his or her own position on matters such as life and death, right and wrong, good and evil.  Lowry was able to create an idealistic utopian society where outwardly things seem to be ideal.  However, upon closer inspection, the reader realizes that in this fictional world where there is no existance of war, hunger or poverty, there is also no evidence of emotion or freedom of choice.   <br /> <br />Provocative subject matter and the author's use of descriptive langueage makes \\"The Giver\\" a wonderful book for readers of all ages.
6305537321|1.0|I heard a lot of good things about this movie and was curious about it. What a disappointment!! Hepburn's character is shallow, unballanced and extremely unlikable. I couldn't keep from wondering why did Peppard's character ever fall in love with her. There is no plot, no character development, just boredom.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|I don't think anyone was more excited than I was that Sean Connery was coming back as James Bond in 1983.<br /><br />The official Bond film that summer was OCTOPUSSY, the first post-RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK entry (although really showing his age by this point, Roger Moore's role was much more active and that film did have some cool action sequences).  But I was really looking forward to NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.<br /><br />The film starts out well enough.  The gun barrel opening and signature music are sadly missing here, but Connery looks great and the touches of humor--supplied by Lorenzo Semple, Jr. (who wrote some of the \\"Batman\\" series campiest and funniest episodes)--set the right mood.<br /><br />But the movie runs out of steam.  Barbara Carrera's character is infinitely more interesting than Kim Basinger's basic bimbo, so the movie suffers when her scenes end.  I'd hoped, since this was a one-shot deal, that Connery would finally face Ernst Stavro Blofeld, but the script remains too faithful to the basic framework of THUNDERBALL.<br /><br />I'd read an interview with Connery and he said the filming of NEVER SAY NEVER was a disaster, that it was more frustrating than his six previous Bond films put together.  He was even called back to shoot more scenes so the movie would make sense.<br /><br />It's too bad.<br /><br />Because the original 007 deserved much better.<br /><br />(Useless trivia: Klaus Maria Brandeur, who plays Largo, was originally cast to play the Russian sub commander in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER in 1990--but was replaced by Sean Connery after a scheduling conflict.  I thought that was interesting since they played hero and villian in this movie seven years before).
B00005QFE5|2.0|It is always nice to see an innocent romance without any sex involved. But this movie is plain boring. Throughout the whole movie Ziyi's character is running through the woods chasing the boy. It is unclear why they even fell in love with each other. I gave it 2 stars for excellent scenery.
B0007XT87G|4.0|After reading the various reviews, I thought I would venture a review myself.    This album is extraordinary.  It comes from a maturing and changing band.  To me, it represents (as does the band) the definition of \\"Progressive Rock.\\"  For the complaints of the album relying on heavy metal riffs, they are not justified.   I believe the heavy riffs are a statement and expression of the attitude and feeling Wilson is conveying.  I believe this expression is best described and understood when the album is played in its entirety.  The music is based upon a screenplay.  Not every movie in the theater should give you the feeling you get when you listen to \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\" or \\"Stars Die.\\"  I believe that this is close to P-Tree's best work.  I think Steven Wilson is establishing himself as a genius in the music industry.    Buy the album, if you are thinking about your options.  It will be a classic.  Then, do what you can to find a copy of Stupid Dream.   An added note:  I saw the band in Las Vegas.  It was my second time to see them.  It was totally amazing.  I have never seen anything like it.  I meant to give this 5 stars.
B000002UZ4|5.0|Actually I have to thank Kylie..I bought her greatest hits package \\"Ultimate\\" because I mildly like some of her songs...At the cash register, the cashgirl recommended that if I liked Kylie, I would definitely like this band and offered me Discography. I wouldn't buy- I vaguely remember them with their stomping disco number \\"New York City Boy\\" but it was nothing to write home about and this package seemed too old- 1991 c'mon...Just for the sake of not hurting the over-excited girl, I check the insert and saw Dusty Springfield's name..Dusty Springfield? With a synth-pop band from other side of Atlantic? What was she thinking? But enough is enough I eventually paid and drove home. <br /> <br />I first listened Kylie but it got thin after a couple of songs- same melodies, same ussh hissshh, same number over and over- very good for jumping on the disco floor but not so exciting to make you go on a dreamland and the lyrics are simply stupid. <br /> <br />Then I put Discography on the stereo...listened two first songs with amusing curiousity-lyrics and structure of the songs were quite interesting- but then the real stomper arrived knocking on all doors of my life: Opportunities...and the rest is just a story, as they say, and I simply fell in love with them. <br /> <br />There is not a single bad or insipid song in the album. Can you believe it?. From the first tunes of West End Girls until the end of Was it Worth it, it almost flows like a magic walk through clouds, through heaven, you laugh, you cry, you dance, you sing, you tap your feet, you think, you are depressed...God, you make everything that music should make you. <br /> <br />But what's more important is the band's striking intelligence...lyrics, structures, compositions, backvocals, production, small touches...are all very well calculated and sincere, just for the sake of making things more fun. Melodies are incredibly catchy and also very complex...miles better than anything Erasure (whom I listened afterwards upon Amazon recommendaton but not impressed) can achieve in their lifetime. <br /> <br />Particular highlights of highlights: Opportunities...Suburbia...What have I done (not surprised Dusty agreed to duet), It's A Sin, Always On My Mind (oh a tepid Elvis song becomes an unbelievably disco stomping piece but what an underlying sadness my friends), Heart, Left To My Own Devices, It's Alright, So Hard,DJ Culture...See, almost the entire album.. <br /> <br />Well I have been missing a very important thing in my life and I am sure millions of Americans are still missing it. If only I had the chance to promote them through the Promised Land.  <br /> <br />All in all, Discography is a must and Pet Shop Boys are true and clever wizards of Pop. Now back to backcatalogue- my first click on purchase items in Amazon: Please, the first album that started the ball to roll on. <br /> <br />Feverishly recommended!
B000089CJI|5.0|This album is simply magical. It's eloquent prose through the eyes of a romantic; charming vocals corroborated by whimsical synth-pop melodies. Listen to it for \\"Such Great Heights\\" alone.
B000065PUE|5.0|Anything recorded by the Pixies is essential listening and this album is the epitome of their art.  Doolittle captures them at their artistic peak.  Every song on this album is a classic.  After listening to the album for hundreds of times over the past 16 years, I still get chills down my back when I hear songs like \\"Tame\\", \\"Dead\\", and \\"Gouge Away\\".  Aside from Nirvana's Nevermind and the first Velvet Underground album, I'm hard pressed to think of any other album that comes even close in terms of originality, excitement, and sheer greatness.
B00020HEL6|3.0|I wasn't surprised to read that Ms. Olstead has been recording country music up until this venture into jazz. She has this annoying inflection where her voice breaks into the next octave which doesn't really work with this genre. She also lacks the life experience to really sing with real emotion although it's not for lack of trying. How much life experience can a pretty 15-year-old sitcom actress put into a song? The girl seriously needs a series of abusive relationships, substance addictions, and periods of depression. After that, she could be another Billie Holiday. Get back to us in 10 years sweetie.
B00005JNDZ|3.0|The essential problem with the second Bridget Jones film is that the best parts remind the viewer of parts of the first film that were done a whole lot better.  It is a pleasant enough movie, but not so pleasant that I would recommend it over taking a risk on any other film or doing something safe like rewatching an episode of BUFFY.  I haven't read the book upon which the second film is based, so perhaps it is to blame for the relative blandness of the sequel, but something is to blame for the fact that while the original was charming and entertaining, the sequel feels tired and derivative.  But even if the book is to blame, it is incumbent upon anyone making a sequel to try to find some way of making the second film in some way new, instead of merely recycling the first.  In this regard, the movie fails.<br /><br />An additional problem I had with this movie is that it took some of the weaker aspects of the original even further than it had done.  For instance, one of the sources of the original was Bridget's penchant for making a bit of an ass out of herself.  Despite this, she constantly manages to come across as cute and adorable, but in the second film she merely looks ridiculous.  The first film presented Bridget as a sympathetic character, but she was much harder to love in the second.  Again, the fault may lie with the source material, but it is important for any filmmakers, when confronted with a weak source, to make it stronger in the rewrite.<br /><br />As with the original, Renee Zellweger is delightful as Bridget, and she remains the main reason for watching the film.  She is one of my favorite contemporary actresses, and someone who hasn't done the range of performances that I would have liked to see her take on.  I miss the days when she did small, independent films like THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.  She looks a bit plumper in this one than in the original, and it is interesting that one of the more celebrated non-anorexic characters of reason years would be played twice by one of the thinnest actresses in the movies.  On the other hand, I didn't like either Colin Firth or Hugh Grant as much in this film as in the former.  The interesting thing about Mark Darcy (just as with his namesake from the BBC production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE-not a slip on my part, because Ms Fielding acknowledges that the model for Darcy was Colin Firth's performance in the six-hour BBC production of the Jane Austen classic) in the first film was in gradually learning about his true feelings about Bridget.  There was no such mystery in this one.  Likewise, knowing from the original that Daniel Cleaver was a deceptive, manipulative creep made him a pretty uninteresting character in the sequel.  The guys too as good a job as is possible given the limited possibilities of character development, but their roles are too circumvented to allow of much interest.<br /><br />So, do I recommend this or not?  I really am on the fence.  I guess I'm glad I saw it, but if I hadn't I would have been able to preserve more fully my respect for the original.  Sequels can often mar excellent originals (think of the MATRIX movies), but still leave an overall surplus of enjoyment.  I guess I liked seeing this one OK, but I can't say now that I would have regretted never having seen it at all.  I suppose that there is no harm in seeing this one, but I would warn anyone who really liked (as I did) the original, that this one falls far short of that superb film.ld be played twice by one of the thinnest actresses in the movies.

B0006399FS|4.0|Despite being an avid U2 fan, I held off on buying this one due to the negative reviews everywhere. Also, the propaganda (Apple and everywhere else) kinda turned my mood off. So I didn't rush to get the CD the moment it was out (like when ATYCLB came out). But finally I have the CD now ... and I have to say I'm still so impressed by these guys. Some songs like Miracle Drug, A Man and a Woman, Yeaweh still blow your mind off. <br /> <br />Those of you shouting that the group sold out ... come on, give us a break. You can't possibly expect them to make the same kind of music for 25 years. Would you be working 25 years somewhere doing the same old $hit? At the same time, if they tried to make another 'Joshua Tree' ... we would still not be happy, cause it is not possible to make another one of that. It's also not the same time or the place. They have softened up, I agree ... but what matters is they can still produce great tunes, connect with a wide spectrum of the population and maintain such a huge fan base (apart from Bono's other worthy ventures).
0684800713|1.0|I will never understand Ernest Hemingway's appeal.  His labored attempts at understating everything, his affected grittiness, his belief in himself as adventurer and someone who truly experiences life all make me want to throw up.  This book is the perfect example of how terrible he is.   I'll give you some examples from within the book so you can think about it a little more. <br /> <br /> Number one is Brett.  The \\"heroine\\" of the book, she is a heartless 34-year old nymphomaniac who is self-absorbed and callous, not to mention elitist and stupid.  The \\"hero\\" of the book, manly man Jake, \\"loves\\" her.  What a great love story.  Jake is too \\"injured\\" to make love to her, so she sleeps with a number of other people during the book.   Number two is Cohn.  This character, created out of the author's anti-semitic imagination, is a simpering bookish fool who, the narrator lets us know, is too cowardly to enjoy things like bullfights.  Only a manly man would enjoy the spectacle of a matador being gored by a tortured animal, of course. <br /> <br />Cohn is apparently equally contemptable because he wants to hang out with gentiles (How DARE he?!), but Jake is magnanimous enough to let him.  Brett is magnanimous enough to sleep with him, but looks down on him for being a Jew.  (Lovely people, aren't they?).  Hemingway wants us to revile Cohn because he took the affair with Brett too seriously and actually got jealous when she slept with someone else.  We're supposed to laugh at Cohn's emotionality and inability to be a wasp.   <br /> <br />I can't tell you how pointless this book is.  What's the moral?  Is there one?  I don't think there is.  If a book isn't engrossing, or exciting, or beautifully written (therefore art for art's sake) it has to have a message.  This book fails on all counts.
B0007MVXQG|3.0|Been living with the new Priest album for a couple months. Feel the same way about it that I felt about Maiden's Brave New World: A few really great numbers, but just not up to snuff. <br /> <br />Judas Rising: Not to keen on the heavier numbers on the album. That being said, this is the best of those and a really good rocker. Always wondered what happened to the Sad Wings of Destiny angel.... <br /> <br />Deal With The Devil: The Priest I know and love! Love the look back at their rise to stardom. One of my faves. Sound like it could've come off Defenders OfThe Faith album. <br /> <br />Revolution: Great follow up to Take On All The World and United. A bit on the repetitive side, but thoroughly enjoyable. <br /> <br />Worth Fighting For: As far as I'm concerned, THE track of the album. My fave hands down. Great imagery and also a great sequel to Desert Plains. Always wondered what happened to that rider. Also love how Rob's vocals are surprisingly subtle on this tune. Old school priest, all the way. This could've come off of Point of Entry. <br /> <br />Demonizer: Very catchy chorus is the best part of the song. Kind of a standard Ripper-era kind of Priest song, though. <br /> <br />Wheels Of Fire: Was taken aback at first of how simple this song is, but it really grew on me. Could've been a lost Screaming For Vengeance album track. Very catchy, especially the chug-chug of the guitars. Love this one... <br /> <br />Angel: Nice to see them do a heartfelt ballad; it's been too long. This could've been on Sin After Sin or Hell Bent....great tune! <br /> <br />Hellrider: Just doesn't excite me. Meh! <br /> <br />Eulogy: Nice little slow number reminescent of Eulogy on Sad Wings. <br /> <br />Lochness: Possibly one of the biggest, longest,dumbest songs recorded by anyone. What were Priest thinking??? BOO!!!! <br /> <br />Order: Worth Fighting For/Deal With The Devil/Angel/Wheels Of Fire/Judas Rising/Revolution/Demonizer/Eulogy/Hellrider/Lochness <br /> <br />They have several better albums, overall. Hope their next one is just as great as Maiden's Dance of Death and that this was just a warm-up album.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|The film shows Americans in Japan.  It is a very relevant metaphor for today.  Japanese society is shown as a model society without violence.  It shows Americans in a small community of friends, which starts to become closer knit while they function in a foreign society.  It also shows some of the story of Americans succeeding in a foreign land.
B000092ZYX|3.0|I'm a big Radiohead fan, but this review will no doubt seperate me from the die-hards. I've heard this album several times since it was first released. Aside from maybe PABLO HONEY, this has to be my least favorite Radiohead album. I just don't connect to these songs very well. They don't stick in my brain the way most other Radiohead songs do.<br /><br />I can't explain it, really. In fact, looking at a lot of these other reviews, many others seem to have a hard time putting their fingers on this one. There are clearly moments of beauty. There are even guitars that sound exactly like guitars. Much of it certainly qualifies as rock music. Yet words like oblique and inscrutable seem fitting. Some might use these words to describe the more experimental KID A and AMNESIAC albums, but I connect to those two far more than HAIL TO THE THIEF and love them much more as well. Songs like the achingly hesitant, positively heavenly \\"Pyramid Song\\" or the spell-binding, propulsive \\"Idioteque\\" have made much more of an impression on me.<br /><br />I thought deeper appreciation would come with repeated listens, and it has to a certain degree, but alas, I still find this album impenetrable. Also, what's with the album title? It's clever, especially in reference to President Bush (Yorke wouldn't be specific about its meaning from what I've read), but I can't figure out how it relates to the record itself.
192076920X|5.0|This is one of those rare books that you will remember having read for a long time. There are many things to say about it, but to cut it short, it brought back to me what it was like to be in Bombay, what it was like to be a romantic, and be in love, and what it was like to know that philosophy is for everybody, not just for an intellectual elite. The most important thing about this book is that it engages with all the big questions in an authentic way. It is also a very good read, without too many concessions to clichs. Finally, the book has one specific lesson for us to ponder: the worst evil is not in the world of crime, but in the institutionalised prison and police jail.   <br />The hero, in fact, may be a criminal of sorts. <br />Many thanks for this book. It joins books by Sandor Marai, William Faulkner, Dashiell Hammett, and a few others in my very special list of novels that reminded me of (or taugut me) something important.
B000929AJQ|5.0|The man himself did it again. A masterpiece that will grow in you as you become more and more addicted to this multi-genre album. It goes from piano melody songs &quot;All the Love in The World&quot; to Hard-Rock-punch-in-the-face song &quot;You Know Who You Are&quot; passing by disco-taste tune &quot;Only&quot; and Pop-dancing rythme hit &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot;. And don't forget the gift that Trent gives to his fans, &quot;Right Where it Belongs&quot; a simple but marvelous song to say Thank You to the fans that never give up on NIN. (Yes Trent, we were there, waiting and Now, we stand up with you). It could even pull some tears from you if you know all he has been through (and if you care).<br />Very different from The Fragile, no instumental this time and much louder. The lyrics has some connections with Downward Spiral but it's all new sound, more raw and stripped down.<br />If you don't know NIN much, you might think this album is weird, but after a few listens it will begin to make sense and your need <BR>to know more of NIN will lead you to his others masterpieces.<BR> <BR>And I'll finished with that: Dave Grohl is a God on the machine drum. Very glad about this guest appearance.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam are all in all, the most consistent and lasting grunge band of all time. Every other band to be born out of the music scene in the early 90s has faded away, some tragically. Alice In Chains, Nirvana, and Smashing Pumpkins all were all destroyed by heroin (Jimmy Chamberlian being cut from the Smashing Pumpkins counts, and lets face the truth, Adore and MACHINA are no Gish, Siamese Dream, and Mellon Collie.) Eddie Vedder and his cronies however still stand today.<br />With a lasting career in music and a large range of songs and albums, Pearl Jam have come a long way in their career. Today, Eddie and co. are the same band they were in 91, but indredibly matured musically. With grunge albums Ten and Vs., cryptic and daring albums like Vitalogy and No Code, the upbeat Yield, the spaced out Binaural, and the gritty Riot Act, their is a wealth of b-sides that have been below the surface of their releases for years, which show who Pearl Jam really are at the core.<br />Lost Dogs is an amazing compilation because it shows who Pearl Jam are and what they are all about, greater than any A-side track in their career. We see sides of Pearl Jam that have never been seen by the public eye before, and this is the sound of who Pearl Jam really are below the serious shell we've seen all along.<br />Disc One has all the rockers. Songs like All Night, Undone, Down, Black, Red, and Yellow, Hitchiker, and Don't Gimme No Lip, are songs where Pearl Jam show their hidden rocking, and upbeat side. Down is the greatest example, a song where you could picture Vedder having a fun time in the studio with the band. Gremmie Out Of Control and Leavin' Here are other great examples, where the band is even humurous. These songs were made you could tell, written when the band couldn't help but fool around and have fun in the studio like a teenage garage band, excited about stardom. <br />Disc Two has all the slow, acoustic, melodic songs, these are beatiful songs that just couldn't fit thesound of any of their albums, songs one could play around a bond-fire. Fatal is one of the best songs, and well worth the price of the album. Along with the two best songs of Pearl Jam's career, Footsteps and the incredible Hard To Imagine. Hard To Imagine defines Pearl Jam better than any other song of their career, it is a slow-building epic song, featuring aspects of everything the band has covered throughout seven studio albums. Vedder's voice start out soft and melodic like his later music, and then builds to an anthemic chant that reminds one of Ten and Vs. <br />All in all, this is one of hell of a cd. This is the album that started me off with Pearl Jam, and it is a great place to start. This album shows that Pearl Jam are not just serious about music, that is only the surface of them.
B00007E8V4|5.0|There are not many CDs that you can listen to all the way through.  This is one.  You can hit play at song one and love it the whole way through.  It is better than Toxicity, just because it is more thorough.  The only good songs on Toxicity are \\"Chop Suey!\\" and \\"Toxicity.\\"  Those are AWESOME songs, but don't buy a CD for two songs.  Steal this Album! won't dissapoint.
B00005AFMT|5.0|This is one of those wonderful albums that changed my concept of music forever.  I was a KC fan starting around the time of RED, and was fully involved in exploring the music of the time.  Yes, E.L.P., Genesis, U.K., National Health, Zappa, Talking Heads,... were the backbone of my collection, and in the couple of years preceding \\"Discipline\\" I had witnessed what I could only characterize as a creative malaise.  Danceability was paramount, and the long-heard battle cry \\"Death before disco\\" was being replaced with \\"Dance the night away!\\".  Prog-rock mainstays were seemingly being sucked into a black hole of \\"jingle-ism\\" quite possibly co-perpetrated by the record company moguls of the time. Enter Fripp, Belew, Bruford & Levin.           If I had known there was a \\"Discipline\\"-shaped hole in the music world, I would never have been able to foresee the filling of that hole by Crimson.  But immediately upon being grabbed by the first few measures of \\"Elephant Talk\\", I new that I was in uncharted musical waters.  I thought Hendrix could make a guitar feel pain, but wow!... Belew could make it sound like an unmedicated pachyderm having its tusks torn from its cheeks!  Many others have delved into the individual performances delivered by the four gents involved, and I strongly recommend checking out the many commentaries on Amazon, for my part I focus more on the milestone status of the recording, and specifically as an artwork.  It cannot be overstated that this record was a completely new experience for the listener, and considering where popular music has gone since 1981, there is very little rust on these sounds!        With the exception of Tony Levin, whose work I had heard but didn't realize it, I was familiar with most of the previous work produced by the members of this KC lineup, and I think it's safe to say that \\"Discipline\\" proved to be a cathartic culmination of their development as musicians, artists & technicians.  The compositions here are original, captivating, flawlessly performed & never tedious (as I admit some of KC's previous work had been).  There is an amazing range of performance captured here; bombastic, reflective, Frippnotic, clinical, playful, ... everything you could ever want from prog rock (which incidentally, this album is TRULY synonymous with!).  In my opinion that means that the music heard here is not just for casual listening, it is to be allowed to reveal itself over time just as a Kandinsky painting does.  It's not a sofa-sized oil painting of babbling brooks and mountains in the distance.  This album is a master stroke, pitting highly organized and technically demanding (disciplined) arrangements against concepts of urban danger, our animal nature and otherwise chaotic expressions, played out in the straining of Adrian Belew's guitar and vocals, Bruford's near-frantic barrages on drums, Fripp's impeccable creation of soundscapes and Levin's more-than-just-backbone bass riffs.      A fascinating aspect of this album is that although there is an obvious dance thread to much of the sound, my sense at the time when it was released was that any danceability had much more of a tribal (as opposed to a \\"disco\\") intent to it.  It is most likely this injection of dance rhythms (in what could fairly be described as an artistic response to the era in which KC found themselves) along with the injection of Belew's artistic vocal/lyrical style that took the band and their audience where no band had gone before.  For the Crimson fan of the time, this album also offered a refreshing break from the disturbing qualities of previous offerings (e.g. \\"One More Red Nightmare\\", \\"Schizoid Man\\", \\"Red\\", ...) which tended not to release the listener from their metal-grinding hypnotic spell.  The tracks on \\"Discipline\\" tend more to be artworks to be viewed a bit more safely from a few feet away, not as painfully immersive as before, which for some may be a let down, but for me it's easier to crank this album at 100 decibels and actually experience ..... pleasure! The pain of Schizoid Man is still there, but here it's found in a more controlled tension that exists between the four performers, and the overall feeling isn't nearly as dark as so much of Crimson's catalog.           Discussing the content of a recording is so personal, it can effect us on so many levels, so in an effort to help you - the reader - get a better picture of where I'm coming from I've decided to list a few of the albums which I feel are artistically related to \\"Discipline\\".  In no particular order; \\"Speaking in Tongues\\"-Talking Heads, \\"Horses\\"-Patti Smith, \\"Sergeant Pepper's ...-The Beatles, \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\"-Pink Floyd, \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\"-Emerson, Lake & Palmer, \\"The Hissing of Summer Lawns\\"-Joni Mitchell.  If any of these recordings had an effect on you, \\"Discipline\\" almost certainly will leave a lasting impression on you.       In the musak-friendly environment of pop music which can be just as easily ignored as listened to, the performances on \\"Discipline\\" will not only find you thoroughly involved, but will most likely leave you wanting more (try Beat, Three of a Perfect Pair and Thrak).
038572179X|5.0|It's nice to know that in the 21st century, the literary tradition is alive and well.  To say that McEwan's book is reminiscent of great authors as varied as Austen, Forster and Hemingway is not giving McEwan his own credit, although I admit I compared his writing style and storytelling to those same authors as I read the novel.  From the idyllic English countryside scenes in the beginning to the graphic war horrors of later on, McEwan tells a story about an act and its consequences that carry over time.  The final act, set in contemporary times, carries a cruel twist but nonetheless one that makes sense.<br /><br />Simply put, \\"Atonement\\" is one of the best books I've read this year.  That may sound a premature statement as the year isn't even half-over, but I doubt I'll find another book quite as complex and engrossing as this one before December -- not that I'll stop trying.
B000002MP2|5.0|This is the album that brought Green Day to the top.  I listened to this cd when it first came out rambling out the verses to Longview and When I Come Around and whispering F.O.D. (whispering because i was about 5 at the time)....well i lost track of this cd for about 10 years, and came back in contact with it last year and i have listened to it non-stop since, this cd is a must have for green day fans!!
B00005YU1O|4.0|The first time I saw this movie I was sixteen. I left the theater mightily impressed by the philosophising of its dream characters. I cherished this revelatory impression of the film until I watched it again as a college sophomore, when I realized that many of the profundities upon which the film is based are flimsy at best.     The science is not interpreted by scientists but by philosophers who have not grasped it in its entirety. The politics lacks depth. The movie gives off a self-important air.     Only a few characters mentioned unexplored and interesting premises. I was disappointed that they were left floating while the more cliched philosophical revelations took precedence. The most telling moment of the film included a tortured novelist in - what else? - a dark cafe.      Every character presented himself as an expert, so telling apart the wise from the banal was an interesting exercise.     I did love the animation, however. It captivated me from the very beginning. I felt it was innovative and a pleasure to watch.     The score by the Tosca Tango Orchestra is also notable.     Watching the movie in an actual \\"dream state\\" or trance may make it more stimulating. Otherwise, its revelations soon wear thin.
0767847431|5.0|This is my favorite movie featuring the stop-motion special effects of Ray Harryhausen. Although, saying that Ray's work is 'featured' in this movie is like saying I.L.M. had 'something to do' with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. One scene stands out, where a six-armed statue comes to life and, controlled with black magic by an evil wizard, starts to dance. It's really amazing. The movie itself, that is, the story, too, is good. You really feel like you're on the ship during the voyage and not just buying time till they reach their destination. Then the masthead (and body) coming to life, this too is amazing stop-motion brilliance.
B000069HK2|1.0|I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why people think that they're badasses when they listen to My Chemical Romance and The Used. Guess what morons, the entire youth of the country is listening to your music, and you're not rebelling against anything in particular, except maybe yourself. Let's face it, the message behind this music is that cutting yourself and writing songs about the same thing over and over again will get you famous. All you need to be able to do is scream. F*ck singing, that doesn't matter. Screamin is badass. That'll get me my money.
B00005JMUA|3.0|I like the part when \\"Bill\\" - David Carradine - is making that sandwich.  I mean, he is REALLY into making that sandwich - the sandwich bread, the mayonaise, everything all perfectly laid out.  I swear, I have never seen anyone spread mayonaise with such precision in my life - all while holding an intimate conversation about life and death.  It was such effortless, graceful sandwich making - they practically made themselves! <br /> <br />I can tell you, I was ready to eat that sandwich when it was all done, but sadly, he made one for himself and his kid, and I never got any. <br /> <br />I never understood why it took Mia Farrow 45 minutes to an hour to kill each of Bill's underlings.  But then she killed Bill himself in like 5 seconds, all while never getting out of her patio seat.  Lamest ending ever.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Yes, yes it is....quite possibly one of the best movies I ever seen, and yet, one of the worst.  I don't know how this works, but it does.  One of Ben Stiller's best performance's as Derek Zoolander, a male model.  It was pretty stupid, but the phrases were hilarious.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Hot Dog!  Lauren Graham needs to be covered in ketchup and mustard, smothered in relish and onions, and served on a fresh bun. <br /> <br />Dabney Coleman and Gary Coleman, aka \\"the Coleman brothers,\\" are outstanding in this series and lend their considerable acting talents to a product that never fails to disappoint.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|The filmmakers who brought you Brother's Keeper spent several years following the members of Metallica between therapy exercises and recording sessions, and the result is a fabulous documentary that will entertain fans and non-fans alike.<br /><br />The group has been divided by a bitter breakup with their bassist, writer/singer James Hetfield has gone into seclusion/rehab, and the band has not recorded for quite a while.  As they attempt to reunite and record St. Anger, they also decide that group therapy would be beneficial and it might be fun to have a documentary crew follow them around!  I'm not sure how they decided all this pressure was a good idea, but it sure makes for a wonderful film.<br /><br />Along the way we meet fans, parents and kids; Lars sells his art collection; the band auditions and selects a new bass player; and, in the funniest scene of the film, the group's therapist decides to submit lyrics to the band!  I also enjoyed the moment when Lars is being interviewed in his home, talking about writing music and performing; in the background we hear a little voice repeating, \\"Daddy!  Daddy!\\" and Ulrich, metal rocker extraordinaire, interrupts his musings on the meaning of art to say, \\"What is it, sweetie?\\"  Priceless.<br /><br />I watched this, then watched it with the band's commentary, then watched it again with my husband -- and thoroughly enjoyed it each time.  I'd recommend this to fans of Metallica, to non-fans who like documentaries, and to people who are interested in people.  While the making of an album is not the primary focus of the film (although, ironically, that was the original intent of it), we do still learn some very interesting things about that process, and we come to appreciate the hard work it takes to stay relevant and entertaining.<br /><br />Extras include two commentary tracks, one with the filmmakers and one with Metallica, and 2 trailers.  Subtitles are available in English or Spanish.<br /><br />The second disc contains scenes from various premieres and film festivals as well as 41 deleted scenes, including a tour of Kirk's skull-rich home, a webchat with the lads, a surprisingly prescient management discussion about the benefits of therapy for the band, bowling, Kirk in traffic school, and a terrific segment featuring a collaboration between Kirk, Lars, Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule.<br /><br />Highly recommended.lm festivals as well as 41 deleted scenes, including a tour of Kirk's skull-rich home, a webchat with the lads, a surprisingly prescient management discussion about the benefits of therapy for the band, bowling, Kirk in traffic school, and a terrific segment featuring a collaboration between Kirk, Lars, Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule.

0788821075|1.0|What's better entertainment than the fairy tale romance of a high price prostitute with the world's biggest mouth, who meets a hampster-loving rich guy who pays her to NOT have sex with him, falls in love with her, and then offers her the world.  Its like the story of Cinderella - if Cinderella were a whore, of course, and Prince Charming liked gerbils more than Cinderella.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|This film  is set between the two world wars, and does a good job of capturing the spirit and feel of the old serials from the 40s, as a mad scientist decides to destroy Earth, only to be dogged by an intrepid pilot and his feisty ex-girlfriend reporter.  The look of the film, which was done entirely against a blue screen, is great, and the acting, with the exception of Gwyneth Paltrow as reporter Polly Perkins, is very good; Paltrow plays the heroine in a much too whiny way, which gets annoying quickly.  Also, Angelina Jolie does not appear until an hour into the film and then is not on the screen enough after that.  The creatures and special effects are awesome, and the plot is good -- true to the movies it's trying to emulate.  I would recommend this film to those who like special effects, sci-fi, Jude Law or old adventure movies.<br /><br />Extras include two commentary tracks, a gag reel, 2 deleted scenes, an original 6-minute short, a 50-minute feature about the effects and a shorter featurette about the style.<br /><br />The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are available in English or Spanish.

B00003CX9E|3.0|I have seen this film at the top(or near) of nearly every film list I've ever seen.  Prior to my viewings of the film, a few of my friends(who also take a keen interest in films) urged me to watch it attentively.  Having seen the film twice now, I can't help but doubt film-critics calling this film the best of all time.  Perhaps this is a result of my youth and ignorance, but I suspect the movie has aged poorly and that people of my generation will never truly appreciate this film. <br />  Citizen Kane meets all the criteria of a classic film, the most important of which is: it deals with themes that are universal.  That is, Kane's ambitions, the corruption of politicians, and the general human desire to be loved.  Unfortunately, Welles makes a few missteps in executing these ideas and he tends to concentrate on irrelevancies such as his second wife's attempt at becoming an opera singer.  Perhaps some movie-goers find this suitable, but it is my firm conviction that a film should include scenes which are relevant to the development of the film, and that everything else should be scrapped.  Had Welles concentrated further on his Newspaper organization, and less on his domestic affairs, the plot would seem a lot more coherent.  As a result, it is not clear exactly what Welles is trying to say with this film.  With films like The Godfather, the implications were clear: organized crime is another form of American business.  Taxi Driver implies that loneliness is an ineviatable state of the human race.  This film on the other hand, can't quite make up its mind as to what it wants to get across. <br />   My own feeling is that this film has too many flaws to be really considered on the same level as say \\"The Godfather\\", \\"Seven Samurai\\", or \\"One flew over the cuckoo's nest\\".  The crucial difference being, not only do those films know what they want to say, but the manner in which they say those things is meticulous and free of any redundant words. <br />
0446677450|5.0|Recently in a Toastmaster meeting a speaker told us how we hardly ever challenge what our \\"Mother, Father, Preacher, Teacher\\" (MFPT) taught us. Fact is, times change. We must change with it ... Or, suffer the consequences. <br /> <br />A couple of years ago I received and read a booklet summary of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. To say the least it was a compelling read. In fact, I still display the booklet on my bookshelf for quick inspiration. <br /> <br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad, is a book that teaches six main lessons: <br /> <br />1) The rich don't work for money <br />2) Why teach financial literacy <br />3) Mind your own business <br />4) The history of taxes and the power of corporations <br />5) The rich invent money <br />6) Work to learn - don't work for money <br /> <br />Throughout the lessons, Kiyosaki helps us understand that to achieve financial success we must do something we are never taught in school and that is \\"to think.\\"  <br /> <br />For the budding Entrepreneur, chapters four (Mind your own business) and five (History of taxes and the power of corporations) hold special interest. The first, because \\"there is a big difference between your profession and your business\\" and the second, because taxes are the single largest expense for most of us - at least until we become wise. <br /> <br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad is, at least to me, more than a book about financial literacy, it is about changing your perspective of the world. In the movie Matrix, Morpheus says (in order to \\"become the one\\") to Neo \\"Free your mind\\". And that is exactly what this book will help you do. <br /> <br />----------------- <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation
B000929AJQ|2.0|After years of waiting for some new music from Nine Inch Nails, With Teeth is eaily the least interesting Nine Inch Nails Album, and one of the worst big-name Rock albums released in the genre over the past few years. With a few bright spots, the Synth-Pop \\"Hand That Feeds\\" and the almost too Happy for NIN \\"Only,\\" With Teeth still fails to get anywhere.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I have read many reviews on here calling this album too similar to the others, and that it should have been the album after The Downward Spiral because it's not close enough to the Fragile. This could not be farther from the truth. With Teeth, in the sound aspect and lyrical aspect, trancends so many fields of music in one album that it is impossible to call it too similar to the other albums. There are tracks that have elements of previous albums in them, but what Nine Inch Nails album did not have tracks that recall tracks from previous albums? And as a whole, With Teeth has a completely different feel to it than Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile. <br /> <br />The themes of With Teeth are strongly tied with Trent Reznor's addiction problems, his coming to grips with the fact he isn't where he thinks he should be, and finally, his facing of himself. These themes work in a concept like The Downward Spiral throughout the album. <br /> <br />I hate reading reviews by those who simply calssify With Teeth as \\"teen angst\\", because it simply isn't. It's a very thoughtfull and meaningful album, for the man who wrote it and for those who listen to it. I love each and every Nine Inch Nails album, and this is no exception. In fact, this is the most interesting of them all. As for fans who were unhappy with the album, I cannot be certain, but I think in time they will learn to like it. It is quite an adjustment from The Fragile to With Teeth. <br /> <br />An incredible album. Mr. Reznor has shown us what real music is once again.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|I am so glad I rented The Phantom of the Opera before considering purchasing it.  This would have been a fairly decent movie had Gerard Butler not been cast as the Phantom.  My ex's caterwauling to the Broadway CD was more pleasant-sounding!  The only thing that was salvagable was the plotline of Christine Daae and Raoul.  That was well-played, and not overdone, which was the downside of the Broadway musical.   <br />If this had been a strictly acting movie, Gerard Butler would be a halfways decent Phantom.  But his singing killed the mood for me.

B000929AJQ|4.0|I'm sure you're going to see reviewers lined up saying how bad this album is. Unfortunately, these people haven't given the album the time it needs to truly appreciate this album. First off, this isn't supposed to a Fragile or Downward Spiral. For the first time since 1989, Trent Reznor is writing a song driven album that *GASP* has good songwriting.<br /><br />Trent took everything you know about Nine Inch Nails and left his fans guessing even more this time. This album is unlike any other and is incomparable to previous albums. The best comparison you can make is that this album is Pretty Hate Machine with 13 songs and not about a collective ongoing epic. These songs are the most organic and percussion driven songs that Trent has ever written. Some of that kudos could go to album drummer Dave Grohl, who lets face it, could retire right now with a good name but refuses. From the climatic \\"All the Love in the World\\" to the groove driven title track, Trent knows exactly what he's doing. There are no layers or textures like that of The Fragile or Downward Spiral, but instead is replaced with just creative approaches towards the productions of bass and drums. There are two songs (The Hand That Feeds and Only) that stick out in being \\"radio\\" ready but *GASP* as long as they are good songs I could care less. The last three songs kind of mesh into one long epic that leads to the album's closer \\"Right Where It Belongs\\". This song is so hauntingly beautiful that even Johnny Cash were alive in two years this song would be covered.<br /><br />Words really can't describe how Trent Reznor has lived up to my expectations. Not only did he not continue the long drawn out Fragile sound that would've been old to hear again, but he really took the time to craft out these songs very well. With the re-emergence of New Wave, it's only appropriate that one of the genre's founding fathers has come back to reclaim the throne
0790730960|5.0|This review refers to the Warner Bros. DVD edition of the film. <br /> <br />THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Michael Murphy, Vincent Schiavelli, Andrew Bryniarski, Cristi Conaway, Jan Hooks, Paul Reubens. Based Upon Characters Appearing in Magazines Published By DC Comics Inc. Casting By Marion Dougherty. Special Penguin Makeup and Effects Produced By Stan Winston. Score Composed By Danny Elfman. Co-Executive Produced By Jon Peters. Co-Executive Produced By Peter Guber. Based on Batman Characters Created By Bob Kane. Co-Produced By Denise Di Novi. Co-Produced and Directed By Tim Burton. (PG-13) For Violence, Very Mild Profanity, Very Mild Gore, and Mild Sexual Content; 126m.; 1992. <br /> <br />WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: The best \\"Batman\\" team reunites for a final outing in this blockbuster sequel to the 1989 original. Rising from Gotham City's sewers is the Penguin (Danny DeVito). He hides beneath a facade of humble dignity while plotting to rid Gotham of their first born sons. Falling from the rooftops is the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). She deals with her abnormal duality by plotting vengeance against the men in her life whom she feels wronged her. Now, Batman (Michael Keaton) must contend with two of the most nefarious supervillians his world has ever known. Director Tim Burton has succeeded in creating a masterpiece which outshines the original movie. This would be a trend carried over by other latter day superhero movies including the \\"X-Men\\", \\"Spider-Man\\" and \\"Blade\\" franchises. The statuesque set pieces are perfect examples of Burton's legendary imagination. Where the original sets for \\"Batman\\" were cold and hard, this Gotham City teems with life and vibrancy. Danny Elfman, as with the original \\"Batman\\" film, reached the pinnacle of his gothic success with his outstanding score. The finale is particularly memorable and showcases what a true talent Elfman really is. Burtonhas also assembled a much better cast for this outrageously entertaining sequel. Keaton returns and continues to infuse his character with the same dry, just-south-of-stuffy performance he brought to the table originally. Michelle Pfeiffer is deliciously slinky in her transformation from painfully shy office secretary Selina Kyle into the aggressive, mysterious Catwoman. She also does a good job portraying the emotional pressures of Catwoman, which leaves her unraveling...literally. Her costume keeps coming apart more and more throughout the picture to physically represent the emotional discrepancies her character is going through. Though, when it's all said and done, Selina Kyle proves that cats really have nine lives. Christopher Walken sinks his teeth into the role of Max Shreck, making the most of an unnecessary character who only serves to fuel the fires of both Catwoman and the Penguin. The true delight, however, is watching Danny DeVito, whose maniacal performance as the Penguin overshadows that of Jack Nicholson (The Joker) from the first film. Overall, this is the best \\"Batman\\" of the bunch. It proves that Warner Bros. should have stuck with the Burton/Keaton formula instead of letting director Joel Schumacher take over the reins for the third movie. One trivia note for astute film buffs, the Penguin's father Tucker Cobblepot is played by Pee-Wee Herman himself, Paul Reubens. <br /> <br />THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: When you pop this DVD into your player, it's immediately apparent that the 1.85:1 widescreen transfer is far superior to the one featured on the original 1989 \\"Batman\\" DVD. Colors are crisp and sharp while blacks are even and deep. Every piece of falling confetti and every light on the Christmas trees are easily picked out and clearly defined with very few traces of grain or wear. The 5.1 Dolby surround sound is staggering in its multi-directional capacity and will surprise fans, even the ones like myself who marveled over the surround onthe original motion picture. Particularly captivating are the scenes in which Batman fights the Red Triangle Gang and the explosion Catwoman causes in a Shreck's department store. There's also a French Dolby 2.0 surround sound alongside English, French and Spanish subtitles. Subtitles are clear and easy to read and are framed within the borders of the film itself. The front cover of Warner Bros.' atypical paper case is a recreation of the original 1992 VHS cover, a wonderful arrangement of the three key characters in the film as well as a few scattered penguins across the bottom. The back cover is a refreshing change from the bleak, unimaginative one that adorned the original \\"Batman\\" DVD. The inside of the paper case is actually a bit muddled in its appearance, although it does spotlight the thirty-nine chapter stops for this two hour plus presentation. As with the original \\"Batman\\" DVD, this is a flip disc which features the widescreen version on one side and a scathing, hacked 1.33:1 full screen version on the other side. No notable special features are included on the disc, only the same style of written text found on the first \\"Batman\\" DVD. There's some very brief cast and crew information. There's also some fairly informative production notes which gives back story to \\"Batman\\" creator Bob Kane, the making of the penguin army and some biographical notes for the screenwriters, among other tidbits. Finally, the obligatory \\"Film Flash\\" section is back, which \\"highlights\\" four video covers for other releases Warner Bros. recommends. Once more, the original theatrical trailer is mysteriously absent, which is a shame considering how solid and well-pieced together it was. <br /> <br />THE YOLK'S ON YOU: This is an early release Warner Bros. DVD. You'll probably find the Penguin's underground lair before you find hidden easter eggs on this one. <br /> <br />THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: While Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderfully sexy as Catwoman, she's never given the proper progression to express that sexuality on screen. The only sexually charged highlight is seeing her in a form-fitting vinyl catsuit, most notably when she decides to give herself a bath after the Penguin makes her feel dirty. Although, to be fair, the lucky Penguin gets to grope a beautiful fan during his candidacy for mayor. There's very little stimulation in that scene for viewers, only for the Penguin. <br /> <br />THE GORE REPORT: The Penguin bites an unlucky man on his nose and a small stream of blood proceeds to shoot out of the wound. Not bad for a PG-13 rated superhero movie. <br /> <br />SAY AGAIN: \\"What do you want?\\" - Batman (Michael Keaton). \\"Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask.\\" - The Penguin (Danny DeVito). <br /> <br />THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. I'm not as hesitant about this recommendation as I was on the original \\"Batman\\" DVD. While the special features are lacking, both the video and audio for this sequel are magnificent. Fans of the film will find it a joy to behold. One wishes a commentary track or at least a making of would have graced the extras, but since there are no known plans for a re-release of this DVD, this version will be more than sufficient. <br /> <br />PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM: \\"Face to Face\\" Performed By Siouxsie and the Banshees. Soundtrack Available on Warner Bros. Compact Discs and Cassettes.
B000929AJQ|2.0|The Broken & The Fragile had blown me away. This (with teeth) is nothing short of mediocre. What happened Trent? What were you thinking man? Either you are losing touch with all things musical or you are simply too deafened by your own rants about how bad all the music is out there. You seem to be falling into that very category that you so arduously created in order make people believe that you are the greatest thing in music. It worked for a while, but its clear now that you are NO genius but only play one on TV. Good show man !
0790731002|3.0|This review refers to the Warner Bros. DVD edition of the film. <br /> <br />THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman, Chris O'Donnell, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Drew Barrymore, Debi Mazar, Rene Auberjonois, Joe Grifasi, Jon Favreau, George Wallace, Bob Zmuda, Don \\"The Dragon\\" Wilson, Ed Begley Jr.. Based Upon Characters Appearing in Magazines Published By DC Comics. Special Make-Up Designed and Created By Rick Baker. Score Composed By Elliot Goldenthal. Based on Batman Characters Created By Bob Kane. Co-Produced By Tim Burton. Directed By Joel Schumacher. (PG-13) For Violence and Very Mild Profanity; 121m.; 1995. <br /> <br />WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: The \\"Batman\\" franchise is back, minus the talents of director Tim Burton (who only stayed on as one of the film's producers) and star Michael Keaton (the best Batman to date). In this re-envisioned sequel, Batman goes up against two of his most famous arch-nemeses, Two-Face and the Riddler. The Riddler has designed a new 3-D television box which drains thoughts and memories from the minds of those who use it, transporting that energy into the Riddler's own brain. He's hooked up with Two-Face in order to uncover Batman's secret identity and destroy him once and for all. During one of Two-Face's solo attempts to uncover Batman's identity, he instigates the birth of another new superhero in the form of Robin. So how does this new \\"Batman\\" film stack up against its predecessors? Well, the verdict isn't looking positive by any means. Director Joel Schumacher has fashioned a live action cartoon instead of the brooding, caliginous heroism which graced the first two entries. Score artist Elliot Goldenthal brings an entirely new musical outlook to the franchise which, while not without some merit, makes listeners long for the gothic suspense of Danny Elfman's masterpieces. Val Kilmer gives a stunted performance as the Caped Crusader, appearing more realistic only as his alter ego Bruce Wayne. Where Keaton could pull both halves of the duality off with fine-tuned precision, Kilmer is better suited to bringing Wayne's tortured psyche to the screen rather than competing in the intense action sequences. Tommy Lee Jones looks the most like a comic book portrait during his witless performance. Unlike the Joker and the Penguin from the other movies, Two-Face's make-up seems purposefully arrogant and as far from lifelike as the filmmakers could apparently get. His origin is also carelessly discarded with a mere flashback sequence instead of being fully developed like other supervillains. While Jones does play well enough against the Riddler, he seems overbearing in other areas of the film. Jim Carrey is the beacon of light for the entire movie, acting as if he were born to play the role of the Riddler. His over-the-top performance is almost as memorable as Danny DeVito's interpretation of the Penguin in \\"Batman Returns\\". Carrey makes Edward Nygma's insanity believable and highly enjoyable. Chris O'Donnell is the key player for this film as the origin of Robin figures prominently into the development of the story. Unfortunately, his brash ego can sometimes become irritating and unwelcome to the viewer, a trait that was sadly carried over to \\"Batman and Robin\\" two years later. It's even more shameful since O'Donnell has natural charisma in other films that he wasn't allowed to fully utilize in this one. Ultra brief flashes pop up here and there, but not enough to save his performance. Nicole Kidman is as bright and starry-eyed as she can be in her role, but Dr. Chase Meridian isn't given enough structure to be truly involving as Batman's love interest. Both Michael Gough and Pat Hingle turn in veteran performances, having grown accustomed to their roles over the course of the last two films. Visually, this film begins to fall apart. The Wayne Enterprises and City Hall exteriors are incredible, wondrous pieces of art sandwiched between mediocre, garish neon-oriented sets which are more annoying than awe-inspiring. The Batmobile is a ridiculously fashioned eye sore compared to the original, classic car. An added complication is the fact that the first hour of this film is much slower-paced than the previous two movies. It makes it hard for the viewer to appreciate the characters and the situations the filmmakers have put them in. Overall, this was a nice try that just didn't hit its mark. If Schumacher had tried for a more realistic approach, leaving intact Burton's dark imaginings and lifelike characterizations, this film might have been a success. As it is, it's more of an afterthought to the original two mega-hits. <br /> <br />THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: There is a clear 1.85:1 widescreen presentation for this film, though the finale is a bit fuzzy from time to time. Colors are strikingly bold, tending to hurt the viewer's eyes after awhile. Black levels are solid and even but not as noteworthy as they were in \\"Batman Returns\\". Right from the opening moments of this film, the accompanying 5.1 Dolby surround sound makes a noticeable impression. Machine gun blasts leave reverberating traces while explosions are booming, room-shaking events. There's also a French Dolby 2.0 surround sound alongside English, French and Spanish subtitles. As with the previous two films, subtitles are clear and easy to read and are framed within the borders of the film itself. This is another atypical Warner Bros. paper case release, but the cover has a brilliant piece of artwork featuring the five main players from the film. The back is nothing special (but it still beats the original \\"Batman\\" back cover) and the inside highlights the thirty-nine chapter stops for this two hour presentation. As with all entries thus far in the \\"Batman\\" saga, this DVD is a flip disc. The widescreen presentation is on one side while a turgid, cut down 1.33:1 full screen presentation resides on the other. Fans looking for the wealth of background information that should have been made available on this DVD will be sorely let down. All the special features contained on this one are written blurbs such as brief cast and crew notes (which are marginally better than the sections appearing on the \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\" discs) and a production notes section. There's also the inevitable \\"Film Flash\\" which \\"highlights\\" four video covers for other films Warner Bros. recommends. Absent again on a \\"Batman\\" DVD is the original theatrical trailer. While not as intense as the one for \\"Batman Returns\\", the \\"Batman Forever\\" trailer would still have been a welcome addition to the blatantly slim extras on this disc. <br /> <br />THE YOLK'S ON YOU: This is an early Warner Bros. DVD release. You'd be more likely to solve one hundred of the Riddler's best puzzles than you would be to find hidden easter eggs on this one. <br /> <br />THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Nicole Kidman is the main focal point for sexuality in this film. We are treated to seeing the lovely blonde wrapped in a bed sheet when Batman visits her home one night and we also get a very brief upskirt when her character falls out of a glass enclosure. She even tries to seduce Batman on a roof after luring him in with the BatSignal. Her skimpy, lingerie-oriented outfit is nice to look at, but Kidman's been much sexier in other roles (\\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" immediately springs to mind). <br /> <br />THE GORE REPORT: Unlike the previous two films in this franchise, there's not even a trace element of blood to be found. <br /> <br />SAY AGAIN: \\"Riddle me this. Riddle me that. Who's afraid of the big black bat?\\" - The Riddler (Jim Carrey) <br /> <br />THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. While it's nowhere near as exciting as the last two \\"Batman\\" films, there are still a few enjoyable tidbits to be gleaned from the movie. Any fan of Jim Carrey will find his performance here to be one of his most skillful and humorous. Those who want to give their home theaters a workout will love the 5.1. True \\"Batman\\" enthusiasts can make a passable weekend diversion out of this film. So while it's not a necessary classic for DVD collectors, it's still a reasonably priced, fairly worthy treat if you're looking for a way to kill time. <br /> <br />PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM: \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\\" Performed By U2. \\"Kiss From a Rose\\" Performed By Seal. \\"Smash it Up\\" Performed By the Offspring. \\"Bad Days\\" Performed By the Flaming Lips. \\"Where Are You Now?\\" Performed By Brandy.

B000929AJQ|4.0|I was a NIN freak throughout college (during the NIN heyday of '92-'96), and was underwhelmed by The Fragile, other than several tracks. I kinda wished Reznor would've continued in the vein of Perfect Drug (still my favorite NIN track), but other than Star****ers, The Fragile operated on a totally different key.<br /><br />With Teeth is, well...it's pretty damn poppy. I mean that in a good way, though. I remember when The Fragile came out, a lot of critics opined that it didn't do well commercially and critically because people at that time were more into positive music -- re the late '90s success of Brittney, etc. I wonder if this made Reznor think he needed to do something less angsty?<br /><br />Even though it's coming out 14 years later, With Teeth sounds more like a follow-up to Pretty Hate Machine than any of the preceding NIN albums. Because unlike them, it doesn't operate on one theme, and it isn't a \\"concept album\\" of any sort. It's just a bunch of songs with great production, good beats, good riffs, and insightful lyrics.<br /><br />All the Love in the World:  Starts off like \\"typical\\" NIN, with melodic bass, a brooding atmosphere, and an Autechre-style breakbeat.  Gradually becomes a rocking stomper with piano accompaniment, a mean fuzz bass, a pounding beat, and a sing-along chorus with multiple Reznor vocals that reminds me, well, of like an advertisement or something: \\"I'd like to give the world a Coke,\\" or something...but then again, that might just be me.  Sing-along chorus is \\"Why do you get all the love in the world?\\", and trust me, it WILL get stuck in your head for days after hearing the album.  A great opening track, and unlike any other in the NIN catalog.<br /><br />You Know What You Are:  Reminds me a lot of \\"Burn,\\" from the Natural Born Killers soundtrack.  A computerized drum pattern similar in some ways to \\"March of the Pigs.\\"  Sounds like an old-school NIN rager.  Definite proof that Nine Inch Nails can still pound your head into the ground.  Reznor screams \\"Don't you know what you [expletive] are?\\" in the chorus.<br /><br />The Collector:  Imagine \\"Piggy\\" from The Downward Spiral, only sped up a bit and with more of a dance feel than a jazzy one.  Drums and bass guitar carry the verses, with distorted guitar on bridge and chorus.  I don't think this one would've sounded out of place on The Fragile.  The end descends into an off-kilter, jazzy piano deal that reminds me of David Bowie's \\"Outside\\"- era music.<br /><br />The Hand that Feeds:  It saddens me that so many so-called NIN \\"fans\\" deride this track as a \\"sell-out,\\" \\"too poppy,\\" etc.  It's as if these freaks have never heard Pretty Hate Machine.  In all honesty, this could stand as one of my favorite NIN tracks ever.  It's got Pretty Hate Machine-era rhythm, Broken-era guitars, and great lyrics.  It's the perfect symbiosis of NIN's early dance roots and later industrial-metal rage.<br /><br />Love is Not Enough:  Starts off slow and foreboding.  Has that Pretty Hate Machine sound, only more modern, with more \\"live\\" instrumentation, except for the drums, which are a sampled beat.  Wicked guitars on the chorus, totally distorted.  Reznor does that \\"speaking/singing\\" thing during the verses.  Toward the end, some very cool harmonics guitars pop up against the main riff.<br /><br />Every Day is Exactly the Same:  If there was ever an album titled \\"Pretty Hate Machine II,\\" this track would be on it.  It's got the keyboard rhythm foundation, the hummable melody, the sing-along chorus.  Hearing this, it's hard to imagine this is the same guy who gave us \\"March of the Pigs.\\"  Middle section features Reznor speaking/singing about leaving a letter for a lover.<br /><br />With Teeth:  Starts off like \\"Piggy,\\" again: heavy, jazzy drums from a real-life drummer, with fuzz bass and distorted guitar accompaniment.  I like this track a lot, it's another example of how Reznor can take something so foreboding and craft it into a melody that sticks in your brain.Unfortunately, the track drops off three minutes in for a long spell of piano ambience, which some may find \\"arty,\\" but I just find annoying.  Goes on for a little over a minute before the song itself comes back with force, this time with distorted guitars blaring throughout.  ROCK!<br /><br />Only:  After hearing the first few beats, you half-expect Gwen Stefani or Pink to start singing.  Seriously, it's THAT poppy.  You could probably argue that this track sounds more like something off Pretty Hate Machine than any other on With Teeth, like a cross between \\"Down In It\\" and \\"Sin.\\"  Reznor speaks the lyrics throughout the verse: \\"Sometimes I can see right through myself.\\"  Those who are quick to scream \\"sell-out\\" will hate this track more than any other, but I like it a lot.  Word of caution: the bass riff will get stuck in your head, guaranteed.<br /><br />Getting Smaller:  This track rocks, plain and simple.  But it doesn't rock like an older NIN track, like \\"Wish\\" or \\"Burn;\\" it rocks more like something by the Foo Fighters or recent Primal Scream.  Ever wondered what NIN would sound like if they were a \\"traditional\\" hard rock group, without industrial instrumentation like keyboards, samples, and loops?  Well, wonder no more.  Raging guitars, pounding drums, screamed vocals, this is a definite standout.  \\"My world is getting smaller everyday, and that's okay.\\"<br /><br />Sunspots:  Another slow and mellow track with heavy drums and a thick bass.  The chorus features the most melodic use of white noise I've ever heard.  The guitars crop up eventually, and the rhythm speeds up a little, but this one's a slow burner all the way.<br /><br />The Line Begins to Blur:  Sounds a lot like something from The Fragile.  Distorted rhythm section, repetitive beat.  Reznor screams the lyrics, sounding like he's down a well.  The chorus seems to be from a different song altogether, very melodic and mellow.<br /><br />Beside You in Time:  Another track with that Fragile-era sound.  Reznor provides mellow vocals over a pulsing synth riff, with a drum loop quietly pounding beneath.  This goes on without much variation until everything drops out except for the synths, which throb louder and louder until they explode into a welter of distorted guitars, which chug along on the same riff.  A GREAT moment.  Sounds truly evil.  As if to contradict this malevolent vibe, Reznor provides airy, dreamy vocals, which seem to float unscathed above the din.<br /><br />Right Where It Belongs:  Similar in many ways to \\"Hurt,\\" off Downward Spiral, especially the live version which can be found on Further Down the Spiral.  Mellow and depressed, a piano provides the melody, with sinister feedback zapping alongside it.  No drums.  Reznor sounds a bit like he's on a short-wave radio.  Eventually a sampled live audience appears, further giving it that \\"Hurt\\" sound.  Doesn't build up to a crescendo; instead, it ends with the piano playing solo.  A saddened ending to an otherwise upbeat album.<br /><br />Here's something funny: while writing this review, and mentally comparing the tracks with those on previous NIN albums, I've realized this is my favorite Nine Inch Nails album.  It's not as sterile as The Fragile, it's more song-oriented than The Downward Spiral, it's longer than Broken, and it's more edgy than Pretty Hate Machine.  Every track has something great, and overall it's one hell of an enjoyable listen.  Besides, who needs \\"all angst, all the time?\\"  It's a new millennium, let's try to make it a more positive one.hat sticks in your brain.

B000929AJQ|5.0|I've never written a review for ANYTHING before until now, after 3 cd run-throughs.  Wow.  Trent has always been ahead of his time.  Please ignore the reviews that say this album is awful or even average.  Whether your somewhat of a NIN fan, or a matured music listener (Appreciate music and genres as artforms), it takes a couple listens to first get a feel for it initially.  From there comes replay value.  NIN is one of the few bands that successfully incorperates long-term replay value into their work.  For example, I only initially liked maybe 5-7 songs off of \\"The Fragile\\".  The others seemed, I don't know, I just didn't have the feel.  5 years after that I gave it a listen and suddenly found myself loving everysong........ <br /> <br />Onto With_Teeth.... <br />I've never really referred to music as being \\"beautiful\\" until this album.  Even the harder, upbeat songs have well thoughtout melodies that just flow.  Also, i've never felt like I got my \\"moneys-worth\\" as much as with this.  It's a very complex album due to the fact that Trent is a genius and NIN molds and evolves throughout every song and album, albums being more noticible. <br /> <br />Some reviews have listed \\"stand out\\" tracks.  Being a true NIN fan I must say that no single track stands out, but every track on the album absolutly blew me away.  I was hoping to hear tracks with the same vibe as \\"March of the pigs\\" and \\"Mr. Self destruct\\", but I know realize I'm happier that \\"repeat\\" sounds are not what NIN is about.  Those older tracks are in my NIN library of HALOS and can be enjoyed anytime.  \\"With Teeth\\" adds to the library a completely new sounding set of tracks, all unique and well though out.  Can't wait to see them on tour.... <br /> <br />With NIN albums individual song reviews are hard as any NIN fan would know.... <br /> <br />So if you purchase this album,(HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - see first line of this review) you can expect: <br /> <br />-Well established percussion and beats that are unique and changing throughout the entire album. <br />-Lyrics that mostly ponder the thoughts about life (Why are we here?) <br />-Emotions are not forced upon you in this album, but drawn out of you depending on your mood.  This strongly adds to replay value as you discover new things each listen. <br />-****Important****  This is the thing that draws the line between people loving or hating this album.  The random, industrual-like sounds have been suppressed with this album...it seems now that they are more organized into the main rythem..(I haven't had chance to try 5.1 format) <br /> <br />Hope this gives you and idea of how the album is, and whether your a true NIN fan or not. <br />  <br /> <br />
B0007TKH66|5.0|Enterprise is a fantastic show.  It's the only other Trek series (so far) besides the Original Series that I've purchased.      I have nothing against \\"The Next Generation\\", \\"Deep Space 9\\", or \\"Voyager\\", but for some reason I feel drawn to this series.  This series has the feel of Star Trek (the original).    Over the years...watch how Enterprise becomes a legend of its own.  I have forseen it.    If you want a show you and/or your family can enjoy...Enterprise is it!
6304806434|2.0|Don't misunderstand me, in LIKE high energy action movies that don't make a lot of sense if you insist on taking them apart. Unfortunately this one stumbles right out of the gate. The whole premise of the movie depends on the audience believing in Mr. Cage's predicament, and I can't. <br /> <br />Supposedly, he has been in prison for years because he, a decorated combat vet, was assaulted by a gang of toughs outside a bar where he had gone to pick up his wife and take her home, and he killed one of them. I don't buy it; not for a minute. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the creep he killed was the local sheriff's son, and that the local political machine is strong enough to get a conviction. I still have to believe that sometime in the first year the Governor of the state is going to call his good buddy, the Sheriff, and say \\"Merle, I know  you loved that no good son of yours, but there's an election coming up. If I don't pardon this guy he's going to be the campaign issue that sinks me. I'm writing a pardon.\\" <br /> <br />That, or he wins on first appeal. The idea that a combat vet is going to rot in prison for years for defending himself from assault is absurd. It undermines the entire film. It is too much to ask the audience to buy. <br /> <br />Otherwise the movie is no sillier than most of its type. There are some genuinely fine moments, and it is full of great energy. It's too bad the film makers threw away any chance of maintaining my minimal standards of belief for such films in the first minutes.
B0007XT87G|2.0|I couldn't wait for \\"Deadwing\\" because I believe \\"In Absentia\\" is absolutely amazing. I can't stop listening to it - even popped it in this morning. The drums are stunning. But I believe \\"Deadwing\\" is appropriately named. And PT must have a new drummer, because they're now very weak - at best. I can't think of a single track that's worth mentioning - maybe Shallow. But even that is shallow.
B0008ISM40|5.0|When I heard this for the first time today, I felt like this album is a lot brighter than the rest of Trent's work.  Brighter chords, warmer tones, and a more optimisic, less depressed feel to the album.  A few tracks just scream Pretty Hate Machine, and in a very good way.  I found myself smiling though throughout this album more than wanting to raise my fist and bang my head.  Very good album, and Trent puts it perfectly from the quote on his website.  The album itself is an art form, and I feel that this album paints some pretty nice pictures, old and new.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|This is one of the best new shows that has been made (especially since it's on UPN! - I never watch that channel...) The story lines are excellent and it's easy to get obsessed with the show right away.  Plus the guys a great to look at (esp. Logan)! (...) so keep up-to-date with them and for goodness sakes watch this show because I don't want to see it cancelled!!!!!
B00004XQ83|5.0|I am a big fan of roots music.  This album is a beautiful, captivating record that consistently delivers great music, song after song.  If you enjoy this album and are looking for some similar great roots albums then I recommend the following: <br />1) Appalachian Stomp: Bluegrass Classics  <br />2) Ain't No Grave: A Tribute To Traditional And Public Domain Songs <br />3) March 16-20 by Uncle Tupelo <br />4) Beautiful Dreamer: The Songs Of Stephen Foster <br />5) Every Sound Below by Tim Eriksen <br />
B0000399WI|5.0|This film sticks in my mind as one of the best movies I've seen for several reasons, but primarily because of the outstanding character and plot development.  Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, is a quiet man who was unjustly convicted of murder and sent to Shawshank State Prison. While there he meets Red, played by Morgan Freeman, who is a lifer and also the go-to guy if anybody needs anything from the outside world. All the inmates respect Red, including Andy, who feels completely out of place in the prison world. He knows that this is not the place for him, and it is his determined hope to eventually get out that causes him to persevere. He, too, eventually gains the respect of the other inmates, although he never fully connects with them. For him, prison is just a temporary station in life and he refuses to attach himself to any part of it. <br /> <br />As the film progresses the audience is captivated by the developing relationship between Red and Andy. We watch them grow together and we can see the impact that they have on each other; we also watch expectantly as we view the impact that both characters have on the prison itself. The development of the characters draws us in-we feel personally connected to them and as twists in the story take place we are anxious to see what happens to each of these characters. <br /> <br />As the story draws the audience in, we wonder just what will happen next. We see mini-plots emerge, including the story of one elderly prisoner who is released back into a world he hardly knows. Because the world has changed so drastically since he was first incarcerated and because he misses his friends so deeply, he takes his own life. His freedom just wasn't worth the loneliness he felt. Watching this, we wonder what will happen to Red and Andy if they are ever released. Will they feel the same way or will they be able to move on with their life? The overall dynamics of the storyline are so engaging that at the end of the film it is difficult to find closure. We are left wondering what is going to happen next. We want to keep following the characters and their story. <br /> <br />This film is engaging, cleverly worked together, and wonderfully developed. Superb acting and an engrossing storyline are finely knit together to produce this masterpiece. <br />
0679731377|5.0|I rarely enjoy fiction very much. For instance, last year I read \\"Life of Pi,\\" which for some reason everyone seems to rave about, and I thought it was just ok. I thought \\"The Alchemist\\"  was terrible, but many intelligent people endorse it. Now I'm reading \\"Lonesome Dove\\" and finding it slow going. But I'm not totally biased against the genre; I read Kafka's \\"The Metamorphosis\\" recently, and loved it. I can't get enough of Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky or Orwell. But they're all dead, aren't they? So there's some background on my tastes, and an explanation for why, despite a strong recommendation from an intelligent friend of good taste, I didn't expect to like this book very much.<br /><br />Sure enough, I thought the first chapter was moderately entertaining, but predictable. That changed as the book went on: Barnes is a very nice writer; the first chapter was probably the most difficult to write. Immediately the book gets more interesting. From the beginning of the second or third chapter, you realize that Barnes is playing with you. The simplicity is deceiving and you have the opportunity to think hard if you want to. The better chapters are sometimes even subtly shocking, yet they remain light and playful. On the other hand, the last chapter is very simple but I will probably never forget it. I may even try to write my own version of it.<br /><br />The book is quite challenging, full of philosophy written into flesh. Barnes manages to tread a fine line between being sufficiently post-modern to please the chattering literature types, and being traditional enough to please more critical folks like me. I was pleased.<br /><br />I don't want to give away anything, other reviewers will certainly do that if you are interested. But I will confidently recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading an intelligent story. Interestingly, as with \\"Life of Pi,\\" not too far below the surface, this is a book about religion. But whereas \\"Life of Pi\\" is advertised as a book that will make you believe in God, I would advertise this as a book that will make you an atheist. Of course that's all just wind, but this is a very satisfying and clever book.<br /><br />I want to especially recommend it to folks who, like me, sometimes find themselves defending the theory of evolution to its fundamentalist critics. It's very entertaining from this point of view.I would advertise this as a book that will make you an atheist. Of course that's all just wind, but this is a very satisfying and clever book.

B000069AUI|5.0|I deleted the bit I wrote on this album back in November 04, so that I could re-do it.  I hate to think that I am so thick that it has taken me almost three years of having this album and listening to it, not all the time, but frequently, to realize what is going on in it.  It seems to be about the relationship between man and God. Not only full of great melodies and musicianship, but also the most damn clever use of subliminal manipulation since The Beatles.  I am totally blown away, and full of admiration for Coldplay, and look forward to the new album, which I will purchase without hesitation.  I am not a Christian, and I don't know if these gentlemen in the band are, but any group of musicians that are this clever and talented deserve our attention. I suppose I could be way off, but a close read of the lyrics of this work is all it should take for anyone.
0446677450|1.0|First of all, let me say that I have never written a review and probably will never write another review.  I am only writing this one because I feel very passionate about this horrifically written book with very dangerous ideas. <br /> <br />After reading \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\", I had a suddenly revelation: Mr. Kiyosaki is wealthy and continues to be wealthy because idiots like me support him by buying his books.  Luckily for me, this is the first book written by Mr. Kiyosaki I purchased and definitely will be the last.   <br /> <br />I generally do not purchase books that promises the \\"secret\\" to wealth and prosperity because I have always believed that hard work (or inheritance) is the only \\"secret\\".  According to Mr. Kiyosaki, that means my dad is a \\"poor dad.\\"  First of all, I will not dwell on the fact that this book sounds like a \\"broken record\\", as many reviewers have already mentioned that. Secondly, the book contains so many grammatical and typing errors that it looks like the book was written in a hurry to make a quick buck (or a quick $16.95).  Finally, many of Mr. Kiyosaki's secrets and ideas are simply illegal.  Mr. Kiyosaki describes trading stocks using insider information and tax avoidance by expensing personal expenses as business expenses as two ways by which the rich becomes richer.  Perhaps some people would be able to get away with it, but to say the the rich as a group can get away with illegal acts such as these is simple fantasy evidenced by many cases of corporate officers being indicted for insider trading or tax avoidance (e.g., Martha Stewart and Dennis Kozlowski).   <br /> <br />I do agree with one reviewer who says this is more of a philosophy book rather than a methods book.  However, this books has always been marked as one which contains methods by which the rich becomes richer. Perhaps falsely marketing a book is another one of his \\"methods\\" by which the rich become richer, but Mr. Kiyosaki conveniently failed to mention this one in the book.  <br /> <br />I did learn one thing from \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\": this is one \\"liability\\" I will never purchase again.
B0002X314C|4.0|Yay!  It's taken me awhile to write this review because I didn't want to be too completely biased, but if you haven't picked up this album, you should get with the program.  From the instant JL asks you to \\"come on and go\\" with him, it's obvious that he means business.  This CD is a wake-up call to R&B artists who would rather regurgitate old beats and bad cliches than create original music.  When you get the CD, definitely listen to Let's Get Lifted, it's so joyous and uplifting.  After that, make sure to checkout Alright, Let's Get Lifted Again, So High and of course both of the singles.  I really wanted to give this album 5 stars, but I can NOT STAND Number One with Kanye.  It doesn't fit the rest of the album at all!!  Skip it and spare yourself if at all possible.  But, the rest of the album more than makes up for that song, so what are you waiting for???!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I recently had the privilege of waching \\"Fight Club\\" and I must say, it was a very enthralling cognition for me. I found the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt to be nothing less than what I anticipated they would be: outstanding. My favorite scene was the one where Norton beats up himself in order to make his boss give him paychecks without working. If you like movies that will mess with your mind, then I recommend you check out \\"Fight Club.\\"
6304466498|5.0|I have watched this movie from begining to end so many times that I have lost count! As a clear spoof of all things sci-fi, Spaceballs goes all the way with the references to all the most popular science movies like Star Wars, Star Trek and even Alien.  It's technical crew included many of the greats who worked on the original movies that it spoofs.  The story is about Lone Starr and his friend Barf who is a half-man, half dog. (He's his \\"own best friend\\".) They are on a quest to rescue a runaway spoiled Druish princess who has come too close to the Spaceballs who are trying to steal the pure air from her home planet, Druidia.  It is a great story that stands all on it's own without leaning too heavily on the movies that are beinging spoofed.
1400049628|5.0|I thought it was really entertaining to read.  I am a big zombie fan, especially of Resident Evil, and a guide on how to fight the zombie horde is a pretty good idea.  I also enjoy the fact it was written by Mel Brooks's son, who has shown to me he is full of the same humor in his dad.  I also enjoy the fact that he named the virus after a potato vine, I got a kick out of that.
068484267X|5.0|A quite breathtaking read, I couldn't put down. Its hard to believe the harsh reality of life and poverty that gripped Ireland not that long ago. I had to keep reminding myself that this wasn't fiction but a true account of McCourts early life. Well written with humour and surprisingly no bitterness. A must read for anyone who thinks their lot in life isn't so good.
B0000X61UU|5.0|i started using this tape when i was in highschool and the results are amazing. this is the period when most of us girls wanna lose our \\"babyfat\\" and this workout not only does that but it energizes you and really tones your body. i admit that this workout looks easy at first but when you actually do it you'll really feel your whole body being worked to the max!! i hear alot of bad review about this tape being unsafe and dangerous to your body parts but like any exercise you do if you don't do it properly or you exceed your physical capabilites than you'll get injured just the same. trust me it's not her moves you just have to do it right! bottom line i highly recommend this for anyone looking to lose weight and keeping it off, toning problem areas or just to be in shape. i am now in my last year of college and recently bought the dvd version of the next challenge because i love it that much! trust me just turn the tv down and put your own  music on once you know whats coming up and you won't get tired of it.  it's one of the few workouts out there that really challenge you everytime you do it.  Just try it you'll love it!!
B000929AJQ|3.0|If  you like Nine Inch Nails then you will probably like this album.  I like this album, BUT I'd like  for Trent to show me something different, something new, something a bit more challenging.  I don't know, maybe it's time for him to do an acoustic album and then he can concentrate on better songwriting.  It just seems like I've heard this all before and before it was just a little bit better.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I have been a fan of NIN from the very beginning having bought most of their material. <br /> <br />With Teeth is a potent, and unbelievably amazing work.  It incorporates everything from all of the other efforts, the maturity of everything that has come before and comes full circle and presents us with the essence of what NIN is, and it is completely new and fresh, not trying to copy or re-create the old. <br /> <br />This is an amazing realization of someone (Trent) who really gives a damn about every single nuance of his music and his work and there are very few artists left who do. <br /> <br />This is pure undistilled creativity in it's most concentrated form.  For a person to pour his soul out and give us something this concentrated and so real, it's amazing we are able to have a copy of this for under $15 dollars.  There is not much in the world today that is real anymore.  This is.  Thank you Trent for staying true to yourself, With Teeth is incredible!
B0000027I6|5.0|'Amsused To death\\" is easily Waters' best solo stuff to date. In this effort Waters takes his rage out on actions surrounding  the Persian Gulf War(1)and the politics that go along with capitalist society. Jeff Beck is recruited for certain spots and delivers astounding solos and guitar work. His presense give Waters'sometimes lifeless grooves the heat they need. Waters hits his mark in his lyrics that range from the hypocracy surrounding the Persian Gulf War (1) to the ultimatly evil dogma of capitalism. The ever changing professional lineup of the Bleeding Hearts Band delivers the music with perfection, but the real story here is Waters' poignant lyrics and his simple yet effective melodies. They all work together just as this effort from the veteran artist works. Roger Waters manages to focus his anger to a white hot laser of contempt for the powers that be and melds it with a cohesive set of melody themes and spry musicianship. It all comes together here Waters'fans. \\"Amused to Death\\"  is easily his best effort to date. To date, that is. I can't imagin what he's working on with all that's happening in the world to date SINCE \\"Amused to Death\\".
B000929AJQ|5.0|This album sounds like Broken with some Pretty Hate Machine whipped into it with some Fragile frosting on the top and let me tell you, I'm going to be getting fat off of this. Trent has concieved and produced one of the most complete feeling NIN albums ever. I'm so glad to hear that Trent has decided to stop worrying about what other people think and just make the best music he can. I strongly support your choice because it has birthed wonderful music. Haunting, melodic, and viseral are some words I can use to describe this album. With Teeth has been a great venture that I'm sure will be a hit with everyone who takes the time to sit down and really listen to it. Congratulations to Trent on a job well done this album is just what I was hoping for. Every song on this CD has something to offer, everytime I hear it I find more and more that I love about it. If you have been a NIN fan you will remain a NIN fan, unfortunaly if you never really liked NIN to begin with this album probably won't sway anybody.
0345350499|4.0|I really, really liked the style this book was written in.  The method.  And the words she uses.  It is very beautifully written in that way.  But...where it falls short is on characters and the whole femmenazi theme.  It's like you read it, and you love it, but then it's just like, something's missing.  I think it's the characters.  Like Morgaine.  She's supposed to be the heroine of the novel...but a lot of times she is unlikable.  Not that I'm against that...it's just that at certain times she's a little too unlikable.  The worst thing about her is that she was in love with Lancelot for NO reason.  I think that's the worst thing about it.  She's supposed to be smart, powerful, all that...but she loves this dude who's basically just a pretty boy with a vacant head.  It didn't make any sense to me.  Then there's Guinevere who is such a simp.  A couple of times she almost borders on cool...but no...she's just an idiot.  Arthur is ineffectual and does stuff just because he wants to make Guinevere happy...which is totally unbelieveable.  He's a waffler.  Mordred is a cool villain...but Bradley doesn't do enough with him.  He disappears from the story too much and for too long.<br /><br />  Then there's the whole feminism aspect.  It's a good idea.  But it is just overdone.  It gets preachy almost.  And it has that tone of favoring women to the point that men become just idiots or bad guys or boring.  Like, women good men bad.  That sort of thing.<br /><br />  Also the whole bashing Christianity thing is overdone, simplistic and idiotic at times.  You can write about being Pagan and loving the 'goddess' or whatever without resorting to calling Christians a bunch of morons.<br /><br />  Overall it is beautiful...but it just falls short of being a story you can actually fall in love with.  Which is sad.  I'd still recommend it though.  It's totally worth reading, and it's a good way to get interested in the Authurian legend.
0898705525|5.0|When I bought this book I thought it would be dry and I was kind of agonizing over reading it.  But by the time I finished the first page I was hooked in and I read it all in one night.  To say I loved it would be an understatement.  This is my favorite book of non fiction and it may be my favorite book overall...maybe a tie hehe.  I've never laughed so much when I read a book in my life.  His style was invigorating.  The little stories he uses for examples are entertaining and so insightful.  And his logic is just nonpareil.  Logic is a sorely missed art in these modern days.  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  I am Catholic myself, but non Catholics or non Christians, anyone could love this book.  Even though he talks about some writers I'm not really familiar with, you get the hang of what he's getting at quickly.  The way he talks about fairy tales especially caught my attention and really made me think.  And I've thought so many times about his statement about how people have made the world small...it just gets deeper and deeper.  This is a masterwork and must, must, MUST read.  I'm looking forward to reading it again and again.
B00008EY65|4.0|Commissioned by the Nazis, a bald Rasputin conducts a ritual in 1944 to summon a Daemon God into the world of mortals, but too much goes awry during the invocation due to the meddling of a Professor Bloom, yet the portal was open for far too long and a baby demon comes through, which is subsequelty raised by Bloom to become the unlikely crime-fighting, cigar-smoking, weight-lifting hero known as \\"Hellboy\\" {Ron Perlman}, who now must face the hell-hound-like denizens of the infernal regions. This character is added to the ungateful lot the likes of Nick Knight, Blade, and Dracula's son from Castlevania, who deny their origins and are at odds with their own natural darksides. Hellboy becomes the 'muscle' for a parapsycholical organization named \\"The Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense\\", aided by a clairvoyant humanoid amphibian {\\"Abe Sapien\\"} and X-Files-like agents. He actually files his magnificent black horns resembling Lord Darkness' from Legend, down into ugly stumps that end up looking like goggles, in order to fit in with the group.<br /><br />While the BPRD attempt to contain the firey talents of a Delia-like character named 'Liz' {Selma Blair}, who herself is quite a pyromantic hellion, she and Hellboy become mutually infatuated {despite the ingracious amorous advances of a fellow agent of Hellboy's}, which seems a perfect match, considering Hellboy happens to be inflammable, making for a very romantic spectacle when they embrace within a plume of blue flame.<br /><br />Rasputin was drawn into the portal, and with the help of a striking Russian female cohort, and an impressive zombie-like character in a Nazi uniform wielding a blade in each hand, returns empowered as an anthropomorphic synthesis of Sammael, with the aid of the 'children of Nergal', to prepare the path for the nefarious inheretors of the planet.  In a marvellous concluding scene, one gets to briefly see Hellboy in his potentially demonic splendor, inclusive of a crown of fire, before confronting Behemoth, a magnificent Cthulhuilike creature. Seems like 'somebody' has been selecting choice Infernal Names from The Satanic Bible!<br /><br />The aesthetics are enjoyable, the plot intriguing, and the characters remarkable, although the Demoralization Process is present, but can be overlooked for the film's better qualities.e confronting Behemoth, a magnificent Cthulhuilike creature.

B000929AJQ|3.0|Trent Reznor has a relationship issue with God and people. It's a theme we've heard time and again on nealy every album he's put out. He's always being put down, losing his identity and personality. These ideas have been express in his violent and brilliant \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and with more intamcy on \\"The Fragile\\". This time he puts out less of a concept album and puts out a more commercially accessable album. Gone are the fillers (as some people call his instumentals which is insulting) and also some of his insight. Musically it lacks the intensity that his previous efforts have had.

B000002L99|4.0|In 1985, when singer David Lee Roth left Van Halen and was replaced by veteran rocker Sammy Hagar, the rock world wondered whether or not the mighty VH could survive. Although the Sammy Hagar era of Van Halen sold less than the Roth era (it is a common fallacy to state that the Sammy Hagar era was more successful) they still turned out four number one albums and achieved multi platinum success over the next 11 years.<br /><br />\\"5150\\" is the first of the four albums Sammy Hagar made with Van Halen. Although I am fond of this album, I don't like it as much as other VH fans. For starters, the album sounds really dated. This would be partially fixed if the CD were remastered. If there was ever an album that needed remastering, \\"5150\\" is it. The quality of the recording is fair. To me, it sounds really dull. The Roth-era CDs sound much better with the remastering, and so would \\"5150.\\"<br /><br />\\"5150\\" relies too heavily on synth pop. I like Van Halen best when they stick to good old rock n' roll. Van Hagar did start to come into their own and rock harder later in their career (with \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" and \\"Balance), but in the mid-to-late 80s it was all about keyboards, keyboards, keyboards.<br /><br />I also hate Alex Van Halen's electric drum kit. The album would have sounded much better if he had played on a real one.<br /><br />That said, there is plenty to like about \\"5150.\\" It still contains some of their finest songs, like the hard-rocking \\"Good Enough\\" and \\"Get Up,\\" the lush \\"Dreams\\" (one keyboard song would have been fine), the infectious \\"Best of Both Worlds, and \\"5150\\" and the stunning \\"Love Walks In.\\"<br /><br />There are other songs that I am less enthusiastic about. I never really cared much for \\"Summer Nights\\" even though that is a fan favorite. I feel it never gets off the ground and just sort of bores me. It's not bad, but I just don't think it's all that great. And then there is the matter of \\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\" Although this is also a fan favorite and one of Van Halen's all-time biggest hits, I absolutely cannot stand it. I think it's a steaming pile of dog crap. It sounds like something Tiffany would do. The closing song, \\"Inside\\" is unnecessary filler.<br /><br />One thing \\"5150\\" has going for it is the band sounds fresh, and hungry, almost reborn.

0743201140|4.0|The message that the author tries to convey is that people make the mistake of becoming so preoccupied with overcoming their weaknesses that they spend too little time focusing on their strengths. There is much more room for growth where we are strong instead of areas where we are weak so he argues. He goes on to explain that we should just learn to manage our weaknesses just enough and concentrate on our strengths.<br /><br />This is a hard concept for me to wrap my head around. Growing up Mom and Dad always said things like \\"you can do anything you want if you just put your mind to it\\" or \\"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again\\"  and that sort of thing. The idea that you just not waste your time on an area that youre having problems with seems so backwards. Frankly I like making major accomplishments in areas I'm weak, it makes me feel more comfortable about my job performance.<br /><br />The book also has a test you can take online that will tell you your strengths. Frankly I didn't put much faith into this. I thought it would be sort of like a psychic reading where the results were either so vague that they could apply to anyone or offer a personality description so pleasant that most people would naturally want to say it applies to them, so I took the test with much suspicion.<br /><br />The results were surprisingly accurate, one of the themes it associated with me was input. People strong in input love information and love to archive information. This is pretty darn accurate, I love to read anything non-fiction, I love information  and especially statistics. The other themes seemed to fairly describe me well also. I was impressed<br /><br />Overall this is a good book that tries to explain how to capitalize on your strenghts to make you more productive at work and home. It's not going to change my life but it certainly provided plenty of food for thought.
B000051Y0G|3.0|Most of the reason for my recent interest in Cyndi Lauper's 1984 debut album \\"She's So Unusual\\" was due to the participation of two musicians on this album - Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman.   Two years later, Bazilian and Hyman would go on to start their own band, \\"The Hooters\\".  However on \\"She's So Unusual\\" the duo would an integral part of Lauper's supporting band. Hyman would also co-write Lauper's #1 single from the album, \\"Time After Time\\".  Bazilian even uses his trademark \\"hooter\\" on several tracks.   This debut effort by Lauper was probably her most commercially successful album.   However, when I \\"peel the onion\\" with this effort, I fail to see where this was a great album.  This may be a good album, but it isn't a great one.   Yes there are some good material on this album, but there is also a lot of so-so and disappointing material.   This may explain why subsequent album sales never approached this debut album. <br /> <br />For the most part, outside songwriters are going to contribute the songwriting for this album.    Cyndi did co-write four of the songs - but on each of those songs, Lauper collaborates with an outside songwriter.   As for the good songs and the not so good songs on this album, both the Lauper written songs and the outside written songs fall on both sides of the fence.  So in other-words, the good songs are a mix of Lauper and non-Lauper material. <br /> <br />I think much of the springboard for this album was due to the debut single, \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\".   This is the song that launched Lauper's career.  Surprisingly, while this was became an anthem for the female generation, this song was written by a male - Robert Hazard.  From a musicianship and songwriting standpoint, this isn't a great song.   However, this is a song that was tailor-made for Lauper's bubbly personality - and tailor-made for MTV.  It also is a catchy song, and the result was a #2 single on the charts.     <br /> <br />The follow-up to \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\" is a different story.   \\"Time After Time\\" is the song co-written by Lauper and  Rob Hyman.   While Lauper demonstrated her bubbly personality on \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\", she shows a serious side on \\"Time After Time\\".   This is a powerful ballad - and this is one of the instances where Lauper does show a lot of promise.   Lauper's vocals are right on the money here.  On many of her other slower songs, Lauper's voice seems forced and synthetic. Not the case here - she shows great vocal ranges.  This song also featured some terrific background vocals - the result is that Cyndi Lauper was rewarded with a #1 single on the charts.  <br /> <br />The third single was \\"She Bop\\".  This also is a song co-written by Cyndi Lauper.  On this song, Cyndi goes back to an up tempo song - but there almost is a darker overtone to this song.   The lyrics to this song aren't anything special, but I happen to think from an instrumentation standpoint, this song is pretty good.   While this is definitely a synth-pop song, the instruments that are going to shine on this song are the the Bass Guitar and the percussion/drums.   Like \\"Time After Time\\", Lauper shows good vocal range - not doing anything forced or synthetic.  This song went to #3 on the charts <br /> <br />When Cyndi's fourth single, \\"All Through the Night\\" came out - she had now emerged as a pop superstar.  While I don't think this song is as good as \\"Time After Time\\" or \\"She Bop\\", this song isn't bad.   This song was written by Jules Shear.   The mantra-like chorus combined with some intricate keyboards make give this song a feel for those insomniacs that can't sleep.  I've heard this song played on late night talk radio shows around commercial breaks.  This song went to #5 on the charts. <br /> <br />There was a fifth single released - \\"Money Changes Everything\\".   While there is some good instrumentation, I felt this was an overrated.   I didn't care for Lauper's vocals at all on this song - in fact at times itmade it hard to make out the words.   This song was written by Tom Gray and basically is a narrative sung by Lauper.  The title of the song describes the song - how money changes people.   To me, this song never really caught on with me.   This song didn't chart in the Top 10 either. <br /> <br />As for the other songs, the one strong song is \\"When You Were Mine\\".   This was a song that was written by Prince.  Considering Prince was at the height of his popularity in 1984, I was surprised this wasn't released as a single.   Although I don't think Lauper's vocals are great on this track, she is helped out by some outstanding background vocals.   The other songs really didn't impress me.   \\"Witness\\" and \\"I'll Kiss You\\", while they have their moments - they aren't going to make me do handstands.   The final track is actually a segue between two songs \\"He's So Unusual\\" and \\"Yeah Yeah\\".  \\"He's So Unusual\\" is a 1929 song.   Lauper sings it in a Shirley Temple style and I found that it got on my nerves.   That song is about 1 minute long, but then segues into \\"Yeah Yeah\\".   \\"Yeah Yeah\\" has a \\"party-like\\" theme to it - and it is a better song.  It was actually co-written by Hollies member Michael Rickfors.  <br /> <br />The remastered edition of \\"She's So Unusual\\" includes three live cuts of \\"Money Changes Everything\\", \\"She Bop\\", and \\"All Through the Night\\".   The liner notes include all of the lyrics, songwriting credits, and musician credits (although I would have liked to have seen musicians credited on a song by song basis).  Overall, I think this album got a lot of hype.  While it does have its moments, I wouldn't classify it as an all-time great.  Still, it may be worth checking out.

B0006IIKS0|5.0|This is a great Documentary. I was listening to Metallica before they had any radio or video play, a lot of my questions of how they endured all this time were answered by watching. An inside look at how the songs come together and how friendships and a certain brotherhood stand tall through some difficult times. Anyone that is alive has certainly gone through the dilemmas that the band faced and can relate, it's cool to see they have to deal with it too, it makes me appreciate their music even more. I have been into Metallica for almost as long as they've existed, I was listening to them before they were \\"mainstream cool\\", I'm still jammin to them even though theres a lot of folks that think they've sold out, I'm certain they've come this far because of talent, endurance and motivation, all clearly shown on this DVD. Buy It!
B000929AJQ|5.0|The first time I skimmed through With Teeth I was a little disappointed.  The only songs that immediately grabbed me were Every Day Is Exactly The Same, Sunspots, and The Line Begins To Blur.  After listening to the album several times I am now addicted.  This album is head and shoulders above The Fragile, and not too far below The Downward Spiral.  There are several songs I think I'll be listening to for a while. <br /> <br />The last two minutes of All The Love In the World are alone worth the album for me.  You Know What You Are? is a good hard hitting track.  Every Day Is Exactly The Same, Sunspots, and The Line Begins To Blur are all as good as anything Reznor has done.  Beside You In Time is a great song to listen to alone with headphones on.  <br /> <br />For all you long time NIN fans disappointed you didn't get Downward Spiral II - I know how you feel.  I was hoping for that too, and this album is not it.  It is way too slow and emotional.  But give With Teeth a chance.  It takes a few spins to really sink in, and when it does I think you'll fall for it.
B0002858YS|5.0|I literally haven't been this excited about a band since The Strokes \\"Is This It\\" album came into my life 3 years ago. The Killers have created one of the best albums I've ever heard. Every song is amazing (Some standout tracks: Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, Mr. Brightside, Smile Like You Mean It, and All The Things I've Done) and very fun to sing along to. If you don't have this album yet, GET IT.
B0006399FS|5.0|\\"Uno, Dose, Tress, Catorsay\\" and we're off into one of the all time greatest albums ever made. Opening with the lead single, 'Vertigo' the hardest rocker and fastest song on the album. This albums Elevation if you will. The Edge plays one of his all time best guitar riffs on this track. 'Miricle Drug' is next with it's awesome lyrics and vocals by Bono, and amazing drumming by Larry. The Chorus is one of Bono's best about giving up all the romance in the world just to find a cure for the diseases that are killing millions in Africa. Truly one of the best songs U2 ever wrote. 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' maybe the best song U2 ever recorded. Easily Bono's most personal and beautiful lyrics, about the morning he fells toward the death of the father he barley knew. Bono's vocals sound amazing here and The Edges signature guitar playing comes through loud and clear. The slide Edge plays on this track is out of this world! If you dont believe me just listen to this song and tell me it's not the very best song that U2 ever recorded. Next is a song that is almost reminicent of RADDLE AND HUM, 'Love And Peace Or Else' has an amlost rock a belly feel to it, great guitar and great feel. Not the best lyrics bu still a very good rock song. Next is my favorite song on the album and probley my second favorite U2 song behind Where The Streets Have No Name. 'City Of Blinding Lights' is classic U2, killer delayed guitar playing, out of this world vocals, easy drum beat, and a fat bass line. This song is so perfect that I dont even know where to start, From the skin chilling verses, and chorus, to the perfectly complamenting piano line, this song is perfect ladies and gentlemen, buy the album for this song alone! Rock a Belly once again with 'All Because Of You' a harder edged song, with cool lyrics and just a great rock feel to it. To me it sounds nothing like any other U2 song. This was released as the second single but went nowhere because no one played it and I dont see why because it's a really cool song. 'A Man And A Woman' is a beautiful love song about Bono and his wife, and yet at the same time it's not, it has two meanings and its a really cool song, especially when Bonon sings \\"Little Sister.\\" 'Crumbs from Your Table' is a good song but nothing too special to talk about other then it's really cool title. 'One Step Closer' is a slower song, that I dont really care for, but I'm sure someone might like it. 'Original Of The Species' is a really cool song with really great lyrics, this is one of my favorite songs on the album, and the production on this track is just plain amazing! 'Yahweh' is a instrumental and a pretty good one at that. I always said the one band that should never make a insrtumental is U2, but this one is great and an awesome way to end the album.<br /><br />How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb was U2's first album since the classic All That You CAn't Leave Behind, and this is so much better then that album. Bono's lyrics are far more personal and meaningful, The Edge's guitar playing has more feeling and versitility to it, Larry's drums are more prominant, and Adams bass is better then it has ever been! As I said before How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is one of the best albums ever made and quite possiabley the best album U2 ever recorded and yes I think it's even better then the Joshua Tree.see why because it's a really cool song.

B000002I4W|5.0|Although Ornette Coleman had already made two albums for the Contemporary Jazz label, it was his 1959 debut for Atlantic Records, \\"The Shape Of Jazz To Come\\" that thrusted the young alto saxophonist into the limelight.<br />Coleman's piano-less quartet was unique for its time and his approach to structure and improvisation was quite controversial amongst jazz critics and musicians alike. Despite all the differences of opinion, \\"Shape..\\" is actually quite a melodic album full of catchy hooks amongst the free improvisations and it's easy to see why the album is still such a milestone 46 years later.<br />The haunting \\"Lonely Woman\\" and the upbeat \\"Congeniality\\" are Coleman staples while the ballad \\"Peace\\" features one of Coleman's most beautiful and lyrical melodies ever written. \\"Focus on Sanity\\", another staple, shows off the versitility of Coleman's quartet with each member taking turns as soloist one after the other. \\"Eventually\\" is a fast-paced frentic piece with some wild improvisation from Coleman and trumpeter Don Cherry and offers a sign of things to come on future Coleman albums while the closing piece \\"Chronology\\" is a upbeat catchy tune with a melody that sticks in the brain long after its over.<br />Like other reviewers have mentioned, \\"The Shape Of Jazz To Come\\" is perfectly in line with the other 1959 jazz classics such as John Coltrane's \\"Giant Steps\\", Dave Brubeck's \\"Time Out\\" and Miles Davis's \\"Kind of Blue\\". The music on this album is still as fresh as it when it was first released and it will never fully grow old.<br />Applause must be given to Ornette Coleman, Charlie Haden and the late Billy Higgins and Don Cherry for creating such a monumental masterpiece.<br />Truly, this was The Shape Of Jazz To Come!!
B0008ISM40|5.0|I was a little concerned at first when i heard \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", and i thought that the album was going to not be so good, but when i listened to it...  I discovered that this album is indeed a great album.  Great songs, and great lyrics.  There are many different kinds of songs on this cd.  \\"Only\\" sounds like it was meant to be on Pretty Hate Machine.   <br />If you really like Nine Inch Nails, you will like this album... Because it's awesome, so go get it.
B0008ISM40|3.0|I remember back in 1999 when I bought The Fragile. I must have listened to that CD so many times in the months that followed. The whole album seemed to flow beautifully together. When I heard that Reznor's new CD, With Teeth, was coming out in May, I was really excited. I thought that the single \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" was ok, but I felt that it was a song made for the radio and not indicative of the true nature of the whole album. I was wrong, and dissapointed.  <br /> <br />First, let me say that I do enjoy most of the album. There are many good songs and interesting themes.  <br /> <br />The whole album lacks the flow of Fragile. Songs just seem to either statically dissapate and merge into each other, or clash. \\"Only\\" seems to just start right off. It just doesn't seem to mesh. <br /> <br />As for sound, I heard alot of samples from Reznor's previous work. I want new sounds!  <br /> <br />If you are new to NIN, I would recommend \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"Fragile\\" over this album. If you like NIN's earlier CD \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", you might find this album to be similar. <br /> <br />Overall I was dissapointed. I wanted to hear a mix of heavy and atmospheric sound. What happened to songs in the style of \\"The Great Below\\" or \\"La Mer\\"?
B00067ZONA|3.0|Why the remastering? What happened to the Definitive edition Remasters (DER)? Did someone decide they werent so \\"definitive\\"? <br />Tracks remixed by Nick Davis definatly sound different but not true to the original mix. The tracks from self titled Genesis album sounds as if the volume was maxed out to give the impression that it was remastered but as far as I can tell still sounds like the first cd version released may years ago. <br /> <br />Great songs but if your a genesis fan you probably have most of these songs to begin with and the DER are easy to find and sound wonderfull.
B0000JCFPE|1.0|This movie reminds me of something that happened to me when I was 10 years old (1979).  My stepmother (at the time) said that we (me, my Dad, her, and my two stepbrothers) HAD to go see this movie that was coming out, and we HAVE to see it the VERY FIRST weekend that it comes out.  Well, we waited for over an hour (in line) to get the tickets.  As it turned out, it was so crowded in the theater that we couldn't even sit all together.  I sat by myself, while my Dad sat with one of my stepbrothers and my stepmother sat with the other.  Well, all the hype about the movie turned out to be just that:  HYPE.  As we were filing out like cattle, I heard more than one negative comment about the film, and, if I remember correctly, I believe this particular movie was gone from theaters in just over 2 months.  The name of the movie???--METEOR.  Never heard of it?  Well, there were no crotch shots, or any nudity or icepick murders, but had there been, the movie still would have sucked.
B000003TAW|1.0|I am outraged by the behavior of the fans of the band Weezer. Recently I attended a coffee shop located on a street corner where all sorts of strangely dressed people congregate. One group in particular dressed up in costumes that made them look like 60's mod-rockers. Mod-rockers were from the 60's and wore furry parkas, gangster hats, rode mini-motorcyles called Vespas, and did a drug called speed I think. (And before you blast me for knowing stupid 60's trivia, it's only because my dad made me watch that Quadrophenea movie about The Who. I HATE the 60's). From what I gather about the mod-rockers is that they only are only supposed to listen to The Who and other groups like that. But not these guys outside the coffee shop. These guys had a little cd player, and what were they blasting? You guessed it...Weezer.  <br />While I don't know a lot about Weezer, I know that they do not play \\"mod-rock\\" or anything like that. Imagine a gothic listening to 50's be-bop music, or a disco dancer listening to hip-hop. Now you can imagine how ridiculous it was to see 60's-style mods listening to this motorcyle rock in front of a coffee shop. Sort of like if you saw a guy in a hockey costume trying to play basketball. It just doesn't work.  <br /> <br />At first I ignored it, but after a while it really started to grate on my nerves. So first I just walked over by them and lightly hummed the song \\"Teenage Wasteland\\" by The Who, to see if it triggered any kind of response from them. Of course it didn't. When I couldn't stand it anymore I actually flat out turned their radio off. I took my harmonica out of my inside pocket. I played a really loud rendition of The Who's \\"My Generation\\" to show them what they should be listening to. They got pretty riled up and made snide remarks at me and all laughed as I walked away stunned. They tried to start an argument with me, but it just wasn't fair since there were five of them and only one of me. (ironically \\"5 on 1\\" is a song by The Doors)I went inside the shop to think of a new approach, and as soon as I turned my back the Weezer came back on.  <br /> <br />Now as you might know, I like to consider myself a little bit of a renegade vigilante, so there was no WAY these guys were going to get away with this. I was simply trying to point out their cultural error through song. And NO ONE laughs at Howard Tuttleman unless it was last year doing a stand-up routine at my uncle's barbecue. I purchased the largest coffee that was offered. I walked back over to them, and proceeded to pour the ENTIRE THING all over their motorcyles. The tallest one (who was obviously the ringleader) threw me against a bench by my shirt and tried to choke me to death. Someone must have pulled him off me because I was free after about 20 seconds. Then someone flung a hot coffee at ME. I tried to get up but I couldn't see with all the coffee in my eyes. Then, hot coffee started splashing me from all directions. You have absolutely no idea what this feels like. I mean, it wasn't hot enough to burn me seriously, but the humiliation factor alone was tremendous as well.  <br /> <br />I had no idea what to do. I contemplated calling some friends of mine that are gothics, but this city didn't need any more gang warfare. I seriously considered calling 9-1-1, but jail would be too good for these guys. I also thought about suing them, or trying to get them banned for life from the coffee shop, or even the city. But I just had to get out of there to collect my thoughts.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, you can now see that I have good reasons to hate Weezer. Please do not support them or even any motorcycle rock in general. These guys's actions were not justified and it makes me sick. I also hate mod-rockers, motorcyles and even coffee now. Please help me figure out how to get my revenge. My current idea involves playing my harmonica through a mega-horn at them from the roof of the coffe shop, and maybe borrowing my mom's coffee pot to launchhot coffee at them from up there. I am desperate for ideas. There was a Weezer concert at the State Theater in Detroit last night, and I circled around it to try to find the perpatrators to no avail. I did give a small, legal, NON-violent protest outside the venue though with my Morris (my dog). I made a few anti-Weezer and anti-motorcyle signs and played some improv-protest songs on my harmonica. Please help if you can. Later. <br /> <br />howardtuttleman.com
B0007XT87G|4.0|PT arrives back on the scene three years after \\"In Absentia\\" with a less powerful, but more cohesive album. Drifting progressively further from their psychedelic rock roots towards prog-metal god-dom, this album does not disappoint, but, alas, does not shine through as their finest work. I wonder if, since they're now signed to a major, and album sales have been improving, they're not under any label pressure to aim for dominating the niche sales of prog-metal. Certainly the replacement of their former drummer (Lightbulb Sun was his last album) with Gavin Harrison has taken them a heavier direction. Speaking of Mr. Harrison, the drumming on this album was its major low point. The remake of Shesmovedon loses a lot of its former flow due to the abruptness and aggressiveness of his style. Steve Wilson is in top form on the whole album, writing songs with a keen eye for feeling. <br /> <br />Album high points include: <br />\\"Halo\\" Colin Edwin's one shining moment on the album. I missed having his subtle feel for groove on every song, but he was here on this one. Great vocals and lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" <br />I love Richard Barbieri's programming and synth work. Another sorely missed element of this album, though on this track, he shines. Everything he does is in the background, but without it, the song would be so much less. Brilliance. <br /> <br />Other good moments: <br />\\"Open Car\\" \\"Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here)\\" \\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\" <br /> <br />All in all, a great album. Unfortunately, when you're talking about PT albums, the bar is set so high by their mid-career work (\\"Signify\\" thru \\"In Absentia\\") it's hard to follow up all those albums with more of the same. I hope that on future releases they will regress a little bit back to their psych-rock roots.
B00005ASHM|1.0|Ok, now this is the 3rd of a trilogy of reviews I'm doing as a birthday present for my dad. The first was Sargent Pepper, the second was Blonde on Blonde, and now this Beach Boys record. Click on the part at the top of this review that says \\"See all MY Reviews\\" to read the entire trilogy. Once again, I am going to apologize to all the fans of my reviews because I'm only reviewing these old records for my dad. He thinks it will be some kind of bonding for me to listen to stuff he likes. Iv'e made it through 2 so far. This is NOT easy, and I probably won't do this again. He better appreciate this. I could be reviewing things that I like and actually enjoying myself. Ok, let's get this over with.  <br /> <br />Ok, I'm looking at the cover...it's green. It says \\"Beach Boys\\"....and it's called.....Pet Sounds!? What...what the........the Heck is \\"Pet Sounds\\"? Oh god, why me? You would not believe how stupid this looks. The Beach Boys (who are no where NEAR any water by the way) are petting some animals on what appears to be a farm. They look soooooo dumb. One of them has this really stupid beard and everything too. What IS this? Animal sound effects? Like cows and horses and crap? Forget it. I'm not doing this. Dad, I tried, I really did, but I don't want my fans to think I'm getting soft. And what if I got caught listening to it by someone at our house? I would be embarrassed even if Morris saw this and he's a dog. Actually I'm just going to put the record in Morris' mouth and he can do the review. He seems to like it.  <br /> <br />Ok dad, I really wasn't trying to hurt your feelings with my trilogy of reviews of your favorite records, but the people that read me expect me to be honest and to the point. It's not worth it to fake a good review of this stuff when my reputation is on the line. In the long run, they will be the ones putting food on the table when I go pro and finally get to move out. Happy Birthday. Oh, and to you guys out there, I apologize yet again. TheREAL reviews will resume ASAP. Later. <br /> <br />howardtuttleman.com
B0007P3582|1.0|There are many well stated facts about this CD already posted, so I will try and make mine quick...well friends...overall...this CD...just stinks!  I know sophomore albums normally are fabricated malarkey but for real, this one is a hot mess.  I will say he is a very smart business man who steals the ideas of others and attempts to make it his, while dissing those who are the true originator of the form.  The entire album is nothing but weak insults directed at folks who respect Ja Rule and had nothing to do with the beef he instigated and if its not focusing on those folks, then its focusing on his street cred, which is nonexistent at this point cause his home is no where near no ruff side of town.    This whole album is talking about nothing but licking and guns and to be honest, being an attractive grown woman.  Men that talk so much tend to be lacking in the areas they  are focusing on...kinda like the short man syndrome who drives the oversized truck and some little man comes out.    I know he will go down in the \\"Hall of Rap Legends\\" because of his debut album sales, but he will not be remembered as a creator...a lyrist, a Tupac, a Biggie, and I merely add those names because that is what most aspire to become.     Overall the CD is conceit, he looks like a monkey, and he is copying the style of  Ja and his crew! He is a poser...he is a wankster!    Save your change and buy something that your sound system would love to playback for you.
B000002UAU|2.0|Now I hope that you can agree with me that it's not really enjoyable to hear people talk about times before you were born, or have them play cds from their younger days, because it's impossible for us to relate to that stuff. Now me, I have a dad that will try to no end to get me to listen to old stuff that he deems as \\"important\\" and \\"meant something\\" to him ages ago. What he doesn't seem to realize is that it's foolish for him when he tells me I \\"need to grow up\\", when HE is still stuck in the era of hippys and be-boppers. YOU need to grow up, dad. Anyways, dad found out that I am building up some momentum as a professional review writer, and HE thinks I need to review some of the \\"classics\\" to gain more credebility. He handed me 3 dusty old records and said \\"It would mean a lot to me if my son would listen to his father's three favorite albums\\". Now in the past my dad's records were something I sneak out of the sleeves when he's at work and play frisbee with Morris (my dog). But his birtday is next week so I figured that my present to him would be to review them. It's the least I can do considering he bought me a Volkswagen Cabrio for my birthday last year.  <br /> <br />These will not be your typical Tuttleman reviews, because since I simply cannot relate to the 50's and 60's and 70's, I have no personal experience to relate these to. Sorry guys, please bare with me. Ok, here it goes.  <br /> <br />I'm putting it on the record player right now. It says \\"mono\\" so this must be a pre-stereo artifact LOL. Ok...crowd noise....Hmmm. There is a guitar now that sounds like motorcycle rock. I thought the Beatles were before motorcycle rock. Maybe it was ahead of it's time or something. Ok, i'm looking at the packaging while it's playing now.....Oh My God! There's a cardboard sheet where you can cut things out and one of them is a MUSTACHE! That would look hilarious on my dog Morris. Maybe later. Next song is kind of like Hillbilly music because of the guys voice. YEEE-Haw! Ok, next song is like weird drug music. Next one....kind of motorcyle rock mixed with drug rock. Now sort of soft drug rock. Hmmmm... the cover doesn't even say \\"Beatles\\" anywhere on it. We'll have to change that right now....God, they look like such deranged, doped-up hippys it's not even funny. This must be after Lennon died. Why would my dad ever listen to this when he swears that he never did drugs? Ok, just got done with a sad Disney style song....Weird! the next song is like..Circus clown music.  <br /> <br />Alright, now I have to walk over and flip the record or whatever. What a dumb concept. Ok, now it's like uh...oriental music. This is taking forever. Ok, now what the heck is with this next one?! It's like a showtune or something, but with a really crappy horn! Whoever played the horn for the Beatles shoud have been thrown out of the band the second he pulled this crap. It sounds like he's killing the horn. Now it's an upbeat song with animal noises. Next, they play the first song over again (that's original). And the last one is like a slow song....no, now it's upbeat. Ok, at the end the symphony apparently got all doped up and had a swordfight with all of their instruments. Then there's a bonus track of noise that plays over, and over, and over, and over, until you can't take it anymore and throw the cardboard case at the record player like a frisbee.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, this record makes me even more glad I wasn't born in the 50's or 60's or 70's, or whatever. The best part about it ended up being the cardboard mustache cut-out which looks really funny on a dog, but you will need to use masking tape or something. The record also has just about every instrument ever on it, but unless I missed it, they STILL couldn't find room for a single harmonica. So there you have it: Pre-motorcycle-hillbilly-circus-clown-oriental-showtune-animal-noise-drugged-out-hippy-rock, I guess you could call it. Happy Birthday, hippy. Stay tuned for the next 2 parts of the trilogy if I can make it through without my brain dying. Later.  <br /> <br />howardtuttleman.com
B000002LIX|2.0|Ira Moon,<br /><br />The spanish spoken intro actually means \\"We have more influence over your children than you do, but we love them. From Los Angeles, Jane's Addiction\\", as it reads somewhere on the accompanying booklet.
0345440900|1.0|Tracy states in this book that formula is about the same good as breastmilk and makes women feel OK if they choose the first one over breastmilk. While I don't criticize anybody for their choices, I believe that a person who has some authority (as Tracy claims to have) should be more objective and give true information regarding that.  <br /> <br />Most of her philosophy, when it comes to scheduling and dealing with babies, stems from 4-hour-feeding with formula and has nothing to do with breastfed babies who are less predictable. After reading her book, I felt like my baby was somehow inferior because she wouldn't last typical 2.5-3 hours between feeds and Tracy said that any healthy and normal baby should be able to do so. Well, mine didn't, she wanted to nurse more often and I realized that my baby knows better. I fed her on demand after that and she has a very healthy eating habits now at 15 months. She didn't wean herself as most of \\"BabyWhisperer\\" babies at around age of 1 year. I believe that BW babies, when their breastfeeding sessions are scheduled consider breastfeeding strictly for the purpose of eating while \\"demand\\"-nursed babies see it also as a source of comfort, therefore are not ready to wean themselves. <br /> <br />Other methods described by Tracy never worked either with my baby. Pick up/put down method made her even more overstimulated and miserable.  <br /> <br />I don't like the term Accidental Parenting Tracy uses throughout her book. Most of people choose to sleep with their babies and rock them to sleep out of love and not because they are stupid and ingnorant. <br /> <br />I definitely don't recommend this book to new breastfeeding moms. It can create problems with milk supply as putting a new baby on schedule in first days will decrease instead of increase it. Also there is a risk of withdrawing food and comfort from your baby because you want to keep your schedule.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Lisen up kid by it trust me you will love it if you love Blink 182 music its older but it is REALLY good!
B000929AJQ|5.0|This one grows on you... take more than one listen, the last 2 tracks are superb, track one sets a great tone.<br /><br />Great NIN release.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Before I heard this album, I wasn't the biggest NIN fan, infact I had a copy of The Downward Spiral, which I listened to once before throwing it away, but when I heard that they were comming out with a new album, I thought I might give it a try. To be honest, I havn't been able to stop listening to it since I got it. It is by far the most brilliant album that has so far came out this year. Every song is very well crafted and the melodies in this album are really amazing.<BR>Trent starts the album with a haunting song called &quot;All The Love in the World&quot;, a song with such an amazing melodie, which he moves it into the next song &quot;You Know What You are&quot;, another truely amazing song, but not my favourite in the album. After that, &quot;The collector&quot; is next and is followed by their first single off this album &quot;The Hands that Feeds&quot;, which is another really catchy song with amazing lyrics. The next track would be &quot;Love is not Enough&quot; which is my friends favourite track in the album, and the next one &quot;Everyday is the Same&quot; would be my favourite in the album.This song is followed by another amazing piece of artwork called &quot;With Teeth&quot;, the title track from the album.The great tracks keep on coming on with &quot;Only&quot;, &quot;Getting Smaller&quot; and &quot;Sunspots&quot;.<BR>The last Three tracks, to me sound like 1 long track glued together:<BR>first one bieng &quot;The Line Begins to Blur&quot;, one of my favourite tracks in the album<BR>next one &quot;Beside You in Time&quot; to me sounds like an introduction to the next song, not much is going on in this song, but its really good.<BR>&quot;Right Where it Belongs&quot; is probably the most amazing piece of artwork in this album, This song and &quot;Everyday is exactly the same&quot; to me are in a tie for my favourite song spot. It is an absolute astonishing song that for some reason remind me of the Matrix's stoyline.<BR>This album as I said before isan amazing album. The lyrics are deep, meaningfull, at times very depressing and at other times very dark. Trent Reznor has either been through a lot of pain and confusion, or he's really good at faking it.<BR>Now that I've heard this album, I'm planing to go buy &quot;The Fragile&quot;. If you like this album, I would also recomand &quot;Version 2.0&quot; by Garbage.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I was so upset when I learned At the Drive In had broken up.  They were one of my favorite bands for years!  But after Deloused and now this wonderful piece of music, I can now safely say that maybe ATDI being put to rest was a good thing.  NO modern band even comes close to pushing music to the new levels that The Mars Volta is. <br /> <br />This album in particular is fantastic! Not some rehash of their prevous great album.  Frances the Mute has a heavier emphasis on guitar work that reminds me of classic 60's yet is still light years beyond.  This album still has long periods of distortion and total beat deconstruction, but like Deloused it really fits well and adds to the overall experience.  There is also the addition of some brass and other instruments to add texture.  Some of the brass segments remind me of classic acid jazz. <br /> <br />Though there is actually a radio single, The Widow, released off this album (I cringe having to say that) this album cannot be broken down into parts.  Like everything thus far from the Mars Volta, it is best listened to in it's entirety, beginning to end. <br /> <br />Sure, they seem pretty pretentious in some of their interviews but I can't think of any band that is as worthy of being pretentious as they are...  They are all about their music and their art and I am confident they will continue to do so for the rest of the time we are graced by the existence of this amazing and revolutionary band.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|A previous reviewer posted a review stating that there are basically two kinds of people who listen to Ryan Adams. Those who hate every note he plays and those who adore every little thing he does. I fall into the latter catergory. I can't help it. I think he has written some of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. I've heard everything that people claim he \\"steals\\" from, I grew up on it. I just happen to think he oftenly enough does a better job than the people he is supposedly always copying. <br />I ran to the store at midnight to pick up this album, I'm that huge of a fan. I immediately ran to the car and started listening to it instantly. I was actually quite shocked when the album failed to blow me away. I knew it would be more country like his earlier albums, which is fine by me, but this one didn't sound like those at all. <br />Where are the rocking out country tunes I'd learned to adore over the years? Where are the \\"To Be Young (Is To Be Sad, Is To Be High)\\", \\"Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart Tonight\\", or even \\"16 Days.\\" Where are the solo acoustic songs that make me remember why I adore music so much (like \\"Avenues\\", \\"Jacksonville Skyline\\", \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Oh My Sweet Carolina\\", or \\"My Winding Wheel\\" often have). <br />There certainly wasn't anything that made me want to cry because it was so beautiful. I get teary-eyed when I hear the end guitar solo of \\"The Shadowlands\\" because it sounds so perfect. <br />The way I am describing it, it sounds like I don't like this album. To be truthful, I didn't think too highly of it when I first heard it. But over the next couple days, it sucked me in. I listened to it while driving, which I've decided is the best way to hear this album.  <br />The big difference between this and some of his other albums, is that it is a complete ALBUM. It is something that needs to be listened to all the way through to be fully appreciated. It isn't an album that you would want to skip around tracks. Straight through is the only way to hear it. <br />As I've grown to know the songs better, I've enjoyed them a lot more. The real standouts for me are \\"Meadowlake Street\\", \\"When Will You Come Back Home\\", \\"How Do You Keep Love Alive\\", \\"Let it Ride\\", \\"Now That You're Gone\\" and \\"Cold Roses\\". I really enjoy the others, but these ones seem to standout in my mind more. <br />My biggest qualm with Ryan is that he seems to always want to put at least one song on an album that seems terribly out of place. \\"Shakedown on 9th Street\\" sounds like nothing else on \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Love is Hell\\" (the song)has no place on \\"Love is Hell\\" (the album). The honor goes to \\"Beautiful Sorta\\" for this album. It is a louder rocker in the 60's rocker vain. It just is the elephant in the room on the album. Why it is there I have no idea. <br />And also, somehow I feel like he needs to work on reducing his track numbers. His albums would be a lot tighter if he would just let some go. This album actually has no reason to be a double disc other than maybe he thought it would be cool. All these songs could fit onto a single disc.  <br />While I have problems with the album (I disagree with reviewers who state it is easily his best album, which just isn't true), I do highly enjoy the album. It is far and away better than most the crap coming out today, and I still adore Ryan Adams. Some wonderful songs are here, and you should definately take some time to listen to them. 4 stars.
B000001H00|5.0|Having heard these pieces a million times by various artists, I purchased the Milstein set. Upon receiving it, my wife suggested going straight to the center of the oreo cookie and listen to the chaconne from partita #2.<br /><br />After sitting quietly for 14 minutes in stunned silence listening to Milstein saw away at one of the most gorgeous sounding violins these ears have ever heard, we looked at each other and said absolutely nothing.<br />At that moment it was clear that we had witnessed something truly miraculous. Such  absolute control over this collosal work has rarely been heard. Most violinists struggle to move heaven and earth while negotiating the considerable difficulties involved but Milstein plays as though he's got technique to burn, like a Ferrari doing 25mph in a school zone.<br /><br />Since then, I've obviously heard the entire album and although I must admit it is not my favorite recording, it is by far one of the most powerful and moving accounts on disk. The reason it is not my favorite is because I prefer a smaller sound and less drama in my Bach, a personal preference that all may not share. Listening to Milstein play Bach, as opposed to say, Aaron Rosand, is like listening to Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra as opposed to say, Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music. Hearing Ormandy's ultra-lush, romantic sounding Bach or Handel is just plain wrong, I tell myself, yet it is a delightful indulgence comparable to eating a 16 ounce bar of my wife's finest swiss chocolate, a sin I've been guilty of.<br /><br />By the way, don't tell my wife I said that. She may take away my Milstein, just to even the score.<br /><br />Highly Recommended Bach.<br />Enjoy.
B000929AJQ|4.0|They've been gone since The Fragile, a pretty good album. Six years later NIN releases With Teeth. In my own opinion it's great, but to alot of people who don't appreciate music itself, you probably won't like it but hey, it's better than no NIN at all. With Teeth is purely a work of art and and for you people that judge music before understanding the lyrics and appreciating the composition of the music, I pity you.
B0007GAERG|5.0|While Mariah Carey's last album, Charmbracelet, was a disappointing effort focused on recapturing her former 1990s glory, The Emancipation of Mimi is, luckily, all brand new material.  Unlike Charmbracelet, which seemed to be forced and fake, Mimi is letting her hair so she can have a good time!  Here is my review, song by song, of The Emancipation of Mimi, my favorite record of 2005. <br /> <br />1.  It's Like That - This song perfectly reflects the mood of Mimi.  It's fun, danceable, and doesn't take itself too seriously.  Mariah sings, \\"No stress, no fights, I'm leaving it all behind/no tears, no time to cry, I'm making the most of life!\\" <br />2.  We Belong Together - My favorite song on the album.  It's super catchy and the lyrics are so heartfelt that you can hear Mariah's pain. <br />3.  Shake It Off - Uptempo dance song featuring JD's beats. <br />4.  Mine Again - My favorite ballad on the album.  The music has an old school feel and Mariah belts her pipes out!  This is what all those American Idol diva wannabes are trying to emulate - and for great reason. <br />5.  Say Somethin - Funky track produced by The Neptunes and featuring Snoop Dogg.  It took me quite a few listens to like this one, but I must say it is now one of my favorite tracks.  It sounds completely unlike anything Mariah has done before.  Even the lyrics are unusual for her. <br />6.  Stay The Night - Produced by Kanye West, this is the song I anticipated the most on this album.  Mariah showcases her powerhouse vocals to a simple piano melody and a sample of \\"Betcha By Golly Wow\\" echoing in the background. <br />7.  Get Your Number - Yet another Jermaine Dupri track, this is my second favorite song on the album.  My favorite part is when Mariah raps \\"I gotta house in Capri and my own G4 and a Benz with the doors that lift up from the floor.\\" <br />8.  One And Only - Featuring Twista.  Mariah's fast-paced vocals match Twista's!  This is a hot song! <br />9.  Circles - Another ballad - as youcan see, they are few and far between on this album.  Her trill 2:40 seconds into the song is amazing.   <br />10.  Your Girl - Another one of my favorite songs.  This was produced by Scram Jones.  The chorus is so dang catchy that it will get stuck in your head all day. <br />11.  I Wish You Knew - I hate this ballad.  This is the only song I skip on the entire album.  The cheesy screaming fans combined with Mariah's \\"shout out\\" to the crowd are just too much for me. <br />12.  To The Floor - featuring Nelly and produced by The Neptunes.  It gets very monotonous. <br />13.  Joy Ride - Another favorite of mine.  This is a sweet and catchy love song reminiscent of \\"Yours\\" from Charmbracelet. <br />14.  Fly Like A Bird - This album's gospel song.  Mariah's pastor even speaks during portions of the song.  It is very positive and uplifting - a great way to finish the album.
0446608955|5.0|Nicholas Sparks' happy and loving book, A Walk to Remember, is a story about two young adults that find out that there is more to life than partying all the time.  Also that you learn to adapt to other people you usually don't accompany with.  The story is told from the voice of Landon Carter who is one of the main characters in the story.  He is the type of guy who is always out partying, drinking and doing wild crazy things that teenagers carry out in their lives.  He meets a beautiful, happy and always smiling girl named Jamie, who happens to be the reverend's daughter in the town of Beaufort.  Landon gets in a bind with his grades and takes on the desire of needing help with getting back on track.  The problem is he has no one to help him.  Jamie, being the good person that she is, offers to help Landon with his studies because she realizes that he truly does have potential.  After spending large amounts of time together between studying and the play that they are in, Landon and Jamie become very close.  Jamie helps Landon realize who he really is inside and Landon helps Jamie lay back and take life with the punches.  This young love story can also be placed under the category of a \\"chick flick.\\"  I recommend that teenage girls should definitely read this book because they will fall in love with it and some may even be able to tie their lives into it.  Nicholas Sparks is a remarkable writer and never seems to prove that wrong.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've never seen the play version, so I have nothing to compare the movie version against, but I thought it was brilliantly done.  Cinematography, scores, etc were all great.  My only minor complaint is the fact that Emmy Rossum was cast as Christine.  Pretty girl, nice voice, decent actress, but I felt she was far too young to convey emotions appropriate for the film.  Plus the fact that her singing voice clearly isn't that of a trained opera singer took away from her singing parts.  Advanced pop singer, definitely, but opera singer, no way.  Gerard Butler doesn't have the best singing voice, but expresses such emotion and heartbreak that he led me almost to tears.   <br /> <br />As for the DVD, if you're interested in special features, I definitely recommend buying from Amazon.  I bought mine from Walmart, and there was only one disk inside with no special features at all; only the movie, scene selection, and subtitle option.
B0000TB050|3.0|U2 live at slane castle is'nt a bad gig, in fact its pretty good, although they are more of a stupid pop band now, with their all that you can't leave behind album. <br />If you think that albums bad, check out how to dismantle an atomic bomb, u2 are boring now, and Bono should take off his stupid purple shades (which he does in this show, besides the point though) and be a real rock star, instead off this Vertigo crappy tour nonsense.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|After seeing this movie most people want to focus on the relationship between murray and johansson.  And of course this is how the film is marketed...as a  tale of unexpected friendship.  But while almost everyone concentrates on this aspect of the film they are being bombarded with a subtle but profoundly conservative message.  Namely that what we call pop-culture and/or consumerism is alien and something to be avoided and overcome. The vapid actress, the wanna-be white rapper, the strip club, the photo shoot, the loose lounge singer...all of these things represent different aspects of our hedonistic culture to one degree or another.  Murray's and Johansson's reactions when confronted with these alien phenomena are instructive.  Johansson can barely contain her contempt while Murray just seems worn out by it all. The look on Johansson's face when she talks with the wanna-be rapper is priceless. <br /> <br />The fact that the two are in Japan is meaningless (except for marketing of course). While it is comical, Japan (with its embrace of western culture) is simply a proxy for the west in this film.  <br /> <br />Rent it and enjoy.
0790730960|1.0|\\"Batman Returns\\" is the one Batman movie that I absolutely loathe. Can I give a zero star rating for it? And I'm speaking as a huge Batman fan who have watched all the other movies more than a dozen times each (not to mention the countless Batman comics that I'm still buying and all). Why do I hate it so? I can list a million reasons but I think the following will suffice: <br /> <br />1) Tim Burton - This is one film-maker that I absolutely detest. Why do I say that? He is representative of the breed of film-makers who value style over substance. Look at all his films. Interesting sets. Gothic look. Very creative and graphic costumes. But zero in storytelling. Time was when a movie was suppose to tell a story not put up a fashion show with a Gothic-or-whatever theme. In fact, unlike many, I actually prefer the third and fourth Batman films over the first two by Burton. At least the other two films (Batman Forever and Batman & Robin) were silly and campy and... fun! Tim Burton's first two Bat-films were just largely... unsavoury, to say the least. <br /> <br />2) Danny DeVito - My wife loves the Penguin. In fact, she's hunting high-and-low for Golden Age and Silver Age reprints of \\"Penguin\\" stories in Batman comicbooks and comic-strips. I too used to watch the Batman cartoons as a kid and remembered the fun of watching the Penguin and his endless array of trick-umbrellas. Penguin, to me, is really Mr. Pickwick as a villain. Funny. Silly. A parody of the Victorian gentleman. DeVito made Penguin a vomit-inducing, sick freak! The Penguin is many things but he is not a monster like the way he was portrayed by DeVito in this movie. <br /> <br />3) Christopher Walken - This guy is one of my favourite actors of all time. I love his performance in every movie since \\"The Deer Hunter\\" but I absolutely loathe him in this one. Why, of why did he even take this role? Max Shreck? This guy is a worthy Bat-villain? I think he was only useful for pushing Michelle Pfeiffer from the top of a building. <br /> <br />The above are the top three reasons I detest this movie. I can think of many more. And of course, like all the other Batman movies, this one got Batman completely wrong also. I think the upcoming \\"Batman Begins\\" movie should be one to look forward to. David Goyer understands these age-old characters and what makes them tick (being a comic-writer and fan himself). This should teach everyone that non-comic-people should never be allowed to make comic-adaptations (think: \\"Catwoman\\", \\"Elektra\\" and this one - \\"Batman Returns\\").
B00005LE3Q|4.0|From the start, I blatantly refuse to compare this film to Huston's \\"Moulin Rouge\\" - these are two distinctly seperate works, and though their subject might be the same, it would be a disservice to the merits of both to place them on the same page.  That having been said...<br /><br />From the great storyline to the rip-roaring dance finale, this is one heck of a movie-musical.  Far, far too obscure, at least in this country - I've told innumerable friends about it, always with the same result - they tell me they've never heard of it.  Well, now that you have, it's very well worth your time to check it out.<br /><br />Firstly, the character development is fantastic.  Jean Gabin shines as the impresario Danglard, Francoise Arnould is wonderful as his ingenue/inspiration Nini, and Maria Felix is devastating as the diva, La Belle Abesse.  As well, look for the glittering talents that surround - the peripheral characters are a delight to behold.  And, of course, the great Edith Piaf makes a brief appearance, as well.<br /><br />Another quality I love about this film is the relatively accurate depiction of 1890's Paris - the costumes, colors and attitudes are well captured.  The truth of the \\"casting couch\\" is openly mentioned, and relationships between performers and impresario are depicted with often saddening accuracy.  On a lighter note, the dances are captured beautifully, as well - throughout the film they shine, in rehearsal rooms, dingy bars, and, of course, in the aforementioned finale.<br /><br />Overall, this is a most enjoyable film - and, unlike many \\"golden age\\" Hollywood musicals, it doesnt' shy away from the ugly truths of life in the theatre.  Well worth a viewing - and very well worth purchase.
B0002HTZJI|5.0|First: I am a Chili Peppers fan. <br />I really like LIHP. It's a great album. Of course Anthony's vocals aren't perfect. But isn't that why so many fans love him? He's not that kind of super-professional rock-star. It's the Pepper's passion for music that most of their fans love. John Frusciante's solos on this album are great as ever. The outro of By The Way is just brilliant. I don't think that he should sing songs like Donna Summer's I Feel Love but he loves playing this music.  <br />Many classmates asked me where they can get this CD. It's the power this music has that fascinates me. <br />To all fans of good music and real emotions: Buy this CD!
B00005ATQ9|1.0|I can't believe this guy thinks this is a great movie and has the gall to criticize Kill Bill 2 for it's editing.  This shouldn't be called a movie but more appropriately a \\"move less\\".  It's more of a painting than a moving picture.  Frankly, I think this guy Hughes has a hidden longing for Ryan Oneal.
B0007XT87G|5.0|It's scheduled for May 10, 2005. Same format as the DTS 5.1 version of In Absentia. That makes at least four versions of Deadwing so far, if you count the U.K. version. Should be interesting. Also they have a date at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park on May 12, 2005. I'll be there.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|First of all, I have to say that if you are a Ryan Adams fan than you know that the more you listen to one of his albums the more it grows on you. Cold Roses is no exception. As I continue to listen, his lyrics, the melodies, etc. continue to grow on me. As others have said, Cold Roses offers something for fans of all of his albums (except for maybe Rock n'Roll). Personally my favorite albums include Strangers Almanac, Gold, and Love Is Hell Part 1. For fans of these albums you will enjoy new songs: 'Let It Ride', 'When Will You Come Back Home', 'Dance All Night', and 'Sweet Illusions'. However, all these songs have substance (no fillers included). It is amazing that with the amount of music Ryan has made in his 10 year career he continues to put out great records that are both fresh and appealing to his fans. I look forward to hearing the other two albums coming out this year, 'September' and '29'. Ryan, you the man...Keep up the great work!!!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|One of my friends had this album and was letting me borrow the 2nd disc after I had already heard the first one.  The second one is in my opinion better because of the live factor. It seems more raw to me, and maybe a little more relaxed or real. I don't know how to better explain it, but I can't get enough. I never get tired of it.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie sound tracks of all time. Gibson certainly picked the right composer when he picked John Debney and he himself shows true mettle by singing and chanting. I feel like I am not giving it enough credit by putting an adjective to  describe it. If I have to then it has to be the following. stupendous, incredible and astounding. There are so many great elements, amazing vocals, great musicians and amazing composers in the form of Gibson and Debney I love the cover and it certainly is a haunting and reminds me of paintings done in Italy  during the 16th and 17th century and the book-let has some truly astounding pictures from this epic movie.
B000002GJH|5.0|Temple of the dog was a side project involving Chris cornell of soundgarden along with the members of pearl jam.they produced only one great album which contains terrific songs like hello 2 heaven,reach down and more.This album is amongst my favourite cd's even though I listen mainly to classic rock music.hugely recommended along with superunknown from soundgarden and audioslave's debut album.
0201721481|4.0|I am in my final year of highschool and heading into computer science next year at university. I have taken (very simple) introductory programming courses in high school and have learned PHP and Java from &quot;teach yourself&quot; books on my own. I was looking for a book to quickly bring me up to speed in the world of C++ programming, and this is just the book to do it. As long as you have some experience using an object oriented programming language, this book this book is for you. However, if you are new to programming in general, you'll probably need to work though a &quot;Teach Yourself in 21 Days&quot; before tackling this one :-)
B000000HTK|5.0|The band pulls back from their epic sound on the last album, and strip the soundback a little. Much less intensity, much easier to lisetn to. These songs are still brilliant; the lyric focus has changed from cosmic to much more personal. After doing his solo career, Hammil no doubt shifted to the much more personal themes of his solo albums. Sleepwalkers is one of the best tracks the band ever did. Not a huge change in sound, but enough of a change to be interesting. The band always had a very focused, very individual song, but they found lots of interesting ways to change it up.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is great, (...)!
B000000HTL|5.0|i don't suggest starting here with Van Der Graaf. It's an album to work up to. Because it is easily their best. Peter's song writing suggest complete genius here. Very beautiful, very harsh, very strange, very van der graaf. I just want to say all these guys are way above average on their instruments. They just don't \\"flash\\". They're not about that. They're about experimentation, pulsation, contrasting beauty with ugliness. Killer.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I love all of the actors, and I guess the acting was pretty good, but I felt like I was listening to a porn movie.  The language was so foul that it actually took away from the movie. I'm not a prude or anything, but there is a line between artistic taste and just plain vulgar. The story was stupid with no true meaning. The characters were all idiots. I only watched the whole movie because I thought surely it would get better. It didn't!
B000000HTO|5.0|This is Van Der Graaf's most laid back album. Almost too laid back; this album screams for more layers of instruments to compensate for the laid back, pretty nature of hte music. However, it's still strong. The songs are still good, Childlike Faith being one of their best songs. Definitely a late night album, I believe.
0783225970|1.0|Words are not enough to describe just how bad this film is.  The characters are one dimensional; the dialogue is comprised mostly of the \\"F\\" word; and gratuitously violent scenes are splattered from beginning to end.  Mr. Pacino relies on a laughable \\"Cuban\\" accent and a perpetual sneer to bring the character of Tony Montana to life.  His performance is pure ham, right of the bone and poorly cut.  The direction is even worse - which brings me to the reason that I always try to catch at least some snippets of the movie when it plays on cable:  the same reasons that make the film so unbelievably bad also make it incredibly funny.  Some examples:  Tony and Elvira's exchange regarding his \\"diplomatic status\\"; Manny's tongue-wiggling scene as he \\"teaches\\" Tony the fine art of wooing an American woman; Tony revealing to Sosa the two things he has in life; Tony and his Tiger-striped Cadillac arriving to pick up Elvira.  I could go on and on.  My only caution to prospective viewers (adults only, of course) is that there is so much violence and profanity used throughout the film that it may be difficult for some to get past the initial revulsion.  However, if they can overcome this hurdle, the film will leave them in stitches.
B000000HTM|5.0|This album is Van Der Graaf's Tales From Topographic oceans. Some people swear it's their absolute best. Some swear it's their absolute worst. <br />I love it; it is something you have to grow to appreciate though. The catchy themes from past times are gone, and it's almost entirely based on atmosphere and that contrast between beauty and ugliness. I believe that A Plauge is one of the best side longs in all of prog. It flows close to perfectly. The other two tracks have sections that are wonderful, others that are not. If you enjoy this album, you'll enjoy the rest of the band's albums. This is their hardest to get into, but it is worth it, i believe.
B00004U8JV|2.0|The original was great, but this sequel stunk! The story must  have been written in 1 day, it was so stupid! Jeff Goldblum, was  even more annoying than usual, and had a black daughter, who was  a gymnast, yeah that's believable! Do yourself a favor, watch  1 and 3, they're good! This #2 belongs in the toilet, with my#2!
0316172324|1.0|I just heard Malcolm Gladwell on CNN. He actually said that as soon as he grew his hair into what was a mini-afro, which he was sporting during the interview with Anderson Cooper - he started getting speeding tickets all of a sudden, as well as being hassled at the airport on a regular basis. It was such a lie. If you ever see a picture of this man, you'll know he's lying. He ain't getting hrassed at the airport looking like that, that's for sure. So we know right off that he's a liar. Anderson Cooper laughed thinking it was a joke for a second and asked him if he was serious. Gladwell said that he was actually serious. I didn't buy it; I'm not sure about Anderson but if he didn't he wouldn't have shown it, anyway. Gladwell is an obvious fake. No need to elaborate any further.    My problem with Gladwell is that he takes valid points outside the context of his arguments and then ties them to his own totally subjective conclusions. The IAD tests he mentions are a total joke. Most of the book is common sense stuff that sgould only surprise you if you're not that bright to begin with. His analysis on height biase is also just common sense extrapolated from some out of context example and then added to subjective conclucions.    Most of the biase is actually from Gladwell himself, who is ONLY in favour of an analysis which shows height and race and other biases. An analysis that would explore an alternative interpretation isn't even explored by Gladwell. Why not? In the end, Gladwell succedes only in promoting paranoia by creating new target groups and unfairly exaggerating the disadvantages of others. Don't buy this book. He makes alot of money by giving naive people a lot of nothing to worry about. GLADWELL: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND A REAL THINKER IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEAR ABBY AND STEPHEN HAWKING. STOP PROJECTING YOUR COMPLEXES ONTO THE WORLD.
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel gives an incredible performance in this movie! This movie is not boring for a second, which is great. I love the part when they're in the mexicans house, it's intense! This movie is exciting from beginning to end!  YOU'LL LOVE IT!
0316666343|5.0|No doubt, this book can certainly be disturbing.  I didn't even know what it was about, but kept on reading.  I really loved the book.  This novel is written from the perspective of the deceased and made it very intriguing for me to keep turning the pages.  I enjoyed this read and already miss the characters!
B000268QB2|4.0|This album is soothing and has a certain chill out factor one needs from time to time. Apparently, they are a part of a Britpop rebirth. However, the version of Britpop is up for debate. I think it is close to Coldplay, Flannelmouth and Radiohead. I can certainly recommend this album if it is the chill out factor you are looking for. Listen to the clips and you will know what I mean.
B0002YLC24|5.0|First, right off the bat, let me say that you MUST see Before Sunrise prior to watching this film.  While I suppose you might still enjoy it without the prior viewing (you are offered a few scattered flashbacks of the previous film), I believe your appreciation of its subtleties will be HUGELY diminished without it.  And it's a rare treat to be able to revisit characters you got to know in one film ten years later. <br /> <br />I actually watched BEFORE SUNRISE again just one day prior to viewing BEFORE SUNSET.  In my opinion, that's the way to go...because there are little things in the first film that come up in film #2...it helps enjoy the movie to remember those little moments yourself. <br /> <br />BEFORE SUNRISE was the story of two young college-aged kids who meet on a train to Vienna, and he (Ethan Hawke) convinces here (Julie Delpy) to hang out with him for the night, before he has to fly back to the states.  From there, they wander the scenic streets of Vienna, mostly talking, and falling in love.  We see how the intellectual connection is made almost simultaneously with the physical attraction...and it's almost palpable how convincing the film is.  At the end, the couple agrees to meet again in one year at the exact spot. Will they come together again?  We don't know. <br /> <br />BEFORE SUNSET answers that question and many others.  I will NOT be a spoiler here, but let's just say that in the 9 years that passed since the last film, Hawke and Delpy have not been together the whole time.  How and why?  I won't say. <br /> <br />This time, they meet in Paris.  Both actors are clearly older.  Hawke is gaunt to the point of emaciation.  Delpy has aged around the eyes in particular.  What's cool is that as the two reunite, we can see the age lifting from them.  Yes, they look older, but as they spend the time together, they begin to feel like their younger selves again.   <br /> <br />Ethan Hawke is not a favorite actor of mine.  In most films, I find him boring or affected.  He's also a very pretentious writer...and I don't like that he dumped Uma Thurman.  Anyway, in these little gems, he is terrific.  The conversational, improvised tone fits him very well, and he's convincing.  Delpy, whom I haven't seen in much else, is very good.  Her character has many annoying little traits, but she's also so open about the joy she takes in things.  And both characters have bristling, active intellects.  It's fun to watch smart people making a connection.  They're both quick witted and funny, especially Delpy.   <br /> <br />The first film was mostly upbeat...even though we knew they had to part ways, there was so much fun in watching them connect so convincingly.  The movie captured the ebullience of young love.  BEFORE SUNSET is infused with melancholy.  The characters are older, and have been battered a bit by life...especially their own decisions.  Neither has been a failure, yet neither is happy either.  And they are tormented (especially Hawke) by what \\"could have been.\\"  There's some resentment there, and it pops up from time to time, even as they rebuild their bond.  They aren't as carefree and open as they once were.  All of that reads as very convincing and believable. <br /> <br />The final ten minutes or so of the film are about as quiet and tiny as any you'll see.  We REALLY feel we're eavesdropping.  The tension is thick.  Time is running out (Hawke has a plane to catch) and we can literally feel the need to cling to every last second.  The ending is the ultimate in bittersweet. <br /> <br />I admire the films because they dialogue, while probably more intelligent and witty then any of us could muster up, FEELS real.  And there's a lot of it, and it's fun to listen to.  The actors also listen to each other very avidly.  It all feels authentic, and makes you realize how many movies really don't.  The films aren't stylish or noisy.  The filmmaking is NOT flashy.  Director Richard Linklater knows what the strengths areand doesn't tamper with them. <br /> <br />Is the movie perfect?  No.  Sometimes we realize that these two people might not be people we would actually like if we met them.  They are a bit full of themselves.  But on the other hand, it's a strength that they aren't afraid to have some significant warts too.  And the opening scene, where Hawke is in a bookstore (before he's met Delpy) feels too contrived...it's only an excuse to show some scenes from the previous film.  But these quibbles are REALLY minor. <br /> <br />I recommend both movies to adults...particularly if you've had love in your life or been an adult for at least ten years.  I think most kids or teens would be bored silly.  <br />
B0002RNXNM|4.0|This is not exactly the best but it comes pretty close. Finally, we have a sound that is not a new version of Franz Ferdinand or The Strokes. It's all-subjective at the end of the day and what I like about this album are the killer tracks such as \\"Reason is Treason\\" and of course, \\"Club Foot\\". Other songs are full of rolling overtures and electronic sounds, which might remind you of the Stone Rose or Primal Scream. Over all, this album has the same hype as the old Oasis material and the latest dbut, \\"Rain Inside\\" from Flannelmouth. Basically, \\"Butcher Blues\\" is my favourite and I can't want to see them live at the Kool Haus in May 2005.
B000929AJQ|5.0|In comparison to other NIN albums, one might say that [WITH_TEETH] is the best.  One might also say it is the worst.  I say it is different.  Much like Radiohead's \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" you either love it or hate it (Is this a surprise considering mixed feelings towards previous records?).  Reznor's new odyssey of live drums, heavy bass, and beautiful guitar is great for what it is : a transitional album.  Don't get me wrong, Reznor does not completely abandon the complex soundscapes of \\"The Fragile\\" nor the raw industrial might of \\"The Downward Spiral.\\"  Rather, he composes such elements in a much more \\"live\\" fashion.  I think that Reznor did in this album as what he did in all his previous albums : explored.  When you measure albums like [WITH_TEETH] to albums like Rob Thomas' new one or Limp Bizkit's attempt at a change, you see it for it's greatness in production and in lyrical content.  It is truly fantastic for today's standards for a \\"good album.\\"  But in comparison to previous records, NIN fans may not be as forgiving.  It really depends on the fan and they may be the harshest of the critics (Something I never understood because Reznor rarely tries to repeat the previous albums, but rather includes a few elements from previous albums).  I thoroughly enjoyed [WITH_TEETH].  I make no apologies for such adoration.  Compared to other Reznor albums, I would give this an 8/10 (for the record I would give \\"Still\\" a 10/10 and TDS/The Fragile 9/10).  Compared to most of the musical drivel spewed out today, I would give it a 20/10.  This album has a lot to offer.  Songs like \\"All the Love in the World,\\" \\"With Teeth,\\" \\"Only,\\" and \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" make this album worth the near 6 years it took for it to come out.  Even the accessible single \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" has more meaning to it than crap like 50 Cent's \\"Candy Shop\\" or Gwen Stefani's \\"Hollaback Girl.\\"  So, when walking into your local record shop, forget that Rob Thomas, 50 Cent, or Akon CD.  Go pick up [WITH_TEETH].
B000929AJQ|1.0|I first heard NIN in 1992... loved it. There were a handful of bands I passionately held as my favorites through high school, and NIN was always numero uno. In college, I remember driving the streets of Atlanta with my roommate for two hours, listening to The Fragile after we bought it at Tower Records at midnight. <br /> <br />So, it was with great anticipation that I awaited With Teeth. Well, it was more like a punch to the teeth. I heard the record on Trent's MySpace page before the CD launched. \\"Jesus,\\" I thought, \\"is this a joke?\\"  <br /> <br />It reminded me of Type O Negative's \\"World Coming Down\\" CD. An amazing band, releasing a record that is absolute dog vomit.  <br /> <br />I figured, maybe I just need to give the record a few more spins. So, I actually bought it and force-fed myself the unimaginative audio-filth... and never gained a taste for it. Maybe it's a sign of the times... just about every band I adored in the early to mid 90s that is still around, puts out records now that just plain suck. <br /> <br />If there are young kids that like this modern-NIN, good for you. I'm glad there's an audience, but as a fan of his earlier (and more inspiring) work, I can only look at this latest offering with contempt.
B00005R2IS|4.0|This film is actually pretty good. If you label it as science fiction, you are missing the point- it's not. It is a comic book-style adventure film with some violence thrown in. Don't be scared off by the violence, it is no where near as violent as some of the movies out today! Some nice stunts with some cool cars and a bit of plot thrown in. But it all works! Parts tend to drag near the end, but only for a few minutes, and its right back to the action. It is basically a revenge story, but its quirks really make it work. It is just different from other movies of the same ilk. I particularly like the characters' comic book style looks and action, and the screen wipes help make the movie seem more like an old fashioned style serial. Worth watching if you like Mel, cars, or action. I didn't hear a whole lot of difference between the American dubbed version and the Australian version, except for a few minor dialogue changes. (I too agree with the reviewer that the chatter over Goose's radio was more interesting on the American version. \\"C'mon Goose! Where are you?\\")
0440238609|5.0|The Harry Potter books were amusing, but they don't even begin to be in the same league as these books.<br /><br />Although not a big fan of Pullman's other stuff, I must nevertheless state that these books defy description.  It was like discovering the magic of reading all over again.
B00005JLTR|5.0|Oh my God I have loved this movie since I first saw it when I was @@@teen.I think this is the best of the remakes,If you like to remeber being that much in love and the pain that went along with being with that one person and you don't mind crying at \\"girly\\" movies this one is the best,not quite Brian's Song but really good
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This movie follows the relationships of four people with completely polarized personalities. It was entertaining... Clive really is brilliant in this, it's by far the best performance I've seen by Jude, I really believed Portman's love for Law's character and Julia, as usual was completely on point. A really good watch and something I would definitely watch twice.
1592400876|5.0|Obsessive-compulsives of the language world unite! As an avid reader, television watcher, and a future English teacher, reading this book had me giggling with delight. Truss, armed with seething sarcasm and historical backgrounds, takes on the current media (including advertisements, newspapers, etc.) and current trends in technology (think :-) ). <br /> It seems like a daily occurrence-walking down the street and a sign looms above: \\"ITS OUR BIG SALE!\\" Truss decides she doesn't have to take it anymore and unleashes all her pent up anger over apostrophe-less signage by outlining the basic rules of the apostrophe, comma, period and various other punctuation marks (this of course is after she decides not to correct a \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" sign with her giant Sharpie). If the humor is lost on the audience reading this book, it still can be used as a learning tool both for the history of language and a basic \\"to punctuate, or not to punctuate\\"-guide.  <br /> While literature lovers, like myself, will appreciate her discussions of Thurber and Greek theatre, so many are likely to say, \\"so, what?\\". My husband, for example, is of the opinion that as long as you can understand what something means, then there is no need for proper punctuation (whenever this debate comes up, he sleeps on the couch that night). Truss argues for a balance between correctness and what has been deemed acceptable by society. This seems logical, and anyone looking for a guide to trends, where current punctuation rules stand, or just a laugh ought to read this book. <br />
B00009V7P8|1.0|Okay, I admit it Volcano is an incredible song.  Damien Rice is an incredible singer and songwriter as well.  So what's lacking in this album?  It seems as if debut rock artists don't trust their true sound and add sappy amounts of strings to pull your heartstrings as you listen to lovely songs about human love and tragedy.  O Damien, if only you had your guitar and did away with the orchestra this would be a masterpiece.  I recommend you see him in concert or wait for the next release when he has more confidence in himself.
B000009HF2|5.0|this review is dedicated to the punk loser below who bashed the album.  listen up there hoss, i know that you are sooo original liking punk and all, which is the friggin downfall of the 2000's so far, ripofawful, unoriginal, standard, cookie-cutter whiny punk music.  and i know your comeback there chief, \\"i like ORIGINAL PUNK, like the ramones.\\"  thats absoluste bullcrap, there is no original punk.  im a bassist for an innovative, progressive, and creative band, and i appreciate those type of, and i quote, \\"unnessecary guitar solos\\".  OK, so frampton was no jimmy page.  but who was???  frank zappa was one of a kind, so why expect others to recreate him???  just because those musicians were music GODS, do not take that away from frampton comes alive.  Frampton was a spectacular lyricist, songwriter and performer, so let that be known, and also, you dont have the BEST SELLING LIVE ALBUM OF YOUR ERA by accident.  Frampton had that \\"it\\", that unique blend of allure, talent, and luck that made him huge, and i still can smoke a doobie and enjoy \\"feel like we do\\" as much as my dad did 30 years ago.  so go play some standard sh*tty chords and scream some sh*tty lyrics at your own pops, cause we here enjoy real music about life, love, war, and gettin' high my man...long live the 60's and 70's, the golden age of rock an roll!!!  and long live the extended, unnessecary guitat solo and improving, for that, friends, is why i am addicted to this thing called rock an roll!!!
B00005JKG9|4.0|Okay, as others have said, this is a great flick, and a stunning cast.  But I'm not sure there's any such thing as an \\"actor's movie\\" as others have said - these guys would be sitting around with nothing to do if not for Mamet's trademark staccato dialogue.   <br /> <br />Speaking of which, IMDB notes that the word f*ck and its derivatives are uttered 138 times in the course of this movie... so much, in fact, that during filming the actors referred to the movie as \\"Death of a F*cking Salesman.\\" <br /> <br />Jack Lemmon was a great actor who tended to get a little over the top at the end of the film - and he doesn't disappoint here, if that's what you're looking for.  And Pacino LIVES over the top - this is another one of those films where he treats his performance as if it's a great big freakin' joke, just between him and his audience.  But for my money, the standout performance in this film is Kevin Spacey's.  His performance is as tightly controlled  - perhaps claustrophobic is a better word - in this as in \\"American Beauty.\\" <br /> <br />Folks who like this movie should check out two of Mamet's best:  The Spanish Prisoner and The Winslow Boy (an early 20th century play Mamet adapted for the screen, and directed).
6305205620|5.0|This is an amazing live DVD. I have noticed a lot of people commenting on how bad James' voice sounds. If you want a studio sound, go listen to the studio album. This is Metallica in the raw, so get over it! I will admit however that his vocals on S&M were much better, but it doesn't really make that big of a difference.<br /><br />Being a huge Metallica fan, and having been to a lot of shows, it was nice to see them open the show with a different format than \\"Ecstasy of Gold.\\" The Jam on \\"Bad Seed\\" was a nice opener. Jason's bass solo was awesome, and I am suprised that this wasn't turned into a song at some point.<br /><br />Great DVD. Highly recommended!
0694003611|5.0|This is a great book.  I read it to my son right after his bath (think wailing time!) while his father dresses him for bed.  While I read my 8 months old is very attentive and forgets to scream as the pajamas go on.  To me, that's a winner. <br /> <br />On a serious note, I read all the negtive reviews to try to figure out why someone would NOT like it and the most people say it's boring... Well I find MOST books written for babies and toddlers boring.  I would be very surprised and dissapointed in myself I found a kid's book fascinating.
B0007TKNII|1.0|So far, I've seen nothing but good reviews of this film. Sorry, but this isn't that kind of review. Stop reading now if you liked it, because I was absolutley appaled.<br /><br />I must say, that when I first heard about the film, I was both delighted and apprehensive. I was first introduced to Phantom of the Opera 7 years ago when my sister took me to a performance in San Francisco. I saw it again in London in July. After seeing it again, I was amped to see how it would translate to film. Then, a friend lent me the soundtrack, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It's also the reason I've put off seeing it until now. The first thing I've noticed is how much of the story has been changed and added to. For one, Madame Giry is not at the auction in the original performance, and it is Raoul who buys most of the items for sale. Though, I did like how they did the transition from the \\"Present\\" to the past. Another thing that was altered was the introduction of the new owners and Carlotta's departure. Raoul was never at that first meeting in the play.<br /><br />Another major change was the end of act 1. The chandelier was supposed to fall after the curtain falls on Il Muto (after Christine returns to perform the lead), being the biggest of the Phantom's crimes, and his attempt at forcing the owners and cast into compliance. The falling chandelier is delayed until the end, and doesn't give the same feeling. And the intro of act 2 is bad. The song \\"Masquerade\\" is written to reflect the costumes of the attendee's. The lyrics go: \\"Flash of mauve / Splash of puce / Fool and king / Ghoul and goose / Green and black / Queen and priest / Trace of rouge / Face of beast\\" and, \\"Grinning yellows, spinning reds\\". But, I ask you, where is all the color?? The only color seems to be from the opera's crew behinds the scenes! All the masqueraders wear variations on Black, White, and Gold! What kind of masquerade is monotone?! It the fact that many of the attendees had faces painted to resemble the Phantom seemed a bit forced. In the script for the play, it says that Christine is traded among dance partners who resemble in some way the Phantom, but never does it say they blatantly have his face! Also, what about the Phantom in that scene? His entrance isn't more than the lights dimming and a few flashbulbs instead of a grand performance as it should be for him. One thing that disappointed me was how they re-wrote the Phantom's past. Madame Giry discovered him when Meg was very young, not she herself. She's the one who freed him, he never escaped anything.<br /><br />As for the acting... Well, to borrow the Phantom's phrasing, it was \\"a lamentable mess!\\" Emmy Rossum's peformance was decent in some parts, but lacking in others. She seems much to young to fill the shoes of Christine. And Gerard Butler as the Phantom... not a great choice. For one, the Phantom is meant to be physically revolting, yet he looks like he just had some 2nd degree burns and they healed quite well.<br /><br />Honestly, much of the film was too contrived and forced. No one should waste their time or money on this drivel. If you want a love story, find something less gag-worthy or go see the stage performance.ted to resemble the Phantom seemed a bit forced.

Fern had saved this little pig from a certain death. She didn't want her father killing a baby pig. But as when Wilbur grows, Mr. Arable, Fern's father says Wilbur has to go. So they gave it to the Zuckermans. And there, Wilbur had a great adventure in the Zuckermans' farm also meeting Charlotte with her baby spiders.  <br /> <br />SOME PIG: <br /> <br />These are the words in Charlotte's Web, high in the barn.

B0007TKNL0|3.0|There are moments where the screws fall in place and \\"The Phantom of Opera\\" soars, musically and dramatically. <br /> <br /> As a visual achievement it's a lush and bold statement from director Joel Schumacher, a cinematic painting of opera houses, dungeons and graveyards in reds and blacks and whites and greys. Schumacher's made too many films - and some not very good ones - but technically he's strong and professional and fluid. The man can direct mood. <br /> <br />And then there's Emmy Rossum, just an 18-year-old kid, is so pure a singer and regal a beauty - well, they found the right girl for Christine. Two of the four key elements - the production and the female lead, are such aces that the accompanying factors - The Phantom and the music - could be, well, what they are.  <br /> <br />A drag. <br /> <br />Some musicals are simply better than others, and some bridge better to movies, too and Andrew Lloyd Webber's words and music do not immediately spring to mind as easy translations. Not for \\"Evita\\" and not here. One could even argue \\"The Phantom of Opera\\" is a lackluster musical, period, and yet the response to it is so fierce, so absolute that whatever chord it strikes in its fans is significant.  <br /> <br />And yet even fans will be let down by the singing portions of the film. They sit uneasily between spoken word scenes. Only the masquerade ball has an opening flourish decently charting a descent into song. In recent years Baz Luhrmann, Lars Von Trier and Rob Marshall found their own ways of kick-starting the musical portion of their movies (\\"Moulin Rouge,\\" \\"Dancer In The Dark,\\" \\"Chicago\\") into gear. Schumacher's only failure is to mishandle the mixture of song and spoken word. It's a little dumb when Rossum might sing a transitionary phrase, or even a singular word, and within the same scene speak whole lines of dialogue. <br /> <br />A lackluster Phantom, played Gerard Butler, doesn't assist matters. Butler is a beefcake lacking tragedy. Or even weariness. Or age. Or somber emotion. Hulking, moping creep he might be. His voice is a pulling moan, defiled by Rossum's clarity and pitch. He comes at the role as a slow-moving linebacker would, adding rage to his tab until he bursts near the end. Neither he nor Patrick Wilson, as the Viscount Raoul, are particularly worthy of Rossum's Christine, in voice or sex appeal, and when they duel with swords near the end of the movie, there isn't much at stake. <br /> <br />Aside from Minnie Driver, who cannonballs into the role of opera diva Carlotta with an at-times incomprehensible Italian accent, other performers, including Miranda Richardson, generally stand to the side in hushed, reverent poses, in awe of their mere presence in the film, until they're called to sing, when they inhabit Webber's jaunty, camera-mugging persona.  <br /> <br />Certainly there is an air of \\"event\\" in the production, and Schumacher surely aspires to it, but passion wanes and drama is muted. \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" produces mostly an uneasy heat, with Rossum, brilliant as her voice is, sandwiched between a angry slug and Some Other Guy who pops up to profess an undying love he hasn't begun to show.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|In this film's four-star constellation of actors, Clive Owen's star probably shines the dimmest.   But make no mistake about it, he rules this movie.    Owen gives an incendiary performance as one fourth of a romantic quadrangle of lovers who are alternately in each others pants and at each other's throats.   Owen, of course, is the British actor who is most often mentioned as the man most likely to be the next James Bond.  And though you can see the Bond suaveness here, this is a film that requires him to turn up the hostility on a dime.   To see Clive Owen in this film to see the modern male as 21st Century caveman.    This is not to slight the work of Julia Roberts, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman.   All give uniformly superb performances in what is a sharply written and deftly directed ensemble film.    All praise is due to director Mike Nichols and playwright Patrick Marber whose play the film adapts.    But it's Owen who towers in this film like Shaquille O'Neal in a kindergarten class.   Watching the film, you almost hope the Bond thing never happens since the O07 role has been a both a blessing and a curse to every actor that's played the role.       Though Sean Connery gave it up by the early seventies it took him more than a decade to climb out of Bond's shadow and become a known as a bankable actor who could do more than shake a martini and fire a gun.   One time Bond George Lazenby was basiclly never heard from again after \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\\"     Roger Moore's most notable recent projects have included \\"Boat Trip\\" and the Spice Girls movie while Timothy Dalton seems to be toiling away in the relative obscurity of made for  TV family movies.    As for Pierce Brosnan, though he's tried admirably to take diverse roles while also carrying the Bond mantle, it's too early to tell if his career will go anywhere but down now that he's parking the Astin Martin in Q's garage for good.    That's why it would frankly be better not to see Clive Owen donthe Bond tux.   Performances like the one he gives in \\"Closer\\" show that he's just too good for it.
B000929AJQ|2.0|I bought this album at my local record store the day it came out.  The hand that feeds was a competant single and I was hoping for an album that might really fill a musical gap from the old angry songsters of lore.  Though this album has about 5 great songs, there are so many that are pure tripe.  First and foremost, the drums.....they are so simplistic on most tracks and so severely underproduced that you'd think a kid was at the drumset.  Next we have the guitars which are so fuzzed out you can't make tell of whats going on when the songs get loud and agressive, which by the way isn't too often.  Then you have Trent whose voice is sounding the worst I've ever heard it.  I know he has never been the best vocalist but now his voice is damned near grating.  Overall, there are SOME good songs on this album for the fans of NIN that want something to keep them over till the next halo.  The ones worthwhile would be.....You know what you are, Everyday is exactly the same, Getting Smaller, The line begins to blur, and really I think those are the only BEARABLE songs on the whole album.  So sad and disappointed.....
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|It would be too harsh to say that \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is a bad movie, but compared to the relatively straightforward plot of the first film, this was at times difficult to follow, with some explanations only showing up in the deleted scenes.<br /><br />The basics are good: Bourne is living in India, still on the run (he thinks) from Treadstone. Then a CIA operation goes bad, agents are killed, and Bourne's fingerprint is left behind ... in Berlin. At the same time, his girlfriend is shot in a bullet meant for him, which brings him roaring back to the West to settle matters once and for all, unaware that he's been framed as a traitor who kills CIA agents.<br /><br />So far, so good. Throw in a ripped-from-today's-headlines Russian oil magnate and you'd think we'd be in good company, but neither Matt Damon nor Joan Allen (in a stellar performance) can save this. Things get confused to the point where one suspects the director wasn't really sure what was going on. Some loose ends are wrapped up, there's a lot of really good action and other set pieces, but the whole does not add up to the sum of its parts.<br /><br />I have high hopes that the third part of this trilogy will return it to form. In the meantime, this is a rental.
B000002UJQ|3.0|...and thus I'm obviously a jaded, myopic music fan who just doesn't \\"get\\" or \\"feel\\" good music and ought to go listen to some \\"stupid\\" pop songs.  Resorting to simple ad-hominem attacks and calling everyone who doesn't worship and slobber all over this  album an idiot or a musical ignoramus does nothing to actually rebut the shortcomings of \\"OK Computer\\" that some of the more intelligent 3 and 2-star reviewers address.       This album is a good slab of Britpop, not all that unlike the contemporaneous output of Blur, Pulp, and even Oasis, modified with some bleeps, bells, and whistles--an interesting approach, but hardly a revelatory, earth-shattering fissure within the landscape of rock music.  Had \\"OK Computer\\" been released in 1970, before the heyday of King Crimson, Pink Floyd (an embarassing comparison for Radiohead), Can, Kraftwerk, Eno, Talk Talk, U2, and Rush, it would have been groundbreaking, but arriving here in 1997, it's a little conservative.  \\"OK Computer\\" synthesizes the aforementioned influences well, but does not offer enough new or exciting variations on musical themes introduced decades ago to clearly step out of its predecessors' shadows.  It's a regression from the brilliant guitar-rock of the band's first two albums, and the first step down Radiohead's path towards boring, mediocre \\"experimental\\" music, which continues to this day.      That's not to say it's an awful album: it's definitely an enjoyable listen, just tremendously and hyperbolically overrated.  It certainly has some great songs, like the chimey  \\"No Surprises,\\" the beautiful \\"Letdown,\\" and the trip-hoppy \\"Airbag,\\" but it also has a boring dirge (\\"Exit Music\\"), a \\"Sexy Sadie\\" rip (\\"Karma Police\\"), and an anticlimax (\\"The Tourist\\").  \\"OK Computer\\" is a good encapsulation of the past, but it's not earth-shattering enough to merit favorable comparisons to the watershed works of The Beatles or Pink Floyd or any of the myriad of other artists who have produced classic, visionary work, and thus calling this album the greatest ever(!) is an appalling assertion--the readers of Q Magazine and their brethren need to go and listen to some albums made before, oh, 1993 or so, or perhaps some that don't get so overhyped that any listen to them can't help but be a letdown.  They must be joking in ranking this ahead of every other rock album ever made, especially since it sags heavily in the middle with \\"Exit Music\\" and \\"Fitter Happier\\" and \\"Electioneering\\" and breaks virtually no new ground.      I must say that Radiohead fans are among the most obnoxious people on the planet.  They go off and listen to this allegedly \\"difficult\\" music, say it's better than the combined recording output of The Beatles and Pink Floyd, and then parade their elitist \\"I'm-feeling-this-and-you're-not\\" sentiments all over the web.  Radiohead's music isn't really that difficult: \\"OK Computer\\" is very accessible even upon first listen, working comfortably within the confines of sullen guitar-and-drums rock and adding some electronic bleeps, which almost everyone mistakes for the illusion of some greater depth beneath the surface music.  There is no Holy Grail here to be unearthed on the 912423423st listen, although who knows, maybe someone will find some backwards, subliminal message hidden within the \\"difficult\\" Stephen Hawking voice of \\"Fitter Happier.\\"  Radiohead aren't great abstract visionaries, yet starting with this album, they begin to outstretch their musical limits abilities and try their hands at genres and styles (electronica, psychedelia, ambient) at which they simply aren't even close to being the best.  While \\"Pablo Honey\\" and especially \\"The Bends\\" showcase a sharply focused and consistent band hammering out brilliant slabs of guitar-rock, \\"OK Computer\\" and its successors are the sound of a band trying to cram itself into a far-out niche in which it won't fit at all.     Anyway, in conclusion, the overarching concept of \\"OK Computer\\" is like something derived from the Kraftwerk back-catalogue: its lyrics are typical, recycled \\"technology is ruining us\\" sentiments, all of which preach to the choir and aren't nearly as deep and introspective as so many diehards make them out to be (\\"the unborn chicken voices in my head\\"--ooh, the emotional resonance!). Thom Yorke's minor key vocals, however, are perhaps the album's strongest suit, bringing a refreshing sense of melody to the table, although he tends to slur and sound dispassionate quite often, paving the way for every mopey, bedwetter British band, from Keane to Coldplay.  All in all, this is a mixed bag, and truly great albums aren't mixed bags.
B0006399FS|2.0|This is the CD that U2 should have titled \\"POP\\".  This is basically middle of the road, white bread pop.  The multitudes love this type of music.    This title, \\"How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is pretentious and out of place for this album.  With a title like that, I really expected U2 to have something to say, similar to albums like \\"War\\", \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" or \\"Joshua Tree\\". With a title like that, I expected to be challenged.  Instead, we get sappy love songs, or emotional outcryings from Bono.    I applaud groups experimenting, and changing.  We don't need another \\"Unforgettable Fire\\".  But, this album does not experiment or push the boundaries.  This is just a continuation of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\".  And that CD was just U2 conforming to the general music style of 2001.
0679735909|5.0|Great book. Did you know that there was a movie made of this book ?  It is also called \\"Possession\\".  It is available on DVD. It was the only time I have sat in a theater ,totally undone,helplessly crying my eyes out and sobbing. It will MOVE you. The movie was so beautifully done,so incredibly romantic and heartbreakingly, hauntingly beautiful.  And if any part of it reminds you,like it did me, of any person or past relationship then you will REALLY need a box of tissue and a good rest afterwards. It's worth it but you will not be the same afterwards. Poetic beyond anything I've ever seen.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is just a spectacular, classic album. Incredibly catchy, melodic, faultless. Even if you just know the singles, all of the tracks are great and could have and should have been hit singles. I could listen to it all day. If you don't own it, you need to buy it!
0307010856|5.0|This was one of my favourite books when I was younger.  Although I am not 28 years old, I still own my copy.  I've read it over the years to various children I've babysat and to my 2 boys.  They ALL love the book.  It's funny and makes you laugh.  It also is suspenseful for the first-time reader.  Great book!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Let me find out Mimi dug deep in her roots on this album. Mariah stepped her game up big time with this one. She actually sounds as if she can sing. This one is worth the money! You have to add this album to your collection
1400032717|1.0|The story of this book is actually pretty cool! I like the whole dog-murder-mystery thing, it was a very neat idea. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this little bit of story is only filler, used in-between the author's little siderants about reality and science.  It's cool, I guess any way to get a lot of people exposed to science and philosophical ideas is neat...but it's so forced that I found it a bit painful :( <br /> <br />I think it's most interesting how the author chose to deliver these spiffy thoughts of his, though. An autistic character is a clever background reason to go off on 'smart' tangents.  If only they were just-as-cleverly integrated into the story, instead of just scattering a story around them. <br /> <br />Good book I guess, if you're into that sorta thing.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Michael Bubl&eacute; shines again with this wonderful CD/DVD treat! Produced by  David Foster and Humberto Gatica and backed-up by a full big band orchestra, this is a follow-up to his successful and most raved-about CD \\"Michael Bubl&eacute;.\\"<br /><br />Listening to the CD is just terrific with eight fabulous tracks, but the DVD is a real delight watching him perform twelve timeless classics and not to mention the interview footages in between his outstanding and remarkable performances.<br /><br />One of the songs Mr. Bubl&eacute; performed on the DVD is very memorable and brings back a lot of memories to me, \\"The Way You Look Tonight,\\" which is my all-time favorite and so much a part of my life!

B000929AJQ|4.0|Overall I think it's a great CD, it lives up to the expectations we NIN fans build up between releases which in and of itself is saying quite a bit (compare to Star Wars fans' disappointment after each new movie). There's plenty here to love for us old timers and if you've never listened to NIN before you'll be inspired to find their older stuff after this one, especially if you hit STOP after Getting Smaller.    All the Love in the World  Harkens back to Pretty Hate Machine, the catchy drum-machine backbeat will be heard in dance clubs around the world for weeks to come. Lyrics are a bit fluffy for NIN but they can't all be about suicide. This sounds like Trent's \\"Friday, I'm in Love.\\" An interesting way to start, kind of a New Order Does NIN thing going on here.    You Know What You Are?  Now we're talking! Trent at his screaming, pissed off best. A bit repetitive, lyrically, but still grand fun.    The Collector  The Collector must have been a drummer, judging by the beats which open this song. More good stuff.    The Hand That Feeds  To quote the Dead Milkmen, this is another \\"Instant Club Hit\\". Trent's lyrics sound almost Cake-like at times with his neo-talking, staccato delivery, but the blaring guitar and driving beat is pure NIN.    Love is Not Enough  Sort of a nondescript NIN song but that's still better than most stuff you're going to hear on the radio.    Every Day is Exactly the Same  \\"I think I used to have a purpose, but then again that might have been a dream.  I think I used to have a voice, now I never make a sound.   I just do what I've been told.   I really don't want them to come around.\\"     The anthem of the modern office worker. I really like this one.    With Teeth  I love the growling guitar in the background but the song starts to drag after awhile.  Too bad because it's so cool at the beginning.  The little change of pace from fast to slow to fast in the middle has been done to death and breaks the brisk pacing established with the rest of the song.    Only  Kind of a Donna Summer/Depeche Mode opening here with more Cake-like talking word lyrics. But the song is saved by meaningful lyrics and a funky, Flea-like bass line.    Getting Smaller  Close your eyes and it feels like this song was ripped right off Broken. Fantastic. I think this or Every Day is Exactly the Same is my favorite song on this CD.  The guitar at the beginning of this song is breathtaking.    Sunspots  Ack, a NIN love song. Damn old age, mellowing people! I can hear Beavis saying, \\"Oh boy. I never thought it would come to this.\\" Really the song would be OK for most groups but a low spot for NIN.    The Line Begins to Blur  Either Trent is screaming at the mike from across the room or he had a cold when he recorded this---the vocals have a strange quality to them. This comes across as \\"Hurt\\"s bastard child, and I don't mean that in a good way. The chaotic guitars override the vocals and the song seems to plod along. I think he was experimenting here and, frankly, it failed.    Beside You in Time  The beginning is terribly cool through headphones and pumped up to earsplitting volumes. The droning guitar sounds like a pack of angry bees. But again the song begins to get old after awhile. It would have been a better song at half the length.    Right Where it Belongs  The obligatory slow, serious song to wrap things up. It's no \\"Hurt,\\" let me tell you.
B0007ORU66|4.0|I owned the \\"Hey Jude\\" LP several years ago and enjoyed it as just one of many Beatles albums.  Like everyone else on the planet, I have been in the process of replacing all my LPs with CDs, and realized that I was missing a Beatles album.  WHERE IN THE DICKENS IS THIS ONE?  Why is it out of print?  What is going on here?  I liked the songs on this one even though many are available elsewhere. That should hardly be a drawback, given the big sales of Beatles compilation CDs.  Besides, this one has \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\" on it- not to mention the title track.  So, I ask again...why isn't this CD easily available?
B000929AJQ|3.0|After such a long wait for Trent's album, and with just about 3 tracks that immediately KINDA stick in your head out of 13, compared to masterpieces such as DownwardSpiral, this album just seems to highlight an aging artist, a completely changed NIN, and filler music much like that interspersed throughout The Fragile. The album just doesn't have a theme, or represent anything substantial, and maybe even TRIES to be like talentless pop. Personally, I think Trent could have tapped a lot deeper into that creative abyss and pull out more of his still unrealized potential. We should have gotten something a lot better. Nothing even close to works of art such as perfectdrug, closer, we're in this together to be found here. I can't help but think that marilyn manson sounded better when \\"twiggy\\" was on board and NIN sounded better when robinfick was around , but isn't Trent the main man??
B00076ZZ84|5.0|This hybrid disc is certainly amazing in terms of flexibility. However, it is prone to scractches on both sides of the disc. The audio segment of the DVD is actually PCM. This quality does not equate to dolby digital and/or DTS surround sound. The CD layer sounds just like any other CD. Nevertheless, if you don't care about the technical specifications then I highly recommended such a wonderful album. This kind of format may become obsolete in the future anyway as they are always coming up with new,improved, and innovative ways such as a HD-DVD using blue laser. Despite all of this however, those factors do not distort the power and intensity of Avril lavigne's voice. One who enjoys her music should get this one as it contains many bonus features including popular music videos I found very intrigued. Very energized album that is highly appealing. If you have bought the original album, only get this one if you really want the videos and other extra features.
0743454537|1.0|I was somewhat caught up in the book until I realized that the lawyer's deep, dark secret was that he had epilepsy.  My daughter had epilepsy for 10 years, until she was cured by surgery here at the Mayo Clinic. As you can imagine, I know a bit about it.  First, if his epilepsy was severe enough that he could claim a service dog, it s hard to believe that no one he worked with had figured out what was wrong with him over the years.  Surely he would not have become a courtroom lawyer when he knew he could have a seizure at any moment.  Next,  when he had the seizure in the courtroom, a trained EMT would have known better than to put someting in his mouth.  The threat of swallowing his tongue is recognized as an old wive's tale.  Putting something in his mouth was more likely to break a tooth or choke him.  An EMT would have known that the only thing you could do was leave him to work through the seizure.  Finally, someone who has epilepsy cannot drive a car.  If he is doing so illegally, he certainly should not jeopardize someone else's life by having a passenger.  He would not be alert enough to avoid a bad situation.  I feel he was responsible for the girl's death.  I am sorry if I have come down hard on this author, but finding a major blunder in a book like this makes me doubt the accuracy of the rest of the book.
B00064X3BI|4.0|After his major comeback in 1974 with 461 Ocean Boulevard, Eric Clapton shied away from the mainstream with his next two releases. There's One In Every Crowd & No Reason To Cry. With Slowhand, he returned to the sounds that made 461 a hit. On his first solo album, he had a major triumph with J.J. Cale's \\"After Midnight\\". He returns to the Cale catalog for another triumph, the searing \\"Cocaine\\". The song has a propulsive riff and a ringing guitar solo. On the flip side of that is \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" which is built around his waiting for his wife to get ready for a party. The song is among the prettiest things he's ever done and it his easy picking of the guitar shows that subtle playing is just as powerful as in your face power chords. \\"Lay Down Sally\\" has a country flavor and was a big hit becoming his second top ten single and peaking at number three. The best song on the album is the lengthy \\"The Core\\". The song has some marvelous vocal interplay between Mr. Clapton and Marcy Levy and some stellar guitar work. Slowhand was a return to the top ten for Mr. Clapton reaching number three in early 1978.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|In 1995, Disney released its 33rd animated feature, Pocahontas, having cut the song \\"If I Never Knew You\\" from the motion picture. Ten years later, the folks at the House of Mouse re-add this beautiful sweeping love ballad back to this masterpiece, and the result is a feeling of satisfaction complete with goosebumps, teary eyes, and the fulfillment knowing Pocahontas is now complete. This 10th Anniversary Edition makes Pocahontas better than ever, and after viewing it, I am proud to put Pocahontas back at the top of my favourite Disney movie list. I just hope that 20 years from now, this final and complete version of the film will be the one audiences will remember, the one Disney will be promoting, the one audiences will be watching time and time again. Of all of Disney's animated full-length features, the love story found in \\"Pocahontas\\" is the most intense, the issues the most real, and the animation and music the most breath-taking and beautiful. If you've never seen Pocahontas, or haven't watched it in years, give Pocahontas: The 10th Anniversary Edition a try, and you might end up asking yourself, \\"If I never knew you...\\"
B00004RFFL|2.0|The Astronaut's Wife was bit of a disappointment, considering the make up of the cast: Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron among others!  An astronaut returns to earth after spending some time in orbit and after experiencing a mysterious two-minute blackout.  Things get a bit more complicated when he begins showing that he is a different man than the one that went into space... <br />There are some obvious elements of the X-Files that can be seen throughout the film. <br />The plot is good, but the movie is very SLOW to the point that it becomes uninteresting even when it shouldn't. <br />Both Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, as well as the rest of the cast, do a good job in trying to cover up for the mediocrity that the writers and director have shown. <br />The potential for a good movie was there if only the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!  A shame really... <br />In a nutshell, it's just an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here. 2 Stars <br />
1402573219|5.0|I ran to the bookstore to buy more of Jodi Picoult's books as soon as I finished this one! A beautifully written novel dealing with an incredibly difficult subject matter. She sympathetically presents all sides of such a provacative issue, that one sees very early on that there are no easy answers, maybe no answers at all. I don't recall being this INVOLVED in a book ever before.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed in the ending, but certainly not enough to spoil the book for me. I passed it on to my 15 year old daughter who is quickly inhaling it.<br /><br />Can't wait to read more from this very talented author.
B000929AJQ|4.0|This record is definitely the return of the Nine Inch Nails. \\"With Teeth\\" is \\"the Fragile\\" without the instrumental orchestra behind it. Trent goes back to his techno/industrial roots with this record. Very danceable music, this record is definitely melodic. In other words, sometimes very beautiful music, and other times dance crazy music.<br /><br />This record probably mostly resembles \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", and what I mean by that is this record isn't full of Metal music like \\"the Downward Spiral\\" or \\"Broken\\", so if you want a record like that, it's not this. Like I said, he goes back to his original techno/industrial vision.<br /><br />This album has memorable songs, and will no doubt at least get in the top 10 on the Billboard charts (NIN's last record \\"the Fragile\\" made it to #1 when it was released in 1999) it's hard to say which songs are the best, all of the songs are great. But my favorite songs on the album would be:<br /><br />The Hand That Feeds (a very NIN song with fast techno music)<br /><br />Everyday is Exactly the Same (a very beautiful piano song with a fantastic chorus)<br /><br />All the Love in the World (probably the best soft song on this record)<br /><br />Only (awesome song, sounds like a 1970's-80's New Wave/Funk/Techno/Disco song, probably my favorite song on this album)<br /><br />Getting Smaller (a good rock song)<br /><br />Don't worry, some of the music may be up beat, but Trent still has his famous dark lyrics. Overall, I think that most NIN fans will love this record, I do and I'm all for what ever changes Trent wants to make with his music. He goes back with this record.<br /><br />I recommend getting the dual disc version of this record. The dual disc comes with the video for \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" along with a few other extras. The video is awesome, it's NIN in the studio singing the song as the video blurs every now and then. It's a good video to watch, you get good look at Jeordie White (formally Twiggy of the band Marilyn Manson) who is now a member of Nine Inch Nails.<br /><br />So if you like his work with \\"The Pretty Hate Machine\\" then you will like this record, this is raw, original NIN that would have been if he didn't go Metal (P.S. I like the metal records he did too, so don't get me wrong). If you expected him to go back to \\"Downward Spiral\\" music, you may be a little disappointed, but I doubt it if you're a NIN fan.Marilyn Manson) who is now a member of Nine Inch Nails.  <br /> <br />So if you like his work with \\"The Pretty Hate Machine\\" then you will like this record, this is raw, original NIN that would have been if he didn't go Metal (P.S.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|This is a really good CD, I'm a slipknot fan and I won't lie I wanted to hate this CD just because it wasn't traditional slipknot, but it caught my attention and kept it, now I'm hooked on vol.3. Here's why <br /> <br />Prelude 4/5 <br />The Blister Exists 5/5  <br />Three Nil 5/5 <br />Duality 2.5/5 (Good song but it gets old really fast) <br />Opium of the People 4.5/5 <br />Circle 5/5 (one of the best acoustic songs I've ever heard) <br />Welcome 4.5/5 <br />Pulse of the Maggots 10/5 (Definitely the best song on here) <br />Before I Forget 5/5 <br />Vermillion Part 2   9/5 (The second best song) <br />The Nameless 4/5 <br />Danger - Keep Away 5/5 (A great way to end the CD) <br /> <br />Now if you're wondering why I left Vermillion and The Virus of life off is because I honestly feel those two songs should have never been added to the cd anyway. They were both SO LAME and so out of place I didn't even want to get into describing how bad they were. All in All this Cd is truly Slipknot's best, it isn't Mate Feed Kill Repeat (Which sucked), Or their self titled (Which loses your attention after the 6th song), or Iowa (where every song sounds just a like and drags on forever), It's a whole new level slipknot hasn't reached until now. I'd reccomend it for anyone. <br />
B0006ICF9A|5.0|On Out Of Time, R.E.M. moved into the slot of the biggest rock band in the world. The album was an unqualified success on all fronts and R.E.M. showed that they could mix up their sound, have a big commercial hit and still retain their artistic credibility. The one sound that is strongly utilized on Out Of Time is Peter Buck's mandolin. It drives many of the songs including the album's smash hit \\"Losing My Religion\\". That song became the band's most successful single ever, peaking at number 4 and the accompanying video has become an all-time classic. Despite its hit status, the song sounded nothing like any of the songs on Top 40 radio at the time and quite frankly since. They incorporate hip hop into the album's opening song \\"Radio Song\\" as Boogie Down Production's KRS-One provides his biting commentary to the song and his deep and rough voice melds perfectly with Michael Stipe's softer sound. \\"Half A World Away\\" is a beautiful song driven by a haunting harpsichord while \\"Low\\" is a deep, pulsating track. Fellow Athenian Kate Pierson from The B-52's provides vocals on two tracks. The first is \\"Shiny Happy People\\" which is just as upbeat and bouncy as the title suggests. The song was the second top ten single from the album peaking at number 10. The second is the album's closer, the much more intense \\"Me And Honey\\". The song has a driving guitar and Ms. Pierson provides a moaning background vocal. \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" is a gorgeous track with layered vocals that reminds you of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. \\"Belong\\" is a spoken word song that is built around a thumping bass line and a soaring chorus of \\"whoahs\\" being layered together. \\"Endgame\\" is a guitar rich instrumental, \\"Texarkana\\" has a lead vocal from Mike Mills and \\"Country Feedback\\" has ringing guitar work from Mr. Buck. Out Of Time also finds the band juggling instruments where drummer Bill Berry plays bass or guitar on some songs, Mr. Mills works alot on keyboards and Mr. Buck tries his hand on the skins. Out Of Time became the band's first number one album despite the fact that they did not have an extensive tour to support it. The success was based on the fact that it quite simply was a tremendous album by a band who had clearly grew into their creative peak. Out Of Time has the curious distinction of being the number one album on Billboard's first Sound Scan chart (which more accurately reflects sales) and the only album to hit number one pre and post Sound Scan eras.  The 5.1 mix is excellent and the documentary is a revealing look into the recording of the album.  The landmark video for \\"Losing My Religion\\" is also included.Out Of Time became the band's first number one album despite the fact that they did not have an extensive tour to support it.

079073253X|5.0|Sleepers brings to the screen the story of four boys from Hell's Kitchen, N.Y., in the late 60's, who end up at Wilkinson School for Boys, where they are systematically and repeatedly abused by several of the prison guards. <br />It is a film about human relations, hope, and second chances, but most importantly about trust, innocence, friendship, divine justice, and inner strength.   <br />All the actors, (Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Kevin Bacon and Dustin Hoffman among others) without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few tears.  Consequently, it is an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.   <br />The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.  <br />I strongly disagree with the \\"official reviewer,\\" Jeff Shannon, about the film's \\"dubious emphasis on homophobic revenge.\\"  No further comment is needed... <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Sleepers is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!
B000002H33|1.0|I've never understood the appeal of Metallica.  While early '80s bands with much more integrity and musical chops like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Ratt, Iron Maiden, Saxon and Styx were virtually ignored during that time period, Metallica somehow managed to steal all the critics' adoring headlines - and sell gazillions of records in the process. <br /> <br />Metallica's girlish lyrics and sluggish sound on \\"Master\\" come off as lazy, dull, and sluggish by today's rock-metal standards.  A better record to purchase would be \\"Velvet Revolver\\" by Guns 'n Roses.  It's got the guy from STP singing on it and it's really quite good.  Grunge has always ruled and that would be the way to go, in my opinion. <br /> <br />SKIP THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />LATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000929AJQ|2.0|well, i live in japan and the cd came out a month before it was released in the states...  i wish i could have warned anybody about getting this cd because it is truly sad.  i wasn't expecting another broken or the downward spiral and definately another fragile (which was also sad by the way).  it's just not up to par with what i think reznor can actually do.  what happened to orginality?  anyways, the japanese release came out with three bonus tracks that are by far way better than the first thirteen tracks that came out on the u.s. version and that's the only reason why i gave this two stars.
B00064X282|5.0|461 Ocean Boulevard was the first studio album Eric Clapton recorded after he kicked his heroin habit. Unlike the tortured passion of Layla, the album finds Mr. Clapton still not completely satisfied, but with a more positive outlook. The album opens with a blistering take on the traditional song \\"Motherless Children\\" follow-up by the compassionate \\"Give Me Strength\\". His remake of the Johnny Otis classic \\"Willie & The Hand-Jive\\" is loose and fun. On \\"Get Ready\\", he duets with his backup singer Yvonne Elliman (pre Saturday Night Fever) on a simmering, bluesy number that has call and response vocals backed by a driving guitar riff. He practically introduced Bob Marley to the white rock audience with his percolating take on Marley's \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\". By combining the song's reggae roots with rock, Mr. Clapton made a memorable song that became his first and only number one hit. Ms. Elliman backup vocals provide the backbone for the sweet \\"Let It Grow\\". The album closes with the burning \\"Mainline Florida\\" in which Mr. Clapton lets it all hang out. 461 Ocean Boulevard was his first number album and re-established Eric Clapton as a musical force.

B000002JSR|5.0|It never got much better for Zeppelin after this monumental effort.  \\"Coda\\" is undoubtedly the singular record fans think of when reflecting on this band's very up and down career.  Mention Led Zeppelin and the average joe walking down the street will think one thing: Coda. <br /> <br />These English hoodlums scored big with Coda, selling a never-seen-before 15 million copies of the album in Canada alone, and spawning an unprecedented 7 number-one singles. <br /> <br />Why did \\"Coda\\" sell so big?  Likely because Page was told not to play much on the record, due to his strung-out status, and, likewise, Plant was told to just shut up for once in his stinkin' life.  Thus, bassist John Paul Jones was cut loose, and the results are fantastic.  John Bonham's contribution to \\"Coda\\" was, as ever, nonexistent, but who really cares?  The guy never showed up for work half the time anyway!!!!!!! <br /> <br />For true Zeppelin masterpieces pick this one up, and don't miss out on '74's gem \\"Presence.\\"  You won't find better albums available on today's Internet.   <br /> <br />By the way, does anyone know when Roth is reuniting with his bandmates in Halen?  Word is he could be back soon. <br /> <br />Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!
B0006399FS|3.0|After 2 years of recording process, after all those noises, rumours and promises of the \\"punk rock made on Venus\\", U2 suddenly released almost identical copy of their previous and the most insipid U2 album All That You Can't Live Behind. Well, maybe we should have guessed, because of the similarity in titles.  <br />Disappointment and deja vu - these are two main feelings, that Bomb lefts. And deja vu is the strongest one. Being a mistake in itself, Bomb, however, looks like an attempt to correct errors of the ATYCLB. As the result some songs are indecently similar in construction and sometimes even in tunes! For example Miracle Drug looks like the slowed-down version of Beautiful Day, Sometimes... is a remake of Peace on Earth. The most evident case of self-copying is rumbs, which consists simply of shuffled and stuck together quotes from Electrical Storm and Walk On. <br />The weakest track on the album is a grammy-winning single Vertigo, which is the most straight, and the most unoriginal U2 song ever. And by the way, it has noting in common with the Boy album (except, maybe, bridge is a little similar to the Stories for Boys) which in itself was 10 times greater than this so called \\"punk rock made on Venus\\". <br />Anyway, the main problem of the Bomb (as well as ATYCLB) is lack of idea and originality. It seems that with ALTYCLB an HTDAAB the band just lost its face. You see, you don't have to be U2 to make such records. We've already heard it from Coldplay, Keane and many others. <br />Few years ago (6 or 7) they've announced their \\"back to basics\\". Have they ever thought since than, that maybe there's no way back? <br />
B0002858YS|4.0|Las Vegas' The Killers are rooted in 80's new wave style and their debut album Hot Fuss is filled with catchy riffs and synth flourishes that call to mind Depeche Mode, Duran Duran & this revival sound's godfathers, The Cure.  The first single, \\"Somebody Told Me\\", is wickedly catchy tale of an androgynous relationship that perfectly captures the feel of those 80's New Romantics.  \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\" opens the album up with a chunky riff and \\"Mr. Brightside\\" has creepy lyrics over a sterling melody.  \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" and \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" are more synth based and has the deep, dreamy quality of the Cure while \\"Midnight Show\\" has the dark, dancability of early Duran Duran.  Hot Fuss is a nice distillation of 80's music that The Killers add their own touches to for a pleasant blending of sounds and styles.
B0007XT87G|4.0|Though Porcupine Tree has moved from being a kind of 90's Pink Floyd to having a much heavier metal sound, it is music that respects our intellects, and is very rewarding musically. <br /> <br />Deadwing is perhaps even darker than \\"In Absentia,\\" and has fewer melodic hooks, but I still feel it is a fine album. <br /> <br />Indeed, content is not what I am posting this review for.  I just want to alert the buyer to the fact that this album has been mixed in such a way that it clips out your speakers constantly. <br /> <br />I rendered the songs as waveforms in a music editing program, and they were all way off the chart.  In order to give the impression of being a loud album with an extremely powerful sound, they inadvertently made this album distorted.  I had to personally finish the mastering process myself by attenuating every song. <br /> <br />So, if you have a decent stereo system with some power in it, you may want to consider doing the same before playing this album.  Until I fixed the songs, I couldn't enjoy them at all!
B0007O38F8|1.0|Similar to Eminem, I got a lot of respect for 50, but released a whack-ass album. This is not worth your money.

In My Hood - voice and beat are annoying; terrible intro song for the album. 3/10<br /><br />3. This is 50 - this is the current 50; overly whack. 2/10<br /><br />4. I'm Supposed to Die Tonight - great Eminem beat. talks about he may die in his tonight. first good song on the album. 9/10<br /><br />5. Piggy Bank - ok song, but not exactly perfect for a dis. 7/10<br /><br />6. Gatman and Robbin (featuring Eminem) - great, and the only, Em/50 collabo on this album. 10/10<br /><br />7. Candy Shop (featuring Olivia) - you all heard this before; way overplayed. 6/10<br /><br />8. Outta Control - great Dre beat. this is definitely hot enough to be a single. 9/10<br /><br />9. Get In My Car - ...and let me kill you for making this F---ING song. 2/10<br /><br />10. Ski Mask Way - just skip this one; the first split-second is not even worth hearing. 0/10<br /><br />11. A Baltimore Love Thing - another skippable track, but not as bad as the last one. 2/10<br /><br />12. Ryder Music - another gangsta NOT riding to this. 3/10<br /><br />13. Disco Inferno - definitely overrated. song sucks, but catch the (X-rated) music video. 4/10<br /><br />14. Just a Lil' Bit - the current single; as of right now, it is not overplayed so I still like this song. 9/10<br /><br />15. Gunz Come Out - killer Dre beat. Favorite song on the album; brings back the old 50. 10/10<br /><br />16. My Toy Soldier (featuring Tony Yayo) - don't like Yayo, Eminem beat gets annoying, and 50 should work on his rhymes for a song like this. 1/10<br /><br />17. Position of Power - another whack-ass song. 3/10<br /><br />18. Build You Up (featuring Jamie Foxx) - after awhile, you begin to forget that the other voice is that of Jamie Foxx's because he has a MUCH better voice on Slow Jamz. Should have Nate Dogg, Jaheim or R. Kelly or any other better \\"R&B singer sings the hook to a rap song\\" dude. 5/10<br /><br />19. God Gave Me Style - I love this song.

B00005JNQ8|4.0|This is an excellent film, but you can't just go along for the ride.  It's not a \\"Sahara\\", it's not brain candy.  You have to pay attention and make an effort to comprehend the issues the characters face in order to understand their behavior.  One reviewer noted that Sean Penn's character seemed, at times, disinterested.  That's because he was!  His character is troubled over a recent tragedy and he's distracted -- and Penn plays it well.  The main characters in this film are arriving at the center point of the story from completely different directions and that makes the film interesting.  This is not Penn and Kidman unite to conquer the bad guys, this is Penn and Kidman dodging and weaving... and who are the bad guys, anyway?  This may not be Pollack at his very best, but he's certainly near the top of his game.  Sean Penn is an excellent actor and he does a great job in this film, he plays his role very well, tormented characters seem to be a natural for him.  I'm not a great fan of Kidman, but she turns in a good performance and was well cast.  All in all, it is a very good film and one worth seeing on the big screen.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day's American Idiot has been compared to The Who's classic rock operas and The Kinks' sharp and crafty songwriting and those comparisons are well deserved.  But the punk fire and political passion remind one of the power and urgency of The Clash.  The songs on the album deal with the current political climate and the paranoia and fear of living in the current world.  While the tone of the album is downcast, the music is soaring and sonically moving. It shows tremendous growth as the band is more than just three punks thrashing around on guitar, bass and drums.  The lyrics show Billie Joe Armstrong's usual sarcastic wit, but have deeper meaning and cutting incite.  The album is best listened to straight through, but songs like the brilliant title track, \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\", \\"St. Jimmy\\" and the pretty \\"Wake Me When September Comes\\" standout on their own.  American Idiot is one of the best rock albums to come out in a long time and Green Day deserves all the accolades they received and then some.
B000002GQH|4.0|I have loved The Moody Blues ever since 1987 when I was in the fifth grade.  I was awakened to their strikingly different sound when I first heard \\"Question\\" on KLSX 97.1, at the time Southern California's classic rock radio station.  I've had a deep love affair with their music ever since.  \\"On The Threshold of a Dream\\" has long been a favorite of mine.  It's rich musical tapestries will sooth you from a hard day at work that's for sure.  Please don't pay any mind to those saying that there is \\"filler\\" on this album.  There's not a stitch of it!  My personal favorite on this record has (and always will be) \\"Send Me No Wine.\\"  It's upbeat carefree melody and harmonies have lifted me from out of a \\"blue funk\\" many a time.  It saddens me to read that people don't care for this tune very much.  This album is classic Moody Blues...as is many of their other L.P.s.  As a kid I used to get those Salesian Inspirational Books (little Catholic poem booklets that contained beautiful artwork), read them and look at the paintings while listening to The Moody Blues...this album in particular.  Their music flowed right along with the country scenes in the booklets and would take me to peaceful places in my mind.  I still occasionally do that too because The Moody Blues are all about peaceful places.  Buy this album and let The Moodies escort you somewhere far away!

0823016714|5.0|Capturing a person's expression is often the key to a successful illustration.  Sometimes you have to translate your own features from a reflection and apply them to the face you're drawing.  This book alleviates a lot of guesswork and opens up scores of options with the variety of kinds of faces included, the range of distrortion the models allow, and the multitude of angles from which we see the faces.  What's great about the collection is it isn't just faces, it's the other details that can sometimes present challenges, from hairstyles to types of shirts and collars, to a specific section devoted to various hats and headgear.  All these seemingly obvious things are necessary to include at one time or another, and can present challenges to an artist.  Just a sliver of the possible interpretations are included in the book as well, as several artists have contributed sketches based on the actual photos you see.  Caricatures, animal characters, sculptures, it goes on and on.   <br />     I see this as one of the few staple books for any artist to keep on their shelf, that covers a broad ground within a single volume.
B0008ISM40|3.0|Keeping in mind the much publicised and turbulent spiral of personal problems that T.Reznor found himself in the past few years, it's actually remarkable that he came up with an album at all. <br />I read recently in an interview of his that he considered himself lucky to be alive.  <br />\\"With Teeth\\" is obviously not a great album nor is it a bad one. It's somewhere in the middle, and where that middle might be depends solely on the ears of the beholder. People who are over-praising this release are either not aware of the NIN history or are simply displaying over-dedicated fanship. But for anyone who's listened to Pretty Hate Machine, Fragile and Downward Spiral, this album here can't honestly compare in depth, quality, diversity or creativity. <br /> <br />   Because we happen to be talking about one of the most important bands on the planet currently, views are bound to be complicated. White Teeth is unfortunate as an album in that sense, because whether one likes it or not, it will be compared to past NIN masterpieces. If that weren't the case it might have faired better. But music is inevitably burdened by the comparison syndrome, that will hardly ever change. <br /> <br />   This album's main problem, is that while it contains three high caliber tracks it also has loads of rather generic ones in between, tracks that dont seem to stick to your mind. Interestingly enough i'm refering to three tracks placed at the very beginning and at the very end of it. <br /> <br />    When it comes to the lyrics, some people claimed that Reznor appears upbeat. I seriously dont know how they concluded that. The lyrics are characteristically NINish, dark, angsty, desperate, screamy, agonising. Nothing wrong with that of course. If anyone has defined angst and darkness lyrically in contemporary music it surely is the man behind NIN. <br /> <br />    What misses here is songs that stand out. On the other hand, the effect that some NIN albums have is that the more you listen to them the more the songs grow on you and you discover unseen at first qualities in them. I know this from personal experience as well. If that happens to be the case with \\"With Teeth\\" it's something that i can't yet judge even if i've already heard the album several times.  <br /> <br />   What currently really matters is not all this. What matters is that Reznor comes out of his adventure stronger. Music needs him more desperately than he can sing despair himself.  <br />

B000002KE2|4.0|Vol. 4 (1972.), Black Sabbath's fourth studio album<br /><br />'Volume 4', Black Sabbath's fourth studio album, released in 1972 marked the beginning of a transitional period for the band. Black Sabbath were pretty much unique with their sound in the early 1970's; the godfathers of heavy metal were louder than most and had a distinctive sound which no other band really came near to having a similarity to. However, after producing three albums ('Black Sabbath', 'Paranoid' and 'Master of Reality') with their classic, straight out heavy and powerful style, Black Sabbath decided to start to diversify and add some different styles to their music. 'Volume 4' was the end result and Black Sabbath certainly did not let any of their fans down with their diverse style on this album!<br /><br />Very simply, 'Volume 4' brings the house down from start to finish. I find this Black Sabbath album to be a particularly great listen every time I play it because, as I have already pointed out, it has so much to offer. It has the riff-packed, heavy rocker styled tracks that we all know Black Sabbath for, whilst throwing in some different effects. There's tracks with guitar experimentation and also some lighter, but still very powerful songs. I also find with this album that, certainly in the case of the heavier tracks, there is great consistency throughout the album. Some of these are top draw rock songs, with some mean guitar riffs. Toni Iommi shows again why he is a guitar legend - jamming out some classic solos, such as on 'Snowblind'. Ozzy Osbourne puts his mark on the tracks in classic fashion - especially on the piano driven 'Changes' track - not bad seen as he was just recovering from severe laryngitis whilst making this album!<br /><br />The remaster for 'Volume 4' is pretty solidly done, as is true for practically all of the Sabbath remasters. The 10 songs on the album have been remastered very well, however sadly no rarities or extra tracks have been added to exemplify this pretty creative period for the band. The inner booklet you get is very much like the LP original, which displayed various pictures of the band in concert, aswell as the song lyrics. However it also does contain some info. about the making of the album and Sabbath's touring activities at the time.<br /><br />There's nothing weak about this album, the songs range from good to doubly excellent. 'Wheels of Confusion' starts the album off in great rocking fashion. This 8 minute epic is packed with great riffs and excellent vocals. It build to a great climax with an excellent outro. the end part of the track is often called 'The Straightener'. 'Tomorrow's Dream' follows were the first track left off in great style. Next up is 'Changes' which is were we begin to see a break from the Sabbath norm. Here its just Ozzy, a piano and a mellotron - its a great change of pace on the album and its title sums up the developing style of the band. 'FX' is an interesting follow up - 2 minutes of experimenting on the guitar ... i think, with various cracking and tapping noises - nothing amazing but I definitely admire the idea to experiment! Then we return to the classic matal sound of Iommi's guitar with 'Supernaut' and this is followed up by 'Snowblind', a real classic with a real atmospheric style. 'Cornucopia' is more downbeat and 'Laguna Surprise' is another change of style. Its softer, with acoustic guitar styles - its pretty hypnotic when you listen to it. 'St. Vitus Dance' and 'Under the Sun' rock out the album, the latter is truly excellent. Some of the riffs are like something you'd hear from a punk band except .... punk hadn't arrived yet so it just shows you how ahead of their time and influential Sabbath were!<br /><br />Black Sabbath's Volume 4 is a refreshing and captivating effort. Personally I would say it just lacks that killer factor that other Sabbath albums have but nevertheless its a great album and it is great to see the band experimenting and trying out different styles because lets face it, all the great bands have that ability to change and never make their music have a replicated feel to it! I would recommend 'Volume 4' to any Sabbath fan or to any fan of heavy metal in general.t bands have that ability to change and never make their music have a replicated feel to it!

B000929AJQ|5.0|This cd is definitely one of those types that grows on you.  The more you listen to it, the more it's beauty and lyrics start to make sense.  I cannot stop listening to it.  I love each and every one of the songs in a different way.  For those of you who are expecting the angry downward spiral material, you wont find it here.  But you can give this a try and be open minded.  With lyrics like, \\"Are you sure what side of the glass you are on...what if all the worlds inside of your head are just creations of your own...What if everything around you isn't quite as it seems, what if all the world you think you know, is an elaborate dream?\\"  This is lyrically BRILLIANT!  Sure it sounds different from previous works, but isn't that what makes an artist brilliant?  How boring to have the same material over and over disguised as new work!  Take a chance, be open minded, listen to it a few times, and it will grow on you.

However it also does contain some info. about the making of the album and Sabbath's touring activities at the time.<br /><br />There's nothing weak about this album, the songs range from good to doubly excellent. 'Wheels of Confusion' starts the album off in great rocking fashion. This 8 minute epic is packed with great riffs and excellent vocals. It build to a great climax with an excellent outro. the end part of the track is often called 'The Straightener'. 'Tomorrow's Dream' follows were the first track left off in great style. Next up is 'Changes' which is were we begin to see a break from the Sabbath norm. Here its just Ozzy, a piano and a mellotron - its a great change of pace on the album and its title sums up the developing style of the band. 'FX' is an interesting follow up - 2 minutes of experimenting on the guitar ... i think, with various cracking and tapping noises - nothing amazing but I definitely admire the idea to experiment! Then we return to the classic matal sound of Iommi's guitar with 'Supernaut' and this is followed up by 'Snowblind', a real classic with a real atmospheric style. 'Cornucopia' is more downbeat and 'Laguna Surprise' is another change of style. Its softer, with acoustic guitar styles - its pretty hypnotic when you listen to it. 'St. Vitus Dance' and 'Under the Sun' rock out the album, the latter is truly excellent. Some of the riffs are like something you'd hear from a punk band except .... punk hadn't arrived yet so it just shows you how ahead of their time and influential Sabbath were!<br /><br />Black Sabbath's Volume 4 is a refreshing and captivating effort. Personally I would say it just lacks that killer factor that other Sabbath albums have but nevertheless its a great album and it is great to see the band experimenting and trying out different styles because lets face it, all the great bands have that ability to change and never make their music have a replicated feel to it! I would recommend 'Volume 4' to any Sabbath fan or to any fan of heavy metal in general.great bands have that ability to change and never make their music have a replicated feel to it!

B000002952|5.0|The lovely shot of Gloria you're looking at is not misleading. The music inside is just as beautiful as the artist. Gloria has long used Spanish music to let her artistic soul flourish and this is her  masterpiece. This album is filled with beauty. If you love music and you want to hear the best of what it has to offer from around the world, then this is a perfect place to start.<br /><br />Once the beautiful \\"With the Years That I Have Left\\" starts we are transported to an elegant and exotic club somewhere in South America. The sun has faded and a tropical moon has taken its place. The glossy hardwood counters are polished to perfection and the cherry finish complements a scattering of sego palms and Spanish lilies as wine glasses are filled with only the finest vintage.<br /><br />Gloria's rich and emotional vocals surround the room and are backed by a lush orchestra and breezy spanish guitars. So rich is the atmosphere we can almost feel her moving around the room and smiling as she passes by our small table. The songs move from love of one's homeland to romantic love lost or waiting, and everything in-between.<br /><br />Gloria fills this room with her magical phrasing of a beautiful language. We hear so many wonderful songs we dare not leave and miss a moment. There are songs of forgiveness and hope, and songs of true love and hanging on 'till the one lost to you returns. One song, the light and playful \\"Si Senor!\\" conjurs up images of the Andrew Sisters and another time.<br /><br />One of the prettier songs we hear before our time in this moonlit paradise is over is \\"Volveras\\" (You'll Be Back). Gloria knows the man leaving her for another and taking her heart with him will be back, because he can't erase her memory. But we know it's only a song. No one could be foolish enough to leave this Cuban flower.<br /><br />And all at once, it is over, and like all vacations, it has ended much too quickly. But what we've seen and heard has enriched and expanded our world. We want to come back once in awhile to feel like this again. Lucky for us we own this little keepsake of our time with Gloria in tropical paradise.d. We want to come back once in awhile to feel like this again.

B000929AJQ|3.0|<br />Mind you, three stars are not bad.  Most radio friendly bands would not have fared as well.   <br /> <br />While 'With Teeth' is not a rerun is music marathons, it is not exactly what the fans were sitting around waiting five years for.  The problem here is more of a music genre-shift than an actual \\"you-have-a-lack-of-talent album\\".  The talent is still here and Reznor is still delivering his melodic singing.   <br /> <br />While Reznor's singing and screaming have always pretty much been the big delivery in all NIN album's (and it surprisingly still works here), the other things we enjoyed like \\"heavy-metal guitars\\", \\"dark industrial\\", and the twisted, thought-provoking images of the lyrics, are all faded memories.  The music is no longer complex, loud, heavy-rock oriented, and harsh.   <br /> <br />Many will compare this release to NIN's first album, the Pretty Hate Machine for the obvious trait that both albums possess:  Pop hooks.  Not only that, but the songs follow the basic song structure that even the lamest of music lovers (radio listeners) must have spontaneously realized by now. <br /> <br />I'd expect this cd to come directly after Pretty Hate Machine instead of the amazingly heavy and melodic Broken, the masterpiece Downward Spiral, and the brilliant Fragile.  These cd's listed above needed time to grow on the listener, but the songs on this new album are quite catchy and repetitive.  Problem is that to be a 'masterpiece' a cd must be capable of being spontaneously listened to time and time again, and the 'With Teeth' approach is going to produce the exact opposite effects. <br /> <br />The lyrics don't help either.  Trent is back and he is using his favorite words such as: closer, broken, apart, and every other word that ever caught your ear in past releases: they have returned to stay - permanently.  You'll be convinced that besides the fact Trent is complaining that he does not feel he has a voice; he really isn't trying to find a new approach or new methods of thought to present to his audience. <br /> <br />And the lyrics have somewhat of a child aesthetic to them: \\"No, no you didn't\\", and \\"flip-flop, flip-flop.\\"  And then there's a song with a chorus that goes \\"On and On and On and On and On and On\\".....certainly not something you will be singing over and over......you'll be to busy trying to forget. <br /> <br />At least the songs \\"With Teeth\\" and \\"Love is not enough\\" kicks major ass:  it has both the heavy music, and the NIN vocal delivery that one would expect.  The rest of the album sounds pretty depressive and slow to me - and this doesn't work to well - I'm not depressed, and it sounds like a lot of whining is going on.  The Revolver press release has Trent even admitting he is quite happy at the moment.....I've not a problem with this, but I didn't need to know that - it's obvious if you've listened. <br /> <br />Overall, I still like the cd and I still love the band. The cd is missing the small lyrical/album insert, and Trent himself said these songs were his quickest to write - which I conclude that the costs of 'the Fragile' proved to be to great for it's lack of sales (but now we see what REALLY sells).  Luckily, I'm sure Trent can redeem himself with a little more cash-flow from this record (currently #5 on Amazon; date: 05/05/05), and hopefully when he does he will create something truly amazing like all of his past releases- <br /> <br />Newbie's be damned. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1400032717|3.0|I feel this book does paint what I understand to be an accurate portrayal of autism and should be applauded for the effort. As far as entertainment, however, and giving the feeling that you're curling up with a \\"good\\" book that you can't wait to finish, I was bored. I therefore, can't recommend it as a great read, but can label it a curiosity and can see how some readers enjoyed it so much. Primarly because it's so unusual. <br /> <br />I wanted to like it more.
B0007TKNIS|2.0|Where do I begin?  The stage design, costumes, lighting, etc. are fabulous. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is miscast or misdirected, even though I think he gave it his all.  He is too handsome and not nearly ugly enough under the mask, and he smiles too much.  The Phantom doesn't smile! He needed to be weirder, more sinister, and frightening, with a little perversity thrown in, yet still sexy. My main complaint is the last, and most important scene of the movie - it is all wrong, and I blame the director.  The Phantom cries like a wimp, and the kiss scene between him and Christine is terrible.  If you are a fan of the play/musical, as I am,than of course you must see the movie, however,it had such potential to be really fabulous with just a few changes, but was such a disappointment.
B000003TB6|5.0|For musical snobs such as myself an album is considered a success if even three out of ten tracks stand out. In my opinion DYWM is not only The Roots' best album (with the exception of Organix, which I have not yet had the honour of obtaining), but is also one of the greatest works to have come out of the Jazz-Hop era. <br /> <br />As many of you would have heard, DYWM was recorded with 100% live instrumentation, and this works to perfection. In fact, this is the only hip-hop album with which I have found myself singing along to the instrumental lines, taking no heed of the lyrics. The instrumental lines are sharp, but never intrusive upon Black Thought's and Malik B's flow; jazzy enough to give the songs a unique texture, but not over-intricate to distract the listener from the vocals. <br /> <br />Black Thought and Malik B are perhaps one of the most made-for-each-other duos in hip-hop, bouncing off one another effortlessly on each track. Their lyrical presentation is crisp and fresh and provides a delicious counterpoint to the smooth, flowing instrumental lines. Both rappers have mastered the art of tonal variation (something not seen these days in commercial rap) and use it with wonderful effect on tracks such as Mellow My Man and Essaywhuman. <br /> <br />One of the great strengths of Do You Want More is that it has a near-perfect balance of quality music and accessibility, making it a great gateway album for those interested in The Roots or hip-hop in general. I would recommend this album to anyone - even those that are not yet into hip-hop. DYWM provides a great sample of The Roots' musical ability and will certainly leave you wanting more.   <br />
B00007G1ZM|5.0|This is perhaps the best performace by Joan Crawford, as she portrays a loving mother of the child that is every other woman's nightmare--Veda. Though the movie chronicles Mildred's rise to success, spoiled Veda is the motivation and uniquely disturbing character. Mildred is a magnet for lying and cheating intimate friends and family. Though the movie is in black and white, costumes, the cinematography and lighting are spectacular. MILDRED PIERCE must be good; it beat out LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN for an Academy Award! This is a true classic. <br /> <br />The flip side of the CD includes the underside of Joan Crawford told by her adopted daughter, coworkers, and intimate companions. The nearly one-hour-long filmography and documentary reveals her birth name, troubled past, rise to stardom from a dancer through the era of silent films and into the \\"talkies,\\" her fight to remain relevant in the face of rival stars, immoral life, abuse to her children--apparently adopted as a public relations stunt, and--through her own eyes--eventual downfall and reclusiveness. <br /> <br />Movie quote: \\"Personally, Veda's convinced me that alligators have the right idea. They eat their young.\\"
B0007TKNL0|4.0|The filmed version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is a good adaptation of the stage show. The visuals are fantastic, and the score sounds the best it ever has, with a 110 piece orchestra. While some may not like Gerard Butler's phantom because of his lack of musical experience, he does deliver well enough. I'm not going to say too much about the film itself, as most have formed their opinions and giving my 2 cents here won't do much for that. All I'll say whether or not you like the stage version already, this film won't change your opionion greatly either way.  <br /> <br />One minor problem I have with this film is technical. While I understand that pre-recording the voices is necessary, I found it easy at times to spot where the pre-record and the filmed action singing wasn't synched very well. Also, the lack of ambient sound really made the pre-recorded sound stand out at times. Example: with all that water in the phantom's lair, I'd think you'd hear some if it at some point... <br /> <br />Besides this one minor point, the film looks great on DVD, and the sound is as lush and full as one would expect. <br /> <br />Regarding the special features, the best I can say is: Not Bad. Included is a trailer on the first disk, but no commentary track (MAJOR DVD no-no...). In the second disk you get a 1 hr documentary about the origin of the stage version, and about 45 minutes of behind the scenes footage, both of which are quite good. I would have like to have seen more, but maybe I've been spoiled by the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions. Also inlcuded is a deleted scene: \\"No One Would Listen,\\" a song sung by the phantom which was the first version of \\"Learn to be Lonely\\" before it was cut for pacing reasons in the film. Also, one easter egg can be found (I won't spoil it here). Finally, the case states there is also a link to the \\"Phantom's Online World.\\" It suggests that there are some DVD-Exclusive extas online, but as of the date of this review, all I could find was a link to the official website, which anyone can see.  Again, I would have liked to have seen more, such as other deleted scenes (if any exist), or a documentary about adaptation process from the stage version to the screen (what the took out, what they kept, why, etc...), or maybe a feature about the visual effects of the movie (especially the chandelier during the 'Overture'), or even some simple production photos.  <br /> <br />Despite the lack of tons of extras, the only thing I will really miss is the lack of any commentary track. There are some basic expectations for major studio DVDs today, and a commentary track is one of them.  <br /> <br />In the end, this speical edition presents the film with enough extras to barely justify the extra money spent. Unfortunatly, many will probably spend the extra money just for the 2.5 minute deleted scene since it's on the 2nd disk.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|This is an odd movie; one worth seeing, but not buying.  Natalie Portman is completely unbelievable as a stripper.  I don't understand how she was nominated for an Oscar.  I think she really whimped out in not having any nude scenes.  It only made the character less believable.  Mike Nicholas, the director miscast her.  Julia Roberts looks very, very homely, and I am being kind, yet the 2 men in the movie keep saying how beautiful she is.  Jude Law is good, but Clive Owen if terrific.  He commands the screen, and is the main reason to watch this movie.  He is sexy and doesn't make a false move, well maybe one, where he tells Alice to stop smoking.  Anyway, I didn't believe the storyline one bit.  It was absurd, but somehow it is still an interesting movie.  The scene between Law and Owen on the sex website is hilarious.    PS  If you are a Clive Owen fan, buy 'Beyond Borders' with Angelina Jolie.  He is so good that words fail me, and the movie, despite bad reviews, is very entertaining.

B000092T6M|2.0|Another Hollywood action-packed/lightweight-acting movie seeking to modernize and glamorize history.  I give one star to the film for Alan Rickman who was really the only good actor in this film.  Otherwise, the film is an overblown super-hero comic book adaptation of the Robin Hood lore that is so Americanized (particularly with Costner's guttural accent)that it's inadvertently comical.  The ridiculous inclusion of Morgan Freeman as the Moor sidekick was nothing more than Hollywood PC brownie points to make sure everybody is fairly represented even though a Muslim/Moor in England at that time would not have been very well received with the Third Crusade going on against the Infidel; but never mind all that, this is Hollywood fantasy after all even though they try to pose it as real history.  The screenplay was OK but a good part of the script was nothing but a bunch of Hollywood jingoisms oversaturated with utterances of 'Freedom!; 'Our rights'; 'Liberty!' Unfortunately Hollywood forgets that the Magna Carta was not the Constitution and Saxon nobles were not the founders of the Republic. Hollywood seems to forget the fact that peasants were still serfs at the time bound to serve their Norman/Saxon lords without many rights or much representation as to anything. Robin of Locksley didn't change that status quo nor did he seem to care to: in those days the axe continued to drop quickly to sever the heads of the impertinent without much fanfare about personal rights.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This is the absolute best movie made in many years. An avid movie watcher, I must deem this the ultimate action movie. The movie really PULLS you into the storyline; surrounding you with the extraordinary array of adventure. The effects in the movie are incrdible, and the actors do a wonderful job portraying their characters. Although an action film, the segments of romance are really quite necessary to emphasize the true importance of the werewolf; and how the changed instincts take over the mind enough to disarray thinking and hurt a lover. The music also plays an important part of the film. It is fantastic, and sets the perfect mood  for every scene. Both Hugh Jackman, and especially Kate Beckinsale do a great job in the movie; and David Wenham's small humor twists liven up the film enough to save it from being pure horror and action. Definetly a movie worth watching continuously and buying!

B000929AJQ|4.0|As a long time Reznor fan, I'm not going to over analyze this record. If you take it for what it is, it's a solid release with a couple of exceptional tracks. \\"Sunspots\\" and \\"Only\\" are probably the highlights of this album, being departures from most of his previous work and possibly pointing us into the future of his music. He has openly stated that this is only a transitional release and he already has most of the material for his next album (next year sometime) in rough form. The fact is this is not his best album..but it is solid and contains a little bit for every NIN fan. Whether PHM, Broken or TDS was your favorite flavor, there is something on this record you'll enjoy. To those who are so \\"disappointed\\", what exactly were you expecting? The {name your fav NIN album} all over again? A completely new sound? Either one of those type albums would've alienated just as many if not more fans for various reasons. The fact is that after some time off, Trent is giving all of us a little something to savor while pointing us into the future of his music to come. It hasn't left my cd player since I bought it, so ultimately it has passed the only real test with flying colors.

0316172324|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's follow-up to \\"The Tipping Point\\" is not just an interesting read. He tells us how companies try to get inside our heads through marketing strategies, how the U.S. dismissed a creative \\"war games\\" enemy's tactics just before heading into Iraq, how we think wthout thinking. Snap judgments can't always be right, but Malcolm shows up how and why we \\"thin slice\\" and are not even conscious of the process. A brilliant book.

0385512058|1.0|This \\"page turner\\" gives an unusual glimpse into the mind of a successful businessman. What will he do next? Without any embarrassment, Ferrazzi exposes his self-serving activities and manipulative use of other people. He lacks insight and is unaware his behavior is wrong. Example after example illustrates the insincerity of his actions. \\"Helping others\\" is only a tool to accomplish his purposes and for gaining power.  <br /> <br />Each anecdote of how Ferrazzi networks shows his insincerity. \\"There are times, amusingly enough, when I call in order not to get through...

Never Eat Alone may be the downfall of the self-acclaimed \\"ultimate networker\\" if any of his contacts bothers to read the book.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|After reading many critical reviews, I saw the film three times(after seeing it on stage at least five times), and now have purchased the DVD. While I agree that the phantom's voice was not as strong as others who have been on stage, I found it to be a minor distraction. Looking at the second disk, I gained a lot of insight into how Andrew Lloyd Weber worked with Carmen Macintosh and Hal Prince to put the pieces together. I also realized that Sarah Brightman was not much older than the actress who played Christine in the film, when the show opened years ago. Although I have seen the various films of Phantom throughout the years, certainly Michael Crawford was not hideous or grotesque, in the stage play nor were any who played the part in any of the traveling companies. I wouldn't have expected the actor in the movie to be either. If the purists were disappointed,they are in the minority, and fail to understand that the movie had to appeal to the full spectrum of movie audiences, rather than the small percentage who demand a strict adherance to the original script.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I will begin by saying what other negative reviews have also stated: I am a fan of Dream Theater and have been for a while. I have all the albums...well, save for one. I don't have \\"Train of Thought\\" because I sold it, even though I am usually a completist when it comes to bands I like. That is how disappointing I found this album. And I will tell you why it is so terrible.  <br /> <br />The defenses seem to begin with \\"well if you're looking for that same old prog sound this isn't for you.\\" First of all, the idea of being a progressive rock band doesn't mean you have to necessarily sound the same and not evolve. That is a naive implication. Secondly, no, I'm looking for good music. I'm looking for a mature artistic statement by musicians I respect. This album is regressive and immature. I was already disappointed with a significant portion of \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" but this is ridiculous. It sounds like a group of metal head Dream Theater fans that went to the Musicians Institute. It sounds like five twenty year olds that recently discovered the realm of music not played by Clear Channel radio stations. It does not sound like five accomplished adults with a rich mold-breaking musical catalogue to their credit. This album brought with it a barrage of cheesy effects that most people use to mask their musical shortcomings along with song structures that are week and choppy. They had great song structures that were progressive and made sense but now it seems like a string of poor interpretations of progressive song structuring. I got tired of the non sequitur changes and the lack of any true groove. One thing I've always loved about them was their ability to transition and change time signatures but there is a way to do that right which requires finesse and maturity. That is, for some reason, absent here. And where did Myung go? Did he take a vacation? Because I didn't hear any of that great bass work that so grandly complimented their previous material. Come to think of it I didn't here many harmonies and melodies at all. Nothing. I don't care how difficult you make it to execute it's just noise. Anyone can make noise and they do. <br /> <br />Between reviews I've read and people I have spoken with I have noticed that it has been common to justify the sound by simply saying it's of a different musical genre. Well, I'm sorry to break it to you but that is simply not enough. The prinicples of music do not change from one genre to another. What makes something good and relevant is consistent, regardless of simplicity and complexity. \\"Train of Thought\\" was an excruciating letdown that I hope Dream Theater doesn't deal me again. But I gotta tell you, because of the trend displayed by their last two studio releases, I'm going to be far more cautious about my purchase of the upcoming.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Great movie. Fantastic Visuals and a beautiful soundtrack, great story. What more could you ask for in a GITS movie? A great DVD. I normally like Dreamworks and what they do but this is a travesty. I bought the DVD and found myself with much disappointment. And yeah, how could they not dub it in English? I do not mind the subtitles or the japanese language but I would have liked an English dubbed version as well. THe cover of the DVD is tragic as well. If it was not GITS, I would not have even bothered picking it up. If you are smart, you will wait for a better version. If you are like me, and just want your own copy for the time being, the movie is worth what you pay but do not expect anything other than a great movie.
0062502182|2.0|Upon hearing my friends' raves about this book, I bought it with high hopes. Some even compared it to Hesse's Siddhartha, a classic text. Unfortunately, the book doesn't measure up to any literary standard outside an elementary school context. What is supposed to be a philosophical journey of self-discovery is better described as a trite, overly simplistic, and predictable waste of time. The only saving grace is that the story does build some suspense toward the end, but of course this is completely rotted away when the ridiculous ending is finally revealed, leaving the reader with a longing bad taste in the mouth. <br /> <br />N.
0062502182|1.0|The Alchemist is a simple tale of a young boy in search of fulfilling his destiny. Nothing really wrong with it, but instead of being simple, this book ultimately turns out to be simplistic. Santiago, the hero of the book is born in Spain and his parents want him to become a priest. But he wants to travel and see the world, so he becomes a shepherd instead. Traveling with his sheep, he leads a happy life. Then he dreams twice about a treasure and he wants to understand the dream. Then a chain of events lead him to the actual journey and fulfilling it. That's it folks; the whole book has just one central character, the boy Santiago and there is just one theme, his journey toward his destiny. <br /> <br />Interspersed with this journey is the talk about how to go about realizing one's destiny. That is the crux of the book and that is what seems really shallow. What I got out of it is a lot of fluff about beginner's luck, importance of omens, listening to one's heart and soul of the world, kind of mumbo-jumbo. Maybe one can write convincingly about such stuff too, but realizing the destiny seems just too easy in `The Alchemist.' It seems as if realizing the destiny is automatic, you will get a dream about it, you will be born to real supportive parents, you will find able guides like `king of he world' and `an accomplished alchemist', a girlfriend that is `a woman of desert' and supportive of her true love's absence for a long-long time. Too much, I say, too much. OK, one final thing, that true love is also automatic, just by glancing at each other it can be found and nurtured forever. <br /> <br />The Alchemist has one thing going for it, it is a pretty fast read, I cold complete it in about four hours with interruptions. The language too is easy, but if is lyrical or not, I find it difficult to make up my mind. Maybe some triteness is bound to come in any translation and I will leave it at that. Let me say, I have no major quarrels with the language of the book. Thecharacterization of the book is weak but it is probably so because the focus of the story is on discussing destiny rather than individuals. Apart from Santiago, we hardly get to meet anyone well in the book.

B0007XT87G|4.0|No sense in breaking this down song by song. If you liked In Asentia, then you should own this CD. If you like any of the band's previous two albums, then you should own this CD. Wilson just doesn't know how to make a bad album. <br /> <br />As with any PT album, you need to give this one a few spins too. But not to worry, this one has immediate appeal. Still has all the qualities of a great PT album (soaring vocal harmonies, keyboard flourishes, hard and soft passages, crunching guitar)plus the great writing is still intact. One wonders if Wilson's side projects will ever dillute his PT work...so far it hasn't. Recommended.

I liked roark because he was independent and doesnt conform to what everyone else does. hes his own and does what he wants, regardless of the consequences. i dont like peter  keating because he takes all of roark's hard work and talent and uses it for his own. that part made me mad. i wish dominique and roark would be together throughout the book. haha. overall i really liked reading it and i would read it again if my book hadn't of fallen apart.
0671027387|1.0|Dan Brown has found his niche in hypothetical conspiracy theories.  I read Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, I enjoyed them (like enjoying a Big Mac) even though I felt like he had violated the \\"suspention of disbelief\\" code.  But when I read Deception Point I felt like I was dealing with a dangerous level of \\"dumbing down.\\"<br /><br />Dan Brown's true niche is in exploiting the paranoia of the uninformed. I had laughed at the idea that Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code would probably keep the Vatican on its toes for a while.  I figured, they're going to be working overtime to keep the conspiracy theories at bay.  But I'm not laughing now because he's developed a huge cult following.  Deception Point's anti-science paranoia is not funny at all in that context.<br /><br />Read this book and think not about advanced science/political conspiracies but about the altruistic nature of science and the self-serving needs of pulp fiction marketing.
B0000025R3|4.0|Men at Work exploded in the United States in the formative years of MTV.  Their inventive music videos and catchy music captured an audience in the throes of a disco music backlash.  Men at Work provided a new sound for a new decade and a new medium.<br /><br />This album begins with one of Men at Work's signature songs, \\"Who Can It Be Now?\\"  The song has a predominant saxophone that, in combination with Colin Hay's voice, provides a unique sound.  The lyrics for this catchy song are somewhat humorous as they initially describe someone who might be us, wanting to be left alone by a salesman or some other unwelcome door knocker.  As the song progresses, we realize that the singer's real fear is that they are coming to take him away, and you realize that perhaps the singer is mentally not quite all there.<br /><br />The second song is more serious.  \\"I Can See It in Your Eyes\\" conveys the strange feelings we sometimes have during changes in relationships.  The fast song with its dark undertone speaks of images that we sometimes associate with relationships.  The collage of phrases initially appears to be unrelated until you tie them together with how we often think as we replay things that happen over a period of years.<br /><br />The next song is pure play.  \\"Down Under\\" is yet another signature song for Men at Work.  The song appears to have a number of Australian slang words, which makes the song incomprehensible in places.  However, the enthusiasm, pace and harmony pull you into this song.  The catchy beat and easily remembered refrain make this a song that will have you singing along when it appears on an oldies station, though it is hard for me to believe that the 80s are already classified as oldies.<br /><br />I have always liked the next song, \\"Underground.\\"  However, I must admit that I am clueless as to the precise meaning of the song.  The words hint at survival during troubled times, but other references are less sure.  I think because I saw \\"Mad Max\\" and \\"The Road Warrior\\" about the time this album came out that I associate this song with those two movies.  Like many other Men at Work songs, the music is catchy and you want to sing along, but the lyrics are too hard to remember without memorizing them.<br /><br />Men at Work rarely created songs that, in retrospect, were throwaway songs.  However, \\"Helpless Automation\\" may well be such a song.  The music is reasonably good, but the lyrics seem like something Devo might have been singing rather than Men at Work.  The following song, \\"People Just Love to Play with Words,\\" is also one of Men at Work's lesser songs.  The song starts out somewhat serious, but the reference to a puzzle throws a bit of humor into the song making it much less serious.<br /><br />The following song is a song about a boy who wants to spend his time dreaming and doing his own thing.  \\"Be Good Johnny\\" is a kind of tribute to the Chuck Berry song, \\"Johnny B. Goode.\\"  Like the Chuck Berry song, this song is fast and catchy, with Men at Work's unique style.  The harmony on the \\"dreaming\\" portion of the lyrics is very good.  However, the endless \\"be good be good be good\\" can feel a trifle overlong sometimes.<br /><br />\\"Touching the Untouchables\\" is the first completely serious song on this CD.  The words relate to homeless people.  While there are wry twists in the lyrics, the ironic humor is cold because of the context.  The music is somewhat downbeat and sad in places.  The song is almost out of place given the lighter nature of most of the songs on this CD.<br /><br />The next song moves back into a more hopeful subject.  \\"Catch a Star\\" advise everyone to chase a dream, no matter how old you are.  Though the tone of the music and the singing is downbeat, the words are relatively upbeat, suggesting there is always hope in a person's life.  That hope can extend from career to personal relationships, suggested by various portions of the lyrics.<br /><br />The last song on this CD has always beenone of my favorite Men at Work songs.  \\"Down by the Sea\\" can be interpreted to fit several topical genres.  When I am reading a fantasy novel I see the song relating to voyages to unknown places or quests in faraway lands.  At other times I see the song as being a love song.  Of course, the plain reading of the words is that the song is about the men who go to sea, whatever their reason or purpose.  The tone of this nearly seven minute long song, the longest on this CD, is serious.  While Men at Work created catchy songs that are pop, this song is a beautiful song best played loud with the ability to concentrate.  This song may be Men at Work's best song.<br /><br />Men at Work existed for all too short a period of time.  Their unique style has yet to have a rival.  Of the three albums they created in the early 80s, \\"Business as Usual,\\" in 1981, \\"Cargo,\\" in 1983, and \\"Two Hearts,\\" in 1985, this album was the best.  Men at Work's star burned brightly during their relatively short run at the top of the charts; perhaps too brightly as they faded as fast as their rising fame.D has always been one of my favorite Men at Work songs.  \\"Down by the Sea\\" can be interpreted to fit several topical genres.

0156027321|5.0|Pi Patel is a boy who was born and raised in India during the fifties.  His father is a zookeeper of small zoo which abound with all kinds of animals.  Pi finds himself yearning for all knowledge and despite being Hindu by birth, he also considers himself a student of Catholism and the Islamic faiths.   <br /> <br />At sixteen, Pi and his family find their way to Canada on a Japanese freighter, to start a new life for themselves as well as homes for many of the former zoo creatures.  A sudden explosion throws Pi and three lifeboat mates on a journey that would last seven months on the open seas.  The mates include a tiger, zebra and hyena, or are they? <br /> <br />LIFE OF PI, is a story of finding hope when there is only despair, and finding God through the trials of life.  The story contains many parallels and mysteries that you will find yourself pondering for months after you have finished the last page.   <br /> <br />LIFE OF PI is the second novel written by Yann Martel.  The story's beginning dragged a bit, but hanging on for the adventure that follows the tragedy at sea is definitely worth it.  His descriptions and story telling abilities will keep you reading through to the end. <br /> <br />For a second novel, Martel has captured the art of a good read.   <br /> <br />LIFE OF PI is a perfect book for any adult reader group. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007TKNL0|2.0|Having seen the stage play (as well as the non-musical movie versions) I looked forward to seeing this movie version.  But the magic of the stage play was not there.  The editor left in too much of the director's follies, there are many unnecessary scenes that just drag the pace down to a yawn.<br /><br />While the movie starts out great it loses pace after the first visually-exciting underground scene. By the second hour you are playing editor and deciding what to chop out to make a better movie.  Get rid of the cemetary scene, chop that unnecessary false-suspence underwater scene.  The last 20 minutes start to pick up the pace and you wake up for the exciting ending.<br /><br />As an editor, I could have made it a better picture.<br /><br />The voices are not as strong as those in the play, and the emotional motivations do not properly come across for the viewer to care about what is going on.  Why didn't they kill the Phantom after his first murder, they certainly had the opportunities (which were not in the original story)!
B0007O38F8|1.0|This CD aint even worth buying, it aint even worth burning this has  to be the worse CD i ever heard in my life, he has lost all his rap he should of retired after the first CD cause this one is junk he disses Fat Joe and Jadakiss on Piggy Bank what a dumb @$$ like they didnt even have any beef with this @$$ clown Jada is so gonna tear him apart im waiting, and then this thing happens with him and Game like this boy fiddy needs some serious help the steroids are wearing his brain down like fat joe says in XXL.  Wait til All or Nothing by Fat Joe Drops yo'all be busting to that cd its well worth a buy but Fiddy's Massacre sure is a massacre to listen to. <br /> <br />
B0000CEB4V|5.0|There is not a lot I can say that hasn't been said about this CD, but I'll add my voice to the chorus of hosannahs still rising from the amen corner. I have rarely seen such an outpouring of love for one man than you will see on Concert For George, nor have I heard before such an exceptionally professional heartfelt tribute to a musician from his former colleagues and fellow musicians. To say that Concert For George is one of the most musically important DVDs on the market is to understate its value. This is one item that should be in the musical library of anyone who ever liked the Beatles or any of the musicians who have come here to pay musical tribute to George Harrison.<br /><br />I am a Beatles fan, but today I listen to very little Beatles music. I am also a George Harrison fan, but to this point I have listened to even less of his solo work than that he did with the Beatles. Concert for George made me see his life's work in a whole new light. I had forgotten just how many great songs he wrote and as long as this production is, they are not even all covered!<br /><br />Here's what you get when you buy Concert For George: Almost five hours of music and entertainment. I enjoy the entire set, but the highlights for me are If I Needed Someone featuring Eric Clapton, Old Brown Shoe featuring the soulful voice of Procol Harum's Gary Brooker, Give Me Love featuring Jeff Lynne, Horse To The Water featuring Jools Holland and the powerfully soulful voice of Sam Brown, Taxman featuring Tom Petty (though his voice is not made for that song, the rest of the gang make up for it), Isn't It A Pity featuring Billy Preston, Photograph featuring Ringo Starr, My Sweet Lord featuring once again Billy Preston, and the tour de force of the show, While My Guitar Gently Weeps featuring Paul McCartney and dazzling guitar pyrotechnics by Eric Clapton. The show closes with a tearjerking I'll See You In My Dreams featuring Joe Brown on ukulele as thousands of rose petals shower from above.<br /><br />There are lots of other musicians who played an important part in Harrison's life and in the wider world of music featured as well. Fans of Indian music may well be thrilled by the raga written in honor of Harrison by Indian sitar master Ravi Shankar and performed by his daughter Anoushka. Jim Capaldi (now dead) of Traffic is here too as is Harrison's son Dhani.<br /><br />I can't believe there are actually used copies of this DVD available. Why would anyone give it up? For those of us of a certain era, this inspired and joyous tribute is a consummation of the promise of the spirit of the sixties. For those of other generations, Concert For George is a lesson in how truly transcendental music can be.<br /><br />I'm not generally given to gushy superlatives, but this is not just a keeper, its an heirloom! Order today and your only regret will be that you did not buy it sooner.here are lots of other musicians who played an important part in Harrison's life and in the wider world of music featured as well.

B00014NE62|3.0|But still boring.  I just rented this film and realized, after the first few minutes, that I had seen it before.  It didn't make any kind of impression on me before; it didn't make a strong impression this time, either.<br /><br />Everybody goes on and on about how wonderful this film is, but I guess lots of people have exceptionally high tolerances for irritating period pieces where each character is dressed perfectly in perfect period clothes in perfect period settings, rooms, and buildings.  Add to that a generous helping of nauseau-inducing pompous, spoiled upper-class pettiness that leaves you with a profound sense of the emptiness of most of these characters and the distaste of the working-class folks who serve their needs.<br /><br />The story is good and the cinematography and spell-binding shots of the college and countryside are not to be missed, but the whole thing leaves me flat and unsatisfied.  It's a little bit like looking at perfectly-preserved, historical artifacts in a museum; interesting, but they don't really come to life except in an artificial way.
0380788624|5.0|Hey, I did my time working in the computing universe -- as a \\"DEC-10\\" operator, an \\"engineering aide\\" on work study, a UNIX documentation technical editor (for industry, NOT those semi-literate hackers who wrote the BSD manuals, thanks!) and a programmer in Pascal, C and FORTRAN -- but computers still remain glorified and troublesome _appliances_ in my view. So, a 918-page(!) book about hackers had better have more going on than elaborate self-aggrandizement to keep my interest.  This story goes well beyond your usual cyberpunk novel, by fully engaging the larger context in which the techno-wizardry occurs.  We get to learn lots of fascinating back story involving (real or imagined) events from World War II, bringing home the recognition that the Web and all of our taken-for-granted computer hardware did not come into existence from vacuum.  All of this information is woven into stories about very interesting people, whose lives you either envy or recognize as not so very different from your own, after all.  I understand that Bobby Shaftoe and friends are present some of Stephenson's other books, and I'll be looking for them.  To echo a previous reviewer, I do hope, though, to see more fully-realized female characters in Stephenson's future work.  Say, one with a Ph.D. and a sense of adventure, but not necessarily built like an Olympic athlete or with Heinlein-esque inflated breasts?
B00007LTIG|4.0|It's become a popular trend in the world of Deadheads to bash this album and call it a \\"disappointing debut.\\"  Indeed, the story behind the album has become legendary:  The Grateful Dead took handfuls of diet pills prior to recording, thus rushing through the songs and giving them a hopped-up, manic energy.  However, it is exactly this energy that makes the album so wonderful.  This is the sound of a bunch of kids rebelling against the ultra-economic conformity of the 50s and early 60s.  This is the music of Ken Kesey's legendary \\"acid tests,\\" of a group of outlaws creating magnificent art and painting everything in Day-Glo.  I recommend Tom Wolfe's \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\" for more on the context of this fascinating music.  Now on to the actual songs:       \\"The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion)\\" is certainly one of the most ecstatic pieces of music ever created, and it captures the '67 \\"Summer of Love\\" spirit better than anything I've ever heard--it's worth the price of the album alone and makes you wonder why the Dead didn't write more of the songs on the album.  Most of the songs are blues standards that they transformed into something new with their shimmering guitars and especially Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan's trademark organ playing.  Other highlights include \\"Cold Rain and Snow\\" and the tender \\"Morning Dew\\"--and just try to resist dancing to \\"Beat It Down the Line.\\"    This is a different Grateful Dead than the one that toured after about 1975--this is the Grateful Dead that performed with riotous energy and was rooted in the blues.  If you're new to the band, I would start by checking out \\"American Beauty,\\" \\"Workingman's Dead,\\" or \\"Live Dead\\" (which remain their crowning studio achievements).  If you want to dig a little deeper into their roots, this is where to go next.  Don't trust the cynics--you will not be disappointed!
0060934719|4.0|Though it seems written for a young audience, STARDUST by Neil Gaiman has some mature themes and content.  Set in the land of Faerie, STARDUST is the story of Tristran, who sets out to bring back a falling star to his beloved, and ends up on a life-altering adventure.  The star - a blonde girl who doesn't eat or drink - is sullen and angry, and not at all thrilled to be captured by Tristran.  Unbeknownst to them, the star is also being chased after by other enemies, including a witch who wants the star's heart.<br /><br />STARDUST is beautifully written, and the world of Faerie is creative and fascinating.  Almost every line in the book is filled with meaning, and each character has an interesting story to tell.  I loved the book for its descriptions and interesting take on fairy tales.  What I didn't like so much were the many animal deaths (some brutally violent) and the surprising amount of sex in the book.  There are definitely some \\"mature\\" scenes to skip over if you plan to read this to a child.<br /><br />Anyway, STARDUST is a creative story filled with imaginative going-ons.  Highly recommended for adults in search of a good, short fairy tale.
B000002NG7|5.0|Just as the band had numerous problems replacing Jim Martin on the axe, new member Jon Hudson came in to fill the void wonderfuly.    Put forth the result AOTY, comes across like a great album of a band reborn and set to take charge.  They went on tour, I missed it, heard great reviews from the internet of the shows, they went to Lisbon, and then... it (FNM) ended.  It was their last album.    Hence AOTY is the last remenants of Faith No More that we have left.  From the crushing opening of Collision, to the eeeeerie atmospheric-ness of Stripsearch, each song builds on and on to the next one either tripping out into classic FNM weirdness (Mouth To Mouth, Naked In Front of the Computer) to ultimate camp (Home Sick Home, She Loves me Not)..  to ending in one of the most beautiful closers of any album I have ever heard \\"Pristina\\", not so much a song as it is one of the longest most haunting outro's ones ears will experience.  listening to it gives you the sensation that the album never ends.    The album does end, but you can get this masterpiece and listen to it again, I just wish the band could get back together myself, but there will always be their albums.
B00008S2VG|4.0|So now it's 2005.  With the popularity of artists such as Annie, the Killers, and M.I.A., more electronic themed pop music is bursting the scenes. <br /> <br />Maybe Madonna knew what she was doing? <br /> <br />So the album wasn't exactly great when it came out.  I admit, I liked \\"Die Another Day\\" than the rest of the CD. <br /> <br />High energy, sugar-soaked anthems of dance and life were what made those times great.  Look at the declining musical popularity of Britney Spears, in favor of mellow mind-numbing compilations such as the Garden State soundtrack.  What's taking over?  Synth-pop.  Acid jazz.  Funk.  Pop music is going the way of soft rock.  And when I say Pop, I mean NSync, Backstreet Boys...that corporate produced money machine which overtook the Nation and turned MTV into the unwatchable zombie it is now. <br /> <br />So Madonna's American Life was obviously overlooked.  It's mellow, it's poignant, it's deep.  Madonna doesn't care *what* you think of her, it's HER forum.  She can talk about her past without wanting a damn thing from you because of it.  She doesn't want pity, maybe she's finally found the strength to ridicule herself.  Whatever the cause, she has found a part of herself which was lost all those albums ago. <br /> <br />\\"Hollywood\\" is still my favorite song on this album.  Her vocals are infections and the synths are captivating.  But that doesn't mean that amazing gems such as \\"Nothing Fails\\" escape my ears.  Madonna has put out something that doesn't make her seem like...putty.  She's not moldable, she's fixed.  This is who she is, after all those years of corporate hands making her what they want. <br /> <br />Maybe that's the real appeal.  She just didn't care about what was popular, she can MAKE the scene hers.  Just give her time.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Ok well I was born in 1981 so I BARLEY remember seeing Jedi in the theaters. That being said I have always been a huge star wars fan. I remember having luke's x-wing fighter that had an R2 that you pressed down to make the wings move, very cool! So to me this has always been the classic \\"Trilogy\\" I've never understood people's dislike of Jedi I think it's above Empire! To me A New Hope is a good intro but I've always been a HUGE Luke Skywalker fan so you could see why Jedi would be my favorite as Luke really comes into his own in Jedi and is really a bad ass, where in ANH he's just a teenage nerd who lives on a desert planet. Yes he saves the day but it's more luck than power. <br /> <br />Ok so to the DVD's, like I said I never saw the O.G's in theaters so I can't say I've really seen these films. When they were re-realesed in '97 I got a taste of what it was like to be there in '77. HOWEVER the changes always bothered me, I HATE the Jabba scene in IV. I love when han steps on Jabba's \\"Tail\\" soo corny, and the song in Jedi, bleeh. I don't mind some of the scenery shots like in cloud city ect.. I think these are good changes, but sometimes very out of place. Would someone please tell LuCASH that when you make a moive your suppose to leave it in it's original form as sort of a time peice. But this new thing of changing classics (E.T I'm looking right at you) is stupid. Someone should take these films away from lucas because if he continue's there'll be nothing left of the O.G's. Someone made a good point on here, Lucash didn't write or direct the two standout movies in this trilogy, and it shows. With the \\"New\\" Tilogy there is so much cheesy diolouge and pointless love story mumbo jumbo and \\"lore\\" that Lucash has made up. (Matrix Reloaded I'm looking at you) Seeing yoda fight is cool but over all there pretty weak.  <br /> <br />Ok so the picture and sound are INCREDIBLE!! I never imagined these movies could look so good! In a word astounding. So I've read another review from an employee of Lucas and he said that these DVD's were just because of a demand for them, and the fact that DVD's are going to be replaced eventully lucas decided to put the SE's on DVD insted of spend the time to fully re-tool the O.G's. So with that in mind you can't get too mad. I understand that they were working on Revenge at the time and had no time to do these DVD's so I understand why they wanted to wait till all the movies where out so they can make a Ultamite box set wich will include the O.G movies. To this is say great! These movies are popular for a reason, and it ain't from the '97 re-realease. I understand trying to reach a new audience but geez why not let those movies stand on there own, yes the new trilogy makes the old ones look very out dated but THEY WHERE MADE IN THE LATE 70'S EARLY 80'S!! good lord, if Cassablanca was updated every 10 years we'd have J-Lo in it and a song by ashlee simpson. My point is that movies like this don't need to be updated, yes they look cheesy now but it's a time and place, when you screw with it it just cheepens the whole thing. I mean everyone probably hates their movies when they see how different they can make them now but that's not the point, let them be! Like I said these movies did not gain popularity because they were re-realeased, they were popular because the characters are great and the story is awsome! Just leave it, don't become a whore to CGI, I think since '97 when CGI started to show up everywhere, we've learned and I hope Lucas has that CGI can't carry a film. Take the new Trilogy, great CGI but no story! No stand out characters, boring diolouge. I LOVE these films even with all the changes I STILL love it, but to me the CGI is cheesy, it was made in a time when CG was still in it's infant stages, and I'm sure after seeing Golum in LOTR george wants to go back and change it again. And frankly I say he shouldn't this is the point, you can never stay ahead of Technology, it's always going toget better. So is george going to \\"Update\\" these movies every 10 years? By the end we'll have a 10 minute Ewok song and dance, and Jar Jar will show up in cloud city or something, so lame. Wow long review but the point is get this box set because the DVD's look great. But know that this is not the O.G fims, you'll have to wait until 2007 for the HD's in there O.G form. Can't wait!!
0792839730|5.0|It is long (about 3 hours), so be prepared.  But not only is the cast outstanding but the writers and director did an outstanding job of catching the feel (and a great many of the details) of the operation.  The movie is very true to the book it's based on, having many of the strengths (and a few of the weaknesses) of the book.  Overall, though, it does a first-rate job of showing the many blunders of both sides, as well as the heroism and leadership which, in the end, could not save the day.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This could be the album that gets PT the worldwide fame they deserved 10 years ago.  Being a fan of only their earlier releases up through Signify(and Recordings), I was plesently surprised at this release.  It continues with the formula that made In absenta so popular and touches on their early albums. <br /> <br />For some reason, this album reminds me of Live's \\"Throwing Copper\\" and Dream Theater's \\"Awake\\". <br /> <br />I don't get why everyone is picking on \\"Glass arm shattering\\", it is simply amazing.  So is the rest of this album.  <br /> <br />You must let this album grow on you cause it is very different. <br />
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|The O.C. Season 2 is just as good as the first season. I like the fact that the show is not just about kids in high school, but also their parents and family and how they all interact. The cast is really good and believable enough to either make you love them or hate them. The show is very emotional at times and it is very addicting. I think what scared me away before I ever saw an episode was that I figured The O.C. was just another show about rich kids in California like Beverly Hills 90210 and/or Melrose place. The show is so much more than those other shows and has just the right amount of drama mixed in with just the right amount of heart. I highly recommend The O.C. for anyone who likes must see TV. This Complete Second season of The O.C. will be released on August 23rd, 2005 just in time for the premiere of season 3 in the Fall. This 7-DVD set will contain all 24 episodes from the second season, and a disc full of bonus material, too. The great news is that unlike season 1 season 2 will be in Widescreen. There will be an English Dolby Surround audio track, along with English, French and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />Here's a list of the bonus material you'll find on this:<br /><br />The Wet and Wilde Kisses - outtakes from the \\"Rainy Day Women\\" episode<br /><br />Beachy Couture: How O.C. Fashion Is Made<br /><br />The O.C.: Obsessed Completely Retrospective TV Special<br /><br />Gag and Goofs from Seasons 1 and 2<br /><br />Extended cut of \\"The Rainy Day Women\\"<br /><br />Commentary on \\"The Chrismukkah That Almost Wasn't\\" and \\"The Rainy Day Women\\" by Cast and Crew
B000929AJQ|3.0|I was prepared to give up on NIN after being bored by THE FRAGILE and by the long spans in between albums. But WITH TEETH actually has me interested again. Most of the reviewers here are correct in pointing out that this album sounds like a post-FRAGILE version of PRETTY HATE MACHINE. If you're old enough to remember that fun and sometimes lame album than you will probably enjoy WITH TEETH. It's definitely not a masterpiece in the way that THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL is. Hell, how many bands have multiple masterpieces this day and age? Hopefully Reznor will release another album in the next year as some have suggested so that WITH TEETH won't have to stand out in the open for too long. It's not strong or complex enough to keep new fans, or old fans that had given up, interested for an extended period of time.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I remember where I was on July 13th, 1985...at home in Monterrey, Mexico very angry that our country was way behind others technologically speaking and; therefore, not having cable systems and missing out on what the rest of the world was enjoying...THE greatest Pop Culture event of the Century. All we got was a 2 hour special that same night on a nationwide TV station that showed about 10-12 performances by 10-12 different acts (with commercial breaks between each and every performance). <br /> <br />All these years I had waited for some footage; at least the audio on CD, but there was no news. I was not aware that Geldof had requested that the event NOT be recorded for future entertainment...it's a good thing the BBC didn't listen to him. <br /> <br />Now; 20 years later, I am able to enjoy what was done in London and Philadelphia. Some reviewer says that 85 songs are missing; hey buddy, there's almost 10 hours of performances here and for someone who almost saw NOTHING AT ALL, this is a truckload. <br /> <br />My review is basically that the audio is very good and the video is near perfect because; although 20 years old, looks perfectly preserved. Bonuses here are the complete music videos for Do they know it's Xmas time? and We are the world, both in high quality. <br /> <br />My word to you, get it, enjoy it and don't lend it. This is something that SHOULD be placed in those time capsules for future generations to learn about.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This was a good idea a few years ago to compile Elvis Presley's 30 #1 hits for this compilation. My first time hearing Elvis' music was 1978, when countless TV ads to order 20 of his greatest hits a year came on after he died in 1977. After that, I noticed how much of an icon and major star he was.  This fellow made some very catchy songs such as Hound Dog, Jailhouse Rock, Can't Help Falling In Love, Return To Sender, All Shook Up and countless others.  He was really a diverse artist, as his forays into rock, pop, gospel, R&B,and other genres fit into his musical style. This collection is very well packaged for today's Internet driven generation who's very much into current artists and trends. Elvis set the standard for most pop artists today into how to market themselves and sell their flashy images. He had a surprising 20 years of hits, even up to the '70s too. Could have had some more hits in the '80s if he even lived longer. Given that this new movie on CBS is coming up, I decided to write this review. And while most folks will drive thousands of miles annually to the Graceland home to worship Elvis, I would rather listen to the music instead because that matters. The remix of A Little Less Conversation is funky with some more modern dance music added to the original song. For today's audiences, this album was very timely to come out in the CD era, when vinyl was a common thing back then.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|But this is not as good as the original, in some cases. Well to start off with, I love this album. It's one of my fav. Megadeth albums ever. But I still prefer their fast paced, speed metal stuff, but I love Risk. Now there were a few problems I had, like I loved the begining to Isomnia on the original and now it's different and I don't like it, and the beginning to Crush 'Em was changed and I liked the original version better. Some of the songs sound better, but some don't. The Doctor is calling sounds good, but some of the parts where Dave sings is missing, well more like on part. Otherwise other than the very few problems I had with it, I loved the remaster, but I think I like the original a bit better. I love the linear notes, those kick arse.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|Bob & the Wailers come together for a wonderful live set, this one is pure gold.  A must have for concert lovers!!
B0008ISM40|5.0|At no time has people want to act like someone that has appy pop music that suggest simple ideals.  This is alsoawesome ... be the point.  Did you like to hear someone go on about how perhapsuch powerful  beat... and nunderstanding why so many ow you don't like 'With Teeth'?  I feel it's s 'God is dead' to a relentless person knows nothing about music technically... then they pretended to relate allNIN bmusic that is another triumph for Mr. Reznor.  I think if amusic for so long is faultering now....  and if he is...  that... mighteen hfor a long time.  It leaked long ago, now I'm buying it to hear the surround sound.  a 'crack in the wall'.  I'm having a hard time  along.  Basically, I've had this album made
B00007FOMP|5.0|\\"What's Going On\\" is revealing in it's nature, very haunting and true...with this masterpiece Marvin did something that was never before done in the history of pop music culture; following in the footsteps of one of his idols Ray Charles, he mixed his musical roots and sang a sermon that to this day is fresh and powerful.  Marvin is the greatest.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Boy this is ryan's best.  Breaking his wrist, staying away from the spotlight, growing a full beard, and breaking up with his woman have all helped ryan make his most soulful record yet.
B00005LANG|5.0|Exodus is pure genius.  Bob was most definitely anointed and touched by God.
B000929AJQ|4.0|You should criticize things for what they are, not for what you'd like them to be. There's no point in saying \\"this is not Downward Spiral\\". It's just nonsense. With Teeth shows the evolution of Trent's work. Some reviewers say there's no evolution here, that's just absurd. Although there are just a few highlights, With Teeth still keeps the deepness of every NIN album.
B00004Z459|4.0|Every single song is off the charts. But sadly it was just too good to be true, their next album killed their music. It was very sad
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I'll review the movie in a moment. What I want to share first is how pleasantly surprised I am at the extras included. Sure, they could have given us more--four different kinds of trailers, costume design boards, a scene from every Phantom movie thus far, interviews with Crawford and Brightman, not to mention commentaries. But hey, isn't that what Christmas is for? :)<br /><br />However, I was enthralled by the story of how the musical came to be. We get not only plenty of airtime from Lord Webber and Stilgoe & Hart, but we see the original stars in footage that we would never be able to see otherwise. Sara Brightman singing \\"Pie Jesu\\" in what looks to be a cathedral, Michael Crawford doing light comedy--light comedy!--on a British show and performing in the circus. We're taken into Webber's estate to view the singers who first performed the Phantom material as it was being constructed, and are enlightened as to how Britain charmingly previewed the musical, via music video, to the rest of the nation as what looked to be, quite literally, a rock opera. (Well, it WAS the 80s.)<br /><br />The other extras that focus on the movie production are also quite good. I thought it might be only a slightly longer version of one of those HBO First Looks, but it was super-informative. In it you get a look at the premier, at part of Emmy Rossum's screen test, the fun of trying to understand Jennifer Ellison's (Meg) accent, Patrick Wilson singing opera in sport pants, the Mask of the Red Death swigging from a water bottle, plus a look at the outrageously elaborate costumes and what the chandelier falling looked like in real life. There's so much more I can't remember, but trust me, it's worth it.<br /><br />I'm not sure sure about the additional scene. I'm glad they didn't keep it in. While it's a lovely song, the Phantom was too soft, not at all obsessive or dangerous. And we don't want that, now, do we?<br /><br />And, about that movie. Emmy Rossum has a perfectly capable voice even at her age, just as Christine is supposed to be quite young. But her face had the same expression on it--trancelike--almost the entire time. When she saw Raoul caught in the Punjab lasso and cried out, I was like, Finally! And then she went back into the trance. I wish they had coaxed more expression out of her.<br /><br />Gerard Butler. Either you love him or you hate him. We all know he's hot. I was really surprised at first sight of the Phantom, because from the stage shows you get the impression that even with the mask on, he's a crowish figure of no less than forty years. I enjoy watching Butler, but if they had used someone less attractive I don't think it would have taken anything away from the movie. As for his voice--I whispered to my mom at one point that he sounds like a rock star. And yes, Butler was indeed in a rock band. He's no Michael Crawford. And sometimes his treatment of phrases isn't the best. But on the flip side, sometimes it's just as uncomfortable listening to a stage Phantom sing in full-on operatic mode. It's...whatever you like, I guess.<br /><br />Of course, the sets are lavish and the costumes lush (and vice versa). I love Minnie Driver in the Carlotta role, and the men who played the managers were really a delight. I know people gripe about all these different things--the addition of scenes, speaking dialogue that was previously sung, the misplacement of the chandelier's big scene, a colorful masquerade being clothed in black and white. But in the end I still think the movie is more than worth it. Why?<br /><br />Because you can see it whenever you want to now. Because the full orchestra sounds heaven-sent. Because knowing all the words to a musical is a big deal. Because it's beautiful. Because it's a full-on experience that requires nothing less than your full attention. Because snow and confetti falling never looked so perfect. Because my first exposure to the musical was on a cassette tape with half the second act missing and it was still so potent that I stayed up to listen to it again. Because the Phantom's hot (oops).<br /><br />So, that's what I think. If you truly love the musical, you'll like the movie. If you knew nothing of the musical before, then you'll probably like it, too.t was still so potent that I stayed up to listen to it again. Because the Phantom's hot (oops).<br /><br />So, that's what I think. If you truly love the musical, you'll like the movie.

B0000669JL|5.0|If you only heard one bob marley song and liked it then you will love this cd. This is truly how he should be rememberd. <br /> <br />I didn't like the song he did \\"who shot the sheriff\\"... the back ground singers messed it up but other then that song the album was perfect.
B000002UEB|5.0|This is a special CD. There is plenty to enjoy musically, but there is so much more. It is rare for a CD to be able to tell a compelling story. Set in the late 80s, we hear a tale of an antigovernment revolution led by Doctor X - \\"The Man With The Cure\\" - who uses a combination of propaganda and drugs to recruit assassins. The CD focuses on the rise and fall of one such recruit. After getting sucked into the revolution, he falls in love with \\"Sister Mary\\", the nun who supplies him with his drugs. However, the order comes down from Doctor X that she is to be his next hit, and this becomes the turning point. He winds up killing the priest, but he and Mary try to escape. Eventually, Mary does wind up dead, but we are not told explicitly how or who did it. All that we do know is that the assassin is arrested and ends up in a mental hospital.<br /><br />From hard hitting metal to driving ballads, every song on the CD is good. You will find yourself listening over and over again, picking up something new each time whether it's a deeper understanding of the story or a layer of the harmony of the rythm section. It seems like a contradiction of terms, but this CD is metal for the intellectual.
0767830555|5.0|Rovert De niro's best work for sure.. a must have for any Robert De Niro Fan!
B00006IX0R|5.0|The thought of a greatest hits collection of Cranberries seems unfair simply because I always thought this band couldnt have a greatest hits unless it was compiled by me. I mean they've made such awesome music over the years. Their style is second to none. Dolores O Riordan has been my psychological lover for over five years now. I like the sound of her voice and it brings back a lost feeling of mesmeria in me.<br /><br />Dreams deserves a place with its absolute ever-echanted sound.It sparks off this album in the most amazing way.No Cranberries \\"non album\\" is complete without \\"Linger\\". Come to think of it I was wrong with my prediction of an unfair greatest hits. Cranberries have a lot of good music so it isnt too difficult. There are four tracks from To The Faithful Departed which happens to be my favourite Cranberries album. Hollywood is easily the closest Cranberries ever got to being labelled \\"metal\\".<br /><br />Some songs this album could do without are - Salvation and This is the day. Otherwise the compilation is rock solid. I'd like to have had \\"Electric Blue\\" which is arguably my favourite Cranberries track.<br /><br />There's no  \\"Joe\\" , \\"Dreaming My Dreams\\" which could have been considered but here's an album I recommend to anyone who has/has not heard Cranberries. If you're new then I suggest you buy this album. If you want to know more about Cranberries, close your eyes and  buy anyone of their albums. Beware, Don't buy their last album since it wouldnt give you the best insight on how their music really stands.<br /><br />Cranberies is the most dreamy band I have ever heard second only to Cocteau Twins. I recommend the 1990 album \\"heaven or las vegas\\" to all the people here who haven't heard them.The absolutely magical sound that Cranberries display in their music is what makes me feel like a new born. I can be more expressive but then I'd over state my opinion. Cranberries is among my top three bands and I don't see any band displacing them in the near future.<br /><br />Hope they come out with a new album sometime soon.<br /><br />So long,<br /><br />\\"Chocolate Brown\\"them in the near future. <br /> <br />Hope they come out with a new album sometime soon. <br /> <br />So long, <br />\\"Chocolate Brown\\" <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|After years of waiting, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is now available to own.  Truly a remarkable musical with drama, romance and a touch of tragedy, it is everything a muscial should be.  The cast is well played out, even though they had big shoes to fill.  Gerald Butler is a wonderful Phantom.  He brings a sexiness and youth to the role that previous Phantom I've seen did not.  You really do feel his obessive love for Christine and his pain when she betrays him.  Emmy Rossum is a wonderful Christine.  Emmy is a beautiful young lady who sings remarkably well.  It actually was more difficult for me to accept her as Christine than Butler as Phantom because this role was created specifically for Sarah Brightman.  However, Sarah is too old for the role now and Emmy does the job just as well.  Patrick Wilson (Raoul) was the one role I thought could have been improved in the movie.  I think they could have added a little star appeal to the movie and cast a hotter actor.  They dubbed Minnie Driver's voice, so dubbing another wouldn't have been that big of a deal. <br /> <br />Overall, this movie has heart and keeps the spirit of the stage production.  The staging of this movie is simply stunning.  Minnie Driver's Carlotta adds for comic relief, as well as the opera house owners.   <br /> <br />The extras include a behind the scenes on how the show came to life.  It includes home videos of early productions and rehearsals with Sarah and Michael Crawford.  Truly, for this Phantom fan, this made the entire purchase sooooo worth it.  If you are a fan, definitely own this work.
B000000WA4|5.0|Smashing Pumpkins is more than your above average favourite band. I don't think I've heard something quite like this album. It's based on the kind of the feeling of being lofted straight to the land of heaven laced melodies with a tinge of sadness to hurt you. I can try to mix and make words jump around but the truth is as simple as it sounds. The Amazon Editor says it all in his review about Mellon Colie.<br /><br />My favourite songs on this album are Thirty Three,Zero,1979,In The Arms of Sleep,etc. Billy Corgan shines in this album with his heaven gifted voice and style. Some songs just bring out white flags of smiles on first few listens while some emote a deep sense of victory in defeated feelings.I didnt know wht to expect from these 2 discs but I can safely say they're the best I have heard from this band and will go down as great options for my desert island discs.<br /><br />All who heard this must give \\"adore\\" and \\"gish\\" their deserved number of listens too.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Parody has the purpose of imitating in detail to achieve humor or to mock.  Sometimes mockery is frowned upon, if the sole purpose is to hurt the individual through ridicule.  This ridicule is also a source of laughter, as it could also be a form of criticism.  The criticism is to express a discontent with what has been expressed prior to the parody.  Thus, parody is essential for free speech and the freedom to express ones own thoughts and ideas.  Team America: World Police pushes the envelope in regards to parody, as it pokes fun of the American tapestry under the Bush administration's era with the help of puppets.<br /><br />The first half of the film provides hilarious outtakes from notions and similar events that have taken place in the world, and the perceptions of Americans throughout the world.  The film begins in Paris where some terrorists, Middle-Eastern looking puppets, plan to strike Paris with Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Fortunately, or should the Parisians say unfortunately, Team America arrives to save the day while also succeeding in blowing up the Eiffel Tower and the Triumph Arch.  This is a funny, yet a bloody event while Team America blows away the terrorists without consideration for art or history in Paris.  This is a view many outside the United States have of Americans, uncultured and with poor knowledge of history.  And to balance this out, the filmmakers make fun of other nationalities through caricature.<br /><br />One of the outcomes of the Paris event led to the death of one of the members of Team America.  Consequently, the leader for Team America, Spottswoode, decides to recruit Gary Johnston, a Broadway actor, who currently performs in the musical Lease, which has an obvious hint towards the musical Rent.  Spottswoode believes that they need Gary's acting skills to get close to the terrorists, as Gary graduated from Iowa University summa cum laude with a double major in theater and world languages.  The recruiting process includes convincing Gary to join Team America, which in itself provides an amusing scene where Spottswoode tries to induce fear in him.  However, it does not affect Gary who goes to Washington D.C. to ponder his decision among the war memorials of fallen men and women.<br /><br />Through the second half, the story increasingly turns away from parody toward what seems to be a MTV production that tries to rely on the shock value of things while heavily borrowing from other sources.  Much of this is amusing in a cruel way.  Some examples of the borrowing turn up when Team America arrives to Cairo, Egypt where Gary enters the terrorists' bar.  This bar has strong resemblance with Jabba the Hutt's place in Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi (1983).  Another amusing scene appears when Gary first arrives to the Team America headquarters in Mount Rushmore, which seems more like the first episode of a new season of MTV's Real World.  A final example is the North Korean president, Kim Jong Il, who seems to be more like a James Bond villain who terminates the Swedish Top UN weapon's inspector Dr. Hans Blix through feeding him to sharks among many other things.<br /><br />Freedom of speech brings filmmakers such as Trey Parker a certain level of social responsibility.  This notion seems to have been utterly crushed in the film, as Trey Parker and Matt Stone throw their characters into explicit violence and sex.  Yet, these scenes are not what are most offending in the film. Several ideas surface throughout the film; however, the director Trey Parker and writer Matt Stone never even try to explore any of these ideas.  They simply spew out their discontent in an extremely hostile, yet comical manner, which leaves the viewer with unfinished thoughts of violence and intolerance toward different thinkers.<br /><br />One major part of the film is the use of numerous known film stars such as Matt Damon, Sean Penn, and Alec Baldwin.  These stars join under Baldwin who is the leader for theFilm Actors Guild (F.A.G.), which Parker and Stone seem to use suggestively in a prejudicial jovial manner.  The sole purpose of the actors appears to be for target practicing, as Parker develops a full out assault on them by killing them in various gruesome ways.  This suggests that is ok to threaten or even exercise violence towards those that freely express themselves, which goes against the notion of freedom.<br /><br />Maybe Parker thought that the idea of using puppets would limit the ideas and thoughts that he provided in the film, as the strings control puppets.  This might be a symbolic gesture toward how people are being manipulated; yet this idea was never fully developed.  Jan Svankmajer's film offers strong and bizarre material through puppets and clay, yet his films are thoughtful in regards to society even though disturbing.  Nonetheless, the discontent is obvious, to point of nihilism, which Ebert even concluded in his review.  This nihilistic attitude does not seem to bring anything more than a parody of itself, as the film unfolds, which gradually increases in meaninglessness.  As mentioned before, the parody, or spoof if you will, seems to evaporate, as Parker and Stone ultimately turn this venture into a cavalcade of shocking scenes for an ever increasingly desensitized audience that will find it funny in the same way a bully muses over his or her victims.  In essence, Team America: World Police begins as a parody that eventually drops the thought it had to embrace and becomes the very same thing that it tries to ridicule.<br /><br />Yet, the film also has a different side where the creators of South Park are able to cause sidesplitting laughter through shocking puppetry with ruthless abandon.  This can only be allowed in a society where freedom allows it.  Many will find this film repulsive while others will deem it generously entertaining.  One great thing comes through this film, which is the exchange of ideas, a dialogue if you will.  In this dialogue people with different convictions first begin to scream, as they try to out scream each other.  Hopefully, both sides realize that screaming does not work, and they lower their voices in order to hear each other out.  Maybe, some are hurt in the process, but so are soldiers in war as some of them fight for the right of the first amendment.  War is not something new and neither is the idea of world peace.  Maybe people need to find some humility through humiliation before people will know that no one is above any idea, and all ideas must be considered for peace to have a chance.er for the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.), which Parker and Stone seem to use suggestively in a prejudicial jovial manner.

B0008ISM40|5.0|In the past two days I have listened to this cd at least 8 times.  Everytime it gets better these tracks just grow on youw it is strange.  It isn't like the fragile at all but, it isnt like TDS or PHM either, It is like a hybrid of the previous three albums taken to a new level.  Another thing I like about WITH_TEETH is that there is as single message being portrayed thourghout which makes for easy listening.  Im done now got to go listen to with teeth.  HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.  you wont regret it.
B000053ZRR|5.0|This dvd concert was just great i mean all the classics were on here only thing i would of like to have seen the song \\"always\\" on the dvd. But here u are with the best band in the world with a live concert and if your a bon jovi fan u will love it even if your not u gotta say there incredable. So if you haven't seen them live in concert which you should this is the closest you wiil get and you will see why there the best band in the world and have sold 100 million album in counting.
B00009W0WM|1.0|I'm holding out for a 16:9 colorized version with Dolby Digital EX 9.1! I mean when I watch Casablanca and I here the gun shot at the end, I want to HERE GUN SHOT AT THE END!!! Also Ingrid Bergman is no Maryland Monroe.
B00080Z53O|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. Cried like a baby several times, very moving. The acting ensemble is amazing. All the characters are fully developed and, except for the stereotypical priest, portrayed very realistically. No bogus Hollywood-style overacting here. <br /> <br />The euthanasia issue is treated with great sensitivity, portraying people on both sides with respect for the most part -- except, again, I found the episodes with the priest to be heavy-handed. Despite the main character's deathwish, the movie shows how he lived life to the fullest within his physical constraints and that's what makes this movie such a gripping and uplifting experience for the viewer. <br /> <br />Do we approach death as the ultimate mystery that intensifies and deepens our life experience? Or do we try to contain it in a corner, put it in a medical ward with all kinds of tubes and devices, so we can repress our fears and not think about death? By denying someone's autonomy over their own body, even if perhaps in error, are we projecting our own fears and hang-ups over the great life/death mysteries? Interesting issues. Try to watch this movie with an open mind and remember, people all over the world may see the things WE do and think we're the strange ones. . .  :-)
B00005LC4B|5.0|Deniro is one of the best actors in movie history, and he is alot more frightening than the original max cady (the orginal movie is alot older but still an excellent film. But of course since this was done in 92, or somewhere around there, they could play around a lot more with the violence parts in which the most disturbing and graphic is when he viciously attacks the young woman that knew nick nolte. It's very graphic when he breaks her arm and literally bites a chunk of flesh from her face and splits it into the air with blood on his mouth, is a bit much to stomach, and must admit it went a little too far, but it was a brilliant way to show what a true monster max cady really is and his lack of any respect for women. But you pretty much knew before that scene that he was a rapist and later on he is a killer when they discover he killed an inmate and bit his tongue off. These type of violent rapists do exist in the real world, the kind that are so vicious that more than one behavior is expressed in each crime they committ. The sadistic kind love to torture their victim by biting and mutilating and breaking bones, and then raping, so that they can inflict as much pain as possible, which is of course max cady. But it is a movie, and Deniro is great. As always.
B00005A46T|5.0|ok, i am sick and tired of seeing people criticizing this album.  yes, it is heavy, yes it is metal and thats that.  i keep reading reviews of people saying how untalented this band is. Well, to those who think joey can't drum, pick up two sticks and show me you've got room to talk trask.  Those who think corey can't sing, grab a mic and show us how your better.  if you dont have anywhere near the talent of Slipknot, then dont claim they aren't good.  i dont care if you dont like them, the fact is you can't compare to their talent so dont say \\"he sucks, he sucks\\" because you dont have room to talk. <br /> <br />now to my review, this album is insane.  its like the stress ball album one needs when they're pissed, but you also dont need to be pissed off to enjoy this.  the drums are off the wall, proving that joey is up there with lars ulrich as one of the best drummers we have today (again, i dont care if you dont like lars but you know he can out drum you).  mick and james provide some very heavy riffs, and, when you can notice it (skin ticket, left behind, iowa) the percussion is good too. the best though is corey.  although there is a lot of yelling in this album, it just shows how much emotion he can put into his work.  and just when you think, \\"ok, he can yell, but can he sing\\" songs like My Plague and Left Behind show his range.  all in all, i do believe that this band has the talent that alot of bands today lack. the other albums (s/t, Vol. 3) are great as well, but this is by far the most aggressive album they've released.  its impossible not to thrash to this
B000929AJQ|5.0|The first impresson I had on the CD was like &quot;what the?&quot; since I was expecting the anger filled Trent that I heard previously. I think a good example of how this CD sounds is...<BR>Imagine you were screaming at someone, yelling at the top of your lungs and run into your room and scream some more in your pillow to the point you notice sceaming just is so tiring...so you simply sigh and take in what has happened. Trents previous CD's were the screaming, the anger that he had (and still has), this CD is the &quot;sigh&quot; and instead of screaming...he is trying to speak his thoughts instead. <BR>    Truly a great CD to get and relax to, but still makes us use the mush we have in our heads called a brain. I give it two thumbs up.
B0008ISM40|2.0|After one listen, this cd was HIGHLY disappointing! I regret buying the album and after a few more listens would probably have purchased 3 or 4 songs online (The Collector - best song, You know what you are? - typical yell anthem, Only - great dance, disco song, Right where it belongs - piano ballad, good but not \\"Hurt\\"). The album is incredibly disjointed and doesn't really flow well. Trent is obviously out of things to write about, you'll hear this when he uses lyrics from past albums like \\"Nothing can stop me now\\" and \\"a tiny dot caught my eye\\". Plus, there's the brilliant \\"Flip, Flop, Flip\\" lyrics in \\"Getting Smaller\\". Fortunately, I bought the Downward Spiral Deluxe Edition and took a trip down memory lane where the lyrics were fresh and full of feeling. One of the biggest fans of Trent Reznor who thought he was a genius is now eating her words.

B00079HZUM|4.0|London, 1660. The most popular form of entertainment is the theater. Shakespeare's plays are playing at a number of different venues, some respectable, some less so. Due to Royal decree, all female roles are played by men. Of these men, Kynaston (Billy Crudup), is widely regarded to be a star, having made the role of Desdemona, in \\"Othello\\", his own. Kynaston's dresser, Maria (Claire Danes), watches his performance from the wings every night, mimicking his every affected move, wishing the accolades were for her as well. Maria sneaks off to a makeshift theater most evenings to perform in a more rudimentary performance of \\"Lear\\". News of this soon reaches King Charles II (Rupert Everett). At the urging of his new mistress, Nell (Zoe Tapper), he soon decrees that female roles should only be played by females. Kynaston is unsure what he can do, now that he is no longer allowed to practice the craft he has so long perfected.<br /><br />\\"Stage Beauty\\", directed by Richard Eyre (\\"Iris\\", one of my least favorite film biographies of all time), is a well-produced film with engaging performances.<br /><br />The film revolves around the two central characters. It is the story of their relationship, their craft, and their troubles. The film is only as good as their performances. And they are quite good. But there is a flaw in each, which detracts from the film.<br /><br />As Kynaston, Billy Crudup credibly creates a character that is very believable. He is a man who has made a career of playing female roles. He even takes to dressing as a woman when he goes out on the town, to the delight of his admirers, because he feels it is important to maintain the charade. He practices hand movements, inflections, walking, all to simulate the female form. He has perfected the art of dying as a female. All of these `technical' aspects of the role are easily handled by Crudup, one of the best actors working today. He also seems to easily don wig, makeup and dress, to become a woman. When the King opens up the theater to women, therefore robbing him of his roles, we feel Kynaston's loss and shock.<br /><br />There is a scene early in the film in which two female admirers rush backstage to meet Kynaston. Ogling him, they eventually get him to agree to a ride in their carriage. This scene is a bit funny, but it is also unfortunate, because it serves to highlight all of the ways in which Crudup's character doesn't resemble a woman. Sitting next to the two women, we see that he wears too much makeup, his face is far too angular, and he doesn't resemble a woman. How did he fool these other women? In order for something like this to work, we have to feel that he could fool his adoring public. If he can't fool us for even a second, how can he fool them for years and years? Yes, they may have been less knowledgeable about these things in the 1660s, but I find it difficult to believe they would buy Crudup as a woman. He looks like a tarted-up whore.<br /><br />Claire Danes plays Maria. She is very devoted to her job, but also longs for something more. She wants to act, not for the stardom, necessarily, but for the challenge. After helping Kynaston change clothes, she rushes to a makeshift theater to perform, as Desdemona, in a more rudimentary version of \\"Othello\\". Much to her surprise, word of her performance begins to travel, causing everyone to rethink the rules. During the course of the story, Maria shifts from a confidant, willing to sneak in a performance here and there, to a woman interested in becoming the star. The shift is not a gradual one and it is a bit jarring. A more natural, longer transition would have aided the role and the film considerably.<br /><br />Smoother transitions in both of the main characters would have added to the film immeasurably. I almost got the sense that the film was trimmed, perhaps due to budget restrictions. The film is a bit short for a period drama. I think it runs about 100 minutes. It was also produced independently,so perhaps this theory is plausible. If these two problems had been worked out, the film could easily qualify as a great film. Most people watching this film won't be bothered by this.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also very good. Of the group, Tom Wilkinson, as Betterton, the owner of Kynaston's theater, is the least memorable. Rupert Everett clearly has a grand old time playing Charles II. Lounging in bed with a dozen yapping dogs, dressed as a woman for a play with his mistress, who is dressed as a man, and more, Everett clearly relishes playing Royalty for the fool. It is a funny and amusing performance. Richard Griffiths is also very good as a pompous, bored member of the upper class. As Sir Charles Sedley, he walks around trying to create amusement for himself. Ben Chaplin plays George Villars, the Duke of Buckingham, Kynaston's closeted lover. He and Crudup are quite good verbally sparring with one another in public.<br /><br />\\"Beauty\\" is a beauty to look at. The stage, backstage areas, the Royal palace, a country estate. Everything looks authentic, adding greatly to the quality of the film.<br /><br />\\"Stage Beauty\\" is a very good film. If a little more attention had been paid to the main characters, it would have been a great film. All in all, definitely worth renting.ependently, so perhaps this theory is plausible.

B000957O82|3.0|Hitch is a fairly good movie. I'm sure you all know the plot from other reviews, so I'll spare you.  <br /> <br />This is one of those movies you go to when you're in the mood to see something \\"cute\\". A few scenes will have you giggling, and others will make you go \\"Awww\\". But nothing in this movie really stands out for me. I wouldn't buy it. Rent it instead.
0679809015|5.0|This was my daughter's first favorite book.  It's small enough for the diaper bag, and did a great job of keeping her occupied when she was getting impatient at appointments, etc.  I would highly recommend this book!
B000002LTU|3.0|Another New Direction. It's Miles - the man who constantly changed the face of music for 40 years, experimenting with the fusion of hip-hop and jazz.  This is his last work (he died before it was completed), and much more adventurous than Tutu and most of his 80s stuff.  The album isn't consistently great, but it is groundbreaking.  As another reviewer mentioned, it sounds like hip-hop for adults.  The opening cut is a slick instrumental with the sound of a scratchy LP record built into the beat, featuring a lot of riffing by Miles.  Although most of the songs here are instrumental, my favorite tracks are 'Doo-Bop Song' and 'Blow', because the rap is all about Miles: how legendary and cool he is, the power of his trumpet, how he is creating a new type of music here.  It works as a beautiful and moving tribute to the man.  You can tell Easy Mo Bee knows exactly who he's dealing with:<br /><br />Here I am, Easy Mo Bee, kickin' it live<br /><br />With the legendary Miles Davis, just my favorite<br /><br />And his trumpet can't be played with, tampered with,<br /><br />Picked up and thrown to the pavement<br /><br />This CD has some great driving music, and the deep bass grooves sound great on a good car stereo.  Along with Panthalassa, Doo-Bop is a great way to turn younger listeners onto the music of Miles.<br /><br />The last album by the man who was always ahead of his time, and popular music still hasn't caught up yet.  I can't believe this album hasn't kicked off a revolution in the hip-hop world.

B00080ETV8|5.0|I purchased only the Jane Eyre DVD from this set. It's the same production with Timothy Dalton as the older 2-tape VHS edition that has been out for many years. Supposedly the DVD has some additional footage but I have not been able to detect it...certainly no additional scenes. Also, I did not expect the format to be episodes of a TV series, with frequent breaks. The VHS version is a continuous movie.
B00005JMYI|4.0|If you like silly comedy than this movie is for you. <br /> <br />The lines in the movie are classic and everyone in the film is hilarious.  <br /> <br />Ron Burgundy falls in love with and has to battle with Christina Applegate. Not only does he have to worry about his love life, but he also has to worry about his dog who speaks spanish and the hatred he faces from the other news teams (Hilarious scene featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, and Tim Robbins) <br /> <br />I gave the fim 4 stars. I know I can watch it whenever I feel like just laughing. <br /> <br />Who knew that Paul Rudd was so funny?
0440178002|5.0|I've never had any particular desire to read anything by James Clavell.  But one day I was in the bookstore, I decided it had been a long time since I had read a lengthy epic novel, and figured what the heck.  The reputation \\"Shogun\\" carries certainly didn't hurt.      By and large, the reputation is deserved.  \\"Shogun\\" is on the whole a wonderful book.  Clavell, while perhaps not a \\"great\\" writer, is an extremely good one.  He has a strong sense for description, dialogue, and characterization, which make the 1152 pages go by quite quickly and enjoyably.      John Blackthorne, an English sailor, manages to bring his ship to 1600 AD Japan.  Almost immediately, Blackthorne finds himself in conflict with the precarious Japanese government, the alien Japanese society, and the jealously influential Portugese traders and mercenaries who have staked a claim.  In order to survive, Blackthorne must adopt elements of Japanese culture, while making himself valuable to Toranaga, the most powerful daiymo of Japan.      While Clavell took the plot of his novel from history, he also fictionalized quite a bit.  Nearly every major character in the novel is based on a historical person.  Toranaga is in fact Tokugawa, whose family took control of the shogunate, and with it control of Japan, for nearly 300 years.  Blackthorne is loosely based on William Adams, who helped open up Japan to greater foreign trade.  I'm not sure why Clavell took this approach, and for a little while, it's a bit of a distraction.    Clavell's greatest strength is examining the various political games the protagonists play.  Toranaga knows early on he is going to be a war with various rivals among the Council of Regents, and Blackthorne's arrival becomes an immediate benefit to Torananga's plans.  Blackthorne finds himself raging at the xenophobic elements of Japanese society that view him as a barbarian, while fending off the Portuguese attempts to capture or kill him.  He also falls in love with Mariko, a woman who is descended from an honorable samurai family, but who is also a Christian convert.  Mariko herself is torn between her duty to her country and her liege lord, Toranaga, and her newly adopted faith, while reciprocating Blackthorne's love.      Blackthorne's transformation from English \\"barbarian\\" into a \\"civilized\\" samurai is one of the most interesting and realistic progressions in fiction.  The change in the Anjin-san (as Blackthorne is called) is a gradual thing, as Blackthorne struggles with the language barrier and customs, coming to accept the better elements of the Japanese society, while becoming more disenchanted with his own heritage.  But at the same time he clings to the possibility of returning to England, covered in gold and glory for opening the door to the east for his native land.  He never quite realizes that only one route is truly open to him.      My only complaint is that I never felt completely connected to the characters.  While I did like them, I was surprised that upon the deaths of a few major characters, I was not as emotionally impacted as in other fictional works (Larry McMurtry's \\"Lonesome Dove\\" was always heartbreaking, for example).  There were also times that I wondered if every conversation about scheming and political maneuvering was necessary.  I was also irritated by Clavell's occasional use of minor characters as a means of moving the plot forward.  For example, the wife of the villainous Yabu figures out very quickly certain hows and whys of Toranaga's plans.  She never appears after this Lady Macbeth-moment, and really, the book only moves forward marginally.  Also, I have to say, I would have liked to see the war proper.  Clavell actually recounts this entire event in a couple of paragraphs on the last page of the book.  Considering the whole novel has been leading up to this war, I felt a little frustrated.          However, none of these complaints really overshadowed my enjoyment of this novel, or my rating.  I will certainly be reading the rest of Clavell's \\"Asian Saga\\", though not right away.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This album is great for eny NIN fan.it  <br />sounds almost like a mix of the fragile  <br />and the downword spiral.and it just  <br />rocks,it's been years since NIN Trent  <br />has done an album and well i believe <br />its an awesome come back and that  <br />Trent is still as rad as ever.and  <br />i hope he sticks with it.
B00005JL9B|5.0|But what the government does to 42 students just because of it is really messed up.  Setting 42 students against eachother, and the fact that most of them are friends really makes the pain sink in.<br /><br />In order to send a message to all bad kids in Japan, like I stated before, the jack 42 students, and send them to kill eachother. There are people who want to survive togeter(The couple that is the main focus) Guys who fend for theirselves(The foriegn exchange student, and that one chick with a cicle)and one who helps if nessaccery(The doctor dude).  But there are many others who have ideas about diffrent things, but one thing they must realize.  If no one wins, everyone looses.<br /><br />This movie has some pretty graphic violence, and quite a bit of language.  So definitly not for kids, people who are just plain out weak, nor people who don't like seeing wemon get slaughtered.<br /><br />I also love the acting in this movie.  The people scream and yell at serious times, and when it seems hopless, they just give the feeling that they're seriously going to give up.  I mean the actig in this is serious, none of that fake horror crap, straight up serious.<br /><br />The 2 things I hate about this film was weapon selection,  (I mean who is going to kill someone with a trash can lid, let-alone binochulars.  And if someone has a pistol aming 20 feet away, can oyu attempt to kill them with a stun-gun) and Chiakii Kuriyama's small role.  She didn't play much(She didn't play much in Kill Bill netiher)  But still, she had a name pretty high in the castlines.<br /><br />Well all in all, this movie makes Kill Bill, Versus, and weak crap that people say is nice, look like boy scouts.  This film is definitly recomended to those who like the films above should<br /><br />defintly see this.  I also recomend it's sequal, altho it feels a bit more like a war film, it overloads on the blood.<br /><br />peace
B0008ISM40|4.0|I baught \\"With Teeth\\" last night at Best Buy for 9.99 and it was well worth the money.  I've listend to every sone and I must say that this may not be up to par with \\"The Fragile\\" or \\"Downward Spiral\\" but this is still an excellent album from and Trent and the boys..  From track 1 through 7 almost ever song seemed to be better then the next, well for me it was.  I really, really, really enjoyed this album and was well worth the 9.99 I payed for.  The best songs are by far <br /> <br />You know what you are?  The Collector, The Hand that Feeds, Love is not Enough, Everyday is exactly the same(BEST SONG in the album), With Teeth and Right were it belongs <br /> <br />Overall if you love NIN get this album, but this seems to be a very mixed review from \\"I'm an old school fan of NIN and this was a dissapoinment\\" or \\"GREAT JOB GUYS\\" So this is either a hate it/like it album...Personaly I loved the album.. <br /> <br />4.4 out 5 stars
6305609705|3.0|A long winded self indulgent odyssey into the vietnam war. Martin Sheen plays a green beret assassin who ventures into cambodia to hunt down and kill an insane colonel who has cut himself off from US military command to rule over an bloodthirsty group of misfits. Beautiful impressive cinematography and landscapes do not make up for the lack of human interaction in the movie. Most of the human element of the film centres around the thoughts of Sheen's character as he narrates from time to time. Sheen's character is an anti heroic creation (in one scene he coldbloodedly murders an injured vietnamese civilian), we gather from his narration that he views the mission as a useful career opportunity though we feel he is like most soldiers in that he may not have a sane motive for what he does. Colonel Kurtz is played somewhat laconically by Brando. People say his performance is evidence of a genius at work, i dont see the genius, he rolls his eyes and makes faces at the camera but that is just Brando playing Brando. No doubt Coppola includes the abundant scenes of   blood and mutilated corpses to emphasise his madness, i think it was overdone and reminded me (somewhat dryly) of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Underlying the entire film seems to be the philosophy of the glory of violence, Coppola seems to be asking us to admire Kurts's spirit of independance, his credentials as a philosopher a prophet and a pioneer. Kurtz's message seems to be that the US forces were not barbaric enough in the war to deserve victory, this idea is endorsed by Sheen's narration as he describes earlier on how effective Kurtz's tactics are. Given the reality of US barbarism in vietnam now well documented this message has not aged well. The utterly pointless and completely horrific scene depicting the real life mutilation/slaughter of a cow at the end sickened and appalled me and did nothing to endear me to the film. There was also that hippy angle moving throughout the film, the insanity of the soldiers, the taking of drugs and the introduction of a Doors song at the end all sounded tiredly familiar to me, i will not slate Coppola for this since his film was probably the first to do it. One scene i admired was the utterly surreal stripshow performed by the three US dancing girls for the leering soldiers deep in Vietnam territory, sums up the sheer insanity of the period and this sums up the one area in which this film might be explained and praised - as a depiction of the sheer insanity of war.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Ok, I got this not knowing what to expect. I am a fan of NIN since the beginning and I know not to judge the album until you listen to it at least 5 or 6 times. I have listened to it at least 15 times now. During the first listen I was like ok.. He's going for a little mellower mood with hint's of pretty hate machine and the fragile. I liked it but it was kinda' strange. Just like all of the others (at first). Now that I have listened to it more I have to say this is up there with all of the other albums! There are hints to his past albums which is good if you ask me. I am not sure why people on here are saying that it dosent flow like the others because it does. It's amazing all of the different feelings this album can provoke from one song to the next. Even though the themes are the same Mr. Reznor has the magic to make each track stand out in it's own way. He also really really believes in his music and it comes through loud and clear in his voice. Anyway.. I don't really know how to write a music critque but I say if you like NIN you will love this album. I give it a 9.8 out of 10! Also if you can listen to it with headphones do it!
B00008J2DQ|3.0|I think the tilte of this review sums it up perfectly. The problem with Godsmack is the fact they seem to be a one-trick-pony. When listening trough this cd I often got deja-vu's of their previous albums, and some songs wind up sounding too similar. Sometimes I even get the impression the singer recycles melodies he already used on some on the previous songs. Which is not a good thing, it gives me the feeling that some songs are nothing more then fillers. <br /> <br />That said, Godsmack does its one trick pretty good. They deliver pretty powerfull music with solid vocals and spiced up with some well done guitar solo's. So if you're really into their style, you'd probably don't mind the lack of diversity. <br /> <br />Worth mentioning though is the last track, called \\"Serenity\\". The only song that's really different from the rest (if you don't count the short instrumental as a song). It's a acoustic ballad-like song and they pull it off very well. In fact, it's my favourite song of the album, along with \\"Straight out of line\\", \\"I stand alone\\" and \\"Re-align\\". <br /> <br />This great way to end the album does make up a bit for the negative aspects I mentioned.  <br /> <br />I'd give the album 3 1/3 stars.
B000089CJI|5.0|I adore this album, for fans of Ben Gibbard and Death Cab it exposes a side of Ben that I've never experienced before. Doubly so since I don't as a general rule listen to electronica. However, this CD is beautiful. The only thing I'm left wanting is more.
B0000027RL|5.0|First of all I HATE STUPID PEOPLE, This is PJ album review dont bring Nirvana, Soundgarden, or AIC into this. Bands like Creed, Puddle of Mud etc. all came out AFTER Pearl Jam, so PJ isnt copying anybody. How can anyone say that Nirvana started grunge? Grunge was started when Jeff Ament & Stone Gossard (PJ members) formed Green River and released the record Rehab Doll/Dry as a Bone on September 13, 1990.  <br /> <br />With that aside this is one of PJ's best albums. The musicianship is great and is readily evident on every song. Every song is packed with emotion and actually means something to the listener. Eddie's voice delivers the pain and suffering behind each song. This album is quite varied too, from Even Flow to Black to Release every song is different. If your a Seattle fan, a PJ junkie, or even a listener of great music pick up this album ASAP. <br />
B000002MFE|5.0|Apart from the two most noticeable tracks, LAYLA and TEARS IN HEAVEN, this album is consistently great, those first two tracks are beyond great, and border on phenomenal.  I watched some \\"jam\\" sessions that Clapton did with some other stars, all acknowledged masters in Blues, and Clapton was in his class.  Whatever you want to call it, Clapton does it superbly. The criticism of EC always  reminds of the anecdote that I think it was Jon Lord made about Ritchie Blackmore... and it was words to the effect that Lord knew that Ritchie had finally lost the plot when he told him that Eric Clapton could not play. Its just sour grapes.  Clapton does something so beautifully, it works well when copied too. I have performed TEARS IN HEAVEN for audiences, and thanks to Claptons basic but beautiful arrangement, the audiences loved it. But the kicker for me was that a classically trained musician in the group I was in one time could not play the tune even WITH the music... and this was a guy with superb classical  skills. Simple is not always the best, but in the hands of some brilliant musicians like Clapton, simple elevates to the level of genius.  A Beautiful  album.
B0008KLVG4|2.0|Pardon the pun, but I am tired of the bait and switch moves by film distributors when it comes to DVD releases. You buy the 25th anniversary disc and low and behold, they release a 30 year version, with nary a tempting extra. Those reviews that give this a 5 star or close to it, you're suckers, all of ya! This release hardly has anything the 25 year version didn't. Maybe a longer featurette. And then there will be the 35 year version, with one extra deleted scene, I bet ya. Anyway, save your money, buy the 25 year unless you can't find it. And by the way, I give the movie itself 5 stars for sure!
B000000OSE|4.0|Awesome CD, not as fast and heavy as the first, but still a very well put together CD. it has a mix of everything... Slash kix serious arse. Its one of my favorites but it will get off your mind after more then 10 listens.
1563523302|4.0|\\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" takes an interesting look into the lives of millionaires in America in 1996.  Unlike what most people think, the people who have the biggest houses, drive the fanciest cars, wear the most expensive clothes are in fact not millionaires and are also not wealthy.<br /><br />Stanley and Danko observe what characteristics make up a wealthy person and why the people who we think are wealthy are in fact not wealthy.  Mostly it boiled down to wealthy people are frugal and are more entrepreneurial than the upper class doctors, lawyers and executives.  The people who look wealthy but in fact are not spend far too much of their money on consumer items to give the \\"look\\" of being wealthy, as opposed to investments.<br /><br />My biggest beef with this book was it read like a specialized statistics textbook.  They have packed a lot of statistics into this book, some useful, some not useful at all.  That makes reading this book rather tedious at times.  It also felt like the authors were drawing out some of the points longer than they needed to be.  Being shorter and more concise potentially could have made this book easier to read.<br /><br />Regardless, this book contains some excellent information that everyone should know about.  If you are looking into increasing your wealth, you can't go wrong with this book.  4 out of 5 stars.

B0008ISM40|4.0|I thought this album was excellent, pure and simple. As an avid NIN fan, I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers in saying, it doesn't quite compare to PHM, TDS or The Fragile. While I thought the Fragile was brilliant, I thought it had a lot of filler on it as well.  <br /> <br />This album sounds entirely different then NIN but at the same time it's totally NIN. A lot of the songs have a grungy kind of rock style to them, with \\"Dont you know what you are?\\" really being the only song to get angry too.  <br /> <br />There's not really that ONE song that stands on this album, but I can honestly say that \\"Only\\", \\"sunspots\\" and \\"Right where it belongs\\" are right up there with some of my favorite NIN songs of all time. Truly brilliant songs in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended if your a true NIN fan and your not expecting every song to sound like \\"closer\\"
0060931671|1.0|This book makes me think of Warhol's famous painting of soup cans. While it may be cute and clever to be sharing a private joke with your readers by naming characters things like Fallopian or Kotecks, and you may be intelligent and a technically capable writer, this does not mean the story, plot, or characters are involving or worth reading about. Don't get me wrong, I have absolutely nothing against modernity or abstract art or literature. I do however feel that a writer has to do more than just be clever to write a great book. While I actively seek out a wide variety of world literature with a very offbeat slant, the deciding factor always comes down to whether the plot and characters are moving and involving. This is what makes literature the closest thing I have to the sacred in life. I feel like I have been befrauded when someone like Pynchon dresses up some otherwise poorly drawn soup-can characters in funny names and thinks that that is a substitute for good writing. It makes me understand how Christians must feel seeing a cross in a box of urine passed off as art.<br /><br />The Emporor is NOT wearing new clothes, he is just a naked deluded fool walking through town.
B00006EXL5|5.0|If your looking for deep, eerie, and powerful music, this is the cd for you. Personally, Ive known My Chemical Romance since early 2003, before they started becomming mainstream, in other words: their BEST moments. Tracks such as Drowning Lessons, and Demolition Lovers demonstrate one extreme to another. From brutally drowning a beautiful bride to running away and dying in a hail of bullets with her, this cd is one of a kind. After all, all we are is bullets.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen the on stage musical 6 times, in LA, SLC and PHX loved it everytime.  My children and I have the soundtrack memorized.  I could hardly wait for the movie to hit theaters and when it did I was first in line!  I LOVED it.  I cried through the whole movie.  Of course it's not the same as the musical but it's close enough. Bravo!
B00025ETIW|5.0|Where to begin.. what a fabulous cd to own. My Chemical Romances new outlook to the musical industry has been amazing. Ive personally been a fan since early 2003, with the release of *I Brought You My Bullets, Your Brought Me Your Love*. Three Cheers is an absolute must. With their lighter outlook on this cd, and fabulous metal riffs, emo/screamo melodies, eerie meloramia, and dark *pop-punk* image, these guys are absolutly amazing.
B0002OERI0|2.0|What the hell is the big deal about this album? Its Greenday, but its not the Greenday I grew up loving. The edge is gone and in its place are bland pop riffs and well...everything that I was glad Greenday didn't succumb to before this album.<br /><br />It is mixed and produced well? Yes. Does that make up for its bland sound? NO.
B000002542|5.0|Growing up in Palo Alto CA my 8th grade buddies and I had the dumb luck of riding our bikes over to the Stanford Fox movie theater on University Ave one summer evening in 1974 to see the Son's of Champlin (for you Elvin Bishop fans). Some noname band that was a spin out of Santana was opening. WOW! <br />I had discovered Genesis, Yes, ELP, Camel, Return to Forever, Zappa==the litany of art/jazz and fusion rock bands, but these guys kicked ass like no one I had heard--and since only Steve Morse and the Dixie Dregs have mixed fusion so well with another major influence (latin blues for Journey, southern rock for the Dregs)in my humble opinion. I've probably seen over 500 shows, but the Journey shows of the early 70's were seminal. Listen to this album on headphones and float back to Winterland. Just don't set the couch on fire with yer spliff!
B00005JNTZ|5.0|I never thought I could get so hooked on a show especially one from UPN a network I hardly every frequent. Veronica Mars changed all that with it's exceptional storylines and charismatic actors. This show keeps you on you toes and allows you to truly feel for the characters involved whether they're dead or not. Veronica Mars is truly one of the best shows on television today and I'm sure the DVD will be magnificent as well.
B0008ISM40|2.0|It's funny how so many people worship NIN. Though,I admit that \\"Downward Spiral\\" and \\"The Fragile\\" are a few of my guilty pleasures.I have not listened to these records for years and when I heard there was a new album coming out I was curious to see what could come out of a six year lull. Luckily for me I heard the album in entirety from a friend before I actually invested money in it. This album offers nothing interesting except for a decent vocal arrangement on the first track and a strange processed wind sound in one of the forgetful other tracks. As for \\"The Hand that Feeds\\", it took six years between albums to come up with this? This is the most generic song I've heard from any band which receives so much acclaim as they do. I've really questioned Trent Reznor's musical capability when I heard this song. Also, the piano on this album is less than virtuoso, the final track doing this statement justice. I don't want to hear the minimal music excuse either. If I wanted to hear good minimal music I would listen to Harold Budd or Steve Reich. This last song is simply pitiful. At least \\"The Fragile\\" had some interesting piano technique as in the seventh track(instrumental) on that album, even though it wasn't even Mr. Reznor playing it. Overall, this sounds like he wrote the album, never released it, and then let some stooges remix it and this is what we have. I would have expected this from one his terrible remix albums(THINGS FALLING APART!!!), but not from the real deal.  <br /> If you are at all pleased with music that is interesting do not buy this. If anything you are looking for profound industrial music check out VidnaObmana's Legacy. This is something that has teeth. However, if you are only interested in DJ'ing a rave, pick up the latest NIN.  <br />  Something also more interesting is to see how many disagreeing responses I receive.
B0002S94OS|4.0|I really am not big on the current metal scene with bands like Hatebreed and Shadow Falls. I am not big on death metal where the vocalist sounds like sea lions on crack. The only metal I really do like is goth metal bands such as Elis and Midnattsol. I accidently didn't send in my slip for a cd club on time and ended up receiving Lambs of God's \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" cd. I was curious enough to decided to check out the Lamb of God. Much to my surprise I ended up liking it more than I thought so but it did require a few listens for the music to grow on me. The musicianship is certainly of high quality. What I really appreciate about vocalist Randy Blythe from other lead singers in the modern metal movement is that I can actually understand what Randy is singing. A lot of singers nowadays are simply barking like sea lions. The clarity of Randy's vocals and the band's tight musicianship made \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" very enjoyable. The only flaw with the album is the production quality. I thought the production was pretty muddled and doesn't have that same live feel that I hear on the latest albums by Elis and Midnattsol. All the songs are solid thrash/death metal songs. They definitely took me awhile to get used to this type of music but I dug what I heard on \\"Ashes of the Wake\\".
B00005JKZV|5.0|THe Two Towers is the second part of Peter Jackson's acclaimed adaption of JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.  The Journey continues in this movie.  Beginning with beautiful scenic shots of the moutains of the Middle-Earth, the Two Towers has climactic battles, struggles of will, moments of pure joy and beauty.  Frodo and Sam continue to scratch their way to Mordor, pursued not just by agents of the Dark Lord but by Gollum, slave to the lust of the ring.  Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-Hai and are hunted by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.  The hunt takes Merry and Pippin to the center of Fanghorn Forrest in the company of the Ent Treebeard, a 14 foot tall walking talking tree.  The 3 hunters fall in the Rhohirram under the command of Eomer (Karl Urban), a culture of horse lords threatened by the evil wizard Saruman, with their king Theoden (Bernard Hill) enchanted by Saruman's agent Wormtongue (Brad Dourif).  Now on horseback, the 3 hunters encounter a resurrected Gandalf the White, now with power over Saruman.   They ride to free Theoden, where they encounter Theoden's beautiful and strong niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto).  Taking his people to the safety of Helm's Deep, Saruman sends his hordes after the king and in an impressive night battle, the Rohirram are aided by a contingent of Elven warriors (the biggest deviation by Jackson from the book). Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam encounter Faramir, the brother of Boromir on their way to Mordor led by Gollum.  While our heroes triumph at Helm's Deep, and Saruman is defeated, the menace of Mordor grows greater as Sam and Frodo move closer to the fulfillment of their quest. I found The Two Towers to be a beautiful and profoundly moving film.  The affects were amazing and the ability of Peter Jackson to combine live action, computer graphics and minature shots make this a great film.  Once again, this movie should have won an Academy Award and the fact that it didn't is almost a crime.
0670033375|5.0|Jared Diamond weaves the fates of ancient and extinct civilisations into a storyline catchier than the Da Vinci code.  <br />I am not an ecologist and I am not able to judge whether Diamonds interpretations about each of these societies ecological collapse are accepted among the specialists of each of them. But the whole makes up a convincing case that seems utterly relevant for us today. Diamond's reach over various academic disciplines is unparalleled, it is better than academic achievement, it is the virtue called wisdom !   <br />The only weak point (imho) is at the level of the conclusions to which the story-line inevitably leads for the world of the 21st century. Diamond's optimism is not convincing, how could a world market economy with fierce political, ecological and economic competition reach an ecological and sustainable platform ? His examples would give less cause for optimism than he shows in the last chapter, to the contrary, using his frameworks and analysis the future looks rather bleak, we are all Easter Islanders !  <br />For everyone concerned about the state of the world, an intellectually rewarding must read !
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Troy is an enjoyable film.  It does not make it to the epic level, but it's a strong film that is character driven.  Of course everyone knows that Brad Pitt is Achilles and he does a great job.  Physically, Pitt looks like one would imagine Achilles looked like.  His demeanor and fighting style scream the greatest warrior who ever lived.  The only problem Pitt sometimes has is with the dialogue.  Occassionally, he seems to get lost in the grandeur of the film.  Eric Bana as Hector totally steals the show.  As the only one of the heroes who understands exactly what the consequences of war are, Bana makes Hector the most noble and decent of the actors.  He dominates every scene with a quiet dignity that totally befits a prince of Troy.  Orlando Bloom as Paris turns in a fine performance.  Though he has played many different epic heroes, Bloom is able to convincingly convey the fear that Paris fears.  He succeeds to a degree in making Paris a sympathetic figure.  Sean Bean turns in a  great performance as Odysseus, I wish he was in the film more.  The supporting actors are also fine and they are too many to name so I will go past them.  What is wrong with this film?  Sometimes the intricate plot gets lost in the action.  My biggest problem with the film is the lack of any sense of time.  The Trojan War supposedly lasted 10 years and while no one wants 10 years to show up on screen, the entire war takes tops 2 weeks.  Amy Greek would have known that only a prolonged siege would take the city, so it would have been interesting to see more attacks repelled.  The sacking of Troy is a tragic scene.  Achilles because of his status as a main character survives until the end of the film where he is killed by an arrow firing Paris, who shoots Achilles first in the heel, slowing the warrior and allowing him to pepper Achilles' body with several more arrows.  Achilles rips out all the arrows except the one in his heel, leaving alive the legend of Achilles' heel.  Paris does liveto the end of the movie and I guess he escapes the sack of Troy.  This I do have a bit more of a problem with but overall, this is an adaptation of the Illiad, not the Illiad on film.  I found this film to be totally enjoyable and while it could have been better, it was not too bad.  The dvd release is pretty pathetic with only a smattering of extra features, not even justifying the 2-disc set.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I bought With Teeth on Tuesday and cant put it down.With Teeth is one of the most addictive,haunting and powerful and just great albums in a long time.As a 31 year old.I relate to every song.Trent Reznor is our generations John Lennon.Both the lyrics and music are layers and layers of depth that takes many listens to fully understand.Smarter then anything else in \\"Alternative\\",\\"Hard Rock\\" or whatever you want to call it. <br /> <br />What may first seem like a love song turns out to be the sexy power of addiction or man's one sided relationship to God.\\"Right Where It Belongs\\" not only lyrically takes you in the subconscious but musically too.the panning and flanger effects feel like the song is going through your skull. <br /> <br />The rockers are also great.Don't be fooled by the angst aspect.Reznor is not screaming about high school and bullies and daddy not loving you.But chosing islation over political,social and religious conformity. <br /> <br />The same way that many of the songs on Pretty Hate Machine were angry social commentary about the hypocrisy and indifference of the pappa Bush admininstration,\\"The Hand That Feeds\\",\\"You Know What You Are\\" and \\"Getting Smaller\\" sound like political anthems about going to war,etc (\\"What if this whole crusade's A charade,And behind it all there's a price to be paid For the blood On which we dine\\") <br /> <br />I was thinking if there are any negative aspects to With Teeth.But even things that didn't seem to fit at first listen now do.The jazzy piano.The funk aspects. <br /> <br />With Teeth is a great album.A collection of some of NIN's most haunting and rockin' songs.And a few firsts (like the spoken word and atari-synths of \\"Only\\",the sexy beach vibe of \\"Sunspots)Easily 5 stars.The best Rock CD I heard in a long time.  <br />
B0007TKNIS|5.0|This was just an outstanding movie that will always be a masterpiece no matter how many times it is remade.  I loved the voices of the characters (though I'm not sure who was actually singing) and the songs themselves were great.  I've never seen the stage production so I don't know if these are the same songs or not.  I'm still singing them in my head a week after watching it.  The characters were very good in looks, even the phantom was gorgeous.  I try to watch any period piece film, and I rushed to the rental store for this one and was mesmerized throughout the whole film.  I only have one thing to comment on:  why can't we have on \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" film that is passionately acted, and acted only.  I understand that the songs are what make it what it is, but I'm a hopeless romantic and would love to see an epic film made out of this outstanding story.  No complaints here though.  I am definately going to buy this one soon and watch it often.  Everything about this film was perfect.  The colors of the background matched the feelings of the moment, and you could feel the despair in your heart when the Phantom was urging Christine to leave him even though it broke his heart.  Ten stars!!!  Bravo!!!
B0002S947K|4.0|Voice reminds me of Ted Hawkins (not quite the range of Ted).  Look forward to a lot of great songs to come.  I bet he's great live. <br />
B0000033P0|3.0|Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's first album had been a surprising hit. After all, half the album was comprised of instrumentals, and aside from \\"Lucky Man,\\" it was not easily accessible. When the trio returned to the studio, they did so with an even more grandiose idea.  <br /> <br />That idea became \\"Tarkus,\\" a twenty minute suite that set the precedent for the style (Pink Floyd's \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" was released a year earlier, but made little impact), which would be taken to new extremes by bands such as Yes and Genesis. \\"Tarkus\\" is violent, complex, and long - twenty minutes of the trio slamming away. Those twenty minutes are broken into seven sections that began with an instrumental intro (\\"Eruption\\") and then alternated vocal and instrumental passages. The group spent hours composing this classical rock masterpiece - highly influenced by composers such as Mussorgsky and Ginastera, Emerson's songwriting is brilliant and challenging. Greg Lake came up with the lyrics, and though they're not terrible, they're less than great, too. That's not the problem with the album, though.  <br /> <br />\\"Tarkus\\" was a difficult song to write, and it left the group unable to formulate a lot of material for side two. \\"Jeremy Bender\\" is okay, but unnecessary. \\"B**ches Crystal\\" is an interesting jazzy piece that would've benefited from the addition of some organ parts. \\"The Only Way (Hymn)\\" is Greg Lake's statement of atheism, a sarcasm-dripping song that will surely offend some people. Personally, I've never enjoyed it. \\"Infinite Space\\" segues out of \\"The Only Way,\\" and while it is an enjoyable instrumental, it isn't showstopping. \\"A Time and a Place\\" actually isn't that bad. It can't match \\"Tarkus\\" in any way, but it's certainly listenable. \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\" is obvious filler, the worst song on the album. <br /> <br />If you are a true ELP fan, as I am, Tarkus belongs in your collection. More often than not, I suppose you will switch the album off after the title track, and that's fine. For the newcomers, you really should check out either Brain Salad Surgery or a compilation that includes the entirety of \\"Tarkus.\\" Emerson, Lake, and Palmer were great, but they play a very challenging kind of music. Weird rhythms, strange time-signatures, and highly technical compositions are their hallmarks. When you do get used to it, you'll be hooked forever.
B000026FOA|5.0|When my good friend Phil recommended this CD to me, he helpfully provided a product advisory. \\"I'm warning you,\\" Phil emailed. \\"It's really melancholy stuff, so make sure you don't have any sharp objects lying around when you listen to it.\\"<br /><br />Like any good Irishman, I love mournful music, and I have a particular weakness for suicidal musicians, especially the ones that died too early to suck. So Phil's words of warning were like catnip to me. Move over Joy Division, Nirvana, and Elliott Smith; make room in the Case Logic for some Nick Drake.<br /><br />I soon found that Phil was right--and wrong.<br /><br />On one hand, \\"Five Leaves Left\\" feels like the saddest CD ever recorded. You can't fake these emotions; every poignant lyric, every aching guitar chord, and every weeping cello proclaim that this is the voice of a troubled and self-critical soul. Nick Drake died of an overdose at the age of 26; oddly enough, of his three albums, this first one sounds most like a suicide note.<br /><br />Granted, there's some debate among his fans as to whether his death was indeed a suicide, whether the overdose was accidental or deliberate. On one hand, he OD'd on antidepressants, even though barbituates were available, and he didn't leave a note. On the other hand, he'd already written \\"Fruit Tree.\\"<br /><br />Has any musician penned a more convincing suicide note? I doubt it. \\"Safe in your place deep in the earth/That's when they'll know what you were truly worth.\\" I'm sorry, Ian Curtis--\\"Closer\\" may come close, but nothing's more depressing than that. And unlike, say, Elliott Smith, whose pop sensibilities often contrasted his morbid lyrics, every note of this song amplifies its mournfulness.<br /><br />Still, this album is comforting in its melancholia--it doesn't leave you feeling suicidal, because you listen to it and know there's someone out there who has felt your feelings and given voice to your thoughts. In fact, it's perfect music to listen to at sunset on a Sunday night, when the day and the weekend are over and you haven't accomplished anything and you're facing another 40 hour week of work-related drudgery. If you're thinking of picking up a guitar and hiring a string arranger and writing a song about those emotions, don't bother--you won't do any better than \\"Day is Done,\\" a 2-and-a-half-minute gem that perfectly encapsulates those feelings.<br /><br />So cheer up, all you sad people--there's a man out there who understood you, even though he never met you. I wish he'd found a way out of the depression, found a way to stick around, write new songs, and keep his old songs from being used in Volkswagon commercials; they say dying young's a great career move, but you miss out on a lot, and when you're dead you can't stop people from doing silly things with your back catalog. Also, even though people romanticize depression and drug overdoses, they really aren't all that fun, especially for those left behind. But Nick left us with some great music, and we can at least be thankful for that. \\"Don't you worry,\\" he sang, to us, and to himself. \\"They'll stand and stare when you're gone.\\" Amen, brother.ver and you haven't accomplished anything and you're facing another 40 hour week of work-related drudgery.

B0000CDLA7|1.0|I cant really add anything- see that review- tis album simple blows-- i hope their new one is no where near this garbage- MAN I MISS DREAM THEATER
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|... usually BS. is old fashioned with dark, morbid and boring music and lyric but Headless Cross is completely different. There is no bad song on this CD. It worth every dime to spend on.
B00024BHTC|1.0|I heard ghost love score and was hooked-now im tired of that song cause its the only good track on the album- agree with other negative reviews- STAY CLEAR- trust me!!!
B000000QFV|4.0|This is is refreshing album from BS, even though its price does not say so. It is full melody, good lyric, rythm. Tonny Martin sounds like Geoff Tate which is positive thing here. His voice upgrades BS. and opens new horizons for BS. Worthlike!!
B0000009SI|4.0|If you have to read the reviews, you're not that familiar with 1970s rock 'n roll I suppose.  Frank Zappa was a prodigy out of the 1960's rock scene, but far more.  Truly a brilliant composer, his music influenced many other musicians from Parliament-Funkadelic to the Monkees, from pop and dance to avant-garde symphonic and jazz music.  His political satire influenced the Simpsons cartoon, and he was truly a unique, bizarre, and interesting man.  He didn't take illegal drugs, though said he had a real coffee jones, and yet his music was associated with the 1970s recreational drug subculture.  Zappa fans have close to a hundred recordings to enjoy and debate about relative merits, but this is probably the best CD to introduce the novice to his music.  You know he once said \\"It's not important to even be remembered,\\" but I think a composer of this magnitude shouldn't be forgotten.  By the way, I got married at St. Alphonso's and I asked the priest about the pancake breakfast (where I stole the margarine), although I'm not sure he ever got the reference.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This is the most unforgettable movie I've ever seen.  I saw it three times in the theatre, and just got the DVD for Mother's Day, and have already watched it.  It is a stunning masterpiece, and I still can't believe that the Academy snubbed this film.  The casting was superb, especially Gerald Butler as the Phantom.  I found myself falling in love with him!  And the  music!  It plays over and over in my head day and night!
B000268QB2|4.0|Very good music.  I like the whole fresh aproach of no guitars in the album, which has been done before by bands like \\"Ben Fold 5.\\"  Keane is more song driven then I thought.  It's a rock-pop band with mellow vocals with production that has been laced with light electronic nuances.  The songwriting is good and they have a great sense of melody.  The slow songs have a nice atmospheric melancholy to it.  The only thing that I wasn't to \\"keane\\" on was the fact when the album reached half way it sounded like it repeated is self. Some lyrics sounded in the same vein as the first couple of songs, but otherwise than that I enjoyed this album.  It's a good change of what's going on out there these days.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|I teach creative writing in highschool.  I like to start the class each semester with this movie.  It's so real.  It shows how opening up and making yourself vulnerable makes you work better.
B00004YA66|5.0|This is the absolute BEST movie ive EVER seen! It was so freaky, in a weird but not scary at all way.  its not \\"Scary\\" but its weird to where it can make you think it can really happen. Bringing family back to life like that.  <br /> <br />What are you waiting for?!?! You HAVE to see this Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKZU|4.0|But this said, I believe that there couldn't be a better movie.  It captures the epic sweep and the pain and turmoil as Frodo and Sam approach the cracks of doom.  It was fantastic.  The filming was beyond scope.  The characters were perfect.
B000929AJQ|1.0|Like so many other early 90's musicians, Trent seems to have been lost in the sea of syrup that flooded the music market in about 1995. I'd like to comment more on the actual music, but theres really no new material on it. Its 90% reworked stuff from pretty hate machine and downward spiral, and 10% completely ripped off from ministry and maintstream 80s artists. We hear a guy who knows that he was once a \\"genius\\" and now seems irrelevant, needlessly existential, boring. Other artists come to mind, some of them his good aquaintances: Tori Amos (who just wrote the same album for the 4th time in a row), Marilyn Manson, who seemingly(and respectably) just gave up, and Tool, who came back for a second a few years ago, only to completely fall off the radar. Why did layne stayley have to go??? why won't scott wyland??? That great moment of the raw, edgy, early nineties music has taken a severe blow, and no one's felt it more than trent reznor.  Nobody wants content in their music anymore.  Everyone just wants a lullaby.
B0000048V8|5.0|I bought this video, indeed searched for it after I heard the snowman's song.  I take it out to listen to it often.  I wish they would release a sound track or something.  The song is haunting and lyrical.  It feels like flying through a winter sky should feel.  Enjoy it for yourself.
B000002INJ|4.0|When i first heard this band, i was barely thirteen. I did not understand english at all, i even didnt know what heavy metal means. But i loved the music, it was comming from another plane (i grew up in socialistic czechoslovakia). Another thrirteen years passed, i can understand english and i enjoy Manowar more than ever. When i am tired or angry, there is nothing better than run some of manowar cd or nightwish, evanescense or something like that.  <br /> <br />What i like about manowar except the music is their lyrics. pleasure slave anyone? I bet the guys read the Gor (chronicles of counter-earth) series by John Norman. What i mean.. its not only the sexuality or their cocky attitude, its the way they do not care about politicall corectness and such stuff, they just sing what they want. They are free in this.
B0002X314C|5.0|I love this CD.  I can listen to it over and over.  If you only buy one CD all year, buy this one.  Very seldom is there a CD where you like all the songs.  Or even most of the songs.  My daughter listens to it, she is 27 and I love it and I am 46.
6305603847|3.0|I am a long-time fan and follower of The Floyd, their music has touched me in a way that no other band has. My favorite works by them are Dark Side, Animals, and Meddle. The Wall is an amazing story more than it is an album. Although it is great, it is not really a Floyd album to me, because it lacks the greatest asset that floyd has to offer: the epicly symphonic pieces of rock music. (excepting Comfortably Numb). The album was made to be listened to by yourself in a dark room. The story is meant to be composed by you, in your head. It is supposed to be meaningful to you in your own head. You deserve to have your own interpretation of it. The Wall is a good movie by movie terms, but it goes against everything that the Wall stood for. The album is ofcourse, asking for a movie like this, but it is much better for the movie to just be in your head, not spoonfed to you by the screen. If you want the quintessential Floyd movie, sync up the Wizart of Oz with Dark side of the Moon, and you will see the Floyd for what they really are.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Excelente serie, tiene todos los ingredientes para convertirse en un cl&aacute;sico.

B00070DK14|5.0|After their controversial \\"A\\" album from 1980, Jethro Tull charged into the year 1982 with their outstanding release, \\"The Broadsword And The Beast.\\" Truly one of the group's very best works, \\"Broadsword\\" saw Jethro Tull acquire two new band members in the forms of keyboardist Peter John Vettese and drummer Gerry Conway. Vettese added a more keyboard-heavy, synthesised gloss to Tull's trademark folk-rock, and the combination works amazingly well. \\"Broadsword\\" also features some of the best material Tull frontman Ian Anderson had written since 1977's \\"Songs From The Wood.\\" Lots of Tull goodies on this one, such as the marching rock of \\"Beastie,\\" the catchy \\"Fallen On Hard Times\\" (which the band appropriately released as a single), the anthemic \\"Broadsword,\\" the fun of \\"Watching Me Watching You,\\" and the atmospheric punch of \\"The Clasp\\" and \\"Seal Driver.\\" Also, this new remaster of \\"Broadsword\\" comes with a very generous helping of *eight* bonus songs all recorded during the sessions for the album, including the Christmas-themed \\"Jack Frost And The Hooded Crow,\\" the part-ballad/part-rocker \\"Jack A Lynn,\\" and the excellent \\"Overhang\\" and \\"I Am Your Gun.\\" The album's early-80's production is top-notch, and Jethro Tull themselves sound truly inspired on this set. All the way around, \\"The Broadsword And The Beast\\" is a great Tull classic.
B000003S0D|3.0|I've got to say that I had this in my collection a long time before I listened to more than the first and last tracks.  \\"Cirkus\\" is good just for the downplayed lyrics.  The singer (Gordon Haskell) isn't really that great, but for this song, he is very low in the mix, and you only really hear the tone of his voice which works really well for this song--kind of builds up tension.  When the acoustic guitar solo rips through your stereo, you won't know what hit you.  \\"Indoor Games,\\" \\"Happy Family,\\" and \\"Lady of The Dancing Water\\" are all so so.  You'll be able to enjoy them if you're into the band as they all follow classic KC form.  The flavor is different, though.  A sax is high in the mix, the vocals aren't always pulled off well and there are moments of \\"popishness\\" that's not characteristic of the band's sound.  The \\"Lizard\\" suite meanders, and the different sections of the song are sometimes only fit together with silence in between.  At times the volume of the flute is so low, you really need headphones to appreciate it.  The ending is drawn out, like any 20-minute progressive rock epic of the time.  Listen to the song all in one sitting, and really pay attention and it's actually pretty good.  This is not a CD I can really play for other people, nobody really \\"gets it\\" unless they're a fan of the band.  I occaisonally like to listen to \\"Cirkus\\" and \\"Lizard\\" if I have time, but I this CD really doesn't get a lot of playtime by me.   <br /> <br />ISLANDS, the band's next release, would show a group of progressive rock musicians at the top of their game.  LIZARD, can be thought of as a failed attempt, but it is halfway there.
0743455967|5.0|I have always admired Stephen King throughout his long and successful writing career.  When I saw this book, I decided to read it as well.  I must say that this title only further enhanced my admiration for the man.<br /><br />I found very useful advice and insight for any aspiring author.  The advice contained in this book makes it worth the price.  However, it doesn't stop there.  Stephen King walks us through how his career began and the struggles he had in getting there and staying there.<br /><br />Mr. King even comments on the accident in Maine that left him with serious injuries.  Aspiring writer or just a Stephen King fan, this book is for all of you.
B00005NB8K|2.0|I saw this movie when it first came out (March 1, 1991).  I was 21 years old, and a huge DOORS fan.  I liked it okay back then, but upon seeing it now, it's boring, and makes it appear that the other members did little or nothing to contribute to the band and its success (Robby Krieger, the guitar player, WROTE 'LIGHT MY FIRE').  I think Val Kilmer does an Oscar-caliber job as Jim, but the others are only there to react to things Jim says and does.  They have no other purpose except to fill in those roles-most anyone could have done that.  I don't think a lot of people realize that Jim Morrison was many things, BUT HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN.  HE DIDN'T PLAY AN INSTRUMENT, and he wasn't THAT great a singer (though I will say that he was damn good when he was good).  THE DOORS were a great band, but that was a long time ago.  As far as the studio albums go, the first two were great, the second two were mediocre (though 'STRANGE DAYS' has a couple of decent tracks), and the last two were hit and miss.  I wasn't there, so I don't know about how they were live (videos and live CDs are NOT THE SAME as being there).  Another reviewer said that Meg Ryan was a poor choice to play Pam.  I agree.  Listening to Stone talk about it on disc 2 tells us why.  Ryan sounds like she was/is unable to comprehend the type of behavior that Pam/Jim engaged in, i.e. drugs, rebellion, etc.  Stone said the same thing about Darryl Hannah regarding her failed attempt to play Darian in WALL STREET (a far superior movie to this one by the way).  I don't understand why Stone would choose to have someone play a role like this when they obviously were unable to 'find and be' the character they were supposed to be portraying.  Stone should have chosen more wisely.  I think Stone's obsession with Jim is the reason this movie is really all about Jim.  Of the many problems in it, the one that probably bothers me the most is that the movie acts like Jim is the center of the universe, as the camera is almost always on him.  But Oliver Stone's Jim Morrison is juvenile, destructive, obnoxious, and often, pointless.  He hardly comes off as a genius, poetic or otherwise.  He suddenly has star status, but the movie doesn't show why-we're supposed to know why.  Yet, why should we care??? The character is despicable, at least that's the way he's written here.  I couldn't even finish the film-I simply didn't care that he was headed for a youthful demise.  When I read 'Riders on the Storm' and 'No One Here Gets Out Alive', I found myself caring about the people involved-not here though.  Moreover, the photography was irritating, to say the least.  I wanted to know about THE DOORS, instead, I got an MTV-type drug trip with DOORS music behind it.  As a big studio movie, I think this fails on all levels except one-Val Kilmer's performance.  As another reviewer noted, this is the best acting he's ever done.  It's too bad that the movie/script he had to work with was/is over-hyped junk.
020530902X|5.0|This is THE Essential Writer's Guide. I learned about this book way back in high school and I have used it extensively ever since.<br /><br />It works for those of us who are writing papers for school, work, or even just for fun.  This book offers insight into many aspects of writing and shows the CORRECT way for everything.  No wonder it's the reference for just about every professional writer on the planet.<br /><br />Check out \\"The Digital Umbrella\\"... another book written by an author who used Elements of Style.
B000683VI4|5.0|If I could have found something different in the video store I would never have rented this movie.  I'm not a big fan of the scmaltzy romance and I really have a dislike for the novels Nicholas Sparks.  This movie, however, really surprised me.  At its hearts, The Notebook is a story of everlasting love and what we give up in order to embrace that love.  From the very beginning you're attached to the characters of Noah and Allie; their love for each other, their separation during the war, and the class bigotry that tried to keep them apart.  Overall, the cast is perfect.  Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have perfect chemistry as the young Noah and Allie; while James Garner and Gena Rowlands are wonderful as their older versions.  Having seen many of John Cassavetes movies I find it interesting that his son would choose such a romance, but Nick Cassavetes really pulls it off without turning it into the saccharine sweet mess it has the potential to be.  Don't get me wrong, there are definitely some moments in this film, but overall it's just a nice, sweet romance.  Heck, even I found myself a little emotional near the end.
B00000099Y|5.0|I've found myself up late, sitting at home, bored sh**less and can't sleep, thought I'd crank up some Tool, surf the net for a while, you know. Anyway(!), since I was listening to Aenima I thought I'd jump on and check out some reviews, see what other people think of it.  <br /> <br />I particularly focused on all the negative and 1-2 star reviews. Now I have to admit, some of you have very good points about why you don't like this album, which is fine, everyone is entitled to an opinion. Heck, that's what keeps this planet interesting, is it not?  <br /> <br />Now I've just listened to the album from start to finish, again, and I can't flaw it! I just can't! So my advice is, forget all the hype, forget what everyone else thinks and decide for yourself.  <br /> <br />Personally, I don't think you'll regret your purchase, but if you do, I really fell sorry for you, cause you're not hearing this album the way I am - pure perfection!  <br /> <br />Excuse the pun, but Aenima is simply music to my ears! Well done Tool!
B0000000LI|5.0|As a young boy I only listened to R&B and Rap and thats what my peers listened to.  One day when I was about 13 I saw a special on TV and it was Yanni performing at the acropolis.  I was captured, I went to the store an purchased his CD and from then on I was in love with this mans music.  This opened me up to all sorts of other genres, Yanni would be the reason why I have a love for music so much.  This CD is stunning, I still to this day sit back and just listen and dream.  This music free's my mind from all of its day to day stresses, and keeps me alive and appreciative.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|<br />SO. When does season 4 come out on DVD???  <br /> <br />I think disk 4 and 5 on Season 3 are my favorite ones.
0446677450|1.0|This book has some good points, but could they could be written in 3 points. <br />1).  Gain profit producing assets (real estate, stock) <br />2).  Re-invest for  more profit producing assets. <br />3).  Avoid liabilities <br /> <br />Disappointed that no methods for doing the above for the poor were laid out.   <br /> <br />I think Mr. Kiyosaki is another saturday morning get rich quick scheme guy.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This album is really awesome!!Every track of it is very good!!Everytime i hear their songs the more i i get inspired to write songs about the government. It makes me wanna slam and mosh!! Especially the song \\"FRANCO UNAMERICAN\\" AND \\"IDIOTS ARE TAKING OVER\\". So, I think you should buy this album mann. I guarantee you will not regret!!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Ok, so I hate Jude Law...and I can't stand Gwynnie...but I have to admit they made this movie an enjoyable experience (unlike the Jude and Nicole combo in Cold Mountain). So, I can't say I agree with the people that say Jude and Gwynnie don't have enough chemistry between them; they have supplied the exact amount of weight to their characters to make them a part of the \\"blue-screen\\" universe around them.    It takes a certain type of story to successfully sell the audience on using the \\"blue-screen\\" technique on everything except for the main actors & props and this movie succeeds on that level because of the genre it is spawning from. I use \\"spawn\\" because no matter how retro you make something, it's not the real thing. However, Kerry Conran gets nothing but my humble admiration in this respect as the design work provides a visual feast fit for anyone and everyone this side of \\"Star Wars\\".    As you know, the main heroes embark on a journey that will lead them across several different backdrops in their quest to stop the man known as Totenkoff. As I'm sure you've read already that the whole story plays off the \\"Wizard of Oz\\", but even without this knowledge, it's easy to guess these intentions going into it.     Also, if you realize this movie is a throwback to old action serials, you should be smart enough to also realize the filmmakers were not going for \\"Oscar-winning\\" performances, to put it that way. What you get is a series of nail-biting action sequences that tease you into thinking it's the end of our heroes all wrapped up by a climax that will leave you cheering for more. Gwynnie, the expression on your face in the last shot gave this whole movie the closure I needed. Only, I still can't stand you in anything else, similar to the way that women only like Orlando Bloom in Legolas attire.     Anyway, you will probably enjoy this movie if:    * You have you ever wondered what \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" would be like if you added a sci-fi twist to it.  *  You like Angelina Jolie; when I saw that eye patch of hers I couldn't stop myself from mentally marrying her Franky Cook character to Snake Plissken from \\"Escape from New York\\"...the wedding album alone is worth daydreaming about....or maybe it's just me.  *  Metallic soft-edged gizmos and robots turn you into a giggling little schoolgirl and you aren't in fact already a giggling little schoolgirl, that is...  *  You like Angelina Jolie just as much with her clothes on because that's the only way you'll see her in this movie.   *  You can swallow the fact that the world's safety depends on one Sky Captain...what's everyone else doing while the world is in jeopardy? Probably having a wine and cheese event...ah, brie how I love thee...  *  You like Angelina Jolie; she says \\"Alert the amphibious squadron!\\" with so much conviction and you'd better do it if you know what's good for you! She may place her shiny boot where the sun don't shine if you don't listen up.....ah, dream woman.  *  You appreciate good campy sense of humor and one scene of violence that teaches scientists why it's best not to run on ahead of the hero.    Sadly enough, kids who watch this movie may not be impressed by the nostalgic feeling it generates and instead may go home with a feeling of being ripped off at the lack of gore, blood, mutilation, foul language, etc. I say \\"That's a good boy, Kerry.\\"
6304712499|2.0|In classical music parlance, this movie is something of a Symphonie Fantastique. It has a lot of fantastic -- meaning out of this world, not necessarily great -- imagry but not much else to recommend.<br /><br />Some of the other reviewers seem to know what's going on in this movie. It appeared to me the story was two enemies battle each other in a good vs. evil episode. I guess that's the story here, although that fat clown that turns into a computer-generated dragon won't go down in film history as one of the great bad guys of all time.<br /><br />What I did find entertaining were the computer scenes in Hell, where the good guy and a buddy battled the dragon. That was pretty interesting, what with all the heat and flames and darkness along the way.<br /><br />I am not naturally drawn to this kind of movie -- something based on a comic book that is a complete fantasy where just about nothing in the movie could happen in real life.<br /><br />Having said that, I greatly enjoyed and admired \\"RoboCop\\" when it came out and set a new standard for computer-generated action. I thought about that movie while I watched this hapless drama unfold.<br /><br />This film completely lacks \\"RoboCop\\"s wonderful direction, action-packed plot and wonderful characterizations but it did have those great scenes in Hell. So I found something worthwhile in this movie that kept my attention.<br /><br />This is about as far from my typical fare as possible and I still wonder how I stumbled on it one night. If this happens to you, stick around and you'll probably find one thing here you like or enjoy.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|this movie was great. perfect sports movie. one of the best. even better than friday night lights, which is saying something.everyone should see this movie. probably not great for really young ages but early teens if fine. MUST SEE MOVIE!!!
B000929AJQ|4.0|Interesting compilation of tracks.  After a few listens and as the complexity of the various songs grew on me, I've come to the conclusion that With Teeth is worth sinking...well..your teeth into.  If you're in a really pissed off mood, pop in Track #2 You Know What You Are? or #7 Only and you'll feel a lot better.  All in all, not as hard as it could have been, but as morose and intense as ever.
B00005JNQ8|5.0|This complex thriller concerns U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), who grew up in a war-torn African country, now ruled by dictator Dr. Zuwanie.  She overhears (or does she?) a plot to kill Zuwanie at the UN in three days.  Secret Service agent Keller (Sean Penn) is assigned to protect her and to see if she has any involvement in the plot.  He learns Silvia was active in the anti-Zuwanie movement back home, where her parents and siblings were killed by him.  As the day of Zuwanie's appearance at the U.N. approaches, several attempts are made on Silvia's life.  But is she an innocent caught up in a political storm or is she an assassin?<br /><br />Kidman is great as the mysterious interpreter who is filled with her grief and her ideals, and maybe is not what she seems.  Penn gives a refreshingly understated performance as a dedicated agent and recently-bereaved husband.  The script avoids a clich&eacute; romance between the two stars, but shows their connection to be heartfelt, nonetheless.  Filmed entirely in New York City, there is a constant sense of danger, helped by an intense and energetic soundtrack.  This movie is not particularly scary or violent, but succeeds because of the fine acting of the two stars and a script that makes you pay attention and think about what you are watching.  Heartily recommended.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Can an album evoke so much unbridled passion and intensity that it makes you feel totally immersed in the music as you thoughtfully digest the lyrics from the enclosed lyrics insert? Funeral can...and will.  A rather inauspicious debut title, Funeral, is rather apropos after all upon reading in the insert how several bandmates had multiple deaths occur to both family and friends while recording their debut album.  So, the pervasive despair, the unremitting passion, the undeniable emotion, the revealing introspection, and the infectious intensity are all genuine.  No BS pop-contrived hooks or manufactured tripe is to be found in such amazing songs as Neighborhood #3 (Power Out), Haiti, Wake Up, Rebellion, and In the Backseat.  Pick it up today and read the lyrics insert as you listen.  After 3 listens, you'll be nothing short of immersed in this incredible genre-defying music.
B000000W5L|5.0|Perhaps the Stones's most inspired work, and it sounds even better if you're drunk.
B00005O3VC|5.0|As you know King Arthur is one of the most (if not the most) reminded character of the Western tradition that overpasses by far the kingdom's domains to inscribe in the essential paradigm and meaning about the lost values and the inability to get a true and effective unity in the love. All happiness is far to be innocent said Jean Anouilh. And the story of Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot will be engaging to millions and millions future readers over and over again. The mythic roots are too powerful and survive far beyond any other circumstance or religious belief.<br /><br />Monthy Phyton makes a fantastic turn of page about this legend and precisely due its black humor doses, put us in context with some revelations that can not be told by reasons politically correct. The sense of irreverence, and sharp deformation of the personages helps still more to get a closer approach to the meaning of this legend.<br /><br />Go for this ever lasting cult movie and if I may express with absolute sincerity this is the real masterpiece of that legendary ensemble.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw the movie last night, and ended up looking at it again , last night! I thought that the production was good, I even liked that this cast, a bit younger, something that Crawford fans may not love, he is after all in his 60's now.  <br />Emmy Rossum was luminous but Gerard Butler was in a word\\"smouldering\\" and he could actually sing! Patrik Wilson was good, Minny Driver was very funny as Carlotta.  <br />Great supporting cast.  <br />Great movie a must keep!
B0000AUHPB|5.0|A British institution (shown there on TV almost every Christmas) this is a movie not to be taken seriously but with a pinch of salt. If you don't understand that statement then forget it! Be aware - especially if you have seen the remake first - that this is a comedy first and foremost with some classic chase scenes. Some reviewers complain that it is dated, well that because it is - get over it this and enjoy a 60's romp with Michael Caine in full Alfie mode. This is not a film for those looking for social messages, deep meaning or plot cohesion, but one for those appreciative of British humor, ingenious car chases and who do not get hung up over the (nowadays) politically incorrect cultural stereotypes. There are some great lines (\\"the only way to get through it is, we all work together as a team - and that means you do everything I say\\" ) and the special features are worthwhile checking out. Could be considered more of a lads' movie but goes down great with kids too. Get your skates on mate, grab a beer, sit back and enjoy.
B000002G87|5.0|It's been thirty-five years, and Clapton has yet to put out a better album than this 1970 release. After touring with Delaney and Bonnie, Clapton went into the studio with band members Bobby Whitlock (keyboards, guitar),  Jim Gordon (drums), Carl Radle (bass), and guest artist Duane Allman (guitars).  In less than ten days they recorded one of the classic albums of all time.<br /><br />Whether they are putting their own stamp on blues standards like \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out\\" and \\"Key to the Highway,\\" or performing originals like \\"I Looked Away,\\" \\"Keep On Growing,\\" \\"Anyday, \\"Tell the Truth\\" and \\"Why Does Love Have To Be So Sad?\\" (all written by Clapton-Whitlock), these songs are filled with passion, soul and fire.  And then, of course, there's the title track, the seven-minute \\"Layla.\\" [Note:  \\"Layla\\" did not become a Top 10 hit until eighteen months later when it was included on the compilation album HISTORY OF ERIC CLAPTON. That album also includes an earlier Phil Spector-produced version of \\"Tell the Truth\\" that was released as a single, but re-recorded during the LAYLA sessions.]<br /><br />While these sessions occured during what had to be an emotional low in Clapton's personal life, he channeled those emotions into the most powerful album of his career. There's a huge gap in your CD library if you don't own a copy of this album  ESSENTIAL
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Im so sorry DT fans- there is no way to lift this curse of an album!!!! OUCH- STAY CLEAR OF METAL DT- you are not METALLICA! cheap way to get more fans-- in my opinion- STREAM only good prog song....STAY CLEAR  <br /> <br />ps. I MISS IMAGES AND WORD DAYS- and oh yeah- they wrote this album IN THREE WEEKS-----IT SHOWS!!!!! cheap way to earn a buck!! Im pissed..........
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Well, gang...after a family consciencious, we have all come up with an overall rating for this movie to a resounding 4 stars!!! <br />Beautiful musical...the actors did a splendid job with the material as well. Emmy Rossum was stellar in her performance as Christine!!  I have to admit, that the majority in the family said that the \\"Phantom\\" should have been played by someone with a better voice...this is not my opinion...I feel that he did great!!  It is about time that they brought beautiful films such as this, back to the mainstream in theater!!
B00005JNBQ|3.0|It appears high school hasn't changed much for social misfits since Carrie burned down the gym or even since Jan Brady didn't make the cheerleading squad. The primary goal of this breed continues to be to find acceptance among peers they have empowered to be their superiors by the will of their own self-consciousness. Napoleon Dynamite is merely the latest incarnation in this 2004 MTV-produced comedy. The movie has nice visual touches (like the food-oriented opening credits) and some funny moments, a few even inspired (the sign-language version of \\"The Rose\\", the chicken farm scenes). It's also admirable that director Jared Hess (who co-wrote the movie with his wife Jerusha) goes neither the smutty nor the slasher route in drawing viewer attention. However, your enjoyment of this film will depend strictly on your ability to relate to a series of episodes that play out like one of those 1950's education films on how to behave on a prom date but reset to present-day, small-town Idaho. For me, the plights of the title character and his friends Pedro and Deb just aren't interesting enough to hold my attention. Accentuating the void is the fact that they are called upon to look very stilted and speak in deadpan, monotone voices. While amusing for about five minutes, it stretches an 86-minute movie into something that feels interminably longer.<br /><br />Jon Heder certainly looks the part of the supreme geek outsider with his red `fro, aviator glasses and polyester prom suit. But his character is simply not fleshed out enough to root for his success, as he avoids eye contact when he talks and encourages the abuse he gets from the more popular kids. As Napoleon's new best friend from Mexico, Efren Ramirez plays Pedro, who has no qualms about asking a popular girl out or running for class president. Former big-time child actress Tina Majorino (she was the little map-tattooed girl in \\"Waterworld\\") portrays Deb as a painfully shy girl who fancies herself as an Annie Liebowitz-type of photographer. They're all quirky enough, but you simply pay attention to these characters because no one else will. Usually someone like Napoleon would have a successful big brother to taunt him, but instead we have 32-year old Kip played with equal deadpan style by a pale-white Aaron Ruell. Kip spends most of his free time in online chat rooms and ultimately has a fanciful romance with his cyber-girlfriend, Lafawnduh. In fact, if you wait for the ending credits to finish, they even have a pastoral wedding. While the idea is funny, the ludicrous nature of the relationship feels overly contrived. Providing more honest laughs is Jon Gries as the moronic, self-proclaimed lady-killer Uncle Rico. With his 1980's-style toupee and constantly flexing his non-existent muscles, he lives in past gridiron glories that probably never happened, even buying a mail-order time machine to transport him back. His new career selling Tupperware makes for a couple of funny scenes.<br /><br />In fact, there are several amusing ideas, but they don't seem to add up to anything that memorable by the poignant tetherball-swinging end. One almost longs for the return of \\"The Breakfast Club\\" and \\"Sixteen Candles\\". Even the climax is oddly unfulfilling as Pedro's presidential aspirations hinge on Napoleon displaying some pretty impressive dance moves to a song by Jamiroquai. The DVD includes four deleted scenes and a black-and-white short called \\"Peluca\\", which stars Heder and provides the basis for the movie. There is also audio commentary by the director, Heder and producer Jeremy Coon. This is the first time I encountered a DVD that uses both sides to provide the full and widescreen versions, but it also means you need to flip your disc to see all the features.

B0007TKNIS|2.0|Everyone else has written wonderful comparisons about the movie and the musical. Obivously, even if you've never seen the musical, you know that the movie version is going to be different because, well, you don't get the luxury of \\"takes\\" on stage, and a movie is much larger than a stage production ever could be.<br /><br />For the movie itself, this DVD was magnificent. \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is one of the best movies I've ever seen, with the stunning visuals and well-rounded cast of actors and actresses. As a DVD, the full-screen edition SUCKS, because, well, there are no extras! All you get is the theatrical trailer. Had I paid attention instead of just assuming that the Full-Screen DVD would have all the same extras as I'd seen advertised for the Special Edition Wide Screen version, I would have never bought this DVD. I was foaming at the mouth with excitement over getting home and watching the behind-the-scenes documentary, and instead all I got was the preview. Bluh.<br /><br />But if you don't care about extras and just want to see the movie, then BUY IT!! By all means, BUY THIS MOVIE. It's a wonderful adaptation of one of the most beautiful stories ever told on stage, and everyone should see it at least once. But if you, like me, buy DVDs for the extra content, skip the Full-Screen version and get the 2-disc collector's edition, which is NOT, by the way, offered in any other format but Wide-Screen. Stupid Warner Brothers! LOL
B00063MBU8|2.0|Simple Plan is a bunch of lazy, MTV sellouts. The only thing that keeps me from giving this album a one is \\"Untitled\\". It has a lot of emotion, and it reminds me of Straylight Run. (Which is'nt a bad thing, because they are so much better than Simple Plan.) Too bad a song that powerful was wasted on such a talentless band.
B0002858YS|1.0|why people would ever buy this album amazes me! The Killers are a decent band.. i guess.. but lets just get this straight, they only have 2 good songs \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\" that's essentially all they have to offer, don't buy this album, borrow it then return it the next day.. for your own sake!
B0007TKH66|5.0|Why? The actors, the stories, the atmosphere, the creativity--in short, it is a quality product from its very first episode.  <br /> <br />The production quality of the DVD set is exceptional--I can enjoy Enterprise in surround sound in 16:9 wide screen nirvana.  <br /> <br />On a personal note:  <br />I own the DVD sets for the other Star Trek series--(Yep--forget vacations, I own all the Star Trek DVDs in the <br />universe!)--but this is the ONLY one I have unsealed and watched!  <br /> <br />I have realized that this show has portrayed some of the best science fiction on television.  <br />And that is this series' hallmark.
B0007TKH66|4.0|A short comment - these are not the episodes as aired! A quick sampling of a couple of episodes reveals some differences in editing from the versions I faithfully recorded on VHS years ago. 'Desert Crossing' differs in trivial ways, for example. But the DVD is packaged in a style befitting a _Star Trek_ offering, and the added features are entertaining, amusing, even informative. Get a second copy, put it in a vault with the plastic unbroken, and have a worthy relic for your kids. And in case you were worried - yes, it is indeed viewable as 16:9 hi def. Sound is selectable between 5:1 and 2-channel Dolby. I have no complaints, but had to mention the editing.  Engage!
B000929AJQ|4.0|First off, as far as where this album is musically, forget the comparisons to previous albums, they won't tell you anything. To all those who say this album sounds the same as his others, you obviously haven't listened closely enough (and of course they're gonna sound somewhat similar - after all, it is the SAME person putting out these albums). To all of those who think this isn't a masterpiece like TDS or The Fragile, you're right, it isn't. To be honest, I didn't really want a \\"masterpiece\\". Sometimes I just feel like listening to a good rock record that doesn't demand deep concentration and focus to enjoy and to fully \\"get it\\". Here, Trent has chilled out a little and given us a record that rocks, grooves, plods, and moves without any pretense.    With Teeth is exactly the kind of album Trent needed to put out. The Fragile (and even TDS before it) were extremely involved, layered, and methodically planned (although it worked very well for those albums). With this album, you get a straightforward rock album recorded with actual acoustic drums (by the way, is Dave Grohl the only rock drummer around anymore??? it's not like the parts he put down are complicated...), all the while still keeping Trent's trademark production, piano lines, hushed to intense vocals, and varied song style/structure. Nothing Trent is doing here is extremely new, but he has placed variations on themes he's explored before while adding an extra sense of musicianship - namely, more beat/drum n bass/groove centered songs, particularly on \\"Only\\", \\"Sunspots\\", \\"The Collector\\", and the lead single \\"The Hand That Feeds\\". He also expands on his layered, piano guided themes on \\"All the Love in the World\\" and \\"Right Where it Belongs\\".    Bottom line, don't get overemotional about this release. No need to expect this album to change your life. This is Trent just jamming out and enjoying his craft.
B00064VR0W|5.0|Track 15 (I Don't Want to Talk About It) on this DVD is fantastic.  <br /> <br />Everyone (Friends and Family) who has seen this DVD has simply raved about the fresh new talent of Amy Belle and the way that Rod has plucked her from obscurity and put her into the spotlight of this performance. <br /> <br />Say what you will about Rod's gravelly voice, but the overall presentation on this DVD is superb.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|A beer and a tear here.<br />Growing (gnawing) on me with each listen.<br />I couldn't comment on whether or not Mr. Adams is trendy,derivative or cool-nor could I care less. I say this is a fine effort.<br />Pensive,perceptive,intelligent,honest,emotive country boy blues.The songs resonate beautifully with Ryan's rueful writing  and the Cardinals fine backing.<br />Adams has never been known to be a sanguine singer-songwriter and here is no exception. His confessionals are bleak bare-knuckled stuff. So be warned -there's some pretty sad stuff here.<br />Favorites so far: \\"Now that you're gone\\"- a tearjerking dirge on lost life/love; \\"Cherry Lane\\"- a sweet and sour love song, and \\"Sweet Illusions\\"- piercing Orbison-esque crooning that puts an arrow straight through the heart of me.<br />Can't stop listening to the whole damn thing. My newest and bluest obsession...
B000002UVX|5.0|This amazing album is the last album that Jimi Hendrix released while he was alive. It offers a fusion of pure Hendrix and funky rifts that have just a great rhythm to them. This album set the tone for the rest of the decade music wise. This is Jimi's finest live album, maybe album alone. Not suggested for beginners, get Are You Experienced, Axis and Ladyland and their greatest hits first.
B00001QEE9|5.0|Pinocchio is planned to be re-released on a platinum/special edition (the time has not been announced yet).<br /><br />The first limited issue release of this DVD was weak. Disney then re-released Pinocchio on \\"Gold Collection\\", but many of the disk inside were still limited issue disk. The limited edition DVD contains no bonus features and has a modest transfer (The sound is excellent, but the picture is sometimes grainy and color is in need of restoration).<br /><br />Basically, Disney gave this film and viewers the shaft (on the first DVD release). It's now rumored that Pinnochio platinum won't appear till 2008, but I doubt we will see it till at least 2009. It's obvious that they are trying to avoid releasing it at all. I wish they would just put Pinnochio and Songs of the South on Disney treasures, and Leonard Maltin could apologize for them before we watch it. That would be better then possibly censoring it, as they have with other titles such as melody time.<br /><br />(NOTE: the little mermaid is scheduled for platinum in 2006). Dont miss Cinderella platinum in fall 2005<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />It's now rumored that Pinnochio platinum won't appear till 2008, but I doubt we will see it till at least 2009
B000002P5R|5.0|This is the album Jimi Hendrix was working on when he died. Some of the songs on here were not quite finished because of his death, but this is an amzing and beautiful assortment of songs, and it gives a look into where Jimi was trying to go with his music when he died of asphyxia in his sleep in September of 1970. Some of the best songs on here are Dolly Dagger, Ezy Rider, Izabella, and My Friend. I highly recommend this album for someone very intersted in the life of Jimi Hendrix, not just in his big hits like Purple Haze and Manic Depression, because there are no hits on here. There's the greatest hits for those songs.
0312995423|3.0|I picked up his book for flight reading, don't even realizing the so commented author of the DaVinci Code wrote it. It was an easy reading, fast paced story, and good mix of action and technology. It was a little farfetched, too many coincidences, and too many obsessive and shallow characters. I had fun and enjoyed reading this book, but I won't read it again. Don't expect much of this book, I didn't not find in it what I have heard of others Brown's books. But if you are up to for easy reading with hackers and lots of dead people, you may enjoy it.
B000002P5W|5.0|Jimi Hendrix's sophomore album was very different from Are You Experienced? his debut. Axis:Bold as Love offers more depth in the songwriting and some calmer rifts than the acid fueled andscreechy, yet mind-blowing enjoyable solos on the Experience's debut. There are some beautiful songs on this album like Little Wing and Castles made of Sand. This is not suggested ofr a starter album for a beginner, and even less so is Electric Ladyland. But if you have at least A.Y.E., I suggest you get this album.
B000929AJQ|3.0|I decided I was going to give this one a real listen before I hastily gave it some half assed review...after about twenty listens I have to sadly admit, its a bit of a letdown. Why? Well, being a die hard Nails fan and, after waiting six brutally long years, I had my(understandably lofty) expectations and they simply were not met. Dont get me wrong, as a stand alone piece, \\"With Teeth\\" is a tremendous effort. However, as part of the flawless NIN discography, it just doesnt hold up.  More specifically, its lacking many of the key ingredients that have made up 90% of all prior NIN works. First off, the songs are just too damn short. Youve written an incredible song, and now your gonna cut it short at 3 minutes!?...what a rip off. Secondly, where is the continuity between songs, giving the album its textbook NIN storybook feel? When listening to any good industrial artist, you look forward to the multiples of peaks and troughs which ultimately provide that complex layered sound. Unfortunately, on \\"With Teeth\\", that formula is virtually knowhere to be found. Its almost like Trent had some B-sides from all his prior works, and sloppily compiled them into one incohesive album. Lastly, your known as a true FORWARD THINKING pioneer in the electronic/industrial genre, so where the hell is the risk taking? Anyone that says this album pushes the envelope for a specific genre that Trent basically perfected, doesnt understand the impact that Nails has had in the past.  On the flip side, this is a very accesible album (especially for all the NIN virgins out there). Catchy tunes, solid lyrics and Grohl pounding away on drums all make for an enjoyable listen. Furthermore, theres a little something for everyone here; the slow and dark pace of \\"all the love in the world\\" is reminiscent of a classic Downward Spiral track. The faster paced more aggro-industrial sound of \\"You know What You Are\\" could easily be added to \\"Broken\\". The brilliant and addictive synthy sound of \\"Only\\" (the standout here) is straight out of the good old \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" days. And last and definitely least...\\"The Hand That Feeds\\"-which is your typical radio-friendly pop song; a track which feels like it was politically forced onto the final track listing. Lastly, skip \\"With Teeth\\" all together, its downright annoying.   As negative as the afore-mentioned sounds, the album is still quite good. I guess I just feel somewhat cheated; Ive invested alot into NIN over the past 15 years, and after waiting such a ridiculously long time for new material, I expect to be simply blown away.  Bottom line-go buy the album, and decide for yourself.
B00005JL78|4.0|What an imagination this guy has! I saw this movie in the <br />theater, and thought it was really cool. A world without <br />murder, someday maybe. If you haven't seen this movie yet, <br />rent it today, it's great. A couple of parts will make you <br />jump out of your seat! Excellent special FX too!
B000002U8G|4.0|This is where is all begins for the great career of a fine, fine band. This album JUST WORKS- Its got a great range- full of many different sounds- A MUST OWN for a rock fan!!!!!!!!
B000002UAF|5.0|In it's simpliest form, music should make you feel good. The Beatles catalog is abundant with songs that achieve a good feeling on many diferent levels. From the cerebral to the insane. However, A hard days night leaves little to think about. Just enjoy ! This is probably the happiest album i have ever heard ! The boys seem really in sync and enjoying things. \\"If I fell\\" is brilliant, a supreme sing-a-long song. In fact the whole album is  one big sing-a-along. The closing track \\"I'll be back\\" shows signs of the accoustic Rubber Soul days to come. \\"Things we said today\\" has always been the sleeper hit of the album for me. It shows stunning songwriting maturity for the time. I love \\"Tell me why\\" not to mention the masterpieces \\"Can't buy me love\\" \\"I should of known better\\" and the tittle track. If you do not feel good after a run through this joyous piece, then sign up for extra therapy sessions !
0688170528|4.0|This book is about Chris and Emily, childhood friends who fall in love and start dating as teenagers. Their parents are also close friends; and the whole group is like one big happy family. Tragedy strikes however when the two teens are brought into the hospital; Emily shot to death and Chris wounded. Chris tells investigators that it was a botched suicide pact; as secrets start coming out though they believe he is lying. <br /> <br />Like many other of Picoult's books, this one has it's share of twists and turns that make it hard to put down. I felt she also did a good job of describing what Emily was feeling, and what may have led her to suicide. What I didn't find as believable as Chris's character: I think most teenagers in his situation would've handled it differently. Also, I felt that Jordan--the lawyer--was stereotypical, as well as ridiculous in some aspects: How many lawyers are going to insist on eating Cocoa Krispies the morning before a trial for good luck? And how many are going to put their clients on the stand without knowing what they'll be saying? Not many, I would reckon. But in spite of the unrealistic courtroom theatrics, this book is still good. A perfect pick if you're looking for something involving but still light.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have listened to the music from the Phantom for years. Michael Crawford's singing was a gift. So when the dvd released I was in much doubt of a new Phantom. I have to say that I was totally mesmerized by Gerard Butler's performance of the Phantom! He brings so much heart and emotion into his performance. As he sings to Christine you can't help but fall in love with his voice and his character. I'm sure all of us girls would love to have someone make us feel the way Christine must have felt! I found myself feeling so sad for the Phantom, as his love is so desperate and Christine betrays him. Emmy Rossum did an amazing job as well, her voice is beautiful. In the point of no return scene you could truly feel her desire and pure emotion in the song. Definetly the most romantic and sexy song in the movie, Gerard Butler's presence and voice is overwhelmingly intoxicating. Girls, if you are looking for a movie to get emotionally involved with this is it. I've watched it 6 times already and still think it's amazing. I look forward to seeing this young cast in future films. Hopefully we'll be seeing alot more of Gerard Butler as the new James Bond, what can I say, he's incredibly sexy!!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I have been a fan of the phantom of the opera for years. I got the dvd about 2 days ago. The dvd version that I bought was a set. Not only did I get the dvd but I also got the book, which was great. Anyways When I first saw this movie it was so wonderful. The music and the movie work so well together. After my mom and I both got done watching this movie we were so amazed by what we had just saw and heard. This wonderful musical is a masterpiece that will be treasured for years to come.
1878424319|2.0|I suppose if you are a person with little to no education, one who has never read any of the classics of either eastern or western spirituality, and are easily impressed either through lack of intellect or lack of experience, you could find this book \\"profound.\\" Sad, really, because it is so simplistic and so obviously marketed toward new age \\"seekers.\\" Here's some advice: try a little harder, reach a little deeper. Read Chuang Tzu, The Rule of St. Benedict, The Cloud of Unknowing, Julian's Showings, Teresa of Avila. . .you'll see what drivel this book really is.    And not only is it drivel, much of it is nonsense. The bit about not taking anything personally really stands out. The author contends that nothing is about us--nothing is our fault. If someone criticizes you it is because of their reality and has no bearing on yours. I'm sorry but sometimes it IS about you. Sometimes we do something wrong and this makes the people around us justifiably angry. In that case it IS about us and we DO need to change our behavior.    This book is perfect for people who want to believe that all the problems in their lives have been brought about by the actions of others. Who want to be told that there is nothing at all that they need to change about themselves. That they simply need to do their best (something that can change from day to day) and ignore what anyone else says because other people only occupy their own dream worlds and do not occupy our own. What a pathetic excuse for a life philosophy.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|at first I thought the name of the band was funeral.  The name gives way to the poetry and dimension of the music in the arcade fire.  Take the feeling of  \\"haiti\\" there the voice/sounds of early bjork well... sugarcubes, a soft gentle voice streaming with such love and quiet beautifulness (that is not a word but...).  Yet without the sly anger of sugarcubes music!  Man, this record this music is everything you can ever enjoy in life. . .  music....    in a state that you can taste each and every sound put together so well into one package*not to dramatic.  Within this album lyes a renaissance of what music nowadays has lost,  an innocence of being hard to classify . . .
B0007GAERG|5.0|Since about the end of 2004 people began \\"buzzing\\" about Mariah Carey's new studio album.  When the buzz began people stated comments like \\"Mariah, like you've never seen before\\" and \\"Mariah's big comeback album is dropping in March\\" (which was the original release date) I can honestly say I became very excited about all the positive remarks I was reading and hearing. After researching and scratching for some insight of what was to come, I finally heard \\"It's like that\\". Which became her first single from the album. I have to admit a couple of things. One, hearing Carey's voice again was incredible. Secondly, the beat is catchy, and lastly, this song has a nice vibe to it. I couldn't wait for \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" to be released.<br /><br />  On April 12, the album finally hit stores in the U.S. Mariah began promoting the album like crazy. Appearing in Good Morning America, Trl, Best Buy,  and talking to anybody who would listen.<br /><br />  The album debuted #1 selling 404,000 copies in it's first week. The highest ever debut for Mariah Carey. At this point the album remains #2 and shows no sign of slowing down.<br /><br />  As listed in her cd, emancipation means \\"to free yourself\\" Carey has made it a point in stating that she has finally been able to be herself. Saying things like \\"my fans will finally be able to know the real me.\\" Now if I'm not mistaken how many times must we allow ourselves to believe that. Since the release of \\"Butterfly\\" Carey began saying the exact same thing. \\"I was held prisoner by my ex and now i'm free like a butterfly\\". Eight years and four cd's later she still promising us the same thing. How many different personalities does Carey have? When will we be able to know the real Mariah? Perhaps in her next three albums we will be able to be a step closer.<br /><br />  I personally agree with the media that Carey sounds more confident. Carey's vocals sound rested and in tune. Carey herself also looks rested, confident, and \\"in tune\\".<br /><br />  The album itself is a typical Carey album. Same common formula. Track #1 an uptempo track. Just recap \\"Honey\\", from \\"Butterfly\\"; \\"Heartbreaker\\" from \\"Rainbow\\"; \\"Loverboy\\" from \\"Glitter\\" and now \\"It's like that\\".  Lyrics are racer than her usual G rated  lyrics. For example, Carey says \\"I came to have a party, open up the bacardi\\", \\"purple taking me higher, i'm lifted and I like it.\\" this perhaps is what Carey means of being the \\"real\\" her.<br /><br />  Her follow up single is \\"We belong together\\". Again same concept as before. The Ballad after up tempo method. For example, Honey-butterfly, Heartbreaker-Can't take that away, Loverboy-Care Enough and now It's like that- We belong together.<br /><br />  Carey rounds up the usual collaboraters,  Jermine Dupri and Snoop Dogg. New additions include Nelly, Twista and her \\"real-life\\" minister.<br /><br />  Overall, I am pleased with the album. The U.S. is short on divas at the moment and Mariah's comeback is perfectly timed. With the downspirals of many of today's \\"divas\\" it's nice to know the good ole faithful Mariah is back on the spotlight. Everyone deserves a second chance and luckily for Mariah Americans have given her a second chance.<br /><br />  Congratulations! Mariah we welcome you into our hearts with \\"open arms\\".\\".  <br />     The album itself is a typical Carey album. Same common formula. Track #1 an uptempo track.

B00000J7A2|4.0|\\"Safe As Milk\\" remains one of the neglected classics of late 1960s rock. It sounds like a 1960s album (production-wise) but points to the future in many ways. Psychedelia pokes its melting fish head in every now and then in the form of thick reverb and spacey, far out arrangements. But something totally new also appears next to the trends of 1967: catchy staccato unsyncopated rhythms, wild slide guitar, heady lyrics, blaring harmonica, thick choppy gutars, and a totally new take on the blues. The seeds of what would become \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" some three years later begin to sprout from the tracks of this album.<br /><br />The Magic Band recorded tracks for A&M a year or so before recording \\"Safe As Milk\\". These yielded no hits, and the label and the band soon parted ways. On the strength of those sessions, however, the nascent Buddha records sought out Van Vliet for a full-length album. \\"Safe As Milk\\" was Buddha's first release. Following some personnel changes, which included adding a brilliant and very young Ry Cooder, the band hit the studio in the spring of 1967.<br /><br />The album begins autobiographically with Van Vliet almost humming \\"I was born in the desert...\\" The desert remained a vital part of and a central metaphor for the rest of Van Vliet's career. The album continues with short pop song length songs. Most run between two and three minutes. The embryonic Buddha Records were likely looking for a hit from their first recorded band.<br /><br />Though Buddha didn't get a hit (sales were not stellar), they did get a great album with some great songs. \\"Electricity\\" remains one of Van Vliet's best songs. Its straining shrieking vocal opener, boppy rhythm, cryptic lyrics and theremin-infused melody make for an unforgettable mix. The song remained a concert favorite for years. \\"Dropout Boogie\\" tells listeners not to drop out (in defiance of Timothy Leary's dictum of the day). Lines such as \\"You told you love her so bring her the butter\\" and \\"Support her support her / She says she's no boarder / get a job get a job\\" provide a direct contrast to rock music's typical anti status quo lyrics. Van Vliet seems to be rebelling against the rebellion of rock. \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" has a happy skippy rhythm that inspires foot movement. \\"Autumn's Child\\" also uses theramin to a great haunting effect. The song even feels a little creepy in places. The album also includes some rather standard-sounding numbers: \\"Call on Me\\" and the supremely heartfelt \\"I'm Glad\\". Doubtless these were meant to be the hits. They don't detract from the album, but they do sound a little anomalous.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Safe As Milk\\" represents an incredible effort for a first album. Van Vliet and the band get captured in top form. Unfortunately, the recording technology available to Buddha at the time left the album sounding a little muddled. Even Ry Cooder gave a thumbs down to the production. That remains the album's only stain.<br /><br />The bonus tracks will be of interest to Beefheart fanatics. Included are non-flanged alternate versions from the band's next project (that would eventually morph into 1968's \\"Strictly Personal\\"). These include \\"Safe As Milk\\", \\"Trust Us\\" and the eerie drunken \\"Korn Ring Finger\\". Some of the melodies will also sound familiar. \\"Big Black Baby Shoes\\" reappeared as \\"Ice Rose\\" on \\"Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)\\" in 1978. And \\"Dirty Blue Jean\\" is not a version of the song from 1980's \\"Doc At The Radar Station\\" but an early non-vocal version of \\"The Witch Doctor Life\\" from 1982's \\"Ice Cream For Crow\\". One wonders what else Van Vliet's vaults contain, and how far back some of his songs actually date.<br /><br />\\"Safe As Milk\\" (the title supposedly is a reference to the contamination of mother's milk with modern chemicals, according to a Beefheart interview) stands as the starting point for what was to become one of the most interesting and critically acclaimed acts in rock history. Beefheart continues to influence musicians. And, given that \\"Safe As Milk\\" was his starting point, it's not hard to see why.nt, it's not hard to see why.
B0006A9FKA|1.0|I'd heard such good things and I just thought this would be done in some sort of zany British way, but it was a lot more like another stupid attempt at comedy by Hollywood. The real plague is the Hollywood infection that's spreading across the world and turning all movies into dull, predictable garbage that just can't seem to get moving. <br /> <br />Shaun of the Dead is lacking in comedic performances. In a movie like this you'd expect the Indian guy in the store to be surprisingly hilarious or the mother or somebody, but nobody was really hilarious. There were a couple of good moments, Shaun going over a fence and it falls down, can't think of anything else, but I'd seen that in previews. Then there's a thick accent you have to deal with and worst of all the style I've seen in every other comedy film. Pathetic. I kept leaving the room to do chores around the house. To think this got rated 4 and a half stars by the time I reviewed it. Shows you how bad movies are. <br /> <br />
B0001CNRBG|5.0|A hilarious romantic comedy about two \\"squares\\" who somehow fall into lust during the 1950's in a secluded coastline get-away. Lust evolves into love and love evolves as their two lives seems inexorably out of phase; she's liberal, he's conservative and then they switch. Through all the turmoil created by current events over the 26 years of the movie's timeline, they remain enchanted with each other once a year as their love and deep respect for each other matures while their \\"real\\" lives keeps them intertwined. The characters grow together despite their limited contact. Every year's meeting is a matured relationship started anew. <br /> <br />Alan Alda's acting reflects the happy-go-lucky attitude most associate with his MASH character. Ellyn Burstyn is brilliant. Marvelous acting and a great story line. <br /> <br />This is an absolutely enjoyable movie that you can watch over and over again, enjoying it more with each viewing.
B000000WZ4|5.0|Seriously.  Just crank that puppy, and thrill to the way its glorious swooping bassline makes your subwoofer earn its living, and to the way it glides from DM's trademark minor key into major and back again, and to the way that it all just sounds so effortless.<br /><br />It clearly wasn't, of course.  These guys (now minus Alan Wilder) went through some well-publicized ugly times to get to the point that they were able to pull off _Ultra_ -- but they also managed to move beyond the stifling cynicism of _Songs of Faith and Devotion_ and come up with something catchy, cathartic, and occasionally quite moving.  I'd rank it right up there with _Violator_, _Black Celebration_, and (if I may plug a largely overlooked personal favorite) Mesh's _Who Watches Over Me?_ among the best albums ever released within its genre.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is a comedy Classic simply put.  You'll either love or hate the Monty Python humor, there is no in between.  I'm sure everyone is aware of the plot, and that it's them making fun of the medieval times and king Arthur in his search for the Holy Grail.  I got it as a Christmas gift, and it's absolutely perfect!  The thing with this movie, is that it brings all its fans together over a wide age audience.  My uncle is a Monty Python fanatic and it's grown on me even before I knew he was.  The quotes you find yourself saying make it more enjoyable the next time you watch it.   The swallows, the virgins, the wedding, the witch, the 3 headed giant, the knights who say NI!  It's all perfect, it's got this shine to it, that will never disappear.  I've seen this movie so many times and well for me personally; it's never lost its touch.  I've seen the Spamalot play and even bought my own personal pair of coconuts. (*chuckles*)   Anyways, rent this and see for yourself.  You may not get all the jokes at first, or understand it.  As the first time I saw this I was about 8-ish and other then the rabbit scene (which is what I consider to be the best part of the movie) I didn't get it.  But then again, I was eight at the time.  The second Disc with extras is great especially the Lego knights signing Knights of the Round Table.  If you want to see the credits for disc two, highlight the Holy Grail on one of the menus, it's an Easter egg.  Although I haven't watched it with commentary yet, this is one ultimate package for Python fans everywhere....unless perhaps, you are French.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Although all the acting by the gorgeous Portman, the fragile looking Julia,  the brutish Clive(WOW--our next superstar!) and the \\"can't take my eyes off him\\" Jude, was excellent, and the the directing by Mike Nichols, reminiscent of the wrenching power he consistently maintained throughout Carnal Knowledge, was fab, it was hard to watch this movie. I had not read all that much about it. However, I had been transported by the Damien Rice theme song.  Therefore, I was expecting a cute little romantic film, starring some hot looking stars.  Do not make the mistake I made, friends. I was unprepared by the intense animalistic rawness of the plot and the cruelty and harshness of the subject matter, which involved the things people will do to each other in the NAME of LOVE. Hey, yes, it happens. People do behave this way, at times. Trust is at a premium, for me at my age though, and this was rough to watch. Do NOT under any circumstances tackle this movie with a \\"first date\\" as you eat pizza in front of the tv. It is definitely not that sort of flick. You will both sit motionless and forget to chew your crust, I predict. Just don't go there.<br /><br />Talk about intense. Intense acting, suberbly brought out by Nichols, who is the ringmaster of the complicated circus of a plot. Super beautiful cinematography, so you can feel tasered and attempt to process what the heck is going on, in very pretty Londony environs.<br /><br />Recommendation: Give yourself a couple of days to think about this movie after you have seen it. I believe it was a worthwhile experience to undergo, and I am still mulling it over. Nope, it isn't Die Hard, and it isn't Daddy Day Care...but it IS something you might want to consider seeing anyway. Not for entertainment purposes, exactly, but for high quality acting, directing, screenplay, and flash.<br /><br />Not surprised it was originally a play. It watches like one.<br /><br />best, jean
B00079FUI6|5.0|I am addicted to this 'primetime stepford wives' soap staring Teri Hatcher (Lois and Clark) and Marcia Cross (Melrose Place) as...(yes, you guessed it) desperate housewives who act up and out in frustration about the things which happen in their lives on Wisteria Lane.<br /><br />The first episode immediately sets the somber-but-sinful tone for this entire series. A reccently deceased Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) takes viewers into the hidden lives of American housewives on a supposedly tranquil suburban street. A neat series factoid is that this particular street was the same location used for the Tom Hanks film \\" The Burbs\\" and this first  \\"Desperate Housweives\\" episode had the highest network airing of any show for the 2004-2005 season.<br /><br />In \\"Impossible\\" Bree Van De Kamp (Cross) is shocked to discover that her daughter (Joy Lauren) is sexually active. Because Bree is the prototypical conservative Christian Republican, the revelation obviously jolts her. In this same episode, a teen pool party gets wild (of course) and Justin (Ryan Carnes) came out as being gay, we also learn that Bree's son Andrew (Shawn Pyfrom) himself is gay.<br /><br />Bree does not learn that her son is gay until \\"Children will listen\\". When she and husband Rex (Steven Culp) visit their son at a teen drug/alcohol rehabilitation camp, Bree recieves this information second-hand from Rex, who (to his credit) does a comparatively better job of handling the information. He is not as shallow and materialistic as his wife.<br /><br />Andrew's sexuality is a reccuring story arc throughout this season. Later in \\"One wonderful day\\" he is home from the treatment camp, and gets in a fight with the gay gardner Justin. In the next season it will continue to be a reccuring theme and delve into even deeper plotlines.<br /><br />24 episodes in this release make it an excellent purchase for the 'desperate housewife' in your world---certainly including yourself./>
1400032717|5.0|I can't tell you how much I loved this book.  I finished it in just two days, and within a week had recommended it to at least five people.  I keep hearing back how much they liked the book too! <br />As a teacher, I relish the insight this book gave.  I've had many autistic students, and now I feel so much more of a connection to them.  It's as if I've been allowed to see into the brain of an autistic boy, which makes it so much easier to identify and to understand the autistic students that I meet.
B000002UA5|2.0|Now I want to start off by saying that Pink FLoyd is easily one of my favorite bands, if not my favorite band.  That is why when I bought Ummagumma, I was rather disappointed. I don't know, maybe I'm just not intellectually capable of understanding this stuff, but it doesn't seem like this is music worth listening to. I'm not even sure if some of it counts as music. After Syd Barret lost his mind and left the band, they were basically faced with the big question: \\"what do we do now?\\" To record this album, each band member wrote his own part and then recorded it. I did like David Gilmour's part, \\"the Narrow Way,\\" but i thought the rest of the album was a little too far out to enjoy listening to.  In fact, even the band didn't like this album. As for the live album, I liked it alright. I wasnt too impressed by the fact that there was only four songs on it. I though they were pretty good but the sound quality could have been better and the screeching on \\"Careful with that axe, eugene,\\" I thought was unnecessary and rather painful to listen to. Overall, this album could have been a lot better and i believe it was an honest mistake in Pink Floyd's growth to greatness. I would recommend for someone who actually wants to listen to music, Atom Heart Mother, Animals, Obscured By Clouds, and Meddle, as well was the obvious choices, Dark Side of the Moon and the Wall.
0671027387|3.0|This really is just an average book, just like the other Dan Brown novels.  Dan Brown seems to be very good at building up a story but very bad at creating knockout endings.  Both Da Vinci Code and Deception Point suffer from dissapointing endings, which leave the reader with a sour taste after such a promising start.<br /><br />This is mildly entertaining and at times gripping, easy reading but not really thought provoking.<br /><br />Buy this if you have a long haul flight, or are embarking on a long journey.
B0007TKH66|2.0|As with Voyager before, Enterprise repeated the same errors. At its core, the show had promise. With very little of early Federation days nailed down, it seemed like a good idea to go back and tell the story. But instead of sticking with some of the canon that did exist, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman rebooted the entire Star Trek franchise, which angered about 10 million viewers. Season one continued the ever increasing schism between the fans. And while I liked Bakula on Quantum Leap, he -like Kate Mulgrew before him - was woefully miscast. The supporting cast, with the exception of Jolene Blalock, showed their limitations as actors (when they got lines). The stories were mostly retreds of previous Trek episodes and while both Berman and Braga were aware of the issues of continuity, they felt that if the adhered to it too much, then the show could not work. They continued to believe that Trek viewers -at least the newer, younger ones (and, admittedly, the group advertisers like) - were only concerned about the how weird the story was and if it had half naked females parading around. This misstep by them, by fulling ignoring the fans who had watched TOS, TNG and DS9, was increasing ENT's end week by week. Paramount can be blamed also, for not stepping in sooner. Berman and Braga's now almost incestuous relationship with Trek caused then not to see the forest for the tree's. Had they realized that fan base was deeply divided, and had they analyzed who was not watching Trek anymore instead of small band who were, maybe something could've been done. Then again, maybe its doom was already sealed by the time Insurrection came out in 1998. And then there is the fan base. They too can be blamed for this, as this schism did not begin with ENT. It really started with VOY. As a network show, VOY had different standards to live up too than it's syndicated brothers, TNG and DS9. Racier plots and emphasis on action and violence became the criterion, while a device called the Temporal Reset Button was used week after week. And while TRB is a useful tool, but to rely on it for every episode got you caught in a never ending loop of Easter Peep type stories; all full of air with no substance. Plus, people who were in there teens or early 20's when TNG premiered were not 15 years older, wiser and now considered less desirable by the advertisers. ENT was, I guess, designed for the guys and girls who were the same age as the ones who saw the first season of TNG. But these new groups of kids, now brought up on a diet of science fiction being everywhere, felt Trek was a dinosaur. So all that remained, in the end, was a few really dedicated fans who felt that, yes the show was not as good as it could be, but it still needed to stay on because it was Star Trek. I will concur to a point, but that's mostly because I hate reality shows and procedural dramas that have overtaken the air waves. Give me a good science fiction story that challenges the mind, then I'll watch. I once read that science fiction is a dangerous genre, for it can be seem as anti-Christian and anti-establishment. It brings up thought provoking ideas and presents a possible world were there is no hatred, no poverty, and no religion. It's the possibilities that scare people. But even as Star Trek has framed a lot of peoples lives, such as wonderful idea of a utopian world and taught us some good values, it has entertained us for nearly 40 years. Both VOY and ENT might be considered entertaining shows, but they are NOT the next step in Star Trek's evolutionary life that TNG and DS9 were.
B0000524EM|5.0|The first film is fantastic,and so are the others.I feel that their based on about a persons feelings of pain in life and it's effects on their emotions of their everyday lives that maybe a constant strugle even for victims of past abuse or trauma's.I mean that literly that when a person young or mid age watches these movies,I personly feel that they can strongly relate to such things within these movies.Weather their good or bad.Because honestly about these movies they somewhat have a true meaning and purpose in life as we know it,for the simple fact that some of the tragies in these movies could very well happen to us if you think honestly think about it.Even if it's just a movie.And,  <br />last,but not least the remarkable thing i like about this series <br />so much is when a important person dies,that they can be given <br />a 2nd chance at life by resurrection of the crow to do a rightful <br />deed of justice in return to go to heaven for destroying evil that was done to a innocent person or themselves.I BELIEVE IT'S A ACT OF FAITH...
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This is a great album, all the songs are excellent, I believe this album is as good as Let Go, even better. My Favorite songs are Don't Tell Me, He Wasn't, My Happy Ending. I love Avril, she's beautiful and her songs are great, I love her, she's amazing.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is a must have for you cd collectors out there. Its hard to compare words to the album. Just buy it and you'll see!! There is dance music, kickback music, love songs and breakup songs. <br /> <br />For the singers out there, this is a great vocal warm-up cd.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Perhaps one of best TV shows of the 2004-05 (along with Lost) season, Desperate Housewives is a wonderful mix of humor and drama and with an added dose of high camp. The series hooked from the start, with it's mysterious death of one character and half naked Jesse Metcalf. All the actress' shine and male actors -like Jesse and James Denton, are brilliant. Marc Cherry, who help produce the Golden Girls, knows what women and gay men like, plus give enough sultry vixens to keep the straight men coming back. There have been some complaints about how we are being teased about what happen on Wisteria lane, but like any good soap opera, you don't spill the beans too soon. Still the show proves that despite the influx of boring reality programs and equally dull procedural shows like CSI and Law & Order (oh, will the hero's get their bad guys? Of course. Too predictable, too boring) a show that is about people and is character driven can succeed. I for one hope Cherry does not reveal all of the secrets of Wistera Lane in this 24 episode first season set.
0380789035|3.0|This is a pretty good post-modern gothic potboiler. The premise is that the ancient gods of diverse mythologies have survived and are roaming the earth in a tawdry underground seeking to re-emerge. This was a competent execution of low-key supernatural subject matter, and provided an agreeable mix of entertainment and thoughtfulness.
B0000669JL|5.0|There is a reason why Bob Marley was ranked the 11th Greatest Artist Of All Time by Rolling Stone Magazine, and it's because of his icredible song writing ability. Bob Marley could write a song about living in a torn shack in Jamacia and when you heard it, you were in that torn shack while rain water seeps through the cracks in the roof and you are left standing there praying for a better life...even if you live in a mansion. That is the power and rawness of Bob's music and why he is revered and respected as the greatest reggae artist to ever live: <br />1.Is This Love-10/10 <br />2.No Woman, No Cry[Live]-10/10 <br />3.Could You Be Loved-8/10 <br />4.Three Little Birds-9/10 <br />5.Buffalo Soldier-10/10(Honestly,How Could I Give It Less?) <br />6.Get Up, Stand Up-10/10 <br />7.Stir It Up-10/10(I Love The Chorus) <br />8.Easy Skanking-10/10 <br />9.One Love/People Get Ready-11/10(My Favorite Reggae Song Of All Time, Best Song Marley Ever Recorded) <br />10.I Shot The Sheriff-10/10 <br />11.Waiting In Vain-10/10 <br />12.Redemption Song-10/10(The Most Underrated Marley Song, Classic) <br />13.Satisfy My Soul-10/10 <br />14.Exodus-10/10 <br />15.Jamming-10/10(The Second Best Song) <br />16.Punky Reggae Party-10/10

B00000AFGM|5.0|Obviously, people who reject this album, because they think Manson is a sicko, did NOT listen to this album without bias.  I played this album in the car once, and a friend of mine, who listens to a lot of 70s rock (which is cool) said, \\"Who is this, this is really good!\\"  I replied, \\"Um, Marilyn Manson hehe.\\"  His jaw dropped.  I was playing GREAT BIG WHITE WORLD.  So to the reviewer that believes REAL rock is Zep and Hendrix, take that.  They were awesome, and the fathers of modern rock, but don't you think the world would be pretty boring if all rock was obligated to sound derivative of the 70s?  That's what makes music go great, the way musicians interpret the 12 notes of its alphabet. <br /> <br />Mind you, this may not be the album that a Manson beginner should pick up.  It's very different in comparison to his other albums, but I do think this may be where the band was at the top of its game.  The influences here are obvious, but just because the music's not overtly original, doesn't mean its not good! <br /> <br />Great Big White World- To me, an amazing opener to an album.  The electronic atmosphere and the chorus gives me chills, and Twiggy's & Zim Zum's (recorded but soon left) guitar work in recording this album is phenomenal. (John 5 was just the touring guitarist on this album).  A song about alienation from society and no love being in the world.  I can relate. <br /> <br />Dope Show-Haha, I remember the video when I was 13.  This song is very \\"Hollywood\\".  People love you when you're up, people drag you down farther when you're already down as far as you can go.  Interesting electronics in this song. <br /> <br />Mechanical Animals- Mmmm, some people don't like this song for some reason.  I'm not sure what it's about: maybe the boy that committed suicide listening to Anti-Spstar.  The programmed beat are very nice hear.  The acoustic guitar is nice as well, a drastic change in atmosphere to the song.   <br /> <br />Rock Is Dead-  I used to not care for this song much, but I appreciate it more now.  Mainly about, the indulgents in being a rock star taking over. <br /> <br />Disassociative- Gotta get away from the world before it takes me down.  Great song, very Bowie-esque. <br /> <br />Speed Of Pain- Mainly acoustic, Pink Floydish.  There's not much I can say about this song, I don't quite understand it yet. <br /> <br />Posthuman-  This is where the industrial/rock is most apparent.  A song that seems to indulge in a woman, comparing her to ranadom drugs and Jackie O! Definitely part of the concept involving Rose McGowan.  Check out the rapid fire beats in this one, very electronic. <br /> <br />I Wanna Disappear- Manson saying that he used to be a \\"nihilist\\" and \\"brutal\\" but now he's just making a mockery of himself.  Arena rockish riffing in the chorus.   <br /> <br />Don't Like The Drugs.....-Wow.  This is one of the most \\"old R&B-esque\\" songs I ever heard from a rock group.  Dave Navarro helped out with lead guitar on this track.  Greeeeat song about who society is sucked in by the media and television.  Drugs are thought of metaphorically in this one: as sex, tv, literal drugs, religion.  This song is very much in line with \\"Rock Is Dead\\" with the idea that America's god is in these so-called \\"drugs\\".  \\"God is in the teee-veeeeee\\". <br /> <br />New Model No.15-  Mockery in that Manson got 15 minutes of fame.  Very Gary Numan like, very good song. <br /> <br />User Friendly- About a female entity that only wants Manson for sex.  Musically, this song doesn't offer a whole lot.  The vocals are the stronger point here. <br /> <br />Fundamentally Loathsome-Whaa??? This song is probably the weirdest Manson song ever, weird only for Manson that is....you just have to listen. <br /> <br />Last Day On Earth- As the world end, Manson will continue to find love with who he's with.  Musically, on the same level as User Friendly. <br /> <br />Coma White-  Wow.  Great guitar work, just emotional.  This proves that music doesn't not have to be technically elaborate to be beautiful.  Manson's best vocal performance ever, hands down.  It's so true, nothing will make you happy in the world, you have to find it within yourself.  As the synths and feedback drift off into the atmosphere, the album ends on a mysterious note.   <br /> <br />In my opinion, this is arguably one of the most creative albums on the late 90s.  Of course it does sound a little derivative, but the effort alone deserves much respect.  Great piece of art, a lot went into it.  5 stars indeed.
1591840562|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone starting a business. The insights that Guy shares in his book is very much like a crash course in Street-SMART MBA program. <br /> <br />I had a lot of great ideas that were stimulated when i read this highly enjoyable book! This is one of Guy's greatest hits! (I also bought the 'Rules for Revolutionaries'! among other titles) <br /> <br />A great companion site would be the online discussion/forum on Art of the Start.

0131103628|5.0|A MUST for beginners in programming. For those coming from C++ background and want to learn low level concepts in C, I recommend quick visit to Chapter 7-8 and Appendix. This is not a book for data structures or algorithms. So you will not find much on those topics though you will see simple concepts here and there. For people exposed to programming this is a simple one day reading material to revisit basic C.<br /><br />Chapter 1 (Tutorial Introduction) - Get started approach for beginners!<br /><br />Chapter 2 (Types, Operators and Expressions) - Bitwise operators in 2.9 are good to visit.<br /><br />Chapter 3 (Control Flow) - Very simple chapter.<br /><br />Chapter 4 (Functions and Program Structure) - Good information here. C preprocessor details in 4.11 are good.<br /><br />Chapter 5 (Pointers and Arrays) - Especially good for pointers and address arithmetic.<br /><br />Chapter 6 (Structures) - Good exposure to basic C structures. Limitations of C compared to object oriented approach from C++ become obvious in this chapter.<br /><br />Chapter 7 and 8 (I/O and UNIX Sytem Interface) - Those who do not have an OS background should read this chapter. You could see how concepts like system calls are abstracted and exposed through standard C functions. Simple and elegant starting point for any low level programming.<br /><br />Appendix A and B - Good details on C standards. Also lot of standard C library functions are explained in good detail here. Very good comprehensive reference point.
B0008ISM40|4.0|I have to admit, I'm pretty late to joining the NIN club to enjoy the music. Over the last 6 months I've bought every CD, and to most fans, the first one is still the best.    The latest offering from NIN is a departure from what I've heard thru the other CDs. There are the plethora of dark songs, but also one of, if not THE, softest song Trent has written -- \\"Right Where it Belongs\\". And if I can be so bold, I think it's the best song on the album -- and this is coming from a guy who usually prefers the harder stuff.    Lyrics are, as they have always been, a focal point of every song that Trent has crafted over the years. Admittedly I can't say I like every song on the album -- some are just not quality songs, even lyrically. But the majority of the songs are definately enjoyable, and some grow on you after a few repeats as they did with me.     It's no Pretty Hate Machine -- but it's a damn good CD in my mind. You won't be headbanging to the most of it -- it's quite poppy in that respect -- but you will appreciate the lyrics and in some cases, as was with me, even see your own circumstances in some of those words.     So buy it. Worse thing that can happen is that you won't like it. But at least your money isn't going to Britney Spears to help her drug addiction. I suppose that's a poor arguement for buying it but well.... I'm not a real motivator :)
B0006213WG|5.0|Sum 41 were pretty big back in 2000 with the likes of FatLip, Motivation and In Too Deep but over the years they seemed to be \\"Slipping Away\\". LOL get it?.....it's one of their songs....!  Anyway I've not heard from them in a while. I only knew 1 song from \\"Does This Look Infected\\" (DTLI) and that was Still Waiting! I dont remember how I heard it though. But that was the last song I had heard from them. I thought they split up cause I never heard from them up until early this year. I was making a cd for a friend whn he asked for Pieces and No Reason on it from the sums new album Chuck. I listened to them (To make sure they were working!) and I must admit Pieces is VERY catchy. Now me, I love songs with ballods in them for example: Coldplay and hoobastank but I never thought I'd see the day that Sum 41 would use them. And I'm no saying that in a bad way, heck I think they are pretty good at doing ballods and with the excellent guitar solos in it they were just great. And NO Way does it rip of Coldplays Scientist! \\"No Reason\\" however I'll admit that it does sounds like Linkin Parks \\"One Step Closer!\\"   So then I put some research into Sum41 thinking it would say 2002 they split up or sumthing. But no, instead I read that they have released Chuck, there newest album, in 2004. I was shocked. I listened to most of their new songs thanks to amazons previews and the ones that really caught my short attention were Pieces, No Reason, Were All to Blame and 88. I made myself a new cd with Sum41s songs from all their albums.(I found No Brains, Over My Head and the Hell Song, from DTLI really addicting too!) It's quite a sad thing to see that an energetic, well talented band like Sum41 get so heavily under rated cause a couple of their songs sound like other bands songs!! But now I'm out looking for their Chuck album and I can't seem find it anywhere. Quite disapointing but wot r u gonnae do? I'll need to get it delivered to me or sumthing because you cant, repeat CANT have a complete cd collection without some of The Sums greatest albums. Especially Chuck!!! ;)

0553208845|5.0|I read it during school days and loved it. Was quite refreshing, elegant, subtle yet quite deep. Felt a need to revisit it again after few years and loved it still. My friend has gifted this to so many of his well wishers after hearing about it from me and reading it himself. Good to have ! Also makes a good gift for anyone who is philosphical, intellectual or open minded.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|I bought the DVD and I loved it- Just as harrowing and chilling as I remembered it - as well it should bee saw this when I was a sophomore in high school and we even had a discussion on it in our science class the next day after it aired. What was really could have happened. While the film was less then real  (less severe) what was there was pretty accurately.    At the same time I was real disappointed because there was no bonus features or discussions- especially since this was such a large talked about show. This show was originally 3 hours long but was edited down to 2 hours before being aired on TV. I keep wondering what the 1 hour of deleted scenes were.    I heard that one of the scenes was showing the actual baby that was just delivered towards the end of the movie.(note that the woman was NOT smiling when she saw her newborn)...this scene was the baby being deformed (or sick?) from the fallout and radiation. I heard this second hand and I don't know how reliable the source was but I am curious if this is true? I've searched the internet with no luck. Does anyone have any idea? Could that have even been possible?    BUY IT- and think of all the nuclear bombs we have now.

B000002H70|5.0|This album is phenomenal. The production on this album is flawless. All the bands hardwork really comes together on \\"Disintegration.\\" There is no bad song on this album. The thing that people overlook most when discussing the Cure is what truly fantastic musicians they are. On this album, the music overwhelms you. It sucks you in and takes over you. many songs are 6 minutes long or more, but the atmosphere created by the keyboards, guitars, violins, pianos, drums, etc etc hold your attention and the songs never tire. My favorite song on here is probably \\"Prayers For Rain.\\" Its beautiful, but so are all the songs on this album. For anyone new to The Cure, please purchase this album first. It showcases the bands real talent and Robert Smith's vocals have never been better. A five star classic in my book.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah got like 7 someodd Emmys for this album, and she and the producers earned it. nothing like it. OK, she reminds me of a white Nina Simone. sultry, soft, sexy, and - well - mellow. love it.<br /><br />i play this CD at work and everyone loves it. in fact if there is a day that all the customers are being poopy - we put the CD on to calm every one down, and yes, it works!!<br /><br />good for fussy husbands too (sorry, hunk man, the love of my life!)
B0007TKH66|3.0|NEW REVIEW FOR BLU-RAY:<br /><br />\\"Enterprise\\" got caught in the web of studio politics immediately. Originally the first season as envisioned by co-crators Brannon Braga and Rick Berman was to take place almost entirely on Earth with the ship being build and the drama that surrounded that (including protesters, etc.)with the conclusion being the launching of Enterprise.<br /><br />Paramount hated the idea and also didn't like the idea of a prequel that would connect more with who we are now than the 24th century (and, in fact, Paramount wanted the next show to take place BEYOND \\"ST:TNG\\"). The studio compromised with the co-creators only on the grounds that \\"Enterprise\\" DIDN'T take place entirely on Earth during the first season and focused on the crew's first adventures in space. The temporal cold war story arc was introduced as a compromise since Paramount wanted SOMETHING from the far future introduced into the show.<br /><br />If you add in the viewer fatigue (the co-creators wanted to take a couple of years between the end of \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\" and \\"Enterprise\\" but were forced to launch the show immediately)after having three \\"Star Trek\\" series in a row, it's no wonder that \\"Enterprise\\", which initially was a ratings winner, lost most of its audience by the end of the first season.<br /><br />In spite of all that \\"Enterprise\\" was a decent show during its first season that kept striving for better and finally reached that goal having lost most of its audience by the third season. For every outstanding episode there were two that ranged from fair to mediocre and could have been on ANY \\"Trek\\" series (and still been mediocre).<br /><br />\\"Enterprise\\" was shot on film for its first two seasons and HD vide for its third and fourth. The masters were prepared in HD for broadcast. The detail during the live action scenes is pretty good and blacks are fairly good in scenes where there are no visual effects. Unfortunately, the visual effects were shot at 480p or 720p depending on how involved the shot was and these have been upscaled. They STILL look better than the DVD's in that regard with better fine detail BUT the visual effects sequences are softer (particularly those integrated with live action)and the shift between higher def and upscaled is noticeable at times.<br /><br />The pilot episode looks the worst--it wasn't shot with widescreen in mind (Paramount couldn't make up its mind about what aspect ratio the show would be broadcast in)and has been blown up for widescreen resulting in a soft, grainy look that is filled with artifacts. The good news is that the show improves with each successive episode on the set.<br /><br />What makes this set especially worthwhile (aside from the improved image qualty -even if it isn't demo quality-compared to the DVD's)are the special features; all of the original special features have been ported over plus we get four new commentary tracks.<br /><br />We also get a three part documentary on the creation of the show where Braga, Berman and the cast are brutally honest in their assessment of \\"Enterpirse\\" (Braga being the most honest--he calls many of the episodes crap and takes responsibility as he was the head writer but pointed out that he and those who came over from \\"Voyager\\" were exhausted and needed a break which Paramount wouldn't give them at that point).<br /><br />We also get a good featurette with Braga and Berman discussing the creation of the show as well as discussing the accusations that THEY killed the franchise with \\"Enterprise\\".<br /><br />While \\"Enterprise\\" was flawed during its first season (every \\"Trek\\" series has been except \\"Star Trek\\" where the first and second seasons were the best)and those flaws still dogged the show during a much improved second season, the show didn't get the shot it deserved. The third and fourth seasons proved how good \\"Enterprise\\" could be (exceptional)unfortunately most of the audience except die hards had tuned out by that point and UPNcancelled the series (even though the fifth season had amibitions similar to \\"Fringe\\" with a number of episodes taking place in the alternate universe we glimpsed during the fourth season very briefly).<br /><br />The A/V isn't perfect but it looks better than the DVD's. Hopefully as we continue to see new seasons released we'll see an improvement in the over all look of the show as well.<br /><br />Recommendedcancelled the series (even though the fifth season had amibitions similar to \\"Fringe\\" with a number of episodes taking place in the alternate universe we glimpsed during the fourth season very briefly).<br /><br />The A/V isn't perfect but it looks better than the DVD's.

I do have to agree that fans have to get a life about this and other aspects that are a bit inconsistent with the Trek saga. Otherwise, you're working within a straight jacket; you'll drive yourself insane with the contradictions and restrictions of the series).  There's also a text commentary by Michael and Denise Okuda on two episodes which can be, at turns fascinating and completely trivial. Be aware that the Okuda commentaries occasionally give away plot points for later in the series run (for example the death of a character that I wasn't aware of having missed that episode during the original run). Actually, it's kind of fun to go from one extreme to the other. Some of the info is witty, some worthless just like a verbal commentary track.     \\"Enterprise\\" demonstrates that Paramount is finally headed in the right direction when it comes to DVD. There's a commentary track, text commentary track (unfortunately on the same episode but it's also the most interesting), outtakes, a gag reel and deleted scenes. I'm sure someone will always complain about the packaging. I LIKE the packaging and feel it's the best designed of all the Trek series (including the bulkier \\"Next Generation\\" set and Classic Trek. There's also a booklet which actually has a synopsis of each episode. I'm hoping that seasons 2, 3 and 4 increase these extras continuing on this positive trend. Kudos to Paramount for doing such a nice job of an underrated series in the Trek saga. I'm a huge \\"Deep Space Nine\\" and \\"Next Generation\\" fan but still feel that the spirit of this series is much more in keeping with the original series.
B0000027I6|5.0|Roger Waters had some VERY high points in his career.  Because of some of them, Pink Floyd went on to to become a legendary band (not just for their landmark album Dark Side Of The Moon), but for their followups like Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall.  Those albums were made as great as they were because of the creativity of Roger Waters.  Pink Floyd's entire direction particularly after Wish You Were Here was because of Roger's lyrics, music, and craftmanship.  The rest of the band perfected it into what we know as Pink Floyd but if you want to know how they were hurting WITHOUT him, listen to the last two PF albums.  They don't even come close to this solo album.  This should have been a Pink Floyd album, perhaps the followup to The Wall.  It would have sold big time and became a classic in it's own right.  However, like the Stones Pink Floyd solo members have never gotten much attention or appreciation from their solo work.  Some fine albums over the years by David Gilmour and Roger Waters were for the most part ignored.  But the one that baffles me is Amused To Death.  The CD is beautiful, not as self absorbed as The Wall or Final Cut, but still has all the trademark sounds, affects, TV playing in the background, Roger's edgy lyrics with a powerful political message and plenty of sarcasm.  I didnt appreciate this CD as much when it first came out as I do now.  Turns out Roger Waters had one more masterpiece in him after The Wall and Amused To Death.  Any Pink Floyd fan should do themselves a favor and give this a chance.  Crank it up and sit back and you will know what I mean.  Yes, David Gilmours trademark guitar is missing here and the vocals are all Roger and the other background singers.  But in this case, it really doesnt take away much from the release.  It stands on it's own, and it's just a shame it will never get the true credit it deserves.  But for me, when I want to enjoy some classic Pink Floyd, I will turn to such CDs as Meddle, Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, and YES \\"Amused To Death\\".  For me, it's in the same league along with some of the best rock and roll ever made (by Pink Floyd).
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Very short : <br /> <br />music for my weddings & funerals : I like the contrasts
B00005B36H|4.0|Ok, i am too old for this kind of music - BUT - i love the song \\"Schism\\" i bought the CD just for that one song. Play it LOUD, and just dig it.  the rest of the album... too heavy metal for an old gal like me. my teen age son turned me on to Tool. my dear hubby, Norman, laughs when i stop everything and get jiggy with that song! but, hey, if you love it - you know what i mean! just have to rock out. not for sleepyheads or whimps.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Boring CD, lyics, etc... Greenday used to rock, now they pop.  I LOVED Dookie.  I don't have any respect for greenday now due to their lack of talent and WRETCHED political views.  I think they are really going to be embarassed of this CD ten years from now.  How disappointing.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I agree with some of the reviews below-- esp the one right below me- but its better than 1 star- Id say two- Images and Scenes are 5 stars- awake 4- change 3-- THIS ALBUM just doesent work
B00006LLNU|4.0|Do you like to listen to music while you read? Than buy this album right away! The music and occasional soft moaning voices produce a nearly orgasmic feeling from this Icelandic group that makes your reading experience just that much more enjoyable. Besides being one of the best background albums ever, it's also one of the best and most minimalistic albums. The songs have no names and the album is called nothing more than (). The instruments are methodic and hypnotic, but there isn't too much beat variation during songs and the singing is nothing more than a chanting moan that I believe means nothing. They manage to make everything go so well together that the sound goes into a fantastic climax and then quickly dies back to the basic beats. If I could, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|This may not be the definitive Phantom, but it's the only one we've got, so let's appreciate it. The designs are truly glorious and the huge orchestration is a treat. Unfortunately for those of us who've grown old with Michael Crawford's astonishing vocals, Gerald Butler doesn't quite measure up. But he looks good in a mask and cape and will probably make a fine James Bond when he gets around to it. However, on the plus side, Ms. Rossum is younger, sweeter and a lot less icy than La Brightman. And Patrick Wilson is always a gift to any musical - one of the sweetest lyric tenors in the business. So don't bewail the fact that this isn't a filmed version of Hal Prince's fine production - that kind of thing never really works anyway. This a new vision and an opulent, grand and beautiful one that manages to maintain the over the top romanticism that makes Phantom such an icon of the musical in our time. (As director Shumacher is quoted as saying \\"Nobody ever paid for under the top.\\")And the extras are fun too! It's always fun to get to see and hear Cameron Macintosh opine on the biz. Go ahead - buy it - enjoy yourself!
B00007E8V4|2.0|As a long time System of a Down fan, I'd have to say this album would be considered mediocre.  The songs are, let me put this in a way for understanding.. Retarted.  The lyrics for -most- not all songs are just plain stupid and make no sense.  Lyrics from Chick 'N' Stu ... \\"This ballgames in the refrigerator. The door closed.  The lights are out.  And the butters getting hard\\" What the hell is that about?  Can someone explain?  The is obviously the WORST System of a Down album ever made so far. If your sick of this crap nu-metal has turned into, check out System of a Down's first self-titled album.  It's their outward most best album.  Instead of listening to crap. Theirs only select few songs that are good on \\"Steal this album!\\". <br />
B00004XOWM|1.0|If you purchase this album your probably a fag that listens to um let me say this nice \\"LOSER GHETTO BLACK Music\\" and all of that pop crap like simple plan good charlotte atreyu and Korn. I hope all that like that music die a terrible death and rot in hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a different sort of Romantic comedy that tends to take one by surprise.  Featuring the talent of Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightly, it is also more star-studded than most RC movies I have seen.<br /><br />The film is like a collage of stories of several couples.  The way the plot progresses reminded me a little bit of the drama PLAYING BY HEART.  We are able to view myriad short-stories that are all interwined (in one way other) to form a cohesive whole.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of flicks in the RC genre, this one is not afraid to engage in political satire.  Set in Britain, the writers taken some not-so-subtle \\"shots\\" at both the Clinton and Bush(jr) administrations.  Fans of either Clinton or Bush are likely to be miffed, while detractors of both are sure to be gleeful.<br /><br />If you want to different kind of heartwarming drama / comedy, you might actually find some love here.  It's worth taking the chance, anyway!
B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein is such a great group! If u haven't heard any of their songs, then u've got 2! The song Amerika, is mi favorite. Its SO hardcore! I recomend this CD! ROCK ON!
B000929AJQ|5.0|Trent Reznor has been able to present albums that truly differ from one another during his career, and \\"With Teeth\\" is no exception. I've seen some here state that this album isn't as good as previous releases because it differs from them in such and such a way - personally I'd grow bored with an artist if things start sounding too similar. \\"With Teeth\\" is a breath of fresh or for Nine Inch Nails - listening to it, I get the impression that a lot of the pretentiousness of \\"The Fragile\\" has disappeared (even though I think \\"The Fragile\\" is a great record). Reznor's song-writing is in top form and much more straightforward on this record. Some of the standout songs on this album include \\"All the Love in the World\\", \\"Everyday is Exactly the Same\\", \\"Only\\" (which is actually quite humorous in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way, with lyrics like \\"I just made you up to hurt myself\\") and \\"Right Where it Belongs\\". Trent's singing is also in top form here.  <br /> <br />All in all, in very pleasantly surprised about this album and very pleased, it's a mix of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" meets \\"The Downward Spiral\\". Something to remember about Nine Inch Nails is that Trent Reznor really makes music for himself. His music is a part of himself; he makes what he feels needs to be made, for himself. If what he's making strikes a chord with you, all the better. Hopefully it won't take as long for the next release to come out!
0446677450|1.0|Kiyosaki very effectively communicates a sociopath personality with a singular focus on wealth as sole determinant of a person's success. His only useful advice is that to be wealthy, one should buy money producing \\"assets\\" and not buy money draining \\"liabilities\\". I agree that this is a good mindset to have but now that you know it just from reading this review, you don't need to spend hours suffering through the book. As for examples of \\"assets\\", he touts real estate and basically says that you \\"only\\" need to go and buy houses that some idiot is selling well below market price, and then sell them. To tell you the truth, I did go looking for houses selling well below market price, but didn't manage to find any. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki writes of a fairy tale land that exists only in seminars. His books are completely fictional. I've decided that next time I will just invest in one of Bobby's companies, where he is in charge of finding these mythical properties, and I am more than happy to pay him a commission of 50% of profits for doing so. Unfortunately I haven't seen one mentioned. <br /> <br />Robert Kiyosaki does not own any real estate companies. In fact searches of titles show he hardly even owns any real estate. He has no substantial holding in any listed company at all. Prior to the Rich Dad books becoming such successes he was pretty much penniless. <br /> <br />He is a total fraud who never made any money at all with investments, his sole source of income is his \\"Rich Dad\\" franchise, book royalties and seminars. He started out his career by lying about his wealth, now the true believers are willing to throw so much money at him to hear him speak that he now has real wealth, but he knows little in the way of wealth creation itself. <br /> <br />The great Robert Kiyosaki has mastered the technique of selling pipe dreams and persuading people to spend more money on his other products and seminars down to a fine art form. You'll note that while he never shares anything really useful, he does dangle you the promise that finally one day he'll release the \\"secret\\" of how you will one day make money without hard work and without having money in the first place. But alas, the \\"secret\\" turns out to be to con people into believing you have the \\"secret\\" and persuading them to pay you money to learn this \\"secret\\" that you actually never had to begin with. <br /> <br />If you wanted to read a book about Robert Kiyosaki's actual wealth creation methods it would be entitled Creating Wealth Through Writing Wealth Creation Books and putting on expensive seminars with a real estate flavor.\\"
0765348780|3.0|There are some real positive things to be found in this book.  The writing is good, the world Erickson creates is elaborate and interesting.  He also weaves a complex tale, which I happen to prefer.  Where he misses the mark, in my opinion, is in character development.  By bringing so many different characters into play it is critical to flesh out the participants in enough detail so the reader can identify with each character (or at least the critical ones).  It acts as a thread to help tie all the players into the plot.  Erickson fails to do this in many instances so one character does not really stand out from most others.  The book also refers to many different races, but then provides very little information of how one race differs from another.  There is no reason to present all this extra information if it isn't used for some purpose in the story, or to help explain the motivation of the characters.  The seeds are there for a great epic fantasy series, but Erickson is not there yet.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|In 2003 Ryan Adams gave us two competent releases \\"Rock and Roll\\" and the 2 part \\"Love is Hell\\", but they weren't what fans were waiting for.  Personally I liked \\" Rock and Roll\\" and I loved \\" Love is Hell\\" but I knew he was capable of capturing the feeling \\"Heartbreaker\\" gave me and on \\"Cold Roses\\" he has. <br /> <br />It is a sure bet that \\"Cold Roses\\" is the record we have all been waiting for. It is a full fledged return to his roots, the sound that made his name when he was in \\"Whiskeytown\\".  Not that \\"Cold Roses\\" is a retread of his older songs or copies of past glories.  It is a straight forward collection of country rock songs that play right into Adams' strength as a singer / songwriter.   <br /> <br />This mock gatefold double CD brings to mind vintage Neil Young.  \\"Cold Roses\\" also does something that his releases haven't come close to since \\"Whiskeytown\\", it sounds like a CD by a band, this enables Adams to just be himself and do what he does best. <br /> <br />If your like me, a fan who has rang true since his \\"Whiskeytown\\" days, you will absolutely love this CD.  It just might tie \\" Heartbreaker\\" as his greatest release yet.  <br /> <br />This year we have 2 more CD's to look forward too. Let us hope the stay as true as this one.
0345409671|1.0|I had always had a bit of an elitist bias against Anne Rice, but after a re-watching of Interview with the Vampire, I decided to start the Vampire Chronicles.  I was immediately hooked - sure, they're guilty pleasures, but relatively well-written ones.  The first two (Interview and Lestat) are tight, superb narratives.  By Queen of the Damned, Anne's writing and plot lines become a bit more contrived, but I still loved the book, and also enjoyed Body Thief.  After I had raced through the first 4 books in so many days, I went out and bought Memnoch the Devil and the Vampire Armand.  With much enthusiasm I started, but unfortunately I have to say that it turned out to be the worst book I almost read.  I live to read, and NEVER before have I stopped reading a book, but more than halfway through Memnoch I put it down, never to be picked up again.  Why?  It had nothing to do with the religious content.  I myself am an atheist, but I am fascinated by novels dealing with what I would term \\"christian fantasy\\" (think Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy).  The problem with Memnoch the Devil is that it is utterly BORING.  I gave up halfway through about 70 solid pages of expository dialogue by Memnoch on the Creation.  It seems that the more success Anne Rice receives, the more she feels entitled to this dense, directionless type of writing.  Anne has obviously thought up some brilliant ideas on the nature of heaven and hell and god and the devil, but she lacks the skill to take these lofty ideas and translate it into good, interesting prose.  After giving up on Anne Rice for a while, I decided to simply skip to the next book The Vampire Armand, which I really enjoyed.  She adds much more of the homoeroticism that threads its way through the entire Chronicles, and the result is that Armand is the most overtly erotic of her books I have read so far.  But the end of The Vampire Armand gets slightly bogged down by ... you guessed it! - Armand's own heaven/god ecounters.Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles should stick to Vampires, the stories are compelling because these inhuman creatures are so utterly human, and Anne Rice can write them perfectly.  But her metaphysical rantings leave much to be desired.
B000069HK2|5.0|well... my friend bought this CD. and we wud just listen to it over and over again. i fell in love with it right away. eventually i had memorized every song on this album, and then bought it! and let me tell you... i have had this CD for a long time, and i still consider it one of my favorite CDs. and usually, i but a CD and only listen to it for a couple of weeks, but not this one! its perfect! its screamo... and u no the hot emo boys are behind that! its great to cheer u up wen ur mad or sad, and its great to pump u up wen ur hyper. u can definetely jump around and have fun to this one! definetely get this album! its so hot!
6304493681|4.0|Rather than offer another version of what's already been said, I'm going to focus on the one part that, in my opinion, put a big gash on an otherwise beautiful, intelligent anime. <br /> <br />I'm not a fan of having to read movies, so enjoyment of an anime hangs in the balance of whether or not it's dubbed well.  In the case of Ghost in the Shell, there's some very good dubbing (Richard Epcar as Batou) and some efficient dubbing (Abe Lasser as the Puppet Master and William Frederick as Aramaki, to name a few).  However, the movie depends mostly on the voice of the Major, and Mimi Woods was (no offense) a terrible choice.  Motoko Kusanagi is practically a perfect cybernetic being, so one might think she'd have a beautiful, almost mystic voice to go with her looks and personality.  Woods, however, sounds unrefined...natural, but too simple and out-of-character.  If you close your eyes and try to picture the Major through Mimi Woods' voice, you don't.  You can't.  And everything she says loses its strength because the voice just can't deliver it with the thoughtful tone it needs...and since most of the insight revolves around her character, that leaves a big dent in the strength of the film's philosophical core. <br /> <br />If you hate all dubs and are strictly a \\"subbed\\" person, then enjoy; otherwise, be warned: with that dubbed voice, the Major's credibility only hangs on by its teeth.
B000929AJQ|5.0|The much anticipated NIN album \\"With Teeth\\" has arrived, long time fans will most likely love this album, but the \\"fans\\" who have just heard a song here and there and just got the album for the catchy \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" will most likely be disappointed. It is slightly different than Trent's past work, but what artist doesn't change album after album? I see numerous people comparing it to \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", that was awhile ago, he's obviously trying new things. Get over it. I also see others comparing it to The Fragile, The Fragile was a 23 song album, about 2 albums together. How can you try compare it to a 13 track album? It's a whole new album, accept it as so.
B000056JYB|5.0|I read that Eric Clapton hates it....well sorry, but I love it. I still think its one of the Best records ever made. I do have to agree that the added material is kind of a stretch...but I guess more mediocre material is still great to get other than the 5 original pieces that Im sure everyone has played to death.
B000099T3P|5.0|This movie is kic. I grew up with this movie and think its funny as hell. Imagine being like 5 when watching it. I have seen them all and only can say this one and 2 are worth the watch. But man it is better than most comedies out there that is for sure. If you like gremlins 2. You will like this because of the all round hair balls eating your house and home. Also for all those 80s fan out there you'll love the rock star kickin scenes. Critters 2 get also because there is nothing like having a playmate with big breath and a stable in her stomach from the centerfold it transformed into, kick krite scum. :)
0786868694|5.0|I first saw Ms. Lawson on the BBC and was enchanted. When I got around to getting the book and trying some of her recipes was I ever impressed. I just hope that she gets the powers that be to get her DVD's for sale over here in the States soon!
B0002X314C|4.0|I may be a bit biased here, because I never really liked rap very much...although I do like it in certain songs. But Kanye West and Snoop Dogg kinda ruin the tracks they're on on \\"Get Lifted.\\" It's not just the fact that it's rap for me, though...it's the fact that the lyrics are just plain stupid. Both songs would sound great without those parts in them; especially \\"I Can Change.\\" I saw John Legend in concert with Alicia Keys, and \\"I Can Change\\" sounded awesome without all that. I think Snoop's lines actually lowered my IQ when I listened to that song on the CD. I dunno, it just breaks up the feeling of the songs, too...the rap parts don't even seem like they fit. They interrupt the mood of the songs and bring the quality of them down a level. But, other than those two things, the album is GREAT.
6305897786|4.0|It was a very enjoyable underrated movie, but the ending left me confused and without a sense of closure, a 'huh-what?' feeling? So she was the devil? A demon? Why'd she choose him?  <br /> <br />An interesting feature to the DVD was being able to watch the picture with no dialogue, accompanied only by the intermittent score. Roman Polanski's commentary was also interesting.  <br /> <br />A second viewing offered up details that I missed before like the picture on Balkan's vault mirorring the postcard to the Baroness and yes, the girl really did 'fly' down the stone stairway and from the second story. <br /> <br />Watch the scene with the 'twin' booksellers in Spain. Roman Polanski explains how the scene was done with one actor playing both parts. Watch it again, noticing the cigarette smoke never drifts to the right side of the screen where the second 'brother' stands. A nice touch is where he waves away non-existent 'smoke'.  <br /> <br />
B0006J28L4|5.0|Spike Lee should've won best director for this film, and Denzel should've won an oscar, but Denzel lost the oscar to Al Pacino for Pacino's performance in Scent of A Woman (which, I believe, is inferior to Denzel's portrayal of Malcolm X, but that's just one man's opinion, innit?)<br /><br />This motion picture is an experience that all Americans should partake in. The story dramatically demonstrates Malcolm's transformation from a street thug, to a leader of the black nation. Denzel Washington was masterful in his performance of the much maligned leader of the Nation of Islam. Washington's performance demonstrates why he should be considered one of the greatest actors of our time. The movie was effective at attracting viewers that maybe would not want to see the movie otherwise-- it has entertainment value. The scenes at the barbershop and the dance are humorous and light and well performed. Washington's delivery of Malcolm's various speeches are also well done. Malcolm X was a brilliant orator, and Washington was able to capture that skill. The film is a must see.
B0006399FS|4.0|As with All That You Can't Leave Behind, I was not thrilled with the first single released which made me not want to buy the album.  But when the video for \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" came out, I knew I made another mistake and snapped this record up. I've been listening to this CD consistently more than any other recent releases for several months now, and it's continuing to impress.<br /><br />There's at least 4 very good songs on this record, my most fave being \\"Original of the Species\\" (gorgeous and addictive).  It took me a couple of listen-throughs for me to begin to appreciate U2's latest achievement.  This record is not as great as Achtung, but it's unfair to expect a masterpiece EVERY time.  It still blows the competition out of the water.<br /><br />A previous reviewers comparison to Coldplay was laughable.  I'm a Coldplay fan, but you can't even compare their skills to the time-proven greatness of u2.
B000002VQQ|5.0|SIX STARS  For me this was the most important album of the seventies.  Patti Smith's debut album Horses came on the scene with a fury.  Eight songs (plus a bonus track) take you on a long mystical journey.  Patti Smith initially fell into the broad catagory of punk but   Patti Smith  is in a catagory all of he own. Her lyrics are very literate and poetic and yet  her words and music can at times have the raw power of punk.     This Beat/Punk mass begins appropriately with the song \\"Gloria\\" and with the same \\"appropriateness\\" begins with the line    \\"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine\\"    It starts out slow but then Patti begins to rock. Patti comes across like an icy blue Janis Joplin because like Janis she puts heart and soul into every song.    The second song \\"Redondo Beach\\" is somewhat down beat and slightly morbid but through out the album an atmosphere is established - and through the joy and the pain expressed one is reminded of many of Allen Ginsberg's poems.    The third song \\"Birdland\\" is by far the most moving. And here takes us from the lows to ecstasies it is intricate both lyrically and musically and to my mind is the best example of Patti Smith at her craft. The song inspired by the son of Wilhelm Reich takes off as though part incantation part revival meeting. If you listen to this song alone and give it your complete attention you will find yourself emotionally exhausted by the end of it. The first portion of lyrics are as follows (limitations of the space given prevent me from printing out the entire lyrics here but it must be heard to truly appreciate its vision. There are parts of the song that literally give me chills up my spine.    Birdland    His father died and left him a little farm in new england.  All the long black funeral cars left the scene  And the boy was just standing there alone  Looking at the shiny red tractor  Him and his daddy used to sit inside  And circle the blue fields and grease the night.  It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars  'cause when he looked up they started to slip.  Then he put his head in the crux of his arm  And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,  Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it  And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,  He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,  And he was very different tonight  'cause he was not human, he was not human.\\"    Oh my.    The fourth track \\"Free Money\\" gives us somewhat of a break from the tension and the artistic and literary references but only slightly and is sung by its end with great urgency.    The fifth track \\"Kimberly\\" is a beautiful poem  sparsely backed up by music. Once again we feel as though we are in the hands of a master.    The sixth track \\"Break it Up\\" Smiths voice goes from pleading to sweeping and one point even singing while she pounds on her throat. It is as if like Harry Partch, Patti smith is out to create her own form of music.    The seventh track \\"Land/Horses\\" is perhaps Patti Smith's most ambitious and once again the priestess pulls out all of the stops as story teller, conjurer and giver of rapture.    The eight track is Elegie. As the title suggests it is somber but Patti again does some marvelous things with her voice to emphasize every phrase.    There is one more track but at this point stop. The last track is quite worth while but my advice it to let  those 8 songs linger in your mind for a while before you  go on to the next.    The last track is My Generation the famous Who song. But in my opinion Patti does a better job with it.    Best to be listened to loud with the lights off and a few candles lit.
B0008ISM40|5.0|If you enjoyed \\"Hand That Feeds\\" you'll enjoy the album.  It's less epic then the Fragile and less guitar driven then the Downward Spiral but i really like this album.  I'm only enjoying it now and i'm trying to get it to grow on me.  Fragile was an instant enjoyment however, i don't compare them.  I just enjoy Reznor and his writing style and ingeneous creativity.  And who said save up for the Backstreet Boys?  Most fans of Reznors would kill a Backstreet Boy but whatever, your call dude.  Anyway, solid listen, more optimism and less epic then previous efforts, but awesome none the less.
B0000024TQ|5.0|I have a couple of confessions here.  My familiarity with Simon and Garfunkel has been incredibly shallow, first through their greatest hits album and then their placement of 'America' in Cameron Crowe's film 'Almost Famous' which sets the tone of the movie.  I know The Bangles' version of 'Hazy Shade of Winter' from the soundtrack to 'Less Than Zero' (one of the principle films of my generation) and didn't realize until years later that it was an S&G song.  My loss.     I picked up this album on vinyl in my local Goodwill to give it a listen.  I had no idea these guys were so radical.  While not overtly political, they were quite subversive and spoke out what people were genuinely feeling during the late 60s.  We all think of the song 'Mrs. Robinson' from the film 'The Graduate' but we often miss the social jabs laced throughout.  'Where have you gone Joe Dimaggio?' is a profoundly disturbing question.    Long before Pink Floyd threw in their sound effects and voices on their albums, Simon and Garfunkel were experimenting with the same.  Who ever heard of recordings of old people put right smack dab in the middle of an album?  You'll realize just how outspoken they truly were, something easy to miss with Simon's beautiful guitar work and Garfunkel's harmonies.      The social commentary is not pretty and underneath the beauty of the songs is a sorrow, a deep longing for meaning and understanding from among the chaos.  We often think of others of that era, from Bob Dylan to Marvin Gaye and other such troubadours, but for those who miss out on the deeper cuts of some of Simon and Garfunkel's work, it's to their loss.  To get an understanding of the turmoil of this era, this album is a necessity.  This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long, long time.
B0006GAI78|1.0|If you've ever seen the Japanese original, this film will be a HUGE letdown, screwing it up in every stereotypical Hollywoodish way imaginable: kitsch, corniness, cliche, patronizing the audience stupidity, etc.  Richard Gere is an OK actor, Jennifer Lopez is barely average (even if she's a hot babe) and this movie is just a disaster.<br /><br />I almost walked out after the first twenty minutes, it was so bad.  The main reason I paid was the $8 tub of exquisitely chemically-buttered popcorn we had invested in, so I stayed put in order to thicken my arteries a bit more.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|When Ridley Scott goes to make a film, he always seems to have a clear view in mind. but when studios tell him to tinker with his films, his vision ends up getting diminished. Such as what occurred with \\"Kingdom of Heaven.\\" Although I enjoyed the 144-minute theatrical version, I also noted that the first half of the film did suffer from under-developed characters and rushed storytelling, but was made up for by top-notch visual effects, some good performances, and superb battle scenes. Still, something was missing from the origianal version.<br /><br />But what was missing has been restored in Scott's superb director's cut. The film has been extended to 194-minutes, mostly adding plot and characterization, that gives the film more of a soul. Now, instead of a good action-epic, we get a film more on the lines of \\"Gladiator:\\" a character-driven historical epic, with fine performances by the main stars. I believe that if Scott had been allowed to release this version in the theaters, a great number of the cast and crew would've been up for Oscars.<br /><br />The DVD presents the film in a Roadshow presentation that would've been normal for a film of this kind back in the fifties and sixties, and features fine picture and sound. The special features are also fascinating, giving insight into the making of this epic film, and the reasons why it may have failed here in the states.<br /><br />Overall, this version of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is a masterpiece of film that ranks with films like \\"Gladiator,\\" \\"Alexander,\\" and \\"Braveheart\\" as one of the greatest historical epics of our time.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+
B000002UAR|5.0|This is one of the finest LP's ever .
015670160X|5.0|This novel stabs at society's defining roles of the sexes in a way that is humorous, yet thought provoking as Woolf entertains her readers in this biography of herself. The author begins with her birth in the sixteenth century, and ends in the twentieth century. She starts as a young man and ends up a woman at the end of the novel, she most definitely makes appoint of showing how women have been oppressed throughout the centuries which is not something no one knows, but a good reminder. Throughout the novel, Orlando rarely changes in appearance with an eerie androgynous look as she/he sees monarch's come and go, and changes along with every forthcoming style. Orlando is a fantasy like novel that is gutsy and a creative mockery of Woolf, as she characterizes in depth the roles of the sexes with a wit and humor. I highly recommend this book along with the movie.
B000929AJQ|4.0|...But, this album lacks the freshness of Pretty Hate Machine, and the epic intensity of The Downward Spiral.  A good description of the album would be that it sounds like The Fragile, with the fat trimmed away and more focus on melody and hooks.  In other words, its a more straightforward album, and a very enjoyable one at that.  To me, the quality of the record picks up after \\"The Hand that Bleeds\\".  I think all the songs after that are very cool, particularly \\"With Teeth\\" and \\"Only\\".  Although the album is not particularly heavy/intense, the songs flow into one another very well and each songs is able to stand on its own.  The structure of the songs most closely resemble Pretty Hate Machine, but with more advanced production.  This album differs from The Downward Spiral and The Fragile in that those two albums were very expansive and intense concept albums, like long compositions.  That worked beautifully on The Downward Sprial because the intensity was there throughout the entire record, and it is put together so well it created an amazing mood/experience.  The Fragile attempted to to that, but being that it was a double CD, it kind of zapped the urgency and intensity that The Downward Sprial had, making it a somewhat exhausting listen.  However that was the point of The Fragile, experimentation.  The experimentation on The Fragile is what makes it such a unique, interesting listen.  On With Teeth, Trent is more intent on making more memorable, quality songs.  Some people will be pleased with that, others will not.  I for one, am.  I also find that this album becomes more enjoyable with repeated listens.  Its a sound of a more mature, sober Trent Reznor, but make no mistake, the music is still powerfull, blissfull, and moving, often times in the same song.  And that is NIN at it's best.
B00000APLB|2.0|Five words should suffice: GET YER YA YAS OUT.  The El Mocambo cuts are the only reason to justify this CD - and, PLEASE no more \\"this was when Keef was busted for heroin.\\"  That is SO \\"last century.\\"
B00005JNVS|5.0|First, let me say that I am glad that Buster Keaton and Quentin Tarantino have finally teamed up. It's one of the things I've been waiting for for a while. I enjoyed \\"Kung-Fu Hustle\\" for the first two acts. The last act, however, falters when it tries to become one extended fight scene. Everything preceding that is like the old Looney Tunes cartoons, and the last act is full of delimbings and decapitations, and a ton of blood. I felt that the excessive violence, although a little too much when one character is bludgeoned so much that brain is exposed, was still entertaining and did not take the movie down or anything, like it may have in any other film. I really liked how the movie, although set in the 1930's , feels like it takes place in the 1800's. I loved the exterior shots and how the cars looked so bright they looked practically computer-generated. Some aspects of the film work well, others work wonderfully, and some work just alright. One scene in the film reminded me of \\"Kill Bill\\", and that is the battle sequence where one man faces about 100 guys, and he scares them all away. I have to say that this may be one of the best choreographed, best edited, best spoofing fil so far this year. It's not the best. It's not the worst. It's a very good movie.     Stephen Chow plays Sing, a Japanese man who apparently has no job, and wants to be a member of the Axe Gang, a group of toughs who swing axes and stick their victims in the most uncomfortable places. Sing's first place that he sets for a takedown is Pig Sty Alley, an impoverished section of China. It is run by a tough landlady who enjoys beating on her hubby, a cheating landlord who likes to give women \\"Full body exams\\". Sing attracts the Axe Gang to the Alley, and an 80 minute battle ensues.     See this film if you feel like watching an entertaining and thoroughly pleasing action-comedy-spoof.     Rated R.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|The third season of \\"Gilmore Girls\\" offers a lot of ups and down for Lorelai and Rory, not to mention pretty much everybody else at Stars Hollow or Chilton.  I was prepared to declare that this was my least favorite season of the series because I did not like Jess and I though Rory's choice to ditch Dean for Jess was the lost of the innocence that made the character so endearing in the first place.  Then I took into account that \\"Gilmore Girls\\" airs on the WB and from Felicity choosing Ben over Noel and Joey picking Pacey over Dawson I have been nothing but disappointed with the romantic choices of their ing&eacute;nues.  Buffy chose Angel and then she ended up killing him.  If Lorelai and Luke do not end up happily ever after I might be compelled to give up on the show (consider this fair warning, WB), but if Rory could dump Dean I knew Jess could never go the distance and I could take heart in that fact.<br /><br />What defines this third season for Lorelai and Rory are not the men (or boys) in their lives but rather their goals of realizing their dreams.  For Lorelai this means opening up her own inn with Sookie.  That dream gets put on the front burner when a fire damages the Independence Inn (\\"A Tale of Poes and Fire\\"), but buying the Dragonfly Inn (the house from \\"The Waltons\\" if you know your television history) proves to be a problem (\\"Say Goodnight, Gracie\\").  When Lorelai insists on spending the money she got from her father on her daughter's education at Yale it is Rory who has to cut her own deal with Richard and Emily so that her mother can get her dream too (\\"Those Are Strings, Pinocchio\\").  It is supposedly a \\"win-win-win\\" situation, but that remains to be seen.<br /><br />Of course, Rory getting into the college of her dreams is the real defining element of the season.  I came to the show late (mea culpa, mea maxima culpa) so I knew that Rory was at Yale and wondered what on earth had happened to keep her from going to Harvard.  Well, in Season 3 we find out.  The dream starts to turn into a nightmare when Rory's application for Harvard has to be put together (\\"Application Anxiety\\").  When Paris did not get into Harvard (\\"The Big One\\"), I was terrified the same fate awaited Rory.  But when Richard manipulates Rory into an interview at Yale (\\"Let the Games Begin\\") my biggest surprise was that Lorelai was actually wrong in an argument with her father (the end of the episode indicates she knows that too).  This one has two of Rory's best moments in this season are when she tells Richard he did the right thing the wrong way in this episode and when she apologizes to Dean and I could feel she was still a good kid at heart.  I also like it in the season finale when she tells Emily she is being stupid in shutting out Lorelai and if I could use my one free spin in this life to get Rory to say something it would be to tell Emily, \\"Grandma, I love you, but no matter what you do I will never love you more than I love my mother.\\"<br /><br />The best part of Rory and Jess was Lorelai giving Luke lessons on what it means to be a parent of a teenager in love.  Other big moments are the dance marathon (\\"They Shoot Gilmores Don't They?\\"), the poignant flashback's to the pregnant young Lorelai (\\"Dear Emily and Richard\\"), and Emily standing up to Trix (\\"That'll Do, Pig\\").  For me the funniest moment of the entire season is in \\"I Solemnly Swear\\" when Emily reads the transcript of Lorelai's deposition.  I almost busted a gut on that one.  Yes, I cried when Rory talked about her mom in her graduation speech, but the sweetest moment of the season was when they came up with the great payoff for the running gag about the t-shirts Kirk was selling at the end of \\"A Tale of Poes and Fire\\" (Admit it: You wish you have a \\"Rory's Going to Yale\\" t-shirt).  Now we can send Rory off to college in Season 4 so that Luke and Lorelai can finally get on the same page and kiss already.<br /><br />The DVD offers up extra scenes, which is certainly ample justification for fans of the show to check it out in this format.  Besides, if you have waiting to see baby pictures of Lauren Graham or Alexis Bledel, Liz Torres and Kelly Bishop in their dancing days, or having a burning desire to see Sean Gunn do the robot again, then the featurettes on the childhood stories from the cast and their best 1980s dance moves are going to allow you to move on to having other images on your visual wish list.to check it out in this format.

B000929AJQ|5.0|To be honest, after the first listen to this CD I wasn't overly impressed. I thought to myself after 6 years Trent could have come up with something better than this. BUT...a few days later and now I can't stop listening to it. It's subtle but the brilliance is there. It's more song-oriented and even poppy at times which might turn some hardcore fans off, but I love it. It shows Reznor's maturity and growth. He's not a punk kid anymore. He's a brilliant artist. Every song is a winner. I can listen to the whole thing without hitting the skip button once and that alone says a lot. I can't even pick a favorite song because they're all great. The production is amazing. This is an album to be savored, like a fine wine, Trent Reznor only getting better with age.

015670160X|4.0|Orlando begins life as a titled and gifted young man in sixteenth century England, but later acquires a much larger perspective through a series of intense and improbable events that take him across barriers of culture, time, and gender. <br /> <br />After enduring a supernaturally cold winter in England and an affair with a Russian Princess that ends badly, Orlando decamps for the Orient, where he becomes a woman.  Nonplussed, Orlando decides that it is  \\"better to be quit of martial ambition, the love of power, and all other manly desires if so one can more fully enjoy the most exalted raptures known to the human spirit, which are . . . contemplation, solitude, love.\\"   <br /> <br />There follows much discussion of gender and gender confusion.  Woolf tells us that: <br /> <br />\\"The difference between the sexes is, happily, one of great profundity.  Clothes are but a symbol of something hid deep beneath.  It was a change in Orlando herself that dictated her choice of a woman's dress and of a woman's sex.  And perhaps in this she was only expressing rather more openly than usual - openness indeed was the soul of her nature - something that happens to most people without being thus plainly expressed.  For here again, we come to a dilemma.  Different though the sexes are, they intermix.  In every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.\\" <br /> <br />There are many other themes in this imaginary biography which spans centuries.  One is comical examination of English society and culture: <br /> <br />\\"Thus, stealthily, and imperceptibly, none marking the exact day or hour of the change, the constitution of England was altered and nobody knew it. ...  The muffin was invented and the crumpet.  Coffee supplanted the after-dinner port, and., as coffee led to a drawing-room in which to drink it, and a drawing-room to glass cases, and glass cases to artificial flowers, and artificial flowers to mantelpieces to pianofortes, and pianofortes to drawing-room ballads, and drawing-room ballads (skipping a stage or two) to innumerable little dogs, mats, and antimacassars, the home - which had become extremely important - was completely altered.\\" <br /> <br />This \\"biography\\" is also metafiction, and there are several humorous references to the act of writing.  In fact, Orlando herself writes prolifically throughout the novel (carrying with her a poem, \\"The Oak Tree,\\" that must constantly be revised as she changes).and encounters many literary figures, among them the revered Alexander Pope who makes a big impression: \\" ... `How noble his brow is,' she thought (mistaking a hump on a cushion for Mr. Pope's forehead in the darkness).\\"   <br /> <br />Sometimes I don't get Virginia Woolf, but I was very entertained by this novel.
6305212112|5.0|What's genius about this movie is it isn't over the top. It's basically like real life, friendship, love, death and illness, ignorance, memories, and being loyal. It is a very sad movie though, but there were so many moving parts that made you cry or just warmed your heart. The only thing I was ever confused about was the end because they pretty much left it up to the audience to figure it out. Was Miss Thredgood idgie? It would make sense since she had photos of idgie and ruth, and knew every detail about their adventures and friendship. But at the beginning, Miss Thredgood said she married idgie's brother Cleo, and was practially adopted by the thredgood family. That contradicts actually being idgie. Or did she just say idgie was alive, so that she could keep her memory alive, because before she told Evylen to go to the grave, she said \\"all these people will live, as long as you remember them\\" Well anyway, I've watched Fried Green Tomatoes for years, and it's funny, and sad, and heart-warming. One of those drama's you never get sick of watching. It's also thought provoking. It's a little reminder to not take things for granted.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|Hodges never should have cut Portman's nude scenes--they could only have improved this otherwise very mediocre movie.  This is one of those flicks with a great cast, giving great performances, but at the end you're left thinking, \\"So what?\\"  The characters are all so unpleasant, you never really give a damn what happens to them, or what they do to each other...or even, most of the time why they do to each other the terrible things they do.      Just about every word out of these characters' mouths is preciously clever, in a way that (to borrow from Updike) rings as true as a handful of false coins.  When they aren't making with the clever-talk, they're making with the dirty-talk, which is just...a joke, really.  (It IS funny, though--unintentionally, I'm sure--to hear golden girl Julia Roberts talk dirty; if you're amused by that sort of thing, it alone might be worth the price of a rental.)     It's hard to see what these characters even see in each other, unless, remarkably, superficial wit makes up for the vast wastelands that are their characters.    Skip this one.

B00005NVDF|5.0|I saw this film at Cal State Northridge with Eric Lax as a special guest. He is the author of Woody Allen: A Biography, as well as bios on Humphrey Bogart and Paul Newman. David Kipen, book critic for the San Francisco Chronicle moderated the program. <br />  <br />In answer to an audience member's question during the Q&A session, Lax said that Woody Allen has never made a bad film. I agree with this comment because I've enjoyed most of Allen's films. The ones I haven't been too fond of have plenty of redeeming qualities in them anyway. Even the heavy-handed Interiors had a lot to recommend it, at least for true movie buffs. Play It Again Sam was one of the funniest and most underrated Woody Allen film I have ever seen. <br />  <br />Based on a play written by Woody Allen in 1968 and directed by Herbert Ross (who also directed film versions of Neil Simon plays back in the 70's), the film concerns a mild-mannered film critic named Allan Felix, played by Allen, who is dumped by his wife (Susan Anspach). What a gorgeous woman like her was doing with a guy like Allan Felix is beyond me, but for some reason, Allen (was Woody playing himself?)  tends to pair himself up with a slew of gorgeous females in almost all his films.  <br />  <br />Felix's apartment is a shrine to Humphrey Bogart and it is none other than Bogey himself who counsels him in the romance department since his ego is crushed. Felix's best friend Dick (Tony Roberts) and his wife Linda (Diane Keaton) also try to find a woman for him by setting him up on one disastrous date after another. When Felix finds himself falling for Linda, a series of hilarious complications take place as he is guided by Bogey on what to do. This results in a funny yet touching reworking of the Casablanca ending with Linda even donning the Ingrid Bergman hat and Felix giving her the \\"Maybe Not Today, Maybe Not Tomorrow\\" speech, after which he replies, \\"It's from Casablanca. I've been waiting my whole life to say that.\\" <br />  <br/>Play It Again Sam was the first screen pairing of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, who would go on to star in over a handful of films together. All four lead actors, including Tony Roberts and Jerry Lacy, who does a perfect Bogart, were in the stage play together. It is interesting to note that, according to Lax, the actors knew which lines would get the most laughs because they performed the play on stage so often, that they slightly paused before continuing, so moviegoers wouldn't miss out on the next punchline. <br />  <br />This often overlooked film is, in my opinion, one of Woody Allen's most enjoyable comedies. The film has aged well, and the witty one-liners and comical situations are still hilarious. Perhaps the reason this film is hardly ever mentioned in lists of Woody Allen's best is because he didn't direct it, although it has the look and feel of an Allen directed film in every aspect. This was a sophisticated and worthwhile film that made me long for the days when comedies were actually funny. <br />  <br />
0440180295|5.0|Slaughter House Five is a great book, PERIOD. As a soldier currently serving in Iraq, I always jump at an opportunity to read any book that is labeled as \\"anti-war\\". After hearing some friends talk about the book, I decided to read it for my own. Words cannot express the adventure, comedy, and horror I felt as I read the book. <br /> <br />The book follows the life of Billy Pilgrim, in the many phases of his life. After Billy is abducted by aliens, he learns how to \\"time-hop\\" and the reader is treated to Billy Pilgrim in different points of his life. The reader is taken along Billy's journeys as he is stuck in time (as the aliens, Tramaldforians explained humans are) while he visits different parts of his life. The reader follows Billy as a young P.O.W. in World War II, an optometrist in his \\"middle years\\", and the voice of the Tramaldforians in his later years. Throughout each phases of his life the reader is given glimpses of what is, has, and always will be of Billy Pilgrim.  <br /> <br />The center focus of the book is the bombing of Dresden, which by some accounts rivals the destruction of Hiroshima, and the TOTALLY destructive nature of war.  <br /> <br />Billy Pilgrim is a chaplin's assistant in World War II that is taken as a prisoner. The book follows his accounts of his capture, then jumps to other parts of his life. Most notably, later on in his life he is abducted by aliens and taken to another planet, Tramalfodor, where he learns that there is a fourth-dimension where Earthlings can travel in time. <br /> <br />Quite frankly it is difficult to give a clear outline of this book as it is not your \\"standard\\" work of ficition. The book is written in a matter of factly type way. Concurrent with the standard of the fourth dimension, as taught to Billy by the aliens, all time is existing at the same time. Therefore, Billy can visit any part of his life and never really dies in the natural sense. he always will live, stuck (or unstuck rather) in time.  <br /> <br />I believe that this book is a great example of what a war book should be. Instead of painting the people in war as heroes and men without fear, this book puts a realistic face on what REALLY goes on. Unforetunately, most war novels and movies potray war with strong men, who prevail at all costs, not this book. Vonnegut, places a human face and war that shows that war is hell, and most times (as with the Iraqi Crisis) it is fought by children. These children are like any other human beings, yet our society has gone through great lengths to make the horrible atrocities of war seems ok, or even heroic. War is has definately been over-hyped throughout the ages, and this book did a good job of bringing war down to what is really is, hell. <br /> <br />The story contains very few characters, and even less description into these individuals. The author admits that this was done on purpose, because there are no individuals in war. Opposite to what movies would have you believe (I guess realistic stuff is boring) soldiers for the most part are not individuals, they are one. They wear the same clothes, eat the same food, and generally have the same struggles. Throughout the books Vonnegut's style and prose make this very clear, which makes the story even more compelling.  <br /> <br />After reading the book, I have become very interested and curious about the bombing of Dresden. From my initial research, the bombing was definately a great kind against human kind, by some accounts over 100,000 civilians were killed in the massacre order by the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force. Still most people do not even have the slightest ideal of the carnage that took place on Feb. 13th, 1945. Vonnegut's book, however, paints a clear picture that is funny, sad, and serious all at the same time. <br /> <br />I would sugguest reading the book, then reading it again to really get a true understanding of the ideal that Vonnegut is trying to express. While the simple narrative of the story is misleading, the book has really raised some strong convictions about the way that I have viewed war. While I am not a pacificist or idealist, I believe that Vonnegut gave a good account of the wages of war. Just read and see!
0790734850|5.0|Manohla Dargis, a film critic for The New York Times and former editor for the L.A. Weekly film section, presented L.A. Confidential, one of her favorite movies, for the Cal State Northridge Cinemateque Critics Series, where I saw this film a few weeks ago. The film was followed by an insightful Q & A between Dargis and David Kipen, a book critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, and continued with answers to questions from members of the audience. <br />  <br />As mentioned by Dargis, L.A. Confidential was released in 1997 to huge critical acclaim. It went on to be nominated for nine Academy Awards and is now considered a key film for the 90s. In fact, in answer to a question from an audience member, Dargis feels that had Titanic been released another year, L.A. Confidential would have garnered all the major awards of 1997. Although it didn't, it is still widely regarded as one of the best movies of that year. <br />  <br />Based on the novel by James Ellroy, the film is a dark and gritty noir set in 1950s Los Angeles and deals with police corruption and Hollywood sleaze. The seemingly idyllic Los Angeles of the early 1950s provides the glitzy backdrop for the grisly crime that is the focus of the story: a bloody shotgun slaying of the patrons at an all-night diner. One of the victims was Dick Stensland, a subpar police officer forced into retirement after a drunken brutality incident not long before his death.  <br />  <br />Heading the investigation are three very different cops. Stensland's former partner, Wendell \\"Bud\\" White (Russell Crowe), a man willing to break the rules to seek justice; Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), an ambitious but naive golden boy who is willing to do almost anything to get ahead; and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a slick operator who collaborates with a celebrity magazine to insure high-profile arrests. <br />  <br />What follows is a powerful and stylish mystery with an ever-twisting plot that continually surprises the audience without insulting its intelligence. The compelling blend of L.A. history and pulp fiction makes for an intense and fascinating film that definitely deserved more audience attention than it got.   <br />  <br />This is my second viewing of the film, but my first as a student of film. With Dargis' commentary following the feature, I now have a deeper appreciation for this unique motion picture and liked it even more upon second viewing. A rich and complex mystery full of astonishing performances (including an Oscar for Kim Basinger's supporting role), this will definitely be remembered as a landmark film for the 90's. Its comparisons to Chinatown are inevitable. This is modern noir at its finest. <br />

B000002H33|5.0|I know you've seen and read hundreds of reviews that tell you how great and grand this album is......and thats just what it is!  One of my favorite thrash albums of my collection.  The best tracks of the album are without a doubt Battery, Master of Puppets, Sanitarium, and Disposable Heros.  I'm not saying that the other songs arent as good, I'm just saying you should probably listen to these ones before the others if you want the good stuff first.  I heard somewhere that Dave Mustaine is co-writer of Master of Puppets and Leper Messiah...I dont know if its true, but whether he did or not, they are great songs.  And that is my two cents on this album.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|After reading many many reviews trying to find out why some do not like the movie version, they just don't get it!  It's about the music not the acting or direction it is The Music of the Night (or day).  If you have seen a live performance, it is often difficult to see the facial experessions, the movie allows you to see it in detail.  Additionally, the stage does not allow to fully comprehend where the action is taking place and how the characters are relating to the scene.  The movie makes the action more memorable.  Indeed the movie and the stage versions are complementary to each other.  Bravisimo!
B0002EXH54|4.0|This album was kind of a disappointment for me.  It has more lows than it does highs.  There are a few songs that I like such as Devil's Island, Black Friday, and My Last Words.  But the biggest low of the album are the lame, boring, senseless intros to almost every song.  I always find myself fast forwarding to the vocals cause the 1 or 2 minutes before are just fillers to make sure the album comes out more than 20 minutes long.  Even though Wake Up Dead starts with vocals right away, it's not heavy enough for me.  However, I reccomend fast forwarding to the middle after the first solo (It's pretty much an instrumental then there are a few more vocals).  I'd be lying if I said I hate this album.  Like I said, it has a few terrific songs, but not enough terrific songs.
B000003TAR|2.0|The lack of production on this thing is really what kills it. \\"PennyRoyal Tea\\" and \\"Dumb\\" could've sounded more cohesive had they been produced as well as their Unplugged counterparts. \\"All Apologies\\" \\"Rape Me\\" and \\"HSB\\" are classics, but the rest isn't worth listening to. \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" is among Cobain's worst songs. So is the feedback squealer \\"RFUS\\". God, I hate all the praise critics heap on this band, and especially this album. Nevermind was the bands ONLY solid studio release. The rest is iffy. Yeah, that what Nirvana is; they're iffy. Sixteen Stone has better songs than the best material on In Utero, and Bush were trying to copy Nirvana's style! I guess a copy really can be better than its predecessor. Give me \\"Glycerine\\" over \\"All Apologies\\" any day. Let the narrow-minded squabbling begin.... NOW.
6304806426|1.0|I watched this movie again, wanting to like it. Wanting to see the romance and beauty in it. Wanting to believe the good reviews and all of the hype. It was even worse the second time. At least it was on television, so I didn't have to fork out money again to watch in a theatre like I did the first time. <br /> <br />The two main characters are shallow and completely unlikeable. There is absolutely nothing redeeming in their personalities. She has as much depth as a cardboard cutout, and he is a maudlin, nasty human being. Yet we are expected to believe that their groping is romantic and root for them. Colin Firth plays her husband as a nice man. The scene where he sees her sneaking out to meet him after planning an anniversary surprise for her is heartbreaking - a decent man who they drive to murder/suicide. At least he is sympathetic, unlike the two pretty, plastic people. I agree with Elaine Bennes on Seinfeld - die already.  <br /> <br />The relationship between Hana and Kip was one of the few nice features of the movie. There was an honesty and likeability about the two of them, a stark contrast to the two detestable leads. I also liked the Carravagio character. At least there was some depth there, even though he is a liar and thief.  <br /> <br />Just as an aside, the Count is very loosely based on a real person. The \\"romance\\" never happened with a woman. The real count was homosexual and died of dysentery in a hospital in Salzberg. He was never in a crash. He was respected by Rommel for being a good desert guide to the Germans.  <br /> <br />I am giving it one star because the cinemetography is great and it was well acted.
B000929AJQ|2.0|The first time I tuned in on FUSE and saw the new \\"Hand that Feeds\\" video, I caught it near the end of it. At first, I thought the band was a bad NIN rip-off. But then I realized that the guy mired behind the increasingly-distorted digital effects and cliched screaming was infact Trent Reznor... again. This guy's in such a damn rut. He hasn't done anything unique since 94's Downward Spiral. He's milked that album for the past eleven years. With great success I might add. After all, there HAS to be an audience for this watered-down digital bullsh*t that Depeche Mode perfected by the time they'd finished their Violator tour in 1990, right? With a title that calls itself \\"With Teeth\\", this album is just asking for people to slam it. Let's see how many plays on the title we can come up with. \\"With Teeth\\" bites. \\"With Teeth\\" has no bite to it. Now come up with your own! <br /> <br />I want more cutesy synth pop like PTM, Trent.
B000929AJQ|1.0|Too \\"hard\\" for pop fans, not heavy enough for metal fans, not quite techno...I guess. Trent needs to come up with some new material 'cause the only differences between \\"With Teeth\\", \\"The Fragile\\" & \\"The Downward Spiral\\" are...um...nothin'. Like previous NIN records, this particular one is noisey (not in a good way), boring, annoying, etc. Nothing personal, Mr. Reznor, but you can't just keep making the same record over & over...then remixing them over & over...& expect to keep fans. What all this means, boys & girls, is that Nine Inch Nails just isn't a good band to listen to. Think of all the other GOOD music by GOOD bands that's out there. Now make a list & go get those CDs & let's all just forget that NIN ever existed. HAVE A FUN DAY!!
0316172324|1.0|The premise of the book is that \\"instinct\\" or hunches can be formed by a first glance (thin slices) of information inputs; this data sometimes is enough as our subconscience focuses on what is really important in that decision long before we can clearly articulate our analysis of the data inputs. On that note, the key thin slice of information you need to know is: don't buy the book as that is the entire message. The remainder of the book is a host of wonderful examples, but no concrete further pertinent information is offered.  <br /> <br /> Early in the book, the author suggests that sometimes the hunches can go awry, but \\"for a very specific and consistent set reasons, and those reasons can be identified and understood.  It is possible to learn when to listen to that powerful onboard computer and when to be wary of it.\\" <br /> <br /> If the purpose of the book was to highlight and divulge in a clear and precise manner \\"when to listen... and when to be wary of it\\", it would be a very useful tool to enhance decision making.  Having failed to offer this, the book fails to give the reader any real value beyond what we instintively already know. <br /> <br /> Ironic, isn't it?  We have enough information about the book very rapidly: it is entertaining but lacking value.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Ok, first off, if you have a SACD compatable cd player you will enjoy this MUCH more....greather depth of sound and things you just dont hear otherwise. I'm not going to list a track by track rating, as I feel that's unfair to Trent. Every Nails album has (as least for me) been a listen to it start to finish type of thing. Trent goes thru every possible track mix, and always settles on what his gut instincts tell him, even if those he is working with disagree. And Most of NIN's stuff takes a good few listens to to absorb. This isnt pop. This is art. I actually had a copy about a month ago, as I usually get to hear most albums before they come out, so I've had plenty of time to absorb this, and it is wonderful. And yes, I did go out and buy it, even though I had it already as I always do. BTW Trent & co. were in town tonight, and did a really small venue. It ROCKED!!!
B000059TEP|5.0|Ghost is probably the most successful blending of several genres:  romance, supernatural thriller, comedy, and crime drama. It works on all levels, due to good performances and skillful production of a concept rarely pulled off so well, that of a ghost, visible only to the audience, trying to solve a problem for the living characters.  It was done somewhat successfully in some very old movies such as Topper, The Time Of Their Lives, and That's The Spirit, all great movies, but Ghost goes farther, appealing equally to those interested in romance, comedy, and suspense.<br /><br />Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore are clearly in love, and when he's killed by an apparent mugger, it's hard for her to accept.  Swayze's ghost appeals to spiritualist Whoopi Goldberg to warn Moore that's she's in danger from the people who murdered him.  Goldberg has some hilarious scenes, and it's my favorite role for her.  The love between Swayze and Moore is established so skillfully that we care about them making contact, and that creates a good deal of the film's suspense.<br /><br />There's not much that's very scary compared to the best horror movies, except on scene with a crazy ghost on a train.  However, the romance, comedy, and suspense are each enough for a great movie, all together making this one a \\"10.\\"<br /><br />If you like the sort of fantasy film that deals with death, angels or ghosts, some others that you may like are The Bishop's Wife, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, That's The Spirit, On Borrowed Time, and more recently The Dust Factory.
B00005JNVS|2.0|Wacky, stupid and overall unnecessary special effects. Great movie for kids that are 10, 11. If you're gonna do a kung fu movie, why do you have to involve fantasy elements? Why do they insist on doing this? I just don't get it. I admit its a pretty entertaining flick, but is not that great. Sorry, but Jackie chan is still number one.
B00005JNQQ|3.0|I was really looking forward to this film. \\"Ice Age\\" is one of my favorite movies. I was ecstatic when my son, almost 4, decided he wanted to watch it everyday for weeks. I sat with him each time it was on. When I first read about \\"Robots\\" I couldn't wait.  <br /> <br />I was THOROUGHLY disappointed. I didn't care about the characters, who never really grew or changed. <br /> <br />The jokes that I felt in \\"Ice Age\\" were timeless, were non-existent in this movies. The subtle animation (e.g., guilty downward glances, pauses in steps) to convey emotion was also missing. <br /> <br />Even with all the noise and colors, my four-year old son didn't like it.  <br /> <br />Sadly, I was very disappointed.
0802130208|5.0|I started reading this book and could not put it down.  The story is captivating and the characters are compelling, original and, of course, hilarious!  An absolute scream.  I practically wet myself with delirious laughter!    I am going to buy a copy of this book for all of my friends this coming holiday.  Laughter is the best medicine and CoD delivers them by the truckload.    I particularly loved Toole's depictions of: morbidly obese sneaky misanthropic dishonest middle-aged misfits unable to function in society; women as uneducated gold-diggers, bullied into submissive, subservient roles by their sons or employers; African Americans as foul-mouthed, lazy, viscious and scheming malcontents; Hispanics as spineless and clueless; old people as surly and senile; and of course, homosexuals as prancing foppish leather queens.      Man alive!  I just can't decide what's best about this book: the parade of cultural stereotypes or the chronicle of a hero who has turned his life into a train wreck.  They're both great!  This is good old-fashioned American humor at its best.  I think we can all agree on that -- Maury and Jerry aren't living on thousand acre estates for nothing.  Am I right?  Huh!?  C'mon - don't leave me hanging!    It's a shame we'll see no more quality writing from this author.  The Pulitzer was hardly enough!  A Nobel Prize would scarcely do justice to this wonderful and timeless contribution to English literature.  Confederacy of Dunces should be mandatory reading for all students, everywhere.  At each and every grade level.  There should be degree programs offered at the Masters and PhD level focusing solely on developing a greater comprehension of this tome, this Rosetta Stone of human behavior.    A gospel, really.  The foundation of a new religion, that we could devote our lives to.  Matthew, Mark, Luke, and L. Ron were hacks!  We could all memorize quotes and passages from CoD that would be relevant to particular aspects of our lives that would guide us in our daily living and bolster us when times got tough.  We could petition our state legislatures to change their license plate slogans to \\"What Would Ignatius Do?\\"  or simply \\"WWID?\\"    Buy this book!  You won't be disappointed!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  And if you wouldn't, yourself, it's probably because you're humorless.

B00007L4OM|4.0|There is nothing special about this movie. The action is ok, the humor is not especially funny, and it is sometimes slow. It delivers nothing new to the audiences.
0671004107|1.0|I very much tried reading this book with an open mind, and it wouldn't have mattered to me in the least if Ellie's character was an atheist. But Carl Sagan had to try and place biblical doubt in the mind of the reader by expressing his own apparent atheist views, by saying the Bible is contradictory. It's too bad that Carl Sagan couldn't have just written a fascinating Sci-Fi book without critiquing the word of God.   Without a doubt Carl Sagan was a brilliant scientist. I viewed Cosmos open-mindedly and was fascinated. I understand most scientists are unbelievers of God, and they place their beliefs on the Big Bang theory, Evolution, etc. And that's fine; they have the right to believe what they choose. But please do not critique other people's beliefs.   If you want to read a very good Sci-Fi book, check out 2001 a space odyssey.     I know my review of this book will strike a nerve with other reviewers. Though, as a believer in God (as I am) and someone who values God's word (as I do) I refuse to give a book a good review when said book critiques the Holy Bible as \\"Contact\\" does. For the unbeliever in Christ, and those who hold no value for the Holy Bible, Carl Sagan's book, Contact, will probably be the next best thing to the creation of Star Wars. For those who value God's word, this book, Contact, has way too much Blasphemy in my opinion. Once again, it's too bad Carl Sagan, couldn't have just written this Sci-Fi book without having to \\"TRY\\" and place Biblical uncertainty. That's all that needs to be said. The \\"point of the book\\" is meaningless. I wish very much that I did not even have to bring up religion when giving this book review. Quite possibly many people will love this novel. But being as though this book really did speak negative about the Bible, shame on me if I didn't at least warn anyone who values God's word, and who might be thinking about reading this book.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|It's difficult for me to express my feelings every time I listen to a new Ryan CD. He can either R&R and whisper in his songs and everything in between. To me he tells so many stories I feel in my guts. In his songs he often discribes the way my live is going down the road. I've seen him perform live in a solo set here in Holland in Utrecht. Just him, a piano and 1500 people hanging at his lips. He was ill that day I think the flue but what he brought on stage was amazing. This CD Cold roses again knocked me off my seat when I first heard it.     <br />
B00000I49J|5.0|Out of all the albums by the JAMC, Darklands is probably the one that best represents them. The album maintains a fine balance of moody and power-charged songs, and quite frankly there is nothing here that sounds 80s-like. Having said that, despite the 20 year rift between now and when the album was made, Darklands actually sounds better than it could have been back then, especially in the context of today's rock music. Here are my favorites: <br /> <br />The opening title track, Darklands, has nothing wrong with it. This is a beautiful song in every sense of the word. From the melodic, perfect guitars to William's soothing, soft voice juxtaposed with the bleak, apocalyptic lyrics, every second of this song is without fault and if you don't like it, well, I suggest you visit the nearest brain surgeon and have your cranium checked. <br /> <br />Deep One Perfect Morning is yet another faultless track that has an extremely catchy tune you probably can't predict as it comes at you. The song is a slow, moody, yet beautiful piece that doesn't waste any time with long guitar solos. The song keeps getting better and better as it goes, and when just when you think this song couldn't sound more fantastic, about two minutes in both Jim and William sing at the same time and you can't help but feel mesmerized till the end. <br /> <br />Nine Million Rainy Days is probably the darkest and murkiest song on the album. It'll go pretty well with you if your day hasn't gone right, with lyrics like \\"As far as I can see, there's nothing left of me\\" sung to a slow and mean guitar snare. Think of this as \\"Deep One Perfect Morning\\" gone straight to hell. That said, the song is a fantastic listen because the Reid brothers manage to concoct a memorable tune out of what might be taken as a depressive mess at first glance. Listen carefully and you'll find a gem of a song here.  <br /> <br />The song April Skies, is the piece which I've always felt best represents the JAMC. If you were to ask mewhich JAMC song you should listen to first out of all the albums, I'd say April Skies. It opens up with a foot-tapping, rocking beat. Jim then enters the scene, and from there the magic of this song begins.  April Skies is a pretty fast song compared to the rest, yet it manages to keep that Darklands formula working with it. The end result is a truly hard-hitting rock song that combines strong guitar work, a rhythmic beat and melodic tune. <br /> <br />Cherry Came Too is a very poppy sounding piece, probably the most candy coated one at that. Even the lyrics (\\"We're going where the ocean's blue\\" and \\"In the light of all my darkest moments, things fall into place\\") start out nice and sweet. Then towards the end, while the guitar work is still nice and sweet, the lyrics change to \\"come on and kick me dead\\" and \\"I'll give you my soul to beat it with your pole\\". Think of this as a more pop-like, sweeter sounding April Skies; it definitely sounds different from many of the songs here, but it still has that Darklands charm so it doesn't become irritating like some of the songs on Munki. <br /> <br />Finally, On the Wall is a rather interesting piece in that the lyrics start out like a \\"What am I?\\" riddle. \\"I'm like a mole, but not in a hole. Yet moles can't see anyway.\\" Midway through, William goes \\"I'm like the clock on the wall\\", and you figure out what the object in riddle is, as well as the significance of the song title. The tune is very slow and hazy like Nine Million Rainy Days, but William's voice makes it far less murky sounding. The song becomes exceptional when Jim enters the scene, with both their voices contrasting each other. All in all this is probably one of the most balanced tracks on Darklands, making it one of those songs you can listen to as many times as you like without getting sick of it.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I know the single was pretty weak, but give the whole record a chance. <br /> <br />Leading up to release, I kept hearing the album described as 'brutal' or something similar. When the title was changed from Bleedthrough to With Teeth I was worried that this was going to be some sort of Broken 2. Or worse yet, some sort of NIN St. Anger. Mercifully, these fears were not realized. <br /> <br />In terms of pure sound, the album seems to have distinct elements from all the previous albums. Some songs sound like they could have been on Pretty Hate Machine, or you'll hear a guitar that would have been at home on Broken. Maybe it's too early, but I can't identify a distinct With Teeth sound. <br /> <br />'The Hand That Feeds' is quite accessible; but its commercial appeal isn't why I'm not a huge fan. The lyrics suck The Gland That Pees; but Reznor sounds great and the song it catchy enough. I just don't like clumsy social commentary. I would have rather had this song on a Rock Against Bush album from last year. 'Getting Smaller' is probably the most straightforward rock song Nine Inch Nails has ever done, and it's done pretty well. <br /> <br />There are a couple 'lame verse, awesome chorus' songs here. 'The Line Begins to Blur' and 'Only' being the prime examples. 'You Know What You Are' sucks; it sounds forced, and worse, it doesn't sound good. <br /> <br />Some standouts include 'All the Love in the World', 'Beside You in Time', 'Everyday is Exactly the Same' and 'Right Where it Belongs'. I really like these songs; combining what has always been great about NIN with some successful artistic stretches on Reznor's part. <br /> <br />Rarely do the lyrics rise above the 'okay' to 'good' range, but NIN fans should be used to that by now. You will get some moments of lyrical depth on With Teeth, however, let's hope they are sign of things to come. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a more straightforward album. The Fragile aimed very high and just slightly missed. It ended up asa sort of magnificent failure. It was a sprawling work that was greater than the sum of its parts, but you could feel that there was something just past the album's grasp that was missed. And you felt like the record itself was aware of this. <br /> <br />With Teeth has a more modest mission. With minor exceptions, it comes off without a hitch. However, the overall work has a smaller scope. It's a solid; better than solid record; but the drama and mystery that swirled around The Fragile isn't there. In a way, that's the point. <br /> <br />The Fragile was billed as the 'recovery' record for Trent Reznor. It wasn't; the fledgling optimism of songs like 'We're In This Together Now' was swallowed up and devoured long before the record was finished. The 'you' in 'We're In This Together Now' and the 'The Fragile' seemed to abandon Reznor, leaving the rest of the record a story of disillusionment just as dark as The Downward Spiral. <br /> <br />With Teeth actually is a recovery album, but it isn't going about it by being happy. It's taking stock in a sober and uncompromising way. The Fragile seemed to still be hiding behind a wall of sound, and still, at times, reveled in the 'glorious despair' it shared with The Downward Spiral. This time, you're getting an analysis of dysfunction with a lot less pretension. Maybe I'm projecting a little too much of my own maturation over the last six years into Reznor's art, but it seems like With Teeth seeks to remove the veneer of 'cool' from the darkness. <br /> <br />But, despite being the turning point, this album takes baby steps. Maybe it has to- if you're backing off the 'my perfect pain is art' angle, it's harder to give quite the same theatrical flair to the music. And that's fine. I'm pretty sure I like The Fragile better than this effort, but I wouldn't have wanted The Fragile 2.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Here is the most fabulous special edition DVD set for any Phantom lover. The movie (that was already loved in the theature) will be enjoyed over and over again. I wanted to make special mention as to the bonus features which include the plays of the past...people involved in them, differences of the movie in comparison to the play, set designs, costume designs as well as the designer, special effects as well as a missing part with the phantom that was cut from the movie. I'm sure that I missed some important features that should be mentioned as well. MUST HAVE...BUY IT!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I, too, have had the privelege of seeing the stage production twice, in Toronto, and Detroit. The last time, only about a month and a half ago.  I saw the film around Christmas time, and I was very disappointed that it didn't get at least one oscars for costumes, or something. <br />  I'm glad they used different people in the roles, because how often do you see the same cast in the stage production? It allowed new actors & actresses to portray the roles, from one of the most popular stage productions of all time.
0596009208|4.0|Well...this book is very perfect for those newbies who want to really gain understanding in Java. Sierra and Bates are just awesome in detailing the theory of Java. They both know how to make Java looked a little bit chilled. If my suggestion is allowed, I would really suggest them to write more codes in their book. Somehow, their theory is great, but I feel programming needs more example to foster our understanding and experience on the codes. Overall, this book is RECOMMENDED for OO Java programming.

0393307050|5.0|Excellent Book, A must-read for fans of seafaring literature; next to Horatio Hornblower, this series is one of the best.
0399241515|5.0|This is the best goddamn book ever! I'm not going to tell you much of the plot, but it's a great book. I've read all 4 before it and this is leagues better than the other ones. Amazon's crappy \\"Look inside\\" won't tell you anything. Just get from the library like I did. There are probably like 10 holds before you, so you have to be patient. Anyway, the whole book is a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge network of friggin lies. Its like, one guy says \\"blah,blah, your father was a murder\\" and then another says \\"no, thats a lie, and tells you another lie\\" you never really find out the absolute truth until the end, and that is probably only mostly true. It has many, many more twists and turns than all the other books combined and is definetely not as predictable as the others as well. The basic plot I have typed below:    In the beggining, he tricks his friend Tom's family into going to Venice with him before going to Naples. There, he tries to break into the house of Julia Rothman, the head of Scorpia a criminal network (She seems nice but shes actually a real bitch)this doesn't work and he gets caught and nearly killed. Eventually, he meets with her again and she shows him a fake vid about the \\"Albert Bridge\\" incident where his father faked his death. she tells him that Mrs. Jones, the leader of MI6, gave the order to kill John rider, Alex's dad. This, however, is a lie. althroughout the book this \\"network of lies\\" gets more and more complex until the end, when \\"everything\\" is finally explained to him. During all this, Scorpia has been working on a huge satelite called invisible sword to kill thousands of children. Eventually, Alex saves the day (as usual) BUT, at the end for an evil revenge, Scorpia sends out a sniper to shoot Alex. (...) This, suprisingly, is only about 50% of the book, its too complex to completely summarize in a review. This is the best book ever, buy it, rent it, whatever, but ya gotta read it!     p.s. Im sorry if this is a little confusing
B000000993|5.0|The first time I ever heard of these guys, I heard the song \\"Sober\\" from my friends car, he was listening to there CD.  So I asked him if I can borrow it cause these guys seemed pretty talented.  after listening to the first few tracks I IMMEDIATLEY ran to the computer and just burned this to another CD....Undertow is with out a doublt one of the best rock album I've ever heard in my life..  The music is just Top Notch and The vocalists lyrics are phenomenal(those lyrics to Prison sex really did disturb me though).  This is my first Tool CD and I simply love it and plan on getting there other CD's in the near future but for now I'll still be listening to this classic.. <br /> <br />Some songs really made me think though, especially tracks 1 through 4 which are the best racks on the album...  Tool is an extreamly talented group that needs more credit to there music but sadly they'll never have that cause we have poser Bands on MTV shining all there light, but who needs them, TOOL RULES!!!!! <br /> <br />If you're looking for an extreamly well made Rock album, with some strong and a bit disturbing lyrics UNDERTOOL is for you, Tool is Genious and I give Undertool a <br /> <br />5 out of 5.....superb album..

That said, he's often asked me to play old Dookie songs and I believe his interest goes way beyond the profanities.  Perhaps this is the only true debit in a perfect album. The obsenities do seem to be forced and unnessary to the LP.  That said, when was the last time a group on the downward side of their career produced something as profoud and true to themselves as this?  It is true to punk ( my recent purchase of superchuck \\"kitty\\" only reminded me of GD) commentary on the current situation and an ode to the theme albums of the 60/70 makes this a worthwhile consideration.  Any album that requires thought as to what its talking about is a welcome addition to the new 'must have' sets of today.  The fact that its easy to listen to on the first try is not a handicap but a plus.  This is not a guilty pleasure, but the real thing.  Consider the work that went into the lyrics, music and risk of reputation.  That alone impresses me - as one who understands what a hard days work is all about.  Groups like Green Day and BNL get a moment in the sun and then they somehow slip back into the musical subsconscience.  No reason to. Get those albums out and relisten to them - they combine the truth with joy and a life worth living.   Having returned from Iraq and about to be released from my reserve duties, I am so glad that for at least one group, the ball has not been dropped. Lets just hope this sets the bar for whats next to come.  Thank you Green Day.
B00006JJ51|5.0|Straight Outta Compton is a classic hit, Fu** the popo was a great one, Straight Outta Compton (song) was good,and 8 ball was good.  Eazy-E was a great rapper and i'm sure many people miss his Kick ass Rhymes.  Ice Cube on the other hand is in movies?  ARE WE THERE YET? HELL NO WE AINT ANYWHERE! Why did yah do it ICE CUBE? Well back onto the album Express Yourself was a Good song, and so was Dopeman. The Dopeman song was all right I'll give it a 9.0.  Well if you liked STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON get NIGGAZ FOR LIFE.  ( N.W.A's 2nd album.) Although Cube aint in the 2nd N.W.A still rocks with Dre, Eazy-E, and yeller Boy.  HOLLA!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I SAW BOTH LIVE PERFORMANCES AND THIS MOVIE THE ONLY THING IS THAT YOU CAN BRING IT HOME AND I ENJOYED THEM BOTH WELL THERE IS NOTHING LIKE LIVE ACTING BUT THIS WILL DO UNTILL IT COMES BACK TO CHICAGO AND I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS MOVIE IT SHOWS A NEW TWIST TO THE SCREEN AND NOW WITH SURROUND SOUND WOW!!!

B000001EL7|4.0|The major flaw in this album is its massive overproduction.  Almost everything on here is overlaid with too much polish and echo, which is not KISS's best side.  In particular, Ace Frehley's \\"Rocket Ride\\" is a great song, but it should be left to itself, without so much \\"gloss\\" and echo.<br /><br />That said, most of the songs on here ROCK-- or would if they were stripped down.  Even the (slightly) hokey cover track, \\"Then She Kissed Me\\" has its merits-- the band is tight and Paul's vocals fit it perfectly (but I wonder-- did Gene put this track here to impress Diana Ross, who he was dating at the time?).<br /><br />Pick hit here would not be the title track, but rather \\"Tomorrow and Tonight\\", with its anthemic chorus that sounds so great live (as it does on Alive II).<br /><br />Simply, Love Gun as a whole is really good, but to get ton the best stuff you'd have to dig a little.
B000002J03|1.0|One of the most unoriginal groups in rock history (see review titled \\"The Greatest Cover Band of All Time\\" for proof, although I would replace the word \\"cover\\" with \\"rip-off\\")  Zeppelin deflates to a flapjack when compared to its '60s counterpart, The Yardbirds. That band was a wonder. Why settle for this cheese when you can hear the real thing? Plus Robert Plant's singing is excruciatingly shrill. No thanks.
B00004TDTO|5.0|30 years later it is difficult to write words to conjure up in the minds of a \\"Jaws\\" novice the effect that this film had on American and world cinema back in 1975.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg was essentially unknown when Peter Benchley's shark book rocketed up the bestseller lists.  CGI wouldn't be invented for 2 decades.  John Williams had not yet written the musical score to Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and dozens of other instantly recognizable melodies.<br /><br />Jaws hit America in a way that wouldn't be equalled until a few years later - when Spielberg did it again with \\"Raiders\\" and \\"E.T.\\"<br /><br />I envy the person watching \\"Jaws\\" for the first time.  It's a thrill-ride of the highest possible magnitude.  Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw bring their vivid characters to life - the police chief who moved to the small beach community to escape the excitement of New York, the geeky scientist shark-expert and the salty old fisherman.<br /><br />Are you tired of thrillers where 2-dimensional characters engage in inane dialogue and behavior before being summarily killed? In Jaws we have characters that we come to know and care for - then send them into the mouth of the beast.  The results are edge of your seat, white knuckle tension.<br /><br />All of these principles made other fine movies - but there has NEVER been another \\"big bad fish\\" story as thrilling as \\"Jaws\\".
0792846443|4.0|This is a very good film based on the story by Stephen King. Kathy Bates is very convincing as the psychotic nurse who's loneliness and isolation and 'misery' draws her into a deep obsession with a fictional character penned by a discontented pulp fiction writer. <br /> <br />James Caan excels in the role of Paul Sheldon, an author who is sick and tired of writing shallow romantic novels based on shallow characters and wants to do something meaningful for once. When his car is involved in a winter crash he is rescued by Annie Wilkes, a lonely ex--nurse who brings him to her home. Annie wilkes is played superbly by Kathy Bates, you could really believe Bates is psychotic in real life after viewing this movie.  Soon Sheldon realises the terrifying truth, Bates is psychotic and obsessed with the old pulp fiction novels he has just given up (he thought) forever.  <br /> <br />When she discovers how he has killed off her favourite character she flies into a rage and Sheldon quickly learns the scary truth, she has no plans of alerting the authorities as to his whereabouts. He must now play a dangerous game, he must balance finding a way of escape with avoiding her psychotic rage.  <br /> <br />This is a very worthy film version of what was an excellent novel (perhaps King's best), because most of the film is restricted to a single location and uses a tiny number of characters, very strong acting performances were essential in order for it to work. These were indeed supplied (Bates in particular over-achieves in her role here) in the film. At times we even feel a little pity and sympathy for the deranged Bates, even when we dont we need not expect cardboard villainy, she is a complex monster.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Alien and Aliens are two of the most thrilling action films ever made, and Aliens serves as one of a SMALL number of films in which a sequel comes close to the success of the original.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is joined by Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and Michael Biehn, and instead of a single alien threatening a space ship, we have an entire herd of aliens who have wiped out a group of space colonists before a group of gung-ho space Marines are sent to kick alien backside - with Ms. Weaver's Ellen Ripley along as technical advisor.<br /><br />James Cameron directed, and he duplicates the tension created by Ridley Scott in the original while multiplying the action ten-fold.  Where Alien takes an hour or so to introduce the cast and the menace of the creature, Aliens benefits from us already knowing about the outer-space monster from the first movie.  When we learn that there are a whole BUNCH of the critters - well, my skin crawled a little.  Bill Paxton's career took off in his role as Cpl Hudson, with oft-repeated lines like \\"Game OVER, man! Game OVER!\\"  Weaver's Ripley gets to be one of the pistol-packingest women of cinematic history, but also gets to mother a young girl, played by young Carrie Henn, the sole human survivor of the human colony.<br /><br />The final 30 minutes of this movie are cutting-edge white-knuckle tension.  The hour and a half preceding it will get your heart pumping too.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I'm not a very big Nine Inch Nails fan. In my poinion, everything after \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" was pretty weak. This album, on the other hand, is effing great! It's strange that I like it so much, because it's not as industrial / electronic as Pretty Hate Machine, or any of thier other records, but something really attracts me to this album. If you're one of those really hardcore industrial types, I wouldn't suggest picking this one up, but if you liked more guitar -driven industrial... This album is for you. Damn... I still don't know why I like it so much....
B00003CXAT|3.0|Warning! There are some mild spoilers in the following review:<br /><br />My sister-in-law woke from a dream suddenly a few years ago, startling my brother awake as well.<br /><br />\\"What is it, honey\\"? My brother asked.<br />\\"I just dreamed that the ending of Jurassic Park made sense.\\"<br /><br />We all shared a good laugh when they shared that story.  An absolutely fantastic dinosaurs-gone-wild story reached the climax of the story.... and I guess no one could figure out an ending that would satisfy Hollywood Producers and make sense as well.<br /><br />Sam Neill and Laura Dern play dinosaur experts who are hired to give their impressions of Richard Attenborough's new amusement park: Jurassic Park, where dinosaur DNA extracted from fossilized pre-historic mosquitos is used to clone a forest full of very impressively real-looking dinosaurs.<br /><br />The scene where Neill and Dern first come upon a scene from millions of years ago enacted before their very eyes captures us with it's awesome dino display.  Later, we get a world-class set piece with a terrifying attack by a T. Rex on a car holding two of Sir Richard's grand-children.<br /><br />The rest of the film is pretty standard \\"oh no! let's run!\\" kind of stuff.<br /><br />The final scenes build a decent amount of tension, but rather than coming up with an intelligent, or at least believable, resolution, we instead have a 20 foot tall deux ex machina dropped right into the middle of the climax. Didn't Speilberg go to great lengths to show us that when the T. Rex was stomping along the ground shook - even from pretty far away?  Can someone please explain to me the logic that this critter could sneak into that last scene, INSIDE A BUILDING, without anyone - even the raptors - noticing?
B000002JK4|1.0|A Log Drop shall be forthcoming when listening to this CD. A \\"Big Log\\", in fact. Choose another selection, but not in the Robert Plant section, please.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Just like all their other albums, a complete masterpiece. Every song is amazing and has something special about it. All the members  have an incredible amount of talent. This is an amazing CD.<br />P.S Children of Bodom are not death metal. Morbid Angel is death metal. Children of Bodom are Heavy Metal.
B000002JR8|5.0|This Album by Pantera, \\"Far Beyond Driven\\", is easily my favourite Pantera Album. Where \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" issued in a new direction for Pantera (Although there were still some of their 'Glam'-roots evident throughout) and was a very good Album, classic for die-hard Pantera fans for obvious reasons. And \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" was very much in fact a 'New level of Confidence and Power', in which Pantera showed their more aggressive, hardcore side..with Dimebag Darrell (R.i.P) proving he was and always will be one of the most innovative, dynamic and consistent Metal guitarists of all time. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" just has a mature feel to it, an attitude that is awe-inspiring, riffs and songs that are equally as unforgettable as on their previous Albums, and really..it's the sound of a band in their Prime. <br /> <br />\\"Far Beyond Driven\\" also surprisingly gained a Grammy Nomination, and is possibly Pantera's most commercial Album. Which isn't at all a bad thing, since it would have turned alot of people's heads and introduced many to the world of Heavy Metal. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" also saw Dimebag Darrell at his most influential, with bands such as Slipknot and Lamb of God saying that they listened to this Album over and over again, inspired mostly by Dimebag's heavy-as-hell, tight riffing. <br /> <br />\\"The Great Southern Trendkill\\" which followed this truly classic Album, also was very good but seemed to lack something. It's the Album that allegedly was made with the bandmembers in separate States. Phil Anselmo at his home in New Orleans, and Dime, Vinne Paul and Rex Brown in Austin, Texas. There were reports of fueding as well, and it would eventually be the beginning of Pantera's downfall, as their next release..2000's \\"Reinventing The Steel\\" was average at best. <br /> <br />This Album is full of relentless intensity, powerhouse chugging riffage and is probably Pantera's heaviest release. Songs like \\"Becoming\\", \\"Slaughtered\\", \\"Use My Third Arm\\" and \\"5 Minutes Alone\\", in particular, are all very tight and show what aggressive Metal sounds like. \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" is a great opener, as it leans alot towards their previous release \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" but introduces the listener to a new sounding, even heavier Pantera. The two longest songs, \\"Hard Lines and Sunken Cheeks\\" (7:01) and \\"25 Years\\" (6:05), also showcase Pantera at their best with melody and being able to keep the intensity for the entire 6 or 7 minutes. The ending to \\"Hard Lines and Sunken Cheeks\\" is also a highlight on this excellent Album. <br /> <br />\\"Shedding Skin\\" reminds me of \\"This Love\\" in many ways. And \\"I'm Broken\\" is one of the loudest and almost massive-sounding songs on this CD. \\"Throes of Rejection\\" is a great song that keeps the intensity going until the very awesome final song, the cover of Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\". <br /> <br />Overall, this Album is unforgettable. Pantera, as a whole, is an unforgettable band that changed the face of 90's Heavy Metal. And Dimebag Darrell was, is, and always will be remembered for his extremely talented, jaw-droppingly awesome, heavy-as-hell riffing, that inspired pretty much every Metal band around today.
B0007TKH66|5.0|If you Love All things Star Trek , then you will love this.Absoulutly amazing, But I'm angry because they Cancelled the Show But, to Preserve Enterprise, Buy them and Never forget.!!!. Live long And Prosper!!
B000002JSN|5.0|....and all I listened to was THIS album. I was 12 going on 13 and already in my 3rd band (they all sucked) and looking for my next shot at glory when Zepp just yanked the rug out. I cannot even explain how much \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" made my nuts hurt or how much \\"Kashmir\\" made my soul soar or how much \\"Boogie With Stu\\" - well, you get the picture. I already had a copy of one of Howlin' Wolf's \\"Folkways\\" releases so I guess I was curious about the BLUES. Ok, so I was 12, but I also had all of Zepp's previous albums and more Sabbath, Neil Young, and *sigh* REO SpeeeeeedWagon than I care to admit. So, again, I was no stranger to anything vinyl, 8-track, or cassette could muster. Something about \\"Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\\" tied it all in with my Dad's Kingston Trio records and I was ruined for life. Music could be, and WAS anything. Don't tell me about overblown, over produced records.....No, Steve Perry's Journey was still on the Eastern horizon and Uriah Heep still sounded quite like System of a Down (C'Mon...listen to \\"Aerials\\" and tell me it doesn't belong on the \\"Demons and Wizards\\" album). It's all music folks and it all has impact. This one impacted the Hell outta me.
B000929AJQ|3.0|2004 saw the release of two great Industrial music releases.  Skinny Puppy's The Greater Wrong of the Right and Ministry's Houses of the Mole.  One was a huge departure from what they had previously done before.  The other was a return to the glory days of their most successful formula.  In both cases they beat out their imitator's latest release, With Teeth, by leaps and bounds.  Trent Reznor just can't compare to his biggest inspirations and his latest release is an absolute mess of corny Live Journal lyrics and generic 80's style goth that has seen a resurgence in popularity in the last few years.  While Trent mopes around moaning like a depressed teenager about his personal problems people who may have loved his angst when they were 12 have mostly grown out of it or at least I hope they have.  Skinny Puppy and Ministry are concerned with the world around us which is a hell of a lot more disturbing in this day and age than the ravings of a depressed 40 year old stuck in his own world of despair.  Or maybe not considering how absolutely pathetic that actually sounds.  I have to give props to Trent for actually trying to do something a little different with his Hand That Feeds single which is supposed to be vaguely political.  There was supposed to be a video made by GNN that was never released as far as I know.  Also, there are no songs about bacon on this one either so that's good.  At any rate go pick up a release by Skinny Puppy.  The Greater Wrong of the Right is a good start.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand by me is one of my favorite movies. It's about a group of four adolescent male friends who go out alone on a voyage to find a dead body. Not as morbid as it sounds, it's really a touching movie about the trials and tribulations of growing up. See this movie.
B000089RVX|3.0|I have finally found the band's key flaws. After listening to many other bands, the main thing that sticks out about Evanescence is Amy Lee. Amy Lee is a fantastic vocalist. Nowhere near as good as Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil or Tarja Tarunen from Nightwish, though. The other thing I noticed is how much the band sucks at played. Boring riffs, and many other problems. My dad was listening to it with me one time, and he easily tell what was coming next. He could tell that the next song would sound oh so similar. =/ <br /> <br />The slow, piano songs are the standouts. They showcase Amy's vocals highly. They also aren't polluted with the band. <br /> <br />The only reason the rating isn't lower is because of Amy's vocals. It's a shame. With a better band backing her up, they could be something great.
B00003CXA2|5.0|When I saw this in the theater in 94, I thought it was amazing! <br />It was funny, it was sad, it had everything. I think this is <br />Tom Hanks best film. He was incredible in this movie! Sally <br />Fields was also great. The story is so fantastic, and original! <br />Buy the dvd, don't rent it, you'll never forget this movie!
0385512058|1.0|As Edward von Kloberg III, a flamboyant lobbyist who did public relations for the most notorious dictators, would say, \\"Shame is for sissies.\\"  <br /> <br />This book proposes shameless use of friends and connections to get power and influence. <br /> <br />Some of the tips are plain silly while others are useful. If you eliminate the names of the rich and famous that are meant to impress us, the book could be reduced to pamphlet size. <br /> <br />Save your money. Like others have noted, the favorable reviews are probably from Ferrazzi's connections in pay-back.
0515123447|4.0|While I enjoyed the read, it killed a rainy afternoon, it grated on me to see the word \\"shrugged\\" comically overused on every page.  I was beginning to think the whole town had a major tic problem.  I liked Child's book \\"The Persuader\\" better than this effort.  I'll keep reading them.
B0007DAZW8|1.0|A review on Stylus tried to defend this album by saying it was a critique of bad music: yes, an album of bad music implicitly critiquing bad music. Pathetic. This is the somewhat inevitable endgame for Daft Punk, who had nowhere else to go but electronic abstraction. If you want to hear some good \\"bad\\" music, try the pioneers of musique concrete for starters. Daft Punk is played out.
0792844882|1.0|They broadcasted this movie in TV, and I had to watch it all the way through because it was so bad that it was actually funny. <br /> <br />The acting is pretty bad, but even worse is the dialog - which cannot be blamed on the actors. Some of the lines in this movie will make you howl with laughter, while other just will leave you in stunned silence. <br /> <br />The plot is absolutely without sense or even more important a point. The main character is not naive, she's downright stupid. The point might be ... In Showbiz, all people might not be there just to help you on your way. And in porn industry, some people might ask you sexual favors. Wow? <br /> <br />To make up for it all, the film is loaded - LOADED - with naked girls. Not just girls wearing only a little clothing, but completely naked and filmed from all angles you can imagine, and with no screening what-so-ever. Wow, that's a good way to make a movie for the masses, especially if your point is to get a message through about the dirty porn / sexual entertainment industry. Really, I'm no prude, but approximately half of this film is downright pornographic. I couldn't help notice the fact, however, that all the men are only shown halfnaked or in a very rare naked only-from-behind shot. I don't quite know why, but it struck me as slightly amusing, but it makes as good sense as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br />Seriously, this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I know people often use sentences like this to make a point about something they don't like, but literally, this IS the worst film I've ever seen. It's very rare I see a film I don't like to some degree, but this one is horrible. If you want a half-pornographic movie, go for this one, otherwise stay far, far, FAR away from it. Though it is sort of memorable because of it's exceptional lack of quality ...
B000002OZY|5.0|this album changed my life. it raised my standards for music. this was the first album that completely blew me away. everyone who is a fan of music needs to own this album. its absolutley perfect. pete townshend is genious. this ablum will change you forever. <br /> <br />if you don't give it five stars.. something is completely wrong with you.
0679882820|5.0|My boy loves this book. He has had it since he was just two months old, but he never seems to grow tired of it (he is 18 months old now). He loves the different noises, and anticipates some that he know he can do really well, like the \\"knock knock\\" sound.
B00069FLC2|5.0|At last I was able to get an excellent concert DVD featuring my all time favourite band. This DVD is a must for all instrumental music lovers. The recording is superb and if you have a high definition TV, the picture quality is a treat for your eyes. They play almost all of their hits with almost 99% originality.I will strongly recommend this DVD. Take it from me, you won't regret your purchase.
0679892478|3.0|I thought this was a Dr Seuss book but it turns out he has only done the text and the book is illustrated by somebody else. Dr Seuss illustrations seem to be really popular with my child but this book has not become one of his favourite books.
B0008ISM40|5.0|If there was any doubt as to whether or not Trent Reznor could write well without drugs or alcohol, this album erases all of it. <br /> <br />If there was any doubt that the years have worn down on Trent's talent, this album erases all of it. <br /> <br />Simply put, this album is awesome.  Not only does it show a maturity unseen in some of Trent's work, but it also proves that Trent can be different, and is great when he does so. <br /> <br />Coming out of the symphony that is The Fragile (which, if you don't have it, YOU SHOULD BUY IT!), Reznor creates a new animal, more lyrics, but not lacking in musicality.  Yet the tone is different.  Yes, the teen-angst lyrics we have come to know and love are still here, but there's a light at the end of the tunnel, some optimism. <br /> <br />Just look at the track names.  Where once there was Mr. Self-Destruct, there is now \\"Love in the World.\\"  I won't go as far as to say the songs are happy, but it might as well be.  And it's good. <br /> <br />This album... I don't have words to describe it.  It's gone straight from the store to my CD player and hasn't left. <br /> <br />What can I say... it's NIN.  He always brings in the good stuff.
0451191153|4.0|If Amazon allowed it, I'd give this book a 3.5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />This work serves as a fantastic introduction to Rand's inane philosophy - Objectivism (more about this in bit). Extremely gripping and never trite, The Fountainhead is a heady mixture of Rand's simplistic psychological and philosophical insights. The characters are, without exception, fascinating: Howard Roark - the unconventional architect who lives for and in his work, Dominique Francon - the yet more unconventional and passionate lover, Peter Keating - the seeker after all that is conventional, and hence (in Rand's mind) worthless, and (my favorite) Ellsworth Toohey - the Evil, brilliant, and power-hungry schemer. These (and other) well-etched characters, paradigms of what they stand for, become Rand's vehicles for expressing her take on the nature of the ideal man, the purpose and summum bonum of life, and other such important things that Rand seems singularly unqualified to expound on. Her story-telling skills and style of writing are undoubtedly distinguished; however, philosophy is not Ms.Rand's forte. In any case, this book was an interesting, thought-provoking read, even if one perusal of it was adequate for me to become all-round mocker of Objectivism.  <br /> <br />Now to the philosophy behind this work. Ms.Rand seems to deify rationality without offering a reasonable explanation. Why are individuality and rationality the greatest and most glorious things? Ms.Rand says so; perhaps it \\"feels right\\" to her. Why, and based on what proof or rigor, does no god exist (Objectivism is an atheistic philosophy)? Ms.Rand says so; perhaps she conducted all kinds of scientific experiments and came up with the definitive answer to this quintessential philosophical problem. Just like in the case of her denunciation of homosexuality: \\"Because it involves psychological flaws, corruptions, errors, or unfortunate premises, but there is a psychological immorality at the root of homosexuality. Therefore I regard it as immoral... Morally it is immoral, and more than that, if you want my really sincere opinion, it is disgusting.\\" Such sophistication of reasoning and opinion would do George Bush proud. To cut this potentially loong tirade short, I have no respect for Ayn Rand's pseudo-rational philosophy. While I like a few ideas here and there - her support of Capitalism and the individual's rights -, on the whole, I think it's a wannabe rational but actually shallow philosophy that, from the viewpoint of rational content, might as well be consigned to flames.
B000063DHL|5.0|Iron Maiden have a plenty good material in their past but \\"somewhere\\" is their peak. This CD is still good as on very first day. It is still musicaly above any other releases.

B0007CNXUK|5.0|This film is a true gem. It is a slow and dramatic account of the adult life of James Barrie. It is very sad, beautiful, and shines as one of the best productions of 2004.  <br />It is not a chick flick. It is very neutral, and can be enjoyed immensly by the male and female audience.  <br />See this, you will be impressed.
B00005QIPH|5.0|is this it is one of best recent rock album along with the albums from jet and the darkness which are certainly anydays better than the awful nu metal albums which are being released.my rating five stars.
B00005JNRB|5.0|I had seen national treasure, and was not about to be mislead by the critics again. This movie was awesome, \\"hear that LEONARD?\\" It had a great story, great acting, great special effects. It also had a love story, humor, and non stop, in you face action.  <br /> <br />Two Thumbs, all the way up.
B000001ESJ|5.0|farewell to kings is one of the greatest rush albums after 2112 and contains my favourite rush songs like xanadu,cygnus x1 and closer to the heart.hugely recommended.five stars.
B00005JLZN|4.0|I only watched this movie once, a week after I saw \\"Enron: the Smartest Guys in the Room,\\" which also featured brilliant Texas business moves like *Death Star* kicking $30 billion of economic crap out of the economy of the state of California so energy traders would have some reason to show a profit on their balance sheet.  The appeal of this movie is far more intellectual than the Enron crap shoot, but it is still a political rant aimed at whoever is faking great results in death penalty cases where the evidence is so full of obvious gaps that anyone's attorneys are likely to be considered incompetent.<br /><br />The death penalty imposed on Socrates does not get much airtime in modern American movies, but this film has a drunken rant that highlights one of the major motivations of intellectual activity against the machinery of death being imposed by large organizations which have more interest in framing someone than in promoting an understanding of weird psychological motivations.  Suicide is such an obvious solution for so many political situations that having a college professor frame himself as a form of suicide in which the inmate actually has some interest in controlling the distribution of $500,000 due and payable at the time of his own execution, having cash in an amount exceeding $10,000 not being a crime of major proportions compared to the rest of the plot of this movie, that people who find philosophy interesting ought to compare this movie to some old song, like \\"Ninety Miles an Hour Down a Dead End Street.\\"

B00008H2LB|3.0|I like Linkin Park, but I know it's not a great band. <br /> <br />Their lyrics are made for teenagers, it always talks about depression, the need to be alone and so one. <br />The songs are all the same, and it's rude for our ears. <br /> <br />I put three stars because there are good songs like \\"Easier to run\\" and \\"Hit the floor\\".

B000002AP1|4.0|NOTE- First things first: This review is of the \\"remixed\\" version of Raw Power. I read other reviews and they complained about how Columbia and Iggy Pop trashed \\"Raw Power\\" by remixing it. I have never heard the original version and may be unable to hear the original. It's still a great album. I will do this as fair as I can and if I hear the original version somehow, then I will review it. Now on with the review. <br /> <br />Right after \\"Fun House\\" was released, bassist Dave Alexander quit in 1972 before dying of an alcohol overdose/pneumonia in 1975. As a result, the sound of the Stooges became weird yet good, with former guitarist Ron Asheton doing bass with new guy James Williamson doing guitar. After not getting that impossible commercial success, the Stooges went on. This time, popular singer David Bowie, who was a fan of the Stooges, decided to produce the next album and the Stooges went to London to record. Instead of the next album being on Elektra, \\"Raw Power\\" turned out to be on Columbia as a result. It was a commercial failure and the Stooges broke up shortly, due to lack of success and drug trouble among members. Nevertheless, \\"Raw Power\\" was a good album. <br /> <br />25 years after RP was released, Iggy Pop and Columbia remixed the album, giving it the \\"New Coke\\" treatment (not releasing the original version in place of the new one), and it was a subject of controversy. I still liked the album. <br /> <br />Search & Destroy- A song about the killer instinct in everyone. I AM A WORLD'S FORGOTTEN BOY!!!!! <br /> <br />Gimme Danger- A  slow song (about love) where Iggy sings in a slurry voice, a-la Jim Morrison. <br /> <br />Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell (AKA Hard To Beat)- Another song about love. This time, Iggy screams the lyrics (the voice reminds me of The Wicked Witch of The West).  <br /> <br />Penetration- A weird song where some lyrics are done in drug-induced gibberish. Iggy repeats \\"Penetraaaaaaaaaaaatiiiooooooon\\" and makes weird noises.That's why the song is good.  <br /> <br />Raw Power- A song with a melody that's a mix of \\"Search & Destroy\\" and \\"Pretty Face\\" and lyrics that resemble 50's-era rock-and-roll.  <br /> <br />I Need Somebody- A slow, bluesy song about desperation.  <br /> <br />Shake Appeal- Another song, this time done in the old-fashioned \\"Fun House\\" manner (repeating lyrics over and over again, same old guitar riffs, very good in the end).  <br /> <br />Death Trip- The Grand Finale. A song where Iggy tries to get his girl to go places with him and \\"go down in history\\".  <br /> <br />In conclusion, \\"Raw Power\\" is a very different album from the first two albums. If you listen to \\"Fun House\\" and \\"Raw Power\\" back-to-back, you will notice a complete difference between the two (in RP, lyrics are done properly instead of the \\"Fun House\\" way of repeating lyrics over and over again). Also, production is over-the-top in RP, compared to the sludgy production of FH. The original version seemed to not be as \\"raw\\" as FH, and even remixed, there's still a difference. Nevertheless, while \\"Raw Power\\" is a bit of a misleading name, it's still a very good album. <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />  <br />
B00004BZ0N|5.0|london calling was one of the greatest punk rock albums ever and is hugely recommended along with their self titled album containing the classic MARRAKESH EXPRESS.hugely recommended.five stars.
B000929AJQ|5.0|for not putting out the same album again.  This is great in its own right.  People are pi*sed that this isn't as angry or downbeat as \\"Downward Spiral\\".  Well, no S*it.  I was HIGHLY critical of this album, disliking more than a couple parts of the Fragile, and I am not finding any reasons to dislike it.  Even the poppy songs that are going to be played on the radio (Only, Every Day is exactly the same) are great (and will no doubt be highly edited when they do go on the air).  I dont understand peoples gripes about the \\"poppyness\\" of this album.  Listen to all of Pretty Hate Machine, Wish, Closer, Into the Void, Starf*ckers Inc, Where Is Everybody, etc...that all has a pop influence people.  Well, give this album a few honest listens for yourself and then give it a fair, honest review.

B000002L9S|5.0|I got the remastered one but I wish they would put her name on the album cover. Why didn't they?????? Anyway I knew I had to get this album because I love hearing Papa Don't Preach, Live Don't Tell, Open Your Heart, and La Isla Bonita.<br /><br />1) Papa Don't Preach- Who doesn't love this song???? The song is either about abortion or her lover.<br /><br />2) Open Your Heart- A second favorite.<br /><br />3) White Heat- I really love this song especially the beats.<br /><br />4) Live Don't Tell- This song makes me cry so hard. I love this song!!!<br /><br />5) Where's The Party- I first heard this song on the radio. It's a fun song to listen to.<br /><br />6) True Blue- Just like Jimmy Jimmy, I'm hearing influences from the 50s. Even the video looks like it. I like this song. It's cute.<br /><br />7)La Isla Bonita- This song is very beautiful and so is the video. It talks about her visit to San Pedro, Belize.<br /><br />8) Jimmy Jimmy- This song has like this 50's feel to it like some of the songs in the 80s do.<br /><br />9. Love Makes the World Goes Around- Great song for when you're having a fiesta. Kinda sound like some Carribean music.<br /><br />The remixes- Nicely well done.

B000002LGQ|5.0|I got this album 6 years ago. I love this album! It shows that Madonna has mature and even her music sounds different in this album. The album gives us a look on Madonna's personal side for the first time and also the first time that we don't see Madonna's face on the album cover.<br /><br />1. Like a Prayer- I love this song.  5/5<br /><br />2. Express Yourself- this song is THE BEST! But I wish it was like the video mix. The video mix is better. 5/5<br /><br />3. Love Song- fun to listen to and I really like the beats. I really do. 5/5<br /><br />4. Till Death Do Us Part-  the song mentions about an abusive wife. Could this be about Sean and Madonna? 5/5<br /><br />5. Promise to Try- A[...] song is so sad. 5/5<br /><br />6. Cherish- I love this song....I listen to it when I'm in a good mood. 5/5<br /><br />7. Dear Jessie- This song is awkward because this is not like her to write a song about pink elephants and lemonade. But's it's really fun to listen to. 5/5<br /><br />8. Oh Father- OMG! I love this song. It's so sad and so is the video. 5/5<br /><br />9. Keep It Together-cool song. 5/5<br /><br />10. Spanish Eyes-This song is very romantic and so are the beats.  5/5<br /><br />11. Act of Contrition-It's really weird to listen to this but funny at the same time. I had no idea that it's really Like A Prayer playing backwards. 5/5<br /><br />Overall, I give this album 10/10.

B0008ISM40|5.0|It's hard to believe that in the 16+ years Trent Reznor (collectively known as Nine Inch Nails) has been around, he/they have only put out four full length albums. This, being the fourth one, and the first of the new millennium, is yet another outstanding, memorable addition to the collection (which, if you are a die-hard fan, includes more remix compilations than actual albums). At a mere 13 tracks long, \\"With Teeth\\" is Trent pulling out his most refined and streamlined work since 1989's \\"Pretty Hate Machine.\\" Out of his previous work, \\"P.H.M.\\" is the best one to compare this new album to. It's not as spacey and ambitious as the conceptual albums \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and the two-disc \\"The Fragile.\\" All 13 songs deliver what we love about Nine Inch Nails, all in one tight package. I've heard the term \\"accessible\\" being thrown around by people attempting to describe this album, and while that description isn't too far off, make no mistake: This is still Trent Reznor, the forever tormented soul who made a career writing industrial/metal songs about loss of loved ones, inescapable drug addiction and weird sex. The most \\"accessible\\" this album gets is on the more uptempo, rockier tracks like \\"Getting Smaller\\" and the addictive first single \\"Bite The Hand That Feeds.\\" Likewise, \\"Only\\" and \\"Sunspots\\" are pop songs, filtered through Trent's warped artistic view. The true standout, \\"Right Where It Belongs,\\" closes out the disc in a very humble and touching manner, not unlike \\"Hurt\\" did for 1994's \\"Downward Spiral.\\" All things considered, this is the perfect comeback for NIN, and couldn't come at a better time. If you are expecting new ground to be broken however, prepare for disappointment. This album is to reaffirm your love for the works of Mr. Reznor.

0767817478|4.0|When this movie first came out in theaters I hated it. In fact, because of this movie and Contact with Jodie Foster I stopped going to the movie theater for almost 4 years. I found the DVD for $5 and bought it for my son since he is a huge Godzilla fan. If you have kids, you know that you have to watch a movie over and over. After watching the DVD for the third or fourth time, I realized that this is a pretty good movie. The best way to enjoy this movie is to forget everything you know about Godzilla and just watch it as a giant monster movie. In fact, besides the name, it has nothing in common with the other Godzilla movies. There is only one monster, Godzilla, and he (or she) is fighting the bumbling army. The special effects are good. If you can get over the plot holes, poor character development, illogical storyline, horrible ending, butchering of the essence of Godzilla and complete misunderstanding of the moral lessons that we are suppose to learn from Godzilla, you can enjoy the movie. In other words, I like the movie because it keeps my kids quiet for two hours.

B000007ODL|5.0|In my 45+ years of collecting and listening to popular music, J.J. Cale stands out as being truly unique. How so? <br /> <br />The easiest way to explain this is to talk about my iPod song list of some 1700 selections. What I've done to create this song list is to choose only my favorite tracks on any particular album to be ripped onto the iPod. <br /> <br />Some albums are represented by one selection; others two or three. And for the very select few, perhaps the whole album gets included in my 'pod. <br /> <br />J.J. Cale is the prime example of this kind of personal special and favorite musician. Why? Well, as we all know, there is no accounting for taste. Each of us has our own musical preferences, tastes, and favorite genre. <br /> <br />For me it is blues based music, whether it be the hard blues rock of Jimi Hendrix, the early Elvis of the \\"Sun Sessions,\\" or the mellow country blues of J.J. Cale, I love the blues. <br /> <br />Here is what I experience with J.J.: deeply felt, genuine, and totally organic blues expressions. The instrumentation is always tight, together, and in the groove. Each musician, each track within a song, each overdub blends perfectly with the whole. <br /> <br />And, J.J.'s lyrics, melodies, vocals, and guitar work are the essential and masterly glue that makes it all happen. What this means, for me, is that his music has a timeless quality. It doesn't get out of date, it doesn't get \\"old,\\" and I don't get tired of listening to it. <br /> <br />This is why when I ripped a J.J. album onto my iPod, I almost always did the WHOLE album. I have 123 J.J. cuts on the 'Pod, but I won't buy \\"The Very Best of J.J. Cale.\\" I have no need to because I already have all these cuts. <br /> <br />However, if I could only own one J.J. album, it would be the double set \\"Anyway the Wind Blows.\\" Without checking it cut by cut, I'm fairly certain \\"Blows\\" will have all the best of \\"The Very Best.\\" But, with \\"Blows\\" you get at least twice as much J.J. <br /><br />This is a very good thing, but if aren't convinced by my opinion, at least try out \\"The Very Best of J.J. Cale.\\" If you're able to appreciate good music in any genre, you just gotta dig J.J.

B00000DFSK|4.0|This is a good sampler of U2's earlier work.  It is not complete enough to satisfy a hard core fan, but it probably doesn't need to do so.  Those fans probably already own several of the earlier albums.<br /><br />This really should have probably been a two disk compilation.  At least two of the great songs were shortened on this version:  'New Year's Day' and 'Where the Streets Have No Name'.  There are also some songs that were not included at all.  In fact, there were no cuts from 'October' which was an excellent album.<br /><br />This isn't a bad start to a U2 collection.  However, if you like them, you will undoubtedly want more.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|I was lent a copy of Team America: World Police for the weekend, and just finished watching it. It's a marionette movie, which I've never seen before, and it's from the occasionally funny creators of South Park.<br /><br />Move premise: Team America is a not-so-super-secret team of do-gooders, acting to thwart terrorism around the globe. In the opening sequence, a member of the team is killed in an operation in Paris, and a new member is recruited, an actor in a popular Broadway show. The terrorists' plans are still in play, and the team must defeat the terrorists, and their evil mastermind, and save the world.<br /><br />At heart, this movie is supposed to be a satire. The movie's creators do delight in skewering everyone and everything in sight: the left and right wings, American blindness to how their actions are viewed by those abroad, and several well-known film actors. The efforts do fall short of satire, however; satire should carry that feeling of...subversiveness, and instead you just get the sense that the characters are blundering through life, Clouseau-fashion.<br /><br />The movie is funny at times, though be forewarned as the humour is crude and bawdy and did I mention crude? Puppet sex had me laughing out loud! Don't be showing this movie to kids; there's a reason it's rated \\"R\\". There's no true intellectual humour here, as one would hope with a satire (and one would get with a satire such as Dr. Strangelove).<br /><br />I should mention that the opening sequence rubbed me the wrong way a little bit, especially after having read Is Paris Burning? recently. The City of Lights deserves to be treated with more care, and certainly should be portrayed more accurately.<br /><br />This would be one of those \\"see on an airplane\\" movies, but the odds of this happening are pretty much nil.
B00003CX9E|5.0|\\"Citizen Kane\\" is probably the most discussed, most written-about movie ever made, as the more than 500 reviews in this column will attest.  Where you stand on its significance and its greatness is pretty much a matter of when you were born.  Most younger viewers (those under 40) tend to be unimpressed and wonder what all the fuss is about; while older viewers remember how there had been nothing quite like it in the history of the movies before it was made and for a good quarter of a century afterwards. <br />This is because the \\"film-school\\" generation of Hollywood directors, Scorcese, Lukas, Coppola, Spielberg, and De Palma among them, all grew up studying \\"Citizen Kane\\" to the point where every frame was memorized and incorporated so many of its innovations into their cinematic vocabulary that we now take them for granted.  Therefore, it's important to point out just what was so new and daring about \\"Citizen Kane\\" in 1941 and for the next 25 years or so. <br />First of all, as Welles would freely admit, \\"Citizen Kane\\" was a collaborative venture.  RKO gave Welles a crew composed of some of the best technicians in Hollywood, and Welles encouraged them to push the envelope and experiment.  A large part of Welles' genius in making \\"Citizen Kane\\" was his open-mindedness, his acknowledgement of his \\"babe in the woods\\" status as filmmaker, and his willingness (later insistence) on exploring new techniques or new ways to use existing techniques.  Welles' indebtedness to previous masters like Lang, Murnau and Eisenstein is pretty obvious.  Yet no one can deny that the cinematic techniques he borrowed from those masters he took to a degree and used to an effect undreamt of in their work. <br />The unsung hero in the making of \\"Citizen Kane\\" is, of course, cinematographer Gregg Toland.  Toland's use of wide-angle lenses and deep-focus photography became the most salient element of Welles' visual style.  But Orson understood possibilities implicit in that deep-focus photography that Toland had not imagined.  By mounting shots with a distint foreground, main focus and background in deep-focus, Welles managed to simulate three dimensions in a two-dimensional image.  Nobody, not even Toland had done that before, yet it is the hallmark of Welles' visual style, not only in \\"Citizen Kane,\\" but in all his subsequent work as well.  It would not be until Stanley Kubrick came along that somebody would explore and use the possibilities of cinemascope as effectively as Welles exploits deep-focus in \\"Citizen Kane.\\" <br />The quick-cut editing, whereby a second scene begins with the logical reposte of something in the current scene has become such a standard feature of worldwide cinema that nobody even notices it anymore.  But when Welles ended one scene in \\"Citizen Kane\\" with Mr. Thatcher saying:\\"Merry Christmas, Charles,\\" and began the next with him saying \\"...And a Happy New Year!\\" without a pause, it had never been done before.  Likewise, the fade-in, fade-out sequences where one character narrates a particular scene on one side of the screen and fades out, while the scene fades in on the other side of the screen until it dominates the whole screen is a technique common in movies today, but it began with \\"Citizen Kane.\\" <br />One of the signature features of Welles' visual style, begun with \\"Citizen Kane\\" is beginning the movie with a \\"processional\\" scene.  In \\"Othello,\\" for example, the movie begins with a literal funeral procession.  Then there is that famous, long, uninterrupted tracking shot that begins \\"Touch of Evil.\\"  The effect is to put the viewer immediately and specifically in the world of the story and its characters.  It's a technique Welles did in spades in the opening of \\"Citizen Kane,\\" as the camera (and therefore, the audience) processes across the grounds of Xanadu, from the gate, past the docks of the artificial lake, past the private zoo, the staturary, up the hill to the mansion and finally into Kane's bedroom. <br />Although no other director in history packed as much visual information into each and every frame of his movies (and all of that detail is significant!) as did Orson Welles, he could be an astonishing minimalist when he chose to be.  The most brilliant use of sound in \\"Citizen Kane\\" is when Kane speaks his last word, \\"Rosebud\\" while holding a paper-weight depicting a winter scene. <br />Then Kane loses his grip (a symbollic detail), drops the globe to the floor, where it shatters, while we hear NOTHING.  Then he dies.  The symbolism of the pre-figuring contained in this scene determines the course of the entire movie and encapsulates the humanity at its heart.  \\"What does it profit a man should he gain the whole world while losing his soul?\\"
B0002X314C|4.0|You may not recognize the name John Legend, but there is a good chance that you have heard his voice or heard him play piano on songs by Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, and Kanye West. West has since signed Legend to be the flagship to his record label and produced his solo debut, Get Lifted. One thing that has ruined R&B in recent years is the major rap influence (are you taking note Mariah?). And even though West's influence can be heard throughout the album, Get Lifted isn't bogged down in an exaggerated bass line or drum loops and Legend's piano take center stage on most songs much like Alicia Keys, the only other R&B singer today that worth listening to today. Even raps by West and Snoop Dogg don't overshadow Legend. <br /> <br />The running theme on Get Lifted is relationships to the point where it almost a concept album. Within those relationships, cheating comes up allot. The theme starts off with the kiss-off, Used to Love U, a song where Legend dumps a materialistic girlfriend. The song spawns the greatest lyric from the album, \\"Maybe I should rob somebody so we could live like Whitney and Bobby.\\" Alright is where Legend tries to get on the relationship horse again. And it's alright is the girl already has a boyfriend. He continues to pursue the girl with She Don't Have to Know again trying to a girl to cheat, explaining that he's doing the some thing to his current significant other. <br /> <br />The next four songs Number One featuring Kanye West, I Can Change featuring Snoop Dogg, Ordinary People, and Stay with You, Legend try to repent for his past transgressions. Number One starts off, \\"Now you can't say I don't love you just because I cheat on you.\\" Now if only I can find a woman that will buy that kind of line. The interesting part of I Can Change is how believable Legend is but you almost have to chuckle when Snoop tries to convince his girl. This is highlighted by the lines, \\"You make me want to lay down my pimpin' and step my love game up. I can make your zoom zoom go boom boom.\\" There is nothing more romantic than quoting old Wreckx-N-Effect songs. Things get slowed down with Ordinary People where Legend does his best Donnie Hathaway impression. This song is also the highlight of the album where it's just Legend and his piano on the song. <br /> <br />The last part the album seems to be more influenced by his family. It Don't Have to Change featuring the Stephens Family (John's original last name is Stephens) seems like a more soulful version of Kanye West's Family Business. Overall, Get Lifted is a solid debut and a must have for any true fan of soul music.
B000002OTL|5.0|Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that, if you like it (or love it, as many people do), it's almost essential to have the soundtrack. The songs in the movie are integral to the movie's mood, and this soundtrack preserves that atmosphere. Alot has been said of the surf music in the film, but most of the soundtrack is composed of several different genres. This includes R&B, country, even a little rock and roll.  <br /> <br />The album kicks off with, as you could expect, the \\"theme\\" of Pulp Fiction- \\"Miserlou.\\" \\"Jungle Boogie\\" is a song we've all heard before, and could be called the other theme, since this song is also present in the beginning of the movie and the trailers. Another notable track is \\"You Never Can Tell\\" (from the infamous Jack Rabbit Slim's dance scene). This is followed by another excellent track.. \\"Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon\\"... a Neil Diamond cover from Urge Overkill. The CD ends with the excellent surf song used for the end credits... \\"Surf Rider.\\" Well actually, it ends in style with Jules reciting Ezekiel 25:17, and then Jules and Vincent blasting you away. So good luck with that. <br /> <br />I recommend seeing the movie before purchasing the soundtrack.. it enhances the experience of listening to this CD by leaps and bounds.
B00004RFFS|5.0|First, let me say that I'm NOT a fan of Anne Rice's overly-romanticized, melancholy vampires.  However, I really enjoyed this movie!  Tom Cruise was very impressive as Lestat, along with Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst giving passionate performances.  For those who aren't familiar with the story, here's an extremely abridged version.   <br />A landowner in the 1700's, (Pitt), wife dies.  He's understandably sad, even has a death wish.  A vampire, Lestat, (Cruise), takes him up on his wish and makes him immortal.  The story is what takes place over the next 200 years in their undead existence, uncluding a trip to Paris' underworld, the creation of a child-vampire, (Kirsten Dunst), and the never ending search for \\"what's it all mean?\\"  As a wraparound piece, the vampire Louis, (Pitt), is being interviewed by a reporter in modern day San Fransisco, hence the title. <br />It's a very engaging story, told from the vampire's point of view, kind of an autobiography.   <br />I remember when the movie was first released Oprah Winfrey did a studio audience screening, and her guest for the day was Tom Cruise.  I remember audience members asking Cruise questions like, \\"How could you possibly play such an evil character?\\"  <br />Tom kept replying, \\"It's only a movie, and only a fictional character.\\"  I think it was a testament to his evolving talent and a great leap of faith on his part.  Kudos Mr. Cruise! <br />It's a great movie.  Great acting, great story, great camera work, scenery, costumes, everything!  Even if you don't like Anne Rice very much, if you like vampires, you'll like this film.
B000002L68|5.0|I would like to point out that MC Hammer's \\"Pray\\" came out several years after Prince released \\"When Doves Cry.\\"  Hammer actually borrowed Prince's beat to create his song.  Also, Prince may have been a show-off, but come on, he was a rock star.  Without the stage show he wouldn't have been nearly as exciting.

B000929AJQ|2.0|Say goodbye to experimentation, to anything new or exciting, or to something else that would leave you wanting more by the end of the album. Trent Reznor is out of ideas. Or maybe inspiration. Half the songs on With Teeth are tired retreads of previous albums, but with LESS bite. Trent has lots of reason to be angry, who doesn't? But don't take it out on the listener, Trent. That's not to say this album is terrible. Fans of Reznor are like starving people at a buffet, they'll go for just about anything. It takes you years to come out with something, Trent, I guess I just expected better.
B00009L1OB|3.0|Seven and the Ragged Tiger, Duran Duran's third proper album, remains in so many ways their most interesting. While it can be judged, 21 years later, as at best a modest musical triumph in its entirety (still, really deserving of another half-star) some of the songs are right up there with the band's best work, and there is no better insight into lyricist Simon LeBon's fascinating inner life. The enigmatic title is a multi-faceted reference to the two Berrow brothers who guided the quintet (2 + 5 = 7) early on, the seven 'chakras' (or wheels, in Sanskrit) of kundalini yoga and, more obviously, disillusion, dissolution and the rapidly diminishing allure of fame (having 'grabbed the tiger's tail'). This ambitious effort was to have a huge influence upon my own metaphysical development; when I realized just how much information was being conveyed in the \\"Union Of The Snake\\" video, I sent LeBon my college newspaper review of it and the album by way of his mother, who replied (in a letter I still have) that Simon had not contested my interpretation. Essentially, it was my belief that the whole video (which I'll refrain from completely diagramming here; go back and see for yourself - one hint: the scaffolding represents his spine) depicts his kundalini experience, leading to a clarifying 'synchronicity' in the desert with all of creation - those fireworks signify not just a fever dream but the shakti, or snake, energy breaking through his seventh / crown chakra; the recurring images of fire and (r)evolution in \\"New Moon On Monday\\" add fuel to that perception of rebirth, even a sort of cleansing or purification, and transcendence  (yes, the fundamentalist Christian concept of being \\"born again\\" or \\"saved\\" is identical to it; \\"The Seventh Stranger\\" alludes to the associated phenomenon of 'speaking in tongues' - \\"some say the seventh sounds a little bit stranger\\" - that interval where the participant loses his or her identity, and a very apt metaphor for the common effect that success has on many people). Nor is there any denying that Duran was to be baptized under fire and two members burned off / out as a consequence, quickly experiencing decidedly Beatlemaniacal adoration on the subsequent tour. Ironically, ...Tiger is the Fab Five's most unabashedly Beatlesque longplayer [for a more obscure example, the slowly descending brassy synth figure that colors \\"(I'm Looking For) Cracks In The Pavement\\" is today somewhat evocative of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" for me]. As one reviewer on this site previously suggested, \\"Is There Something I Should Know?\\", with Liverpudlian touches all over it and the earliest product of sessions for what would become ...Tiger, fits in seamlessly with this collection of songs. And there's indeed no question that the inclusion of it and the superb \\"Secret Oktober\\" would've strengthened this CD but, of course, the former instead replaced \\"To The Shore\\" on the re-release of Duran's debut, strictly as a stop-gap measure to maintain Rio-derived momentum and almost landing DD their first US No. 1 in the process before \\"The Reflex\\" went positively ballistic ten months later. A very dark and deep (if not necessarily dense. even slightly spare) album, all in all, but one well worth exploring, despite its seeming disposable poppiness.  Incidentally, Duran Duran were not the the first, nor the last, recording act to seize upon kundalini yoga as subject matter; preceding them were Styx (with 1973's The Serpent Is Rising, their third album as well) Earth, Wind and Fire, who went to 13 with \\"Serpentine Fire\\" in 1977, and Love and Rockets, with the minor college radio hit \\"Kundalini Express\\" in 1986.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I popped it in my Mac running OSX 10.3.9 (Tiger is on it's way to my home from Amazon) and it mounted and opened in iTunes with no problem.  I just ripped it and copied it to my iPod.  It also works just fine on my older Mac with OS9.<br /><br />I will write a review later as I just picked up the DualDisc version tonight and need to give it a few listens.  Been a fan since the beginning so I'm sure I'll enjoy it.<br /><br />And if your on a Mac and have GarageBand be sure to go to the official NIN site and download the GarageBand file for The Hand that feeds and make your own re-mix (works in ver 1.0 even thought it says it needs 2.0)

B000007OY0|5.0|This film is based on a Stephen King story and stars Tim Robbins as Andy, an innocent man who is sent to prison for life. At  Shawshank Prison, the cruel warden (Bob Gunton) and guards treat the convicts like animals. Their lives are filled with misery and hopelessness.  Andy's only relief comes from his friendship with fellow inmate, Red (Morgan Freeman), an old-timer who never expects to get out. Andy gradually adjusts to life at Shawshank, working in the warden's office and helping to get a prison library. Resourceful Andy has also been secretly working for years on a wild escape plan.<br /><br />With all the prison cruelty, this is a very painful movie to watch, but it has a hopeful and heartwarming ending. Robbins and Freeman have a great chemistry and are a pleasure to watch. James Whitmore has a small but touching role as a convict who gets released after spending most of his life behind bars. Although there are many scenes that make me cringe, I do like the movie and heartily recommend it.<br /><br />Kona
B0006GAI6Y|2.0|Stanley Tucci saved this film from a 1 star rating.  He & Richard Gere's other male dance students, Miss Mitzi, the detective & his hiliarious assistant made the movie fun!!  Otherwise, it was a dud. <br /> <br />The marriage of Gere & Sarandon had no chemistry.  That the wife & stupid kid showed up & ruined his big day, stunk.   <br /> <br />Jennifer Lopez is mesmerizing to watch, beautiful as always, but they stuck her in a corner!  It was a crime and a waste of Lopez's tremendous screen presence.
0688156819|5.0|{Believe it or not}, the \\"Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy\\" is actually one of the saddest poems in this book. Even though it IS comedy, it is dark comedy about outsiders who only wish to fit in, but something tragic happens to them. They are very short poems, but worth reading.  <br /> <br />I could not put it down.
B0002858YS|4.0|<br />I bought this cd on a hunch after hearing \\"Somebody Told Me\\" driven into my skull a million times over last summer, and having liked the song but not loving it, I didn't know what to expect. What I got was one of the best debuts by a mainstream American band I have heard in a long time. This band has stardom written all over them, that's if their second LP matches up with their first. Hot Fuss is a tour de force filled with catchy pop/new wave songs which never release you from its grip. Brandon Flowers the lead singer of this Las Vegas quartet has a wonderful voice which may sound like a fake British accent but who cares this guy can sing. The best songs on this wonderful disc are \\"Mr. Brightside, Smile Like You Mean It, On Top, and Believe Me Natalie\\" and my girlfriend really likes \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" as well. Either way, anybody who likes fast paced, energetic, atmospheric music with a sense of purpose and urgency will probably love this cd, this band has tremendous potential to say the least.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Bottom line up front: This album is for the older NIN fans. You young kids pull up your pants, go buy a belt and find something else to divert yourself from the coming darkness. This album is a recommended installment in the solid series coming from Trent over the past decades <br /> <br />What many 24 hour news cycle era reviewers miss is that the artist is creating an expression. This expression is an updated anthem not a new slogan so we can renovate a marketing plan.  <br /> <br />Sure NIN has techniques that are of their own. Claiming that there is nothing new here is like saying each artist must reinvent themselves for each album. Using that logic Willie Nelson should do a techno album and Trent should do a country album. Critique of the much younger reviewers aside, what is important to me is the continuation of the message: the vocal anthem that brought us to NIN in the first place. Like Trent says in Getting Smaller, \\"I can still make a fist!\\" this album is another installment in the learn to hate series we have embraced since the 80's. You young cats need not judge the album. In fact I wish you would find your own voice and let us old fogies get into the show so we can relish the latest vocal anthem with our Nitzer Ebb T-Shirts and Skinny Puppy key chains holding our BMW keys in check This album represents a maturation of the anthem.  <br /> <br />Welcome the update to keep the old school on track. <br />
0060589272|5.0|Before that one I read \\"Alchemist\\", a great inspiring fairy-tale. Was told by some that all Coelho books are alike, though... So was not keen on reading something else by the author. Noticed \\"Eleven minutes\\" at my friend's place a while ago and now, being in a quite depressive mood, picked that one. <br /> <br />Reading it was like having a shot - you get it in one breath, you freeze for a while and only then you start wondering what it actually was... Well, what one comes away with after reading the book depends on what (if at all) you were looking for. At least, it's a great merit of the author that he provides all - an entertaining narrative and a host of philosophical underlying themes. <br /> <br />Personally, I was struck by the motif of continuous search for the limit. Considering every new, big or small, decision in her life Maria wonders if she should go a bit further and then she explores how much further, or closer to the limit, this brings her. Also, I thought, that ideas of love, possession and freedom are very interesting in the way the author puts them. Finally, the theme of spiritual sex that underlines the whole book is developed very well! Guys, this is so much more than pointing a way for this hard-coming female orgasm (as pointed at some reviews). This is about sex being a sacrament between two, being a dialog with the very inner self, being an expression of all the concerns, troubles, insults, dreams, happiness and misery - all those things that could be hardly expressed by any other words or actions but this coition. Coelho brings those issues with a great mastery: these are not the scenes themselves, but rather the way Maria sees them that powerfully conveys the message. <br /> <br />I've got some concerns about the author's style and language, though (translations issues, obviously, come into play). Language seems simplistic, yet precise. Mixture of high and low language strikes. Somehow relates to those erotic stories written by amateurs when their authors miss the basic vocabulary to describe the happening, so they start mixing pathetic and gross stuff.  But then... is not that reflection of the real life, of people being both pathetic and gross, both sophisticated and naive?  Characters (but the front ones) and setting seem poorly developed, but then.. a smart reader does not need directions and should be happy enough with the details, outlines and those descriptions which Colelho provides in abundance.  Personally, I believe that the more \\"yes...., but then\\" statements you are left with, the more controversy you found about the book the more influential the book was. \\"Eleven minutes\\" still makes me wonder... <br />
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Both the Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel released their final albums in 1970.  However, while LET IT BE documented the fragmentation of band members heading in different directions, no such tensions are evident on BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER.  The title track is a majestic tour de force and spent six weeks at No. 1 and sold over a million copies. \\"Cecelia\\" was another million-seller. But my favorite track is the melancholic \\"The Boxer.\\" And just for the sheer joy of the song, \\"Baby Driver\\" runs a close second--even though I still don't have a clue what the lyrics mean!  And they pay homage to one of their biggest influences with a rendition of the Everly Brothers' 1957 hit, \\"Bye Bye Love.\\" Simon & Garfunkel were the most successful duo of the Sixties for a reason:  Simon was a superb songwriter and they could sing the hell out of a song.  It doesn't get any better than this!  ESSENTIAL
B00005JMEW|1.0|This has got be the most disgusting film that has ever been produced in history. It's wanton disregard for the sanctity of human life warrants the same judgment as war criminals.

B00005UKE0|5.0|George Harrison had the misfortune of being a very good songwriter in a band that had two excellent songwriters.  So, after years of getting only one or two orignal songs on a Beatles' album, Harrisons's backlog of material resulted in this 2-CD (originally 3-LP) masterpiece.<br /><br />The centerpiece, of course, is the No. 1 hit \\"My Sweet Lord.\\" [Note: This was the first solo Beatle chart topper in the U.S.] \\"What Is Life\\" also made the Top 10.  But every song is a gem.  Highlights include \\"Beware of Darkness,\\" \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" and the lone non-original, Dylan's \\"If Not for You.\\"<br /><br />Harrison also surrounds himself with a stellar cast of musicians, including all of Derek & the Dominos (except Duane Allman).  Also on board are Klaus Voorman, Billy Preston, Dave Mason, Bobby Keys and Ringo Starr.<br /><br />And Harrison wasn't all peace and love; he could be political too.  Note the lyric from \\"Awaiting on You All\\":  \\"Well, the Pope owns fifty-one percent of General Motors/And the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us.\\" [Even on this 2001 re-release, they still don't include that line in the printed lyrics.  But listen to the last chorus; it's there!]<br /><br />The only real clunkers here are the loose jams.  They're interesting artifacts, but not worth repeated listens.  Taken as a whole though, this is the strongest album of Harrison's career.  ESSENTIAL
0451209338|4.0|The first book in Daniel Silva's Gabriel Allon series is a good one. As Silva's fourth book, the references to the prior two books (Mark of the Assassin and Marching Season) are few, but they are there. It was more a pleasant surprise to me after having read those already. However, it's certainly not necessary to have read those before starting this one.<br /><br />Gabriel Allon has left the Office (Israeli Intelligence) and is working as an art restorer. A job he loves. However, his former mentor beckons and convinces him to get back into the game to eliminate a Palestinian radical who played a dark role in Allon's past.<br /><br />The plot is intelligent and engaging. I find Silva's writing to be fantastic. His style is great. He keeps you guessing, and keeps those pages turning. The chapters seem to just fly by.<br /><br />My only gripe with this is that it's not as good as \\"The Mark of the Assassin.\\" However, that is not enough to deter me from heading straight into his next book in this series \\"The English Assassin.\\"<br /><br />****1/2!!!!
B0000B1OFL|5.0|This is easily my favorite movie. It has everything.

B0007TKNKG|5.0|I have to agree with everyone. This is Sylvester Stallone's best movie. I grew up watching the Rocky movies and the REambo movies but when I saw this on network television I was absolutely blown away by the fact that Stallone could really act if he were given the chance. This movie showcases some of his best acting that his earlier films didn't show. <br /> <br />Now that this movie is finally coming out on DVD I would recommend this movie to everyone out there. There is nothing out there which would delegate this movie to a certain age restriction as it ranks on my list as one of the top ten family movies. It'll move your heart and cause you to think and care for the characters in this movie. It even had one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in a long time.
0618526412|5.0|This book is set in a small, indistinct southern town, full of misfits -- people who don't feel like they quite fit in anywhere -- with different desires and dreams. A lot of what McCullers focuses on is the inability of individuals to express themselves to others. Instead, they put their energies towards self-destructive habits such as drinking, fighting, and sexual depravity.<BR> <BR>Two of the main characters are Mick Kelly and John Singer. Mick is a young tomboy who comes of age in the story. She doesn't have money for instruments or lessons, but she goes through a deeply personal attempt to find the kind of happiness and beauty she finds from musical expression. Mick, like many of the townspeople, finds beauty and intrigue in the deaf mute, John Singer. John Singer leads a quiet life, but is deeply troubled by the loss of his longtime friend Anatopolous, who is also a deaf mute. John Singer becomes a mystical figure to the townspeople, becoming a projection of each individual's personal desires. Part of his mysticism forms around the fact that he is a deaf mute, therefore communication is limited, mostly a one-way event. People pour all their wishes and dreams into their projections of him.<BR> <BR>Amazingly, Carson McCullers was only 23 when this book was published. How a person that young (well, my age, in fact) could write with such an insightful view of humanity, as well as politics, art & music is impressive. Her prose is descriptive, but at the same time spare. The narrator of the book gives a limited-omniscient view, so while you know what each character might think, you feel you only are scratching the surface of their thoughts. In many cases, what you find is that the individuals themselves don't quite understand their own motives or desires. <br />This book in many ways reminds me of Sherwood Anderson's classic novel, Winesburg, Ohio. It shares commonality in narrative style, themes of isolation, loneliness and the inability to express everything in words. The power of these books is not in what is said or the events themselves, but the things left unexplained, what we are prompted to think about as a result. I enjoyed Heart Is a Lonely Hunter very much, but try it for yourself! Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Carson McCullers, but very much on my mind since I purchased a \\"used\\" copy off Amazon is \\"The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition, an engaging, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.

This is the first of the Rocky series and in my opinion the best, the other 4 are also great but this is the one I like the most, the fight at the end is good and so is the rest of it. It is probably the best boxing movie of all time.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|Absolutely agree. Happy and wisdom statement that it constitutes the central nervous of the film. A powerful story that interweaves with impeccable edition past and present.<br />The triumph of the great loves can be seen only through the ravishing Perrault stories. In the fifties Hiroshima mon amour proved once more the expected possibility to reach the absolute realization due the love.<br />But the magnificent homage to Hemingway is all around the film. And you think in that ancient Frank Borzage's film Farewell to arms over and over. The nurse, extraordinarily played by the French Goddess Juliette Binoche, who won deservedly the academy Award will mean the weak link between the life and death when she decides to consecrate all her efforts for keeping alive to this mysterious man, seriously wounded after being attacked. The moral reconstruction is far beyond the delicate physical condition. This man is alive just to tell us his fatidic story. But the fascinating script engages us with other secondary characters as the implacable Wilhelm Dafoe who will follow to Fiennes according superior orders. Kristin Scott Thomas and Colin Firth will be the couple in disgrace who will conform the amorous triangle. The love scenes are filmed with admirable good taste and artistic rapture. There are not wasted lines in this running film of 155 min.<br />The desert is the big frame and also another invisible actor that will untie that huge sand torment that will allow the narrow and decisive contact of these two future lovers.<br />There is besides, a surreptitious homage to David Lean by double departure: A brief encounter and Lawrence of Arabia.<br />This will be one of the most reminded films in the distant future. I guess the multidimensional level and Shakespearian and Wagnerian dramatic roots  that sustain the whole work will consent it a special place in the Pantheon of the great films.<br />Joseph Fiennes is a true giant actor. How many additional proofs  do you want? After Schindler's list, we have besides Spider and The end of the affair.

B000003TAR|5.0|This album is easily one of my favorite albums of all time, and I have a diverse taste in music. I listen to anything from Pearl Jam to Megadeth to the Beatles, but Nirvana is definitely my personal favorite. The only thing that could have been better on this album is the production, but honestly, it wouldn't have made much of a difference since this is one of my favorites.  <br />  The songs are all great, especially 'Heart-shaped box', 'Rape Me', and 'All Apologies' because they are catchy (well, at least \\"Rape Me' is) and they are well thought out. 'HSB' is infact my favorite song of all time, better than 'Master of Puppets', better than 'Holy Wars...The Punishment Due', and better than 'In My Time of Dying'. Another good song is Serve the Servants', which is a poppy intro to the album and explains the high price of fame, the riff is very kick ass. I also really like 'Pennyroyal Tea' and 'Dumb', which are both different from what the album offers. 'Dumb' is more of a ballad and its hard to understand what the lyrics mean, but its very good. 'Pennyroyal Tea' is soft during the verses and heavy in the chorus, much like the usual Nirvana, also catchy. <br />  The rest of the album is good, but it doesn't stand out like these songs do, but I will make another note that 'FFWGHROS' is a very good song with great lyrics like \\"she'll come back as fire, and burn all liars, leave a blanket of ash on the ground\\". This is a very good album that only ignorant hairmetal fans will hate. <br /> <br />10/10 songs: Heart-shaped Box, Rape Me, All Apologies, Dumb, Pennyroyal Tea, Serve the Servants <br /> <br />9/10 songs: FFWHHROS, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, Very Ape, Milk It <br /> <br />8/10 songs: Scentless Apprentice <br /> <br />7/10 songs: Tourrettes

Metheny decide to pay his personal tribute to the lyric guitar under the candlelight.<br />Thanks to a very missed girl who gave me her last present, I found myself extremely and powerful amazed from the first time I listened it.

B00011F5DK|5.0|This is a wonderful game for children and adults.  I introduced it to my adolescent special education class and to their delight they were competitive with peers and adults.  This  is because it challenges visual and spatial parts of the brain.   It fits instructional objects  for sustained attention, pattern recognition and spatial discrimination.  No two games are alike.  The students love the web site (...)where they play against the computer.
B00079018K|1.0|I liked the song club foot so I bought the CD.  HUGE MISTAKE.  The CD has some sort of copywrite protection such that it cannot be played on IPOD or other MP3 players (I use an iRiver and it didn't work).  It is really annoying-you cannot make any copies even for legitimate reasons like keeping a copy in your car (and just trying to play the CD with a computer is a pain in the butt).  I think Kasabian sucks for copping out and letting RCA dictate how I should use a CD that I own.  It is like GM selling you a car and telling you that you cannot drive it in Canada!?!
B0009KA7BS|3.0|An Ok actioner based on the comic book called Hellblazer about John Constantine, played by Keanu Reeves (The Matrix Triology, Point Break) who's smoking himself to death...hell wants him and heaven wont take him but earth needs him is basically the theme for the movie and he embarks on a case of twins, both played by Rachel Weisz (Runaway Jury, Confidence) and one of them mysteriously dies but the other twin doesnt believe that she would kill herself. So, Constantine shows her what he sees...soon, Constantine learns that the Devil's son wants to get loose onto the world and in order for him to do that he needs God's blood and the vessel is the remaining twin Weisz. Not bad for what it is.....better then some of the movies that came out so far...better then Alone In The Dark. Reeves is alright though he has his moments though we can hardly hear him he talks so soft he pays up in the action sequences...its what he's good at. Weisz is pretty damn hot. Also starring Djimon Honsou (Gladiator, Deep Rising) as Poppa Midnight....good name for him...the voodoo man. Peter Stormare (Armageddon, Fargo) comes at the end playing Lucifier, decked out in all white (hey, it fits him well) Pruitt Taylor Vince (Identity, Mississippi Burning), Shea LeBouf (Holes, The Battle At Shaker Heights) is all grown up and is out of his teeny bopper faze and a surprising acting debut by Bush lead singer Gavin Rossdale who takes on the role as Balthazar. Isn't the best...I do not worship this movie to death but I liked it enough to recommend it to fans of the comic book or fans of any of the stars. Good yet not a masterpiece.

B000002KDO|5.0|With their behemoth 2nd album Paranoid going into the books as one of the essential rock records of all time, it probably was amazingly difficult to have a succesful follow-up to an album of such magnitude. However, Master of Reality, miraculously, equalls, if not surpasses, Paranoid's musical content. Sweet Leaf, the first song of the album, may be a turn-off to some fans. Personally, I feel it's the weakest song on the album. However, it's quickly followed by After Forever, a relatively upbeat song which deals with matters of religion. Although deviating from Sabbath's musical style, the music is still good in this track. Butler's bass is the most prominent on this track, and synthesizers are used. It's quite refreshing. Next, we have Embryo, a 30 second violin-ish track, which eerily and perfectly opens up Children of the Grave, the monster of the album. It's truly a quintessential metal anthem, showcasing Black Sabbath in their true and purest form, Ozzy's creepy vocals, Iommi's hard-hitting riffs, Butler's pounding bass, and Ward adding his flair into the mix. This monster is followed by the gentle Orchid, which is disliked by most fans, but I personally enjoy. Afterwards, you have Lord of this World, a great track, although not one of the strongest on the album. Afterwards comes Solitude, a song where Ozzy decided to sit it out and hire another singer. This one is debatable in the Sabbath fan base, but I personally like it for its uniqueness. Lastly, the album closes with Into the Void, similar to Electric Funeral from Paranoid in structure. I feel it's the second-strongest cut on this album, and I truly love it. <br /> <br />So, what do we have out of this album? A truly solid performance, and the perfect follow-up to Sabbath's best album, Paranoid. Experimental and traditional at the same time, Master of Reality is, in short, an essential album and amazing follow-up.
B000002U82|5.0|This is the album that got me into Pink Floyd and I am now a big fan. In fact I just bought Piper at the Gates of Dawn off of Amazon. Well anyway, this is a great cd and I recommend it to anyone who likes rock music. <br />Best tracks: <br />Time  <br />Money <br />Brain Damage <br />Us and Them
B000957O82|4.0|i saw this movie before in theaters and it was very good. will smith was very hilarious in this movie and i hope he makes another one like this.
B0007O38XU|4.0|This is an A++ movie, but the \\"special\\" DVD release is not as special as I had hoped. <br /> <br />Let's look at the bad parts first! <br /> <br />The pre-menu \\"don't pirate this disc\\" bit is a new live-action waste of time and seems to run much longer than the old-sk00l FBI warnings, despite the new version being in english only.  How much money went into producing that claptrap anyway?  The usual English/Spanish/French full-screen blurbs are more than adequate.  Save the disc space for a better compression rate (not that this DVD release fails where it counts...). <br /> <br />Along with the new, patronizing, live-action piracy bit is an advert for the remake of the pink panther movie.  One I was not able to cirumvent by pressing every menu button on my remote.  This does not make for a happy viewer.  And not just because it's yet another remake of yet another old movie that trashes the old and can't draw in the viewers at the theatres too, making execs wonder what went wrong as they then proceed to make a remake of another old film...  but I digress.  I also double-checked the price of the disc and all the blurbs on the box.  I didn't pay for a pathetic trailer I can't get around.  I paid for a movie.  Not extra advertising in every place they can shove it. <br /> <br />Also, for \\"flubs\\" I had read \\"bloopers\\".  Unless I missed a menu, there are no bloopers - which are usually far more interesting than pointing out flubs (production goofs such as pointing out the camera tracks in one scene and a poorly set up mirror in another), most people will find or just not care about.  I want actors saying the effenheimer or the sclhizzlebler because they couldn't remember a line correctly!!   <br /> <br />On the plus side, the opening menu (disc 1) is HIGHLY entertaining if you let it sit there and just run for a while.   <br /> <br />DTS sound is AWESOME too.  Alone it's worth the price!  Specially in the F/X shots, you'll be blown away by the remix - it is INCREDIBLE andexceptionally well done. <br /> <br />Video quality is excellent for a restored 19 year old film too.   <br /> <br />Nice to see the trailers and featurettes; especially when they hadn't been given the restoration treatment.  (not being sarky here, it's incredible what they can do to restore and preserve film these days!) <br /> <br />The trivia game seems trivial; very obvious questions and the response sequences are too few to maintain interest. <br /> <br />But all in all, the restoration and enhancement of the video and audio is well worth the price. <br /> <br />As for the movie itself...  easily one of Brooks' best works and is a great parody of the original Star Wars series, most of which were good in their own right but this parody of the original trilogy is stingingly funny.   <br /> <br />I sincerely hope Brooks does a sequel (prequel) to Spaceballs because the \\"prequel\\" SW trilogy is so horrendously awful that any spoof of it would rake in far more money, of that I have no doubt!!
B00005JN2Z|4.0|The film seemed somewhat implausable, but if you watch it for the imagery, colors and cinematography, it's a remarkable film.  The film depicts a third-shift LA as a very bleak, electric land of concrete.  The filmwork really captivates, so this makes for a great film visually, but storywise it is somewhat silly (a contract killer... hires a cab?)
6303402348|5.0|An OUTSTANDING film, Forrest Gump, follows the life of a young boy from Alabama as he grows up and through him sheds light not only on his life, but on modern American history as well.  <br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, innocence, friendship, and inner strength.   <br />Tom Hanks, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention quite a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.  <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!  <br />In short, Forrest Gump is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!
B0007GADZO|5.0|There's maybe ten or so albums you'll ever come across that will change your life.    \\"Real Illusions: Reflections\\" is concept album work at it's very best, right up there with Genesis' \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" and Dream Theater's \\"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory.\\" I discovered the sonic brilliance of Steve Vai back in 2000 and I soon after obtained every solo work he has done, and it's been easy for me to identify the rare ability, the talent, the lost gift he possesses to come up with these infectious, perfect songs like \\"K'm Pee Du Wee,\\" the kind that stick in your head relentlessly and bother you throughout your workday in a glorious manner.    Mr. Vai was never one to sacrifice his keen sense of melody for the sake of mindless, autopilot shredding, as this entire album gorgeously displays. \\"Real Illusions\\" will grab you from the initial seconds of it's opener, \\"Building the Church,\\" guaranteed to make you smile and bob your head in rhythmic approval. \\"Glorious\\" is exactly that, and is also reminiscent of that beautiful tone he used on \\"Feathers\\" from the Archives Vol. 4. \\"Freak Show Excess\\" will make you throw your Squier Strat in the garbage, (you should anyway) and quit forever. Awesome orchestration on \\"Lotus Feet,\\" and frankly, though not often one to pen lyrics, (like he even needs to), I think \\"I'm Your Secrets\\" are the best three words he's ever put next to each other.    I honestly think \\"Real Illusions: Reflections\\" is the best and most brilliant thing Steve Vai has ever done, and one's mind would implode in an attempt to imagine what could possibly top this. If \\"Real Illusions: Reflections\\" doesn't change your life in some way, then there is something wrong with you.    Thank you, Mr. Vai, for this wonderful, void-of-conformity  example of everything that music should be. And don't worry, Steve. Some of the whiny, close-minded 'tards who gave this record a bad review don't even know how to spell.
B00006AW2M|3.0|Ok, this album is flawed. However, the reviewer Spiced Rum seems to think that The Stones have made a career out of ripping The Beatles off, and that is just wrong. Since The Stones began they were attributed to being the exact opposite of The Beatles. The Stones were, and still are a great live band, while The Beatles brilliance was mostly visible in the studio. Also, you wondered \\"how the beatles ever tolerated these posers hanging around\\" Well, The Beatles obviously recognised the genius of The Stones, after all on the cover of Sgt. Pepper, a kid is wearing a shirt that says \\"Welcome The Rolling Stones\\" clearly, The Beatles recognised the difference and incredible talent of The Stones. So, The Beatles did not tolerate The Stones, they embraced them.   <br />And to respond to what you asked about what The Stones have done since 1970: the release of Exile on Main Street, Get Yer Ya-Yas Out, Which was preceded by Let it Bleed and Beggars Banquet, Sticky Fingers, and the release of Some Girls. These are considered some of The Stones greatest albums, especially Exile. When I read Spiced Rum's review I wanted to take it off the site, it is an absolute disgrace and anyone who is thinking about buying Satanic Majesties, disregard that review because it is full of bogus information.
B000001G5H|3.0|After winning the Chopin Competition in Warsaw, Pollini's name became synonymous with Chopin. Mr. Pollini's technique is certainly incredible and he makes little effort in performing the most difficult Chopin Etudes (especially Op. 10 Nos. 1, 2 and Op. 25 Nos. 6, 8). His playing is fluid and the recording quality is excellent.    Unfortunately, the more one listens to other pianists, the more one dislikes Pollini. This is for one reason. Although Pollini follows the musical text, he adds nothing personal. Since I have performed many of the etudes myself and I have played through all of them, I can attest that Pollini is one of the most boring performers of these etudes. Fortunately for Mr. Pollini, Chopin is such a great composer that the pieces almost speak for themselves. But then again, I would rather buy the scores than the CDs.    I would recommend the following sets of Chopin Etudes as points of reference:  Ashkenazy, Cortot, Simon, Perhia, Lorte.  Listen to how Ashkenazy and Lorte play pianissimo and staccato at the A minor section after the initial C Major prolongation in Op. 10 No. 1 to get a sense of what colors are possible in a seemingly simple etude. Though Cortot misses enough notes to write another piece, his phrasing is incredible and his long lines are inspiring.  I would also recommend listening to performances by Rubinstein, Arrau, Richter (I don't know anybody who can match his Op. 10 No. 12), Kissin, and Cziffra (possibly the greatest technique ever...listen to his Op. 10 No. 1).

B00003CWPQ|3.0|Eyes Wide Shut, brings to the screen the story of a couple going through some difficult times in their marriage.  \\"Curiosity\\" will test the couples' resolve and inner strength, while their very life might be on the line. <br />On the positive side: a) Great casting i.e. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are wonderful, b) significant elements of eroticism/some really good nudity (!!!), and c) excellent costumes Renaissance-style.  <br />On the negative side: a) The movie is super/uber/ultra slow (!!!), b) The music (if one can call it that...) might make you want to throw things at your television set so make sure you remove all dangerous items from the vicinity, and finally c) the very poor dialogues/lines for which the writers are to blame. <br />In conclusion, the film may provide for an evening's entertainment, though it's no masterpiece...
B000000LZV|5.0|This is not the greatest punk album of all time.  It's not fair to these guys to limit this album to be the best in some category as limiting as 'punk.'  Leave punk as the relic that it is with the likes of amateurs like the Sex Pistols.  'Double Nickels' transcends punk.  This album is up there with the Beatles' 'Revolver,' Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side,' Johnny Cash's 'Folsom Prison,' Zeppelin's 'Zoso,' etc.  Along with Sonic Youth's 'Daydream Nation,' this is the best album of the 80s.  What strikes me most about this album is how stripped down and tight these guys are.  No effects pedals, very little distortion, no overdubs, or layering, just three guys making impossibly brilliant music.  I didn't even get this album until I was nearly 30 and way past my days of being a big punk fan.  I don't know how this got past me for so long.      I might add that Mike Watt's bass playing on this album inspired me at 30 years old to start playing bass after several years of farting around on guitar.  If you're an aspiring bass player, you NEED this album.  And on the days when you think you're getting pretty good, put this disk in and be humbled.
6305807930|5.0|Dario Argento's elaborate follow-up to \\"Suspiria\\" is a brilliant and deranged and utterly surreal ride.  The narrative is intentionally disjointed--like the supernatural text the characters search for, the deeper you follow the more dream-like it becomes.  And the the whole thing is awash in wild colors and stylized sets and characters that act and react like marionettes controlled by some mad puppeteer.  If the narrative frustrates you then my advice is to suspend disbelief, sit back enjoy the visuals.  Loads of fun and well worth repeated viewings to search out hidden meanings and connections--not too many films you can say that about.
B00005NVDF|4.0|Play it Again Sam is not one of Woody Allen's best movies, and, for this reason, I can only give it four stars.  However, all of his early movies have merit and worth in my opinion.  There is a great deal of silly comedy in this film and the character of Bogey always comes along to give our hero advice that he does not have the style or flair to put into practice.  Play it Again... is rough and jaggedy compared to the uniform excellence of Sleeper and Banannas, but it's still a good bit of fun.  Seeing Allen outside of New York (it's set in San Francisco)is quite a novelty and the beauty of a young Diane Keaton won't be something viewers will soon forget.
B0006284JQ|5.0|There is a lot of garbage being written by the Britney haters here. Firstly so what if her last two albums did less well than her first two, they still did very well.Her 1st two albums did exceptionally well, so that can in no way be used to rubbish her later achievements. Also the comparison between her and the 70s group, Star Land Vocal Band, is beyond stupid. After their first hit The Star Land Vocal band barley did anything else, Britney has topped the America album chart FOUR times in six years, the only reason the \\"best of\\" didn't do as well was because her past product did so well. Also the ignorance here is beyond belief. Even if she had dried up in the USA, which she hasn't, the America music scene is more a representation of the music business rather than public opinion, but big deal. Britney is still huge in the USA, one only needs to look at the huge success of her last tour there. Even if she no longer had a fan base there she could carry on another 5 or 6 years of topping the chart elsewhere on this planet. Make no mistake the United States is not the final say who who's big and who's not. Plenty of singers, some of them even American, never had a hit in the USA (unlike Britney who again has had FOUR number 1 albums) yet they did very well elsewhere. Britney is still a huge artist world-wide, to sell several million copies globally of your Greatest Hit's package when your previous 4 albums sold more than 55 million copies between them reinforces that fact. Britney is respeted by no one besides the millions of fans she still has around the world, so too bad for the ney sayers. <br />Britney is respected by no one besides the millions of fans she still has around the world, so too bad for the ney sayers.

B0006Z2KX4|5.0|Actually, it's a must-see for any fans, anyone who loves movies.  This print is drop-dead gorgeous, all the better to be whisked along through the story by Katharine Hepburn's lovely and authentically madcap \\"Susan Vance\\", courtesy of the unobtrusive and elegant direction by Howard Hawks, abetted by one of funniest performances ever by Cary Grant as well as a host of the cream of Hollywood character actors.<br /><br />Not forgetting \\"Asta\\"(not his real name), that fox terrier from the \\"Thin Man\\" films, as \\"George\\"; he really *does* play a crucial part in this ridiculous story about a dinosaur's missing intercostal clavicle, a tame leopard from Brazil(the \\"Baby\\" of the title), and how a Connecticut society girl(one suspects this performance is a lot more like the \\"real\\" Hepburn was than most of her others were)entertains herself while falling in love.  Really, it's an impossible film to describe-which brings me to my one caveat, which is only a factor if you turn on the second audio commentary by the world-class name-dropping windbag Peter Bogdonovich.  Far, far from illuminating, we get such fascinating tidbits from ex-director Peter as the information that \\"several women I've met were actually NAMED 'Susan' after Hepburn's character in this film\\", and a monotonous recitation of exactly what's going on on the screen at the moment it's happening(my friend said it sounds more like a descrptive video for the blind than a critical or meaningful analysis)---as in \\"\\"he's getting frustrated now!\\"  \\"That was a hard fall she took there\\" and \\"HERE's the first closeup of Hepburn in the film\\"--AFTER several lingering closeups were plainly visible earlier in the film...lots of chuckling, repeating lines after Cary Grant has just said them(this last the most obnoxious tic he's got); etc.etc.<br /><br />But that's of little importance-just too bad that they didn't get someone to narrate who doesn't think the fact that THEY love this movie is anywhere near as important as the movie itself is.  The fact remains that this is one of the funniest, most entertaining pieces of fluff done in Hollywood, ever.  A genuine must-have for the film library.itself is.

B00005JNDZ|3.0|Was it too late to make a sequel to the adorable Bridget Jones'Diary after more than 3 years? That's what I wanted to ask when this one came out in theaters. Some movies are better if no sequels were made. This one obviously wanted to make more money when the script is really not as interesting and funny as the first one. Apparently, Renee Zellwegger got paid like twenty times more money for this film than the first. The hundreds of donuts, cheese cakes and pizzas she had to eat to gain the 30lbs really showed in this film. She's very \\"striking\\" in one scene when she wore a tight fitting gold colour evening gown. Talk about the waistline of BJ. Well, we got to give the American Texan the credit for the stunning transformation, and the British accent is still right on.<br /><br />So we know that she found the love of her life in BJ Diary. Colin Firth reprises the role of Mark Darcy, the future husband of BJ,since they have moved in together. Their relationship looks picture perfect at first, but jealousy and insecurity took over BJ's mind when she mistaken him for cheating with a tall and beautiful assistant. Bridget gets pregnant, and Darcy was very happy and decided to propose to her. Then Daniel(Hugh Grant) reappeared in BJ's life, and they spent some time together in a journalism partnership in Thailand. Bridget's life is at a chaotic state when she was mistaken by the customs for carrying drugs in her luggage, and who will bail her out before she faces possible imprisonment.....<br /><br />There's many attempts on jokes in this movie. They did Madonna's Like A Virgin and Material Girl in the prison scenes, but it didn't provoke much laughters like BJ did when she did All By Myself in the first film. Darcy and Daniel also get to have a man-to-man fight over BJ again, but we know Daniel is not the man for Bridget, because her heart belongs Darcy.<br /><br />Hugh Grant had limited screentime here, and didn't have much chemistry with Zellwegger. Colin Firth is good as a calm and sophisticated high class gentleman/lawyer(a true ladies man). As for Renee Zellwegger, she's tried her best at being funny, and touching while maintaining her British persona, but the role has lost it's zest compared to the first BJ. Hopefully we won't have to see her playing overweight and English again for a while.good as a calm and sophisticated high class gentleman/lawyer(a true ladies man).

B0000CEB4V|3.0|The Indian music was very good. The covers of George's songs were dreadful until Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers came on stage. It may be that the musicians were too sad to play well, or perhaps George was simply that much better on guitar than everyone else, even Clapton. Petty got things rolling, they were the real professionals. Ringo picked things up and also was the first to acknoledge the pain when he introduced the song Photograph that he wrote with George, that he knew the meaning changed with George gone for real. Even for big Harrison fans, maybe especially for them, this is a renter rather than a keeper.

B00004XONN|4.0|Kid A (2000.), Radiohead's fourth studio album<br /><br />'Kid A', Radiohead's fourth studio album, released in 2000 is, in many ways, their response to all of the great popularity they gained from their previous two masterpieces, 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer'. Radiohead were pretty much fed up with all of the hype which sprung up from critics following their previous albums and so, Kid A, very much different sounding to their previous discs, is pretty much a two fingered salute to their popularity! Rather than being an album dominated by guitar play, 'Kid A' is very much driven by electronic keyboards and sound effects. It certainly startled many at the time of its released but however, it has become since recognised by many Radiohead fans as an excellent step in the evolution of Radiohead.<br /><br />'Kid A', in my opinion is a truly fantastic album, even if it is, in my opinion, not quite at the levels of 'Ok Computer' or 'The Bends'. I'm every bit in favour of what Radiohead did with this release, that is, put out a totally different sounding album with plenty of experimentation. However, sadly, because of this, it has become one of Radiohead's more underrated efforts and often gets attacked by those who have little time for different styles of music. The average 4* rating on amazon.com for me is an unfair reflection - it is much more than just a good record. If you have any doubts about this listening to this album, I would urge you to dispel them - you may have to put a bit of effort in yourself in getting to like it, as its very different in style, but it is well worth it.<br /><br />As I've mentioned, this album has very much a keyboard driven style to it with very much a cut down guitar usage alongside it. However, the way both instruments are used, often blending very well together in a unique style, is part of the attraction of the record. Its Jonny Greenwood who does most of the keyboard stuff and he certianly comes into his own on this album because of this keyboard presence. Thom Yorke's vocals are often pretty weird on this album, distorted no doubt by the effects that the band have probably used for the music, but it makes a great result overall. Overall Radiohead produce excellent results with the experimentation. I would personally, as I've said in previous reviews of Radiohead albums, not subscribe to the overcomparison with Pink Floyd. I listen to both bands and I can find very little to compare then by - there's just a couple of split second moments on 'Kid A' were I think there is a similarity in effects but its nothing much. Its definitely no reason to call Radiohead rip-offs of the great Pink Floyd, as some reviews seem to find.<br /><br />The keyboard orientated drive for this album is there from the very start. 'Everything in its right place' is a very unusual opener, with mellow keybaord effects. Only Thom Yorke can make lyrics like 'bluh, bluh, bluh' sound good with the music and yes, he does it here! 'Kid A', the title track follows this, and is slower and more atmospheric, with some pretty enchanting keyboard styles. Thom Yorke sings in a pretty distorted style on this track - what perhaps makes this track so great is its very minimalist approach. 'The National Anthem' track follows this and for me, this is the only weak track on the album and is the reason why I only gave the album 4.5 stars. Its got a good underpin bass line but some of the effects and vocals seem too disjointed to be true - I've tried to find some reasoning for this track, but it seems to lack any direction. 'How To Disappear Completely' follows this and its is a welcome return to brilliance. It is, in my opinion, one of Radiohead's greatest tracks - its haunting and captivating, with a clever use of slide guitar. The acoustic background and Thom Yorke's very much tired and lacklustre vocals give the track a unique and amazing feel. 'Treefingers' follows this and this is effectively a 4 minute keyboard interlude with lots of effects before running into 'Optimistic', another highlight of the album. The guitars have their greatest presence on this track, with some great riffs. 'In Limbo' is very dreamy in style, with a great keyboard rhythm. Thom Yorke's vocals fade in and out with great lines such as 'Your living in a fantasy'. 'Idioteque' follows this, another amazing track, with a strange keyboard beat to it. Lots of experimentation from the band makes this track an excellent one - it rounds off with some strange shreaking sounds. 'Morning Bell' is another keyboard driven song and 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' finishes the album off emphatically. The title says it all, listen out for some great effects. The last track is 3 minutes but leave it running afterwards because there is a hidden track!<br /><br />'Kid A' is another great album from Radiohead. For me it is a masterpiece bar 1 track (the godawful 'National Anthem').

Nine Inch Nails has been able to capture that musical masterpiece which seemed only to be getting better and better with each new record.  After waiting these last years since \\"The Fragile\\" I think the anticipation started to build for many of us who were thrilled that NIN was getting ready to reemerge this year. And what did we get? \\"With Teeth\\" another centerpiece in a long running music carrer.  While after playing the entire album through the first time I felt that about 5 of the 13 songs were able to stand out to me.  The disappointment was that after the first week of contunious play in my cd player the ablum never grew on me the way I wanted it to.  I think if anything I felt more disappointed in the fact that this album did not stand out to me.  The way I describe it to myself is that it would not have mattered to me if Nine Inch Nails ever released this album or not.  It will not go down in history as any historical milestone. Sure there will be fans who 100% disagree with me but thats why it's good to read some reviews and then make your own conclusions.
6305744793|5.0|this movie is a very nice movie for gloomy days. this gothic but entertaining movie is perfect to cheer you up because i think the movie is very good. the actors who played them are also great which adds to the concept. the movie is about the addams in there kooky way and then there long lost uncle fester comes but he isen't what he use to be, he's to normal. i coud be a imposter trying to steal the addams fortune. so wendsday (brilliantly played by christina ricci) and pugsley plan to shed light on him. see this movie, it can cheer up anything. evn a disembodied hand.
B0002O37RM|5.0|Hi, folks ! <br /> <br />Thanks for sharing your patience with this album of mine! <br />I don't like it so much as you do ... <br />But it's possibly not my best work. <br />Thanks anyway to all the buyers and listeners of good jazzy works! <br /> <br />Sincerly yours, Charlie
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I feel that The Phantom of the Opera was a good film, overall. Unfortunately for anyone who has had the opportunity to see the stage production, it pales in comparison. But in reality, no one can fairly compare the stage and the screen. Both are extremely different avenues. I felt that the movie accurately portrayed the storyline. The actors were extremely well chosen for their respective roles. The only thing that I disliked, however, was the singing voice of Gerard Butler as the Phantom. Although he captured the magic of \\"The Music of the Night\\" well, the rest of the songs were a bit lacking vocally on his part. His voice was excellent, to say the very least. However, part of the essence of the Phantom character is to have a large, powerful, booming, and mysterious voice. It is meant to make you shudder and be fearful of him. I don't feel like this actor's voice created that emotion in the movie. Again, it was a superb film!
B000002KHF|5.0|My Favorite Van Morrison album of all time and One of the Best album Of the Rock Era. My favorite Songs are the Title Track, \\"And It Stones Me\\" and \\"Caravan\\". But all the Songs are Terrific. A classic Rock album.

0783225733|5.0|I posted a review of this film some four years ago after I had purchased the \\"Collector's Edition\\". About a year later, I watched the movie one more time. Since that time, my DVD has been stored in its jacket, safe and sound. About one month ago, I was going to view the film again but my DVD player tells me, \\"This Disc Cannot be Played on this Player\\". Cleaning and otherwise re-inserting the disc proved useless. I have since tried the disc in both my computer's DVD drives, two other different DVD players, a laptop and one more computer, all to no avail. I keep getting the same message. Does anyone know what happened to my disc while stored safely in its jacket? Why did it play well two times, and now says it can't be played, on the same player. Has anyone experienced this problem? Thanx...........
B000005IU2|5.0|I dont know what you wanna call it ....sludge...raw power.. punk prototype...garage classic.... I Dont Know dudes, but the beginning of TV Eye (3rd track) makes me wanna bang a chick and smash a car at the same time.  Do you feel the power? Do you feel the intensity of the guitars and the pounding of the drums? Basic ..and sweet.  Bands nowadays just dont get it, maybe they never will. I just cant emphasize how damn good this album is. Grab a beer ,crank it and enjoy!
B000002J09|5.0|This is My favorite Led Zeppelin Album <br /> <br />All Classic Material!
B000929AJQ|5.0|I have listened to this album non-stop since my purchase.  I have also read all the reviews on this site about the album and all of those who rate it less than 5 out of 5 really need to step back, move away from comparing it to old NIN and give respect to Trent and associates for reinventing genius! <br /> <br />Yes, what they say is true...  You won't hear the heavy electronic clutter that was so aggressively inspiring and angsty and you won't have flash-backs just from listening to it like the prior albums.  This is everything Trent always was but could never properly portay with the genres of over production and high musical standards which he never main streamed into anyways but it still didn't help.  Now the generations of music are all over the place and Trent, like other bands recently, is taking advantage of \\" RAW \\" which is what we have all complained about with the last three decades of music and that is that music doesn't sound live and raw like off a record anymore.  So now you have Trent mixing electronics with analogue, like putting a micro-processor in Einstein's Brain and you have solidity like giving Hitler a heart!  Put these aspects together and you have Trent with the help of his talented army of genious musicians. <br /> <br />You just have to live this album, sit back with a Latte or Beer or Vice of Choice and experience it, absorb it, respect it, and realize that with all the clutter and chaos in the world today that weighs down on your shoulders that it was Trent and NIN that brought that full album's worth of serenity and simplicity to help you take the focus off of Hell.  Simplicity is the key to genius, it took a series of hundreds of small brush strokes to create the Mona Lisa but behind it all is just dabs of paint and a very Big Brain! <br /> <br />GET IT!

B0002OERI0|5.0|So this is a punk opera. Wow. The band has come a long way since Dookie, and it shows. There are only two truely political songs on this CD: American Idiot and Holiday. So if your very patriotic don't get scared away by some of the bs media this has been getting (they banned American Idiot here on the radios because Ft. Knox was whinning). <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia is easily the best song on the album. So why doesn't it get any air time? Because its about 9 minutes long. Unless your band's name starts with Led and ends with Zeppelin (or if its just Queen) then theres no way a 9 minute song will make the air ways. Maybe they'll get cocky and give it a try though, and if that happens it might just work out. <br /> <br />Give Me Novacaine, St. Jimme, Homecoming, Holiday,Blvd. of Broken Dreams, Wake Me Up When September Ends, Letterbomb, and Whats Her Name are the other really good songs on here. <br />American Idiot is easily the weakest track on the album, St. Jimmy would of made a better first single. Mostly because its closer to Green Day's old school stuff. Its loud, its fast, and its catchy. But hey, it worked out in the end didn't it? <br /> <br />The album has quite a bit about coming of age and relationships between friends and ex-girlfriends. Thats right. Green Day did an album that wasn't about getting stoned. And its still damn good. <br /> <br />I saw them live in Cincinnati, and I must say that I'm hoping they'll release a Live DVD and CD. It really is that good. I suggest you see them if you haven't already. <br /> <br />This was one of my highlights(as far as purchases go)from last year and they're still going strong with this album. Doesn't really matter though since its so good that its destined to be one of those classic albums that captures a moment in time and a generation much like Pink Floyd's The Wall(oh, Lord please forgive me for comparing Floyd to Green Day :P), Nirvana's NeverMind, and U2's \\"The Joshua Tree\\" did, so it will never be toolate to buy it. <br /> <br />So is it worth buying? <br />Hell yes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXCW|5.0|SUNSET BOULEVARD is Billy Wilder at his scintillating-best.  Gloria Swanson turns in the performance of her career as Norma Desmond, the faded silent movie star looking to make her comeback, and William Holden is the jaded Joe Gillis, the desperate writer who gets drawn into Desmond's own singular world.<br /><br />The movie works on so many levels: black comedy, romance, melodrama.  It is the ultimate Hollywood expose and no wonder it caused such a furore when it was originally released in 1950.  The supporting cast cannot be bettered, led by Erich von Stroheim as Max, Norma's faithful butler and one-time husband/director.  Nancy Olson is luminous as Betty Schaefer, the pretty studio writer in love with Joe (and the only real innocent amongst the hard-boiled and jaded lead characters).<br /><br />The well-presented DVD Special Edition of SUNSET BOULEVARD includes a fascinating `Making Of' with Nancy Olson and others taking part.  There's also a feature-length commentary with Ed Sikov,  a great featurette about costume designer Edith Head's days with Paramount and the original opening set in the morgue.

B00005JMYI|5.0|For anyone who hasn't already seen Anchorman, you can read the other reviews for the plotline - it's a wafer thin medium to let Will Farrel do nutty stuff.  Fans of Old School will like this movie.<br /><br />That being said, I'm giving this DVD the 5 star rating because it has so much extra stuff.  This is what a DVD should be: jam packed with bonus features, gag reels, promo spots, trailers, commentaries, and a music video. (The hilarious \\"Afternoon Delight\\" video will be stuck in your head for days).<br /><br />I've bought too many DVDs that end up having the scantest extra features - usually little more than a trailer and some boring commentary.  This DVD combines a great movie with so much bonus stuff, you'll really get your money's worth.
B0007GADZO|5.0|I can't believe some of the reviews some people are writing.  This album is one of the most inspired and well-played albums there will ever be.  Most Vai fans will think it blasphemy- but I think this albums is better than Passion & Warfare.  This cd hasn't left my car since it came out.  Every song is perfect and the production of it is great.  To that one reviewer: the guitar is SUPPOSED to stand out over the keyboards... it's the steve vai band, not the mcalpine band.  This is the only review i wrote so far because i feel very strongly that everyone should buy this.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Sitting around my friends house, getting high one night last year, my friend pulled out a cd and asked me if I had ever heard of Elliot Smith.  My response was something like, 'Yeah, thats the dude who recently died, heard his music is pretty good.'  With that my friend put Figure 8 in the cd player, and  immediately I was hooked, but profoundly sad at the loss of such a great artist. <br /> <br />That was a year on, but today I feel compelled to write a review for you folks.  Having listened to the majority of Elliots stuff I can say that this is probably not his best album.  However, it is still a masterpiece that deserves recognition as possibly one of the best albums released in the last 5 years.  Straight away I was taken in by this albums brilliance, captivated by songs such as Son of Sam, Junk Bond Trader, Wouldn't Mama Be Proud etc.  This album safe to say didn't leave my md player for a long time as the albums copius hooks refused to weaken and give way. <br /> <br />Listening to the cd a year on it has lost none of its touch and is even fresher than the day I first got to hear it.  Elliot Smith was a great artist.  You'll find yourself feeling an edge of sadness listening to his music but at the same time the music is quite uplifting.  Elliot had the knack of singing about depressing themes but not doing it in such an upbeat way. <br /> <br />This is a good starting point for Elliot if you haven't heard his earlier stuff as its easy to get into, then once you are hooked progress onto XO or Either / Or.  I personally find his early work (Self Titled, Roman Candle) a little more harder on the ears, however that may well be because I have not given them a great deal of play so far. <br /> <br />Get Elliot, you'll not be disspointed.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0552149519|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I was enthralled from the very beginning. It took me a little more than 4 days to read it because of my busy schedule. This book is quite a mystery book and delves deeply into religious issues especially the always controversial Catholic Church. As I read the book, I couldn't help but wonder \\"Is it possible?\\" and \\"What if this is real?\\" I knew deep in my heart though that this was a work of fiction; none the less, the reader is pulled into the work and made to seem as if the story IS real and that there has been a conspiracy for all these years. To all those, especially the Catholic Church, who hated this work, you need to realize that this was a STORY...a work of FICTION. Let me further elaborate: FICTION is describing imaginary people and events, sometimes even places. Get over it and grow up.
0385512058|1.0|Why would someone openly tell the public that they solicit their friends in order to bring in business?  The book itself is mere self indulgence and instructions on how to have people over for dinner, but Ferrazzi calls it \\"cloning an event\\".  HINT...not a good idea to write a book on being insincere and fake to people when its your job.  Ferrazzi tactics are common sense and at times, unkind.  My dog thanks you for the chew toy.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|this movie is not anti-america propaganda, its satire, its parody, and its damned funny, this movie is basically poking fun at all political views, and because that involves making fun of america people think it's anti-american, so now we can't even poke fun at ourselves, you know what happens when people don't have a sense of humor about themselves and their own beliefs? you get relgious extremists who generate enough hate to want to commit terrorist acts (for those of you not getting my hints i'm talking about our so called enemy) anyway all political ranting aside, this movie is almost guaranteed to offend people reguardless of political viewpoint simply because of the extremely crude humor, so if you can't stomach foul language or 10 min, of a drunken puppet spewing vomit then steer clear of this one, I however found this very funny and would reccomend it to anyone who can laugh at themselves and isn't easily offended
014017821X|5.0|In Angela Carter's The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories, the author re-creates the fairy tales of old, melding them into feminist tales of love, loss, lust, and sexuality.   While her stories find their genesis in the childlike versions of Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, and others, Ms. Carter transforms these fantastical stories into adult renditions where vampires prey on virgins, where children lie down with wolves, and a Count \\"thrust his virile member into the dead girl\\". In each of these stories, Ms. Carter creates an unexpected, erotic feel which is intertwined with mystery and an adult edginess that goes far beyond the original versions of these fairy tales.  She also is very adept at giving the reader just the right amount of clues, never being too obvious, and respecting her reader's intelligence in unraveling the webs she weaves with these stories.  Ms. Carter additionally has an ability to take what could be mundane aspects of her stories and infuse them with richness which keeps the reader involved in the story, compelling them to read on.  Finally, Angela Carter is a master of symbolism:  the young officer in The Lady of the House of Love as the true measure of life and freedom, the kiss in The Company of Wolves as the conquest of men, the clothing in The Snow Child as a representation of power.  In every story within the pages of The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories Angela Carter's brilliance come through, and her readers are rewarded with lush, rich, compelling, adult stories of adventures born from our childhood fairy tales.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I just wrote a review but I think it didn't go through. I personally think this is one of the all time best albums (not just from radiohead).   I've been a fan of the band since the early 90's, when they played in small venues for about $10!   Their newer albums are a little too mechanical sounding to me...but OK computer is amazing.  I think there is a song for everyone on this album, and I'm surprised reviewers are giving it less than 5 stars! It's one of those albums that make you wonder how anyone could be so talented?
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|This is bad... It's significantly better than other new music out today and they are able to pull off a few catchy rhythms (so I'll give it 2 stars), but for the most part this is bad music. Anyone who bases their musical taste on appreciation for skill, songwriting, variation, replay value, and depth in albums will not like this band. Given a few guitar riffs per song and some drum and bass samples I could see someone recreating the entire album on a computer. Sorry to crap on your taste, but wake up: this is not good music. There is very little good new music being released. You probably like this more than you should because on a relative scale of new realeases it is near the top. On an absolute scale it is probably 2 stars.
B0002G2B2M|5.0|Eternal sunshine should be voted as the best movie of 2004. For those of you who are jaded by the typical blockbuster film with expensive special effects and cliche one-liners, this is the movie for you. It's funny,creative, and philosophical. You leave the movie thinking about life and the purpose of love.   It's defintely a romantic film, but not overwhelmingly so. I am not usually a fan of cheesy romance films, but this one isn't like  your Drew Barrymore/Ben Affleck type cheesy films. Its a movie that makes you wonder about every relationship you've ever had. And Jim Carry does an amazing job of portraying his character. He's come a long way since the Mask..I think he could be the Tom Hanks of this generation.    However, if you are the type of person who enjoys movies like The Wedding PLanner or Gigli, and every Will Smith end-of-the-world catastrophe summer movie,  then this is not the movie for you.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Many reviewers have made comments on the script, soundtrack, artistic direction, and acting in Eyes Wide Shut. All are superb, especially the interior photography, but I would rather focus on the profound story-telling in this exceptional film. <br /> <br />The plot of Eyes Wide Shut weaves together the path of man's fall from Grace, his struggle and journey to regain that state, and the amazing almost accidental way that Grace is restored to the human spirit. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise plays Dr. Tom, the Everyman. Nicole Kidman plays Allison, his wife. In the beginning of the film she plays the Eve archtype, who stimulates the fall from Grace with a curious note of discord and jealousy.  <br /> <br />Tom, the Adam/Everyman character, has it all in his Garden of Eden. He has a wonderful medical practice near Central Park. His beautiful wife, who is shown in total naked innocense in the first scene of the film, manages an art gallery in SoHo. They have a multimillion dollar apartment overlooking the Park. They have a bright and lovely young daughter that loves them. They have a beautiful and to all appearances perfect life. <br /> <br />They attend a Holiday Party at the home of an ultra-rich, ultra-powerful patient of Dr. Tom. While separated, the Devil (disquised as a suave sophisticated older man) asks Nicole to dance and within minutes begins to seduce her and try to get her to go upstairs and have sex with him. The actor who plays this Devil character was perfect. He was slim with a big head full of white hair. He wraps himself around Nicole Kidman like a slinky boa constrictor. She avoids the seduction despite being slightly intoxicated. Yet she does not escape unharmed for he has planted the seed of discord in her mind. She performed well and she would like to be praised for resisting this seduction, but she realizes her husband will never know.  <br /> <br />Dr. Tom in the meanwhile is tending to the herion overdose of a very high priced prostitute. Laying nudeand unconscious, this woman appears to be the apex of earthly beauty. Dr. Tom revives her and treats her with extreme kindness and dignity and handles the entire situation very diplomatically. Again, in mirror image to his wife, he has performed beautifully yet he can't really tell his wife what he has experienced. They both leave the party with secrets they can not share. After smoking a join at home, Allison challenges her husband that he really does not understand the sexual desires of women and he really doesn't know her thoughts and secrets. The Devil has done his work!  Adam is about to be handed the apple! Allison admits that she had a consuming overwhelming sexual fantasy while the family was on Cape Cod based on a military officer she saw eating dinner in a restaurant.  <br /> <br />Dr. Tom's fall begins here and boy does he fall! He journeys through the night-life of Manhattan but eventually gets caught up in the nest of Devils in their sexual orgy hideaway. His life is in danger and yet a beautiful prostitute saves him and he is allowed to leave. Later he finds that she has died of an overdose. Remember that a sacrifice is required when one falls from Grace, a maxim of every religion. <br /> <br />In some ways his journey is like Ullyses trying to make his way home to the waiting Penelope. This is especailly true with the wild encounters he has with Manhattan low-life on his night's journey. He is almost seduced by a street walker who he finds out later has AIDS. <br /> <br />He makes his way back to his wife, full of contradictions and uncertainties, but resolved to rejoin with her - to renew the emotional bonds that he lost during his night of journey into dark places. <br /> <br />The film ends in a gigantic toy store, a place of renewed innocence, and when Dr. Tom asks Allison where to they go from here, she acknowledges that they move forward together for they were \\"lucky\\".  <br /> <br />It is this word \\"lucky\\" that resolves the story from a theological point of view, for they have been saved by the Grace of God. They don't deserve this gift,they really didn't ask for it, they just struggled in the dark like all human beings. Yet, in the end they are the recipients of this Grace. <br /> <br />Stanley Kubrick based this film on Arthur Schnitzler's short novel \\"Traumnovelle\\", but surely Schnitzler based his novel on the eternal story of Adam and Eve, the fall and the redemption. This film that was judged obscene turns out to be sacred.
0316172324|3.0|-----It is interesting to look at all the Amazon reviews of this book.  They are so divergent.  Some reviewer love it, others hate it.  Why?  My own response may be suggestive.  I liked his writing.  He has a talent to take abstract academic psychological concepts and turn them into interesting ideas and examples the lay reader can easily read and understand.  In this way, he is similar to Antonio Damasio who popularized neurology (Descartes' Error) and Carl Sagan who did this for astronomy.  But there is a problem.  Unlike these authors, he is not an expert in the field.  They were accepted by their professions--an outstanding neurologist or an exceptional astronomer.  He is accepted only as an outstanding writer.   <br />-----His knowledge of the subject matter comes from interviews with some experts in the field or reading some books.  But he doesn't have the years of experience examining scientific journals, considering counter evidence, or applying the scientific method to test his hypothesis.  As a result, his book reaches some basic conclusions that are not only erroneous, but many professionals consider being the exact opposite of what they should be.    <br />-----True, our brains do quickly organize data into patterns; he calls them \\"blinks or \\"thin-slicing,\\" others call them schematas or gestaltens.  True, these blinks may prove to be correct.  But equally true they may be false.  The question is, how do we determine which ones are true and which ones are false?  We can't tell from the blinks themselves.  The false ones feel just as strong, just as certain, as the true ones.  The only way we can tell is by collecting data and analyzing how accurate our past blinks have been.   <br />-----Accepting our blinks uncritically can cause mountains of problems.  The vast majority of patients I have treated accepted a phony intuition uncritically: the four-time divorced woman who kept marrying alcoholics because her intuition told her he was Mr. Right; the panicked adolescent who intuited that there was great danger whenever he left his house, the suspicious business man who \\"blinked\\" that people who talked in whispers were plotting against him.  The first step for all these people was to challenge their instant perceptions.  It would be helpful if this book clearly said, \\"Don't trust your blinks,\\" instead of hinting at the opposite.
B000777J2S|5.0|Antony is with no doubt one of the most dramatic, soulfull, beautifull voices that i have ever heard in my life!  <br />Poetic and dramatic lyrics..you can consider this a dark album, but still full of love and happiness..with simple piano melodies, it will get stuck inside your head and soul for a long long time..! <br />I am a Bird Now opens with a suberb song..although this is that kind of album that you can't decide what's your favourite song on it..every song is deadly beautifull!! <br />With guest vocalists like Devenra Banhart, Boy George(i got surprised by this guest i may say..what a beautifull voice Boy still has), Lou Reed, Rufus Wainright and Julia Yasuda, who added their talent too...this album is alredy a masterpiece for me!!! <br />For lovers of Nina Simone, Nick Drake, Nick Cave(boatman's call era), you all gotta hear this and trust me...you'll be overwhelmed!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000029GA|5.0|This is by far one of the best hip-hop albums of all time.  Production is great and nas's flow is even better.  Every track is great.  I can put this on and listen all the way through. It is definately his best album.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Sometimes the way that we REMEMBER movies is telling.  If anyone had asked me what I remembered most about Stanley Kubrick's classic black comedy, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, I would have said the \\"ending,\\" you know with Slim Pickens sailing through the air, riding a nuclear warhead like a bucking bronco.  Trouble is, that isn't actually the end of the film.  If pressed, I might have recalled the recurring images of mushroom clouds that play over the closing credits and, if someone had given me a reminder, begun to recall that Vera Lynn's sentimental WWII hit, \\"We'll Meet Again\\" was played over these images and the closing credits. <br /> <br />But I had quite forgotten the actual closing dramatic sequence, one that some people (if the reviews below are any indication) objected to as being dramatically superfluous, extraneous or just plain weak.  That would be, namely, the final scene in the War Room wherein the good Doktor Merkwuerdigliebe (the former Nazi and now military advisor to the American President--now Anglicized to \\"Strangelove,\\" a more pronounceable but no less disturbing moniker really) articulates his vision for saving humanity (or at least the powerful elite) by holing up in underground caverns for the next hundred or so years.  <br /> <br />It's a chilling vision, and for those who recall the Cold War Era, it was one that actually gained some currency at the time.  The twist, put upon it here, and one that echoes a subtext of the film, is how this vision of the near total destruction of humanity actually had a certain perverse appeal to some, namely those who by virtue of rank and power, might actually make into one of those bunkers.  The blackly comedic undercurrent here is a sexual one (as it is throughout the film), since the military brass and political elite present in the War Room are, uh, \\"intrigued\\" by Strangelove's notion of a Bunker Haven wherein powerful men must, of necessity, mate with several women in order to ensure the survival of the species. <br /> <br />A specious argument if there ever was one.  The placement of this War Room scene is key, sandwiched as it is between Pickens A-bomb ride and the closing mushroom-cloud montage.  It's clear that this is an insane, last gasp fantasy on the part of the Cold Warriors responsible for this destruction.  Even if Strangelove's fantasy were realizable, there is simply no time.  Doomsday is already upon them.  How can they even hope to make it to the underground caverns, let alone gather up the bevy of fertile beauties required to fulfill their fantasy?  They remain delusional to the end--and this is the end. <br /> <br />Strange love indeed. <br /> <br /> <br />
0783222955|5.0|The mockingbird in this movie has no wings and little chance of otherwise escaping. (I won't spoil the movie by revealing it's identity.) The movie is a lesson in courage and respect for people who are different. Country life is depicted in hindsight through the eyes, ears, and narration of a child while boldly addressing prejudicial social issues against formidable odds. This is a classic appreciated more with each viewing. <br /> <br />Movie quote: \\"Neighbors bring food with death, and flowers with sickness, and little things in between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a knife, and our lives.\\"
B00000JRTX|5.0|A surprise hit that was nominated for Best Picture in 1994, FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL is a marvelously performed romantic comedy.  Hugh Grant is superb as Charlie, the suave young man who is always late for weddings, and is looking for the right girl to speak his own vows.  Andie McDowell is the American who enters Charlie's life, but his refusal to make a commitment sends her into the hands of a much older man (Corin Redgrave).  What makes this movie so delightful is its marvelous supporting cast:  Simon Callow, Charlotte Coleman, John Hannah, James Fleet, and of course the sublime Kristin Scott Thomas as the acid-tongued but charming Fiona.  Rowan Atkinson also has a scene-stealing hilarious moment as a nervous priest really screwing up the wedding ceremony at Wedding # 2.  The movie is incredibly human and Hannah's recitation of a W.H. Auden poem at the funeral is extremely powerful.  For romantic comedies, they don't get much better than this.  Another high point:  the guitar strumming couple who warble both CAN'T SMILE WITHOUT YOU and STAND BY YOUR MAN.  A Fun film.
1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is one of those books that you hear everybody talking about and reccomending to you and that's been on the best seller list for the past couple of months. I felt that the only reason that I should read it was because everyone was talking about it so much;I didn't think I'd actually enjoy it. I was very wrong. <br />The main character, Christopher John Francis Boone, is autistic. Therefore to enhance the fact that he's autistic, the author writes the book sort of choppily, for example, there might be five paragraphs in a row that begin with the word \\"and\\". You come to understand the character's actions, no matter how extravagant and awkward, and begin to understand autistic people in general. As well as this, Christopher is bursting with bits of knowledge that are interesting to know as well as the story. <br />In the beginning of the book, Christopher finds his neighbor's dog impaled upon a garden fork in her yard. Having read Hound of the Baskerville's, he is very much into detective work and decides to try to figure out who killed the dog. The story just takes off from there and Christopher ends up hip deep in trouble and still manages to weasle his way out of it. <br />Don't hesitate, read this book!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Other than CHICAGO, movie musicals have not been abundant in the last ten years or so.  THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a joyous, breathtakingly beautiful film featuring some of Andrew Lloyd Webber's most beautiful songs (Music of the Night and All I Ask of You at the top), dazzling sets and costumes, artistic flair, and performances of superior quality.  More a love story than a horror story, THE PHANTOM sweeps onto the screen in lush colors and amazing cinematography.  Joel Schumacher, mostly known for his action thrillers, shows a deep respect for his material and takes his relatively unknown cast through the motions in glorious style.  Gerard Butler (Dracula 2000, Lara Croft Tomb Raider, Dear Frankie, Reign of Fire) is a superb Phantom.  Having to overcome the stigma of being the man who took Michael Crawford's role, Butler oozes romantic obsession, tortured self-deprecation and a swashbuckling persona.  While his vocal prowess is indeed limited, he sings with emotion and a tenderness combined with madness that is marvelous.  Emmy Rossum (Mystic River) was 16 when she filmed this movie and she is glorious.  Aside from her stunning beauty, she evokes the innocence of Christine and sings like a nightingale.  Patrick Wilson, a two time Tony nominee, is fine as the heroic Raoul, the young man who wins Christine's heart.  Their duet of All I Ask of You is dazzling.  Rounding out the cast are Minnie Driver as the over the top Carlotta, as mentioned the only performer who was dubbed musically; Miranda Richardson is perfect as the savior of the Phantom in his early years; and Simon Callow (Four Weddings and a Funeral) and Ciaran Hinds (Veronica Guerin) are superb as the two \\"scarp metal\\" magnates who buy the Opera house.  The film has a plethora of haunting scenes; artificial snow has never looked more gorgeous; and the graveyard scene is eloquently beautiful.<br /><br />THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is high class entertainment, and in time I feel it will receive more critical acclaim as it is viewed on its own merits and not compared to the stage play that gave its birth.m as it is viewed on its own merits and not compared to the stage play that gave its birth.
B0000CAXID|5.0|This debut from Dave Grohl will certainly be known for many years to come as a Classic.  As most rock music fans know, Grohl was the drummer for Nirvana before Kurt Cobain's death.  Not taking any of the glory from Cobain, but Grohl likely had a very strong influence regarding the success of Nirvana.      Much like Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, Dave Grohl wrote and recorded all of the music on this first album from Foo Fighters.  You can certainly tell that Grohl was eager to be independently creative for a long time...and this album is a masterpiece.  Grohl really turns up his vocals in \\"I'll Stick Around\\"...then later, churns out more melodic tunes, such as the eclectic \\"For all the Cows\\".  Everything from thrash to warm harmonies are represented here...and I enjoyed every bit of it.  I was fortunate to catch Foo Fighters in Cincinnati, back in 1995...and it remains the second-best concert I've ever been to (second only to Page & Plant).  Successful diversity has always been what I look for in performers...which Grohl does quite well.  He and his band remain one of the last few great rock acts around.
B0008ISM40|5.0|An attempt at an objective review: <br />Reznor's newest album can best be described as \\"consistent\\".  *With Teeth*, however, differs from more recent albums such as *The Downward Sprial* and *The Fragile* in that it relies more on traditional rock and roll than digital manipulation to create its unique sound. The sound is very much Trent Reznor, perhaps a more mature evolution of the man who spent so much time lamenting lost love (or lust?) in previous albums.  His musical vision is like billet metal machined to a thousandth of an inch; it is precise and  finely crafted.  Given the album's guitar+bass+drums edge, it is more reminiscent of *Broken* in many cases than *Pretty Hate Machine*. The latter-mentioned album is rumored to have been created almost entirely on a Macintosh, whereas *Broken*, with the distinct overdrvien sound of producer Flood, destroyed any ideas about Reznor just being a kid that was crafty with Pro Tools. In the same way that *Broken* stunned listeners with the riff-heavy \\"Wish\\", *With Teeth* recalls that definitive sound, though the two albums in between have left and distinguishable mark. *With Teeth* really is an evolution of that sound; with the first listen, the music delivers both the unexpected (new sounds never heard before) and the familiar (particular chord progressions that distinctly belong to Trent Reznor). It is a logical progression... *Broken* was the inevitable result of *Pretty Hate Machine*; *The Downward Spiral* was the stunning result of what had been outline in *Broken*; *The Fragile* was the predictable anti-climax, still beautiful in its own way, but sad somehow; and now *With Teeth* is a reconstruction, a result of everything that has been and things that will be. <br /> <br />A Subjective Review:  <br />And now I will indulge in personal opinion: It would be unfair to say that *With Teeth* does not meet expectations, because what is forgotten is that Reznor spawned a mainstream genre that has never been able to match the quality of its creator. It's not like Reznor planned it, but a product of his obsession and apparent self loathing was the creation of something genuinely original, and original things will inevitably be imitated. This is not to say that there were not other musicians doing similar things that were not equally or more talented (Oghr of Skinny Puppy comes to mind). The fact remains that it was Reznor's particular brand of talent that was chosen by the mainstream, everything afterward is a result of that choice. Therefore, criticizing Reznor for lack of creativity on his newest release is like saying DaVinci should have been more talented. It is an irrelevant statement that cannot be logically supported.  <br /> <br />The Music: <br /> <br />The catchiest songs on the album are perhaps \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" (of course... it's the radio single) and \\"Only\\". \\"Only\\" has a low and funky bass groove that is tuned low... low enough to hear the heavy strings resonate like the sound of plucking the strings in a baby grand piano.  \\"You Know what You Are\\" and \\"The Collector\\" have the distinctive influence of Dave Grohl. \\"You Know What You Are\\" is fast and heavy, almost like \\"Song for the Dead\\" on QOTSA's *Songs for the Deaf*; fast enough that one might wonder how it is humanly possible to play that fast. \\"Love is Not Enough\\" and \\"All the Love in the World\\" are familiar, having something to do with a woman, sex, love, and whatnot. Apparently Trent is still upset about that. However, this album will deliver something for every NIN fan and should be added to your CD collection.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I bought this when it was first released and it's still in my CD player! Every song has a different story and it's truly the diary of a young woman's journey!
0312305060|5.0|It took a lot of courage to come here and be the 500th reviewer, especially that of my favorite book.  But it is an honor to write about Mr. Cunningham's novel, and if you are, by any chance, reading this with the possible intention of reading The Hours, let me tell you precisely why it is such a great honor to be writing this review... <br /> <br />Getting down to business.  The Hours is a novel made up of three different stories about three different women in three different generations.  There are some brilliant interwoven moments that really pull the book together, but they reveal too much to be in the review.  The main connection between the stories is how they revolve around Virginia Woolf's novel, Mrs. Dalloway.  The first story is of Virginia Woolf writing the book in the 1920's/30's.  The second story is a depressed suburban mother reading the book in the 1950's.  The third story is set in modern times, and is probably my favorite, where the characters and events are actually echos of the characters and events of Mrs. Dalloway.  This whole crazy woven plot is what really makes The Hours so dynamic. <br /> <br />What tops of the plot to make the book truly extraordinary is the characters and the actual writing.  Some people say that Michael Cunningham is cheating, because most of the characters and events in his book are either historical or from Mrs. Dalloway.  Whoever says this is wrong, to be straightforward about it.  Cunningham takes this things and paints a beautiful world out of it.  The characters are so beautiful in so many ways, often troubled and unstable, but between the craziness, there are glimpses of such pure humanity.  Beyond the incredible three women who lead each story, there is one of the most spectacular characters in all of literature, Richard, the poet with AIDS, who, in all of his Martin Eden-esque Bohemian splendor, made me really feel so alive, and added The Hours to the very short list of books that made me cry.  Cunningham's talent with his pen is evident in his descriptions,imagery, and the natural and moving dialogue. <br /> <br />I have read many books in my day, and The Hours is probably the best.  I stood in line for a VERY long time, and had a choice of getting a book signed by the very talented Ms. Jumpha Lahiri or Michael Cunningham.  There was not even a tiny question in my mind about who to chose.  Please pick this book up.  The Hours is fairly short, and in its pages, you are bound to discover humanity. <br /> <br /> <br />PS.  A very funny tidbit.  The main woman in the modern day story is walking around New York City to buy flowers.  On the way, she catches sight of a movie star who she thinks is Meryl Streep.  In the film version, the character is actually played by Meryl Streep.  It made me giggle for a little bit....
0451209338|4.0|Daniel Silva's Kill Artist is an excellent introduction to his series of spy thrillers starring Gabriel Allon. Allon is a unique character; a former assassin and spy for the Mossad (Israeli Intelligence) he retires after his wife and son are killed and takes up a successful career as an art restorer. Allon is an enigmatic, fascinating, and utterly likeable character, which makes the fact that he's a sociopath a bit troubling. <br /> <br />In the Kill Artist Allon is called out of retirement when a terrorist named Tariq comes out of hiding and kills an Israeli Ambassador in Paris. Allon's former boss, the calculating Ari Shamron, uses this to manipulate Allon back into the field--Tariq was the man who murdered Allon's family. Joining Allon in the hunt for Tariq is Jacqueline Delacroix, sometimes fashion model and sometimes spy, who uses her body to seduce information out of enemies. <br /> <br />The Kill Artist is well-plotted and full of suspense, making it a great read for anyone looking for a good thriller. Allon is a new breed of spy, filled with more shades of gray than James Bond or Jason Bourne. He's clearly meant to be the good guy, but the fact that he's a cold-blooded killer can't escape the reader. <br /> <br />The only flaw with this novel is the fact that Allon and the other \\"heroes\\" are clearly sympathetic to the Israeli cause. While I can't speak for Silva's politics, it makes the novel seem one-sided. Taking that with a grain of salt, the novel is still entirely enjoyable <br />
B000000H64|5.0|I can't believe this was released 10 years ago, god I feel old. Regardless, this cd was ahead of its time in '95 and still is. It has a cold, unrefined sound to it. There's a reason that the review for this album is 5 stars. Hightlights include Demanunfacture, Self bias resistor, body hammer, h-k   (hunter-killer), hell there all classics. There aren't any words that I can say that would do this album any justice, buy it now and  I guarantee, you'll thank me later
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen the play Phantom 8 tmes and concider myself a phantom phanatic. The movie was different, but hey lets open up our minds and let our fantasy unwind, it is amazingly beautiful. I took my 19 year old to the movie, and said \\"well honey what did you think?\\" and her reply was \\"oh my gosh mom, i loved it!\\" Buy it or rent it, you wont be dissapointed.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Phantom of the Opera has to be my absolute favorite musical that I have ever seen.  I saw it on stage in 1992...the only time I saw it.  I fell in love with it so I bought the original cast CD of it and naturally loved that as well (it may have something to do with Michael Crawford's voice;).<br /><br />Anyway, when I heard that Phantom was coming on to the big screen, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical at first.  I wasn't sure if a musical of this genre could make the transition from stage to screen.  I am so glad that I was proven wrong!!!<br /><br />I went to see the movie about 2 days after it premiered and let me just sum it up in one word: WOW.  The music, actors, scenery, costumes, everything was magnificent!  Gerard Butler (The Phantom) was excellent in his role.  I was not at all familiar with him before seeing this movie.  His emotions that he put into the role made me feel so bad for the Phantom!  There were times that I wanted Christine to end up with him!<br /><br />Emmy Rossum (Christine) was brilliant!  Sure, she's no Sarah Brightman, but she is most definitely a rising star.  It is very hard to believe that she was only 16 years old when they filmed the movie.  She has a voice of, well, an angel!  And to top it off, she is absolutely gorgeous.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson (Raoul) was amazing as well.  I had no idea that he had come from the stage originally.  His voice was truly amazing, as was his acting.<br /><br />The supporting cast was amazing as well.  Minnie Driver is the perfect Carlotta.  She just fit into the role so well and I loved her accent!  She was indeed a great 'Primma Donna.'  Miranda Richardson (Madame Giry) did a wonderful job as the very mysterious woman who somehow knew the Phantom, but kept it to herself, until she told Raoul about how she met him.  Yet she was still amazing.<br /><br />Overall, I give this movie a 10/10.  Kudos to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher who made a wonderful team.  Minnie Driver's song Learn to be Lonely was terrific.  Thank you, ALW, for turning such a wonderful play into an incredible movie.<br /><br />If you are a fan of musicals, especially of Andrew Lloyd Webber's, I highly recommend you rent and/or buy this DVD today!  The special features are mind blowing.  Trust me--you will fall in love with it.or turning such a wonderful play into an incredible movie.

B0007KTAU4|2.0|I've listened to quite a bit of French-language music while growing up.  Perhaps that made me immune to the \\"exoticism\\" of French lyrics, because this album does absolutely nothing for me, despite all the glowing reviews posted on here. <br /> <br />Carla Bruni's voice is annoyingly monotone, displaying a marked lack of range and expression.  Her \\"melodies\\" tend to stay within a very narrow cluster of notes, sounding repetitive and unengaging, and she overuses the vocal device of lapsing into \\"breathing\\" a lyric instead of singing it.  It might sound sexy for a song or two, but when every song is saturated with this gimmick, I can't help but suspect it's because she ran out of breath.  The songwriting is flat, without a single memorable lyric hook or melody, and the whole album conveys the same mood over and over -- a low-flame kind of seduction that wears thin after three songs.  There isn't enough variety in tempos -- all the slow songs (\\"Quelqu'un m'a dit\\", \\"Tout le monde\\", \\"La noyee\\" etc.) sound the same, while the few slightly faster numbers (\\"Raphael\\", \\"Le plus beau du quartier\\", \\"L'excessive\\") also sound alike, the same lilting rhythm employed ad nauseam.  The only tracks I like are \\"Le ciel dans une chambre\\", whose folkish melody carries some hint of soul, and \\"J'en connais\\", which has some interestingly off-kilter harmonies, a little more rhythmic drive than the other songs, and good nylon-string guitar arrangements. <br /> <br />If you like this kind of cool-sexy mood, try a singer like Lynda Lemay or Axelle Red instead -- these are singers who can veer towards the cool spectrum without sounding musically bland.  Not to mention a singer's singer like Souad Massi, who can make magic with just a guitar and her voice, whose songwriting is soulful yet often deceptively simple, traversing language barriers via pure emotion.  Carla Bruni, on the other hand, is stuck firmly in one mode, and nothing on this record suggests she'd be able to break through into something interesting anytime soon.
0380789035|1.0|... but liked the idea that the ancient gods have survived in a somewhat powerless state, then have a look at _Malpertuis_ by Jean Ray. Finding the rare translation might already prove a challenge. The movie with the same name is also worth watching.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Don't listen to anybody who says this album is Pretty Hate Machine Pt.II, too depressed/too happy or one dimensional. With Teeth is multi-faceted. The lyrics depart from the old themes of desperation and depression to a new theme of fading with time, yet the lyrics directly reference the older albums at times (\\"tiniest little dot...\\") The music is more   straightforward rock, yet still contain heavy handed synths (Beside you in time.) Finally, the album is more mainstream sounding but simply bizarre at times (Only.) More to the point this album is good. Perhaps people will be disappointed if they wanted Trent to sound more/less like one thing or another but judged on its own terms, With Teeth is awesome.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Well I am into my 4th spin of this album as i am writing this, and it seems to be an album of quality from Trent Reznor, but nothing new to his credits. It has a few remeberances of the past albums (Starf*ckers Inc. can be heard throughtout a few tracks off the album). As for everyone who is whining about the *pop* tracks on this album, you have to expect some after 15+ years of making music, its just incluence. Overall my two favorite tracks are \\"What You Are\\" and \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\". The album isn't as dark as some other ones in the NIN library, but as you listen it definitely gets darker and heavier, with the exception of \\"Sunspots\\", which is a well designed and written tune, just doesnt fit on a NIN album. Overall a decent effort from Mr. Reznor, but I personally could have asked for more heavy industrialized tunes.
B0007WF1WI|5.0|Seriously! This album is the best! Other albums (including other artists) always contain at least 1 song that I don't like but In The Zone's every song is my favourite! I bought this album (regular CD) 2 years ago and now I'm buying it again because I love it soo much and I can't wait for the DVD side!<br /><br />This is not on the Amazon's tracklisting but I just wanna let you know that the DVD side also includes the ENTIRE album in DOLBY  5.1! I can proove it to you! It says on the back cover and I can give you the screen cap of the menu where you can choose to hear the album in Dolby 5.1!! So you can enjoy the entire album on the DVD side in PCM Stereo and Dolby 5.1!!
B0006284JQ|5.0|The laughable comments by the joker who thinks they are right and anyone who disagrees is wrong and thinks they know it all, but off course they don't  Let's look at there so called \\"facts\\"    \\"5 mediocre Platinum selling albums, all are worse than before\\"    Really? That might be your view but clearly not the view of everyone. Britney Spears has now lasted 6 years, I bet you gave her a year or two back in 1999! So who are you to say her music getting worse? To you maybe, to people who like it, no.     \\"A fluke of a number one single\\"    The single sold over a million copies in the USA alone, it also topped 1 million in sales in the UK and was the biggest selling debut single of the 20th century in that Country. Since that time she has scored another 19 hit singles, 8 of which have been Number 1 in various countries. There is a world outside the United States you know!    \\"A Grammy(big deal, Starland Vocal Band won a Grammy yet no one remembers those a****les) \\"    You seem too. I do too. Also I didn't see the Starland Vocal Band achieve 4 number 1 albums in America, or 5 top 20 albums in Britain, neither have they, to my knowledge logged 60 million album sales. So to compare the success of Britney Spears to that of the Starland Vocal Band is completely stupid, but then again so has your whole argument.    \\"Fans who worshipped her then abandoned her after her erratic behaviour started taking shape after Justa Tinkertoy left her!\\"    Is that why she's still topping charts all over the world, because she has no fans?       \\"Fame(everybody has that, including ME!)\\"    Well you're probably the worlds most famous bulls*****r!    \\"No beauty\\"    Who says? You? Is that why people constantly vote for her as the sexiest woman in the world?     \\"Homewrecker\\"    She isn't actually if you look at the whole facts.      \\"Drug addict\\"#    You must be on something yourself to come up with all this nonsense!       \\"No Respect from anyone\\"    She has it from me, so you're wrong there!\\"And a baby on the way which I bet she will ***carry!\\"    You really are evil.    This record is great. The people here saying Britney's career hasn't been going long enough to have a \\"Greatest Hits\\" out are missing the point entirely. This album is not based on amount of time you have been around, it's what it says on the cover, it's a \\"Greatest Hits,\\" therefore it's about hit singles being collected onto an album and the question is has Britney had enough hit's for a Greatest Hit's album? The question is not how long has she been around for?!. The answer to the real question, with her scoring 19 hit singles to date is, yes.    Britney burst onto the music scene with \\"Baby One More Time\\" in 1999, a song which i'm sure anyone who had a radio or TV has heard many times. \\"Sometimes\\", \\"Oops I did it again\\", \\"Stronger\\", \\"Lucky\\", \\"Everytime\\", \\"Toxic\\", etc, etc, etc all followed. Now Britney is regarded by many to be the best pop star on the planet.     Back in 1999, people though Britney would soon fade, now in 2005, 6 years later, the same people are still saying that. She has already gone much further than they first predicted, so who to say, as long as the hit's keep coming, she won't last even longer yet.    This is a totally justified release as is truly a collection of great hit's from a hugely popular performer. It merits it's description as Britney Spears Greatest Hit's!
B00076ZZ9I|1.0|i love the album, but i must strongly disagree with some other reviewers saying that the dvd side sounds better than the cd side, i have good gear (not a home theater in a box)i couldnt tell the difference even in a blind test, and no one i got to listen to it could tell either. the only difference between sides is 16 bit 44.1 khz for cd, and 16 bit 48 khz for dvd.  amazon should really address this issue and get a backbone and post the truth about all sony/bmg dual disc titles. but like everyone else, amazon is probably petrified of sony.     JUST A FOLLOWUP TO MR. STEVEN M GADDIS, THE DVD SIDE OF BACK IN BLACK IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME BALLPARK AS DVD AUDIO, ITS NOTHING MORE THAN DOLBY DIGITAL STEREO, THATS IT!!...PERIOD, AND I AM SORRY BUT I HAVE LISTENED TO BOTH SIDES ON MERIDIAN GEAR PARTNERED WITH B&W NAUTILUS SPEAKERS, AND THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL, AND THAT MY FRIEND IS THE HARD FACTS, SONY IS PULLING AN OLD FASHIONED BAIT AND SWITCH!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is without a doubt one of the most important bands in the history of rock/metal.  I'm not knocking any of the greats like, Zeppelin, Floyd, Sabbath, etc., so don't get me wrong.  What bothers me is that Tool is not seen in that light by the masses, which is odd considering the body of work they've produced.  Oh well, that's mass media for you. <br />Lateralus is great from beginning to end.  There really is no soft spot on this album besides the few minutes of dead air between Triad and the last track.  The songs are complex, yet simple, which is what makes this band so great.  If you like music, you should buy this album. <br />
0793573742|5.0|If you have a passion for Gibson Les Paul Sunburst's made between 1958-60 then this book is an absolutely essential \\"must have\\". It is the definitive book on this rare, much loved and highly sought guitar.  <br />Since owning this book, I've read it over and over with enthusiasm and passion. Hardly a day goes past without picking it up for a quick read and gazing over the fabulous pictures of these exquisite guitars. The photogaphy is superb, capturing many fine features and close-up's. Mr Iwanade has researched every facet from original materials used, design, suppliers and importantly production methods and not forgetting feedback from collectors who cherish their bursts.  <br />Having a vivid passion for these guitars for more than 35 years and read just about every article writen about 58-60burst's, I truely believed that I was highly knowledgable on this topic but the truth is I have learned so much after reading this book.   <br />For me the \\"Beauty of the 'Burst\\" is the final word. I'm thinking of buying a second copy in case I wear the first copy out - How many books can you say that about <br />
B0007XT87G|4.0|In Absentia was a masterpiece, so it's really difficult to judge a new album when the last one was that good.  So, you wouldn't be suprised to learn that I find this album to be one notch below the previous. <br />However, that is not to say that it's bad.  It's actually very good.  \\"Arriving Somewhere, but not here\\" is my favorite track thus far, but like other Porcupine Tree albums, you need to give it several listens to let it all sink in.  I still hear things on the previous ablums that I hadn't noticed before. <br />For new buyers, start with In Absentia, but don't hesitate to buy this one if it's the only one on the shelf.  (American music stores are pathetic when it comes to stocking good artists)
B00006F7IM|5.0|A truly great movie! It's just one of those movies with no original plot, about a boring down and out baseball team, that makes a great comeback. At first glance, you would think there is no way this movie could be entertaining.  <br /> <br />But a masterful blend of perfectly cast actors, cinematography, and soundtrack makes Major League one of the greatest \\"fun movies\\" of all times.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Reading other reviews, I've noticed that some people are disappointed in this album, but I can't see it.  I have already listened to this album countless times, and it came out less than a week ago. <br />The music, lyrics, and production are quite strong, something we've come to expect from Trent Reznor.  I can understand if some people are a little let down because it's been so long, and following up a double disc with a single disc contributes to that, but really, it's a great album. <br />The music is a bit of a throwback to PHM/Broken days, but that doesn't bother me at all.  In fact, it makes it all that much better. <br />If you've ever liked NIN, you should buy this album.  It's well worth it.
0743454537|5.0|This book was absolutely awesome. The main question that this book will have you thinking is: If all my parents ever used me for was a \\"lab rat experiment\\" to help my older sister get better or prolong her life, would I continue to let them even after I got sick of it? Better yet, would I continue to even after she's told me not to?<br /><br />This is definitely a book for those with siblings and even those without. It shows how devastating, complicated, and emotionally heartbreaking medical issues can be for those who are living with it and those who it affects, with or without their consent. This is the story of 2 sisters and their family, a lawyer and the love of his life, and the strength to accept what we wish not to accept and to let go of those that we need not hold on to.
B000001YOW|5.0|I heard In Absentia first, barely liked it enough to get this.  My world has changed forever, this is my #1 favorite album ever.  Too bad they forever changed directions after this release, by putting out the stinky Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun.  Im glad those albums are widely popular, but Signify(and Insignificance) is their greatest release.
B000000WHX|5.0|I love this CD. Period.<br /><br />It's not just \\"trippie\\" but it's a lot more than that. It has atmospheres that will transport you to soundscapes you maight never been before. Evenmore, each track will transport you to another different soundscape each time you listen to them. Safe From Harm and Be Thankfull For What You've Got (my two favs) are some of the best tracks I've ever heard!<br /><br />If you are a Massive Attack lover, you'll love this album, if not, you'll start loving Massive Attack.
B0002DB0FO|1.0|Wow. What can I say. This is the worst, most predictable, badly acted show I've ever seen. I think it epitomizes the lazy thought so prevelant in America today. What is wrong with these people who like this crap? What redeeming qualities does this show have? I personally would rather sit down with a good book than have to go through this. The list of predictable, gag-me-with-a-spoon, sappy, and corny subjects that this parodic brain-rotter manages to ring off in a sigle episode is incredible!
B0008ISM40|1.0|I have been with Nine Inch Nails since 1989, and I have loved each NIN album, even though he has evolved his music to a newer sound. The strength of Trent is his innovation of rythmic beats and soundscapes to bring you into his world. Even if you didn't like The Fragile, we all have to stand back in awe of his mastery. Bottomline, Trent is the leader in a music industry full of sheep. He started the industrial movement, and the angst driven electronic music. So, why does the man who is light years ahead of everyone else now choose to follow like a sheep? Rick Rubin made the awe of music genius into a packaged sound that results in plain songs sprinkled with the generic element of NIN. Although the songwriting is the worst from Trent, Nine Inch Nails suceeds in making a half dozen in With Teeth songs pretty catchy. However, being catchy and simplistic makes the album very superficial. This album will be forgotton by most within half a year. The album fails to invoke any awe or bring you into Trent soundscaped world of angst. WITH TEETH is an uninspired album.  <br />BAD about WITH TEETH: <br />Nine Inch Nails which is usually VERY good with beats and rythms suffers in this album. Dave Grohl did a very crappy job in this album and sounds like a drum machine.  <br /> <br />Lyrics are rehashes from his rehashes of previous songs. Looks like his writer's block reached new lows with this album.  <br /> <br />Too simplistic - Trent used to have multiple instruments playing multiple rthyms and beats in each song. There are some very good tunes in this album but they are played to such repetition that they lose their flavor - much like untalented technos artists often do. <br /> <br />GOOD about WITH TEETH: <br />The first song, All the Love in the World, is very good. From looking at the Still and The Fragile albums I can see Trent wanted to evolve towards more piano-based, heart-felt songs. Unfortunately, this is the only song that has continued this evolution. <br />Only,is innovative and interesting to listen to, but nothing super cool.  <br />Hopefully, Trent will realize how uninspiring this album is (especially when it flops in sales) and quickly produce a better album focusing on his angst angainst himself for producing such an album. <br />I want to hear a song how Rick Rubin is the anti-Christ. Wait, Karl Rove is, I forgot.
B000002JKA|5.0|First off, great CD.  Second, and just to clear things up, MTV Rocks is just screwing with you people!!  Stop writting pissed-off responses to his reviews!!!  He's funny as hell, read a few of his reviews and you'll get it.
B00006FXB6|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age are a tremendeously good rock 'n roll band in the 2000's. Among all the nu-metal crap there still are rock bands left, not rap bands only. Their style is kinda unique in many songs, Josh Homme's cool, sludgy voice and their \\"small-time\\", but infectious and groovy guitar style, mixed together is candy for your ears, and there' always a sense of fun in their songs, and I like it, their not a political band, their a fun rock 'n roll band, with roots and influences more from classic rock bands instead of punk bands, and that's why they stand out in the alternative circles too, cause they don't sound like another Pearl Jam copycat, like so many others do. The hit song \\"No One Knows\\", is simplistic but catchy as hell, and gives you a great vibe, \\"Go With The Flow\\", is also great, and these tracks are perhaps the biggest pleasers, but there's more. \\"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire\\", the opening track is awesome! With it's fast singing and great epic guitar, make a grea tstart. \\"First It Giveth\\", is slightly lame, but I love it though. \\"Gonna Leave You\\", is a little simplistic and clichd but it works, \\"Do It Again\\" sounds like a hockey anthem in my ears, but it's different, cool. \\"God Is In The Radio\\", is one of my favs. too, it's brilliant. \\"mosquito Song\\", has a really, really nice acoustic guitar, and some great, but perhaps sad singing by Homme. Well, I wouldn't consider this a masterpiece, simply cause there are some weak tracks too, that could've been cut out, but it's a great album all in all, QOTSA play desert-stoner-rock, you actually get a feeling of being in the desert without water, when you listen to it, and that you're really stoned in the desert, ha ha, no but, they have an unique style, and that's a very precious thing, today! Respect!!!
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|Everyone forgot the actual source material for this band... the late great scottish band Josef K... try their record The Only Fun In Town which was reissued awhile back and be amazed at the gall of these nitwits who lift an entire sound without adding a single element while their clueless audience eats it up...
B0006284JQ|5.0|This album contains 20 solid good songs. Britney has been around for almost 7 years now and this album is a soundtrack to that time. A must have for any fans of good pop music.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Chunk the fat(over weight) child in the film is one of the most hill-air-ous characters ever captured on film by a major movie company!
B0007XT87G|4.0|As someone who's been a fan of the group for the past 5 years, if there's one thing we can always expect from Porcupine Tree, it's that they never hesitate to change directions with every album.  And Deadwing is no exception.  Having been almost 3 years since In Absentia was released, and the fact that Deadwing was going to be released a month earlier in the UK, I couldn't wait so I went ahead and purchased an overseas copy back in March. <br /> <br />Some of the concepts of the album are based partly on a ghost-film script that a friend of PT frontman Steven Wilson wrote.  Musically it is more diverse from the death metal-dominated In Absentia.  This is also the first PT album that featured guest artists (Adrian Belew of King Crimson and Mikael Akerfeldt of the Swedish death metal band Opeth) <br /> <br />The album's title track starts off with a bang blends electronic music with a heavy yet well-blended rock sound. <br /> <br />\\"Shallow\\", the track that is currently the first released as a single in the US, is a 4-minute heavy riff rock song with a great hook to it that could actually receive some airplay here. <br /> <br />\\"Lazarus\\" is a beautiful, delicately crafted track that quiets you down from the previous two, with terrific piano and guitar work.  Could be another track that could get some future airplay here in the US. <br /> <br />\\"Halo\\" brings the other members of the band more to the forefront especially with Colin Edwin's bass and Richard Barbieri's keyboard and atmospheric synthesizer work. <br /> <br />\\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" is a wonderful 12-minute piece that blends together well and ranks up there with other long pieces like \\"Russia on Ice\\" from Lightbulb Sun and really showcases the musical and vocal talents of Wilson and the band. <br /> <br />\\"Mellotron Scratch\\" is a piece that begins very acoustically and soft and then intensifies to become a rock piece and has terrific arranged vocals at the end. <br /> <br />\\"Open Car\\" is the trackthat changes pace quickly from frenetic hard riffs to melodic layered vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Start of Something Beautiful\\" is a track that begins with terrific keyboard work and gets better in the latter parts with heavily riffed guitar work. <br /> <br />\\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" is a calming ending piece, which is typical of PT albums.  Very atmospheric thanks to keyboardist Richard Barbieri and the diverse layered vocal work.  Reminds me a bit of the track \\"Darkmatter\\" from their 1996 album Signify. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of music that's uncompromising and outside the mainstream yet still accessible, and if you're tired of the same old formula stuff that shows up on MTV, then give Deadwing a listen, as well as all of Porcupine Tree's previous releases. <br />
B00009W0WM|5.0|Wow, where to start. Quite simply, this has to be one of the greatest movies ever made. Now realize that this is coming from me, a 16-year-old! I don't consider myself anything of a film expert, but I know a good film when I see one. It's hard to imagine that the part of Rick was originally scripted for Ronald Reagan, but Bogart's performance is flawless, as is Bergman's. I also find it somewhat ironic that it spawned a catch phrase that was never spoken verbatum in the film, but aside from that, wow. A lot of people may find the storyline somewhat dry by today's standards, but I love it. All of the actors have marvelous voices. Casablanca only gets better 'As Time Goes By' (neat little reference, eh?), and I highly recommend it to anyone with a pulse and a soul. If you must see one more movie before you die, it doesn't get any better than Casablanca.<br /><br />Also, Bogart fans should check out \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"The Enforcer\\".
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I was drawn to this story in elementary school and have loved reading the variations, extras, and edits of the different prints/copies of this novel. I loved seeing this film partly because I was never able to attend the stage performance so it was great to see it in action.     I loved this film because it struck my chords of emotion, empathy, and anticipation not just irritating song after smiling song. I hate musicals and this is NOT a mere musical, it is a work of art. The colors, the actors, the sets, the story. Nothing was overdone. Gerard Butler was great as the phantom letting the audience see the sinister and the sympathetic without giving too much.However his voice, while speaking is rich, but I can't say I cared for his singing much except the DON JUAN performance. As an experienced musician with a good ear, I say Emmy Rossum was great I don't know why people are dogging her so! And last but not least, Minnie Driver did an excellent job as the Diva Carlotta, she was just out of control.      Okay I don't have any other words to describe how much I enjoyed this film ( I cried at the end and I usually don't cry over movies). That is my opinion and I am sticking to it. Take care and see the film!!!!
B000063DFN|5.0|This is an awesome album, from the high-speed \\"Aces High\\" to the long \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\" It also includes one of my favorites \\"Two Minutes 2 Midnight.\\" This is a good album, but I don't think it is as great as their earlier work like \\"The Number of the Beast,\\" But it still is a must have with great songs from one of the greatest metal bands ever.
B000000H7I|5.0|why do people claim this to be metal at all it's just overdone noise with cheesy solos and annoying vocals. For all the hype the drummer gets I don't think he's even that fast in fact I think he's just about the slowest drummer I've heard to date you want fast get Travis Smith from Trivium which by the way is a true influential and inspiring metal band. metalcore is the only true genre worth listening to why bands like Atreyu, As I Lay Dying, Unearth, and As Hope Dies have the charisma that you can't get from this lousy act which is Suffocation.  <br /> <br />for REAL METAL just stick to the truly innovative metal bands such as Korn and Throwdown
B000063DHL|5.0|Iron Maiden made a big leap of faith with Somewhere in Time and expanded on their sound by introduction synth and string effects into their music. It paid off for them big time. They not only managed to keep their Iron Maiden sound, but they managed to take that sound into an exciting new direction, which they capitalized on with their subsequent album, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (the perfection of their experimentation with synth effects). Somewhere in Time is full of essential listening and a great purchase for anyone into metal. There's absolutely something for everybody.
B000002NFM|5.0|The addition of hardcore/thrash metal guitar god Gizz Butt proved the best idea this dance band ever had,creating a dense (dance ?) and heavy music plagued with killer,hypnotic heavy riffs even an old harcore punker like me (43) can relate to.Everything about this record,the drummining,the synth loops,the bass playing,transpires sheer agression giving you the adrenalin rush of your life !!! I can't but help getting up and shake my hips every time I listen to this record,which,by the way,is incredibly well recorded.
0790729970|5.0|This film stars Jim Carrey in the popular Dark Horse comic book, \\"The Mask,\\" while taking on an international crime syndicate in the name of justice and fun. The movie does seem a bit redundant at times and a bit too goofy, but the film still manages to be funny. The film is a laugh out loud riot, and it makes fun of all the typical super hero movie cliches that are expected. Jim Carrey gives a truly comical performance in this film, so it's no wonder why you can't take your eyes off the screen. Overall, this is a solid film for the entire family to enjoy.
B00006HBBL|4.0|After \\"Days of Future Passed,\\" with its fusion of progressive rock and the London Festival Orchestra the Moody Blues provided more of the same, only different (i.e., a Mellotron instead of the full symphonic orchestra since Decca did not want to pay for another one despite the success of the aforementioned previous album). On their 1968 release \\"In Search of the Lost Chord,\\" the songs are shorter and manage to involve both pop and Eastern influences. \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" could be one of the best Hollies song never done by the Hollies. However, the exception that proves the rule here would be \\"Legend of a Mind,\\" the song that causal listeners think is called \\"Timothy Leary\\" or \\"Timothy Leary's dead,\\" or something along those lines:<br /><br />Timothy Leary's dead.<br /><br />No, no, no, no,<br /><br />He's outside looking in<br /><br />Now that Timothy Leary is not only dead but really, most sincerely dead listening to \\"Legend of a Mind\\" from is a different experience. Leary died in 1996 and his remains were cremated and lauched into the final frontier along with those of \\"Star Trek\\" creator Gene Roddenberry. The song is associated with the psychadelic period of the Sixties, although it is hard to imagine why given that the lyrics are full of unqualified praise for Timothy Leary and his astral plane:<br /><br />He'll take you up, he'll bring you down,<br /><br />He'll plant your feet back firmly on the ground.<br /><br />He flies so high, he swoops so low,<br /><br />He knows exactly which way he's gonna go.<br /><br />Ray Thomas wrote \\"Legend of a Mind\\" and also \\"Dr. Livingston I Presume,\\" the other song on the album that makes acid trips sound like a good idea, in that delightfully eccentric way that make the British so endearing. You keep wanting to suspect that there is something tongue-in-cheek going on here, but, no the group seems to be earnest in its adoration as the CD's new notes by the band members. No wonder the Moody Blues were so popular with the counter-culture. Add to this the Eastern influences that pop up at the end of the album in \\"Visions of Paradise\\" and \\"Om.\\" Things get a little self-indulgent on this album, but the experimentation pays off big time with their next effort, \\"On the Threshold of a Dream.\\"<br /><br />In 1968 the Moody Blues, which is a much better name than El Riot & the Rebels, consisted of Justin Hayward (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, 12-string guitar, sitar, harpsichord, piano, Mellotron, bass, percussion, tablas); Mike Pinder (acoustic guitar, cello, autoharp, harpsichord, Mellotron, piano, bass); John Lodge (acoustic guitar, cello, bass, tambourine, snare drum, background vocals); Ray Thomas (C flute, alto flute, soprano saxophone, background vocals); and Graeme Edge (piano, drums, timpani, tambourine, tablas). The point of detailing all this instrumentation is to evidence that the level of experimentation here was at least the equal of what the Beatles were doing during their legendary \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" period (and Jethro Tull only had one flute). The result was that \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\" made it to #23 on the Billboard chart. There were two singles released, \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" made it to #61 and \\"Never Comes the Day\\" only got to #91 (A pair of Justin Hawyard songs, \\"Voices in the Sky\\" and \\"The Actor,\\" were both released in the U.K. as singles), and to make sure everything is dotted and crossed, the cover art was by Phil Travers.Add to this the Eastern influences that pop up at the end of the album in \\"Visions of Paradise\\" and \\"Om.\\" Things get a little self-indulgent on this album, but the experimentation pays off big time with their next effort, \\"On the Threshold of a Dream.\\"  <br /> <br />In 1968 the Moody Blues, which is a much better name than El Riot & the Rebels, consisted of Justin Hayward (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, 12-string guitar, sitar, harpsichord, piano, Mellotron, bass, percussion, tablas); Mike Pinder (acoustic guitar, cello, autoharp, harpsichord, Mellotron, piano, bass); John Lodge (acoustic guitar, cello, bass, tambourine, snare drum, background vocals); Ray Thomas (C flute, alto flute, soprano saxophone, background vocals); and Graeme Edge (piano, drums, timpani, tambourine, tablas).

B0006J28KU|5.0|This is arguably one of my favorite action flicks. With a cast to die for, and a director who just keeps turning out fabulous films, Heat has it all for some serious testosterone. Al Pacino plays a world weary LA detective who takes down sophisticated robbers. He is pitted against the a-team of thieves led by Robert De Niro as an incredible group of actors-criminals including, Val Kilmer and Michael Masden and an all star cast of crooks looking for that big score. The sub plots are well developed, and the suspense is fabulous, as Pacino and De Niro establish a mutual respect that leads to a fantastic creshendo of conflict and action. I can't say a bad thing about this flick.
B0002V01UG|4.0|When you think of Swedish music, ABBA and other embarrassments come to mind. Well, scratch that impression. In 2000, the American rock scene got its blast of Swedish punk rock from the Hives, who got attention with the raw energy and raging music of \\"Veni Vidi Vicious.\\"<br /><br />Their breakout album is a lot more assured than their relatively clumsy debut, \\"Barely Legal.\\" It kicks off with some catchy riffs, joined rapidly by some heavy percussion and unholy yells from Howlin' Pelle. That's only the first minute and a half, an explosive opener called \\"Declare Guerre Nucleaire.\\" (The meaning is pretty obvious)<br /><br />That sets the tone for the rest of the album, with its mix of hard rock and aggressive yells. Some of them, like \\"Statecontrol\\" and \\"A Get Together To Tear It Apart\\" are almost dizzyingly fast-paced, while songs like \\"Main Offender\\" are catchy enough to count as genuine singles. Fortunately, they don't sacrifice too much of the aggressive rockin' for catchiness.<br /><br />The Hives have done their homework, unlike many a whiny faux-punk band. What makes rock'n'roll like this enjoyable is not laments about how your girlfriend left you, but explosive energy and a bit of hell-raising. I don't know if the Hives hell-raise in real-life, but in \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" they sound about ready to. And love every minute, too.<br /><br />Like many popular rock bands, they have a lot of classic rock echoes -- most notably Iggy and the Stooges. Despite a lot of unfortunate hype surrounding them, here's nothing original or groundbreaking about the Hives. They simply move faster and with more energy, and their lack of pretention is what makes them entertaining.<br /><br />Howlin' Pelle is well-known now for living up to his name -- at least the \\"howlin'\\" prt. He shrieks, he yowls, he yells, he yelps, he wails. He even sings a little, in a very hammy manner, in the wickedly tongue-in-cheek \\"Find Another Girl.\\" But mostly he howls, and that gets a bit annoying after awhile -- especially since he actually has a pretty decent singing voice.<br /><br />Fast, rip-roaring and full of earthy energy, \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" is a fun rock'n'roll listen, despite the over-the-topness of Howlin Pelle.bit annoying after awhile -- especially since he actually has a pretty decent singing voice.   <br />  <br />Fast, rip-roaring and full of earthy energy, \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" is a fun rock'n'roll listen, despite the over-the-topness of Howlin Pelle.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I'm a 16 year old self proclaimed film buff, and I can't see how people can call this film boring and overrated. True, it was made in 1941, and it's in black and white, but it's a masterpiece nevertheless. This film is noteworthy for several reasons. This work is consistently at the top of film lists. It has a special place in film history for the innovative approach employed at the time it was released in 1941. From my perspective, this film should be on the summer viewing lists for every high school student. The Rosebud symbol is still recognized even though more than a half century has passed.
B0000666DW|5.0|I'm serious.It doesn't get much better than this.It might be my absolute favorite metal record to listen to,so this will probably be a really bad review haha.Mastodon really made something special with this release,and you know it as soon as the first song starts charging at you with inhuman drum fills and off time riffs and vocals that are intense as hell burning on 3 million gallons of gasoline.Despite popular opinion,I think this release blows away Leviathan.The music here is more complex,is much heavier,and has a lot more energy than their latest release.Brann Dailor shows you he is one of the greatest drummers you will ever hear,and if you don't believe me..just listen to the ending of Crusher Destroyer and tell me your jaw doesn't drop.The song writing is amazing and unparalleled in the genre.Every song is great here,you're not going to skip anything.The riffing is extremely catchy and precise and each note fits the song perfectly.Oh,and the song names are to die for too as well.Basically if you like metal that's technical heavy and intense then this is required.One of my favorite records ever,5 stars.
B0000640SB|4.0|My usual movie fare consists of independent and foreign films and I shy away from the typical big brash Hollywood movie but sometimes everyone needs a good laugh.  <br />This is a very funny film that puts a whole new spin on \\"illegal aliens\\". <br />Part sci-fi spoof, part action movie, the film makes use of a lot of special effects. Some of the forms of space creatures are in and of themselves a riot.  <br />The humor ranges from slapstick to the silly to sometimes being surprisingly witty. <br />There are parts of this movie that are laugh out loud funny.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Wow what a hilarious record! I love it! The joke songs about being really angry and intellectually complex over nothing are comedic genius.Plus I love the seme street influence on the costumes..it really brings the thesis to the listener well.I love the fact that the music isn't even heavy to show us that it's a joke.Soon these guys will be right up there with Weird Al if they keep up the good work.Oh wait..these guys are being serious?..Oh..
B00004T8RK|5.0|I don't know what everyone is talking about. Binaural is unspeakably good.  Every song sounds incredible, the lyrics are touching and thought-provoking, Matt's the man on drums, and we all know what to expect from Jeff, Stone, and Mike. <br />Still, it sounds way different than their earlier work.  But hey, give Ten, Vs., Vitalogy, and No Code a good listen and you'll see that every PJ album has a radically different sound. <br />So in conclusion, screw you guys. It's a good record whether you like it or not.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|I couldnt belive how skinny Christian Bale was in the movie. It was disturbing to watch him, because he was basically just bones. The movie had a good plot, but I couldnt get most of it. Ill have to watch it again to get what I missed. Christian Bale is one of the greatest, under used actors of modern cinema. I cant wait to see him in Batman!
B00005MP58|5.0|What an excellent adaptation of Jane Austen's novel.  Beautiful scenery, costumes and wonderful acting make this movie a definite A+.  Worth the time spent watching which is hard to say of many movies out there nowadays.  Don't pass it by, I think Jane Austen would have been enamoured with it as well.  Also, look into the \\"Making of Pride and Prejudice\\" book which is chock full of interesting tidbits from the film.
B000006045|5.0|Without a doubt the best trip hop album that will ever be recorded. Id go so far as to even say one of the best electronic-based albums period. I find myself extremely surprised that this cut hasn't had a LOT more attention and appreciation than it has. <br /> <br />Years ago a friend of mine from the UK turned me onto Massive Attack. I loved the first two albums a lot(especially 'Protection'), but Mezzanine's overall gloomy, sleek, sexy, smokey feel just had me obsessed for months.  It still mesmerizes me when I listen to it today.  <br /> <br />Im not completely sure it's true, but i've heard that Robert Del Naja/Daddy G programmed the album on CUBASE. If that's true then someone deserves a grammy or 3. The very well mixed beats and soundscapes work perfectly as an awesome mixture with the real guitar and bass, and with Del Naja's soft, close-to-the-mic rhyme-talking/singing. <br /> <br />From me, this would be an abvious recommendation to all around fans of well done music... but especially to the guys who need some mood to get the woman in the sheets. I'm telling you. A rotation of Mezzanine, Dummy by Portishead, and maybe some B White (or even the sexy soundtrack from the modern Romeo + Juliet) in a 3 disk changer and you're laughin'. <br />
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Finnaly the most original film bought to a two-disc special edition! Yes I loved this film I saw when I was 4 years old and was fascinated with it! I hope you enjoy this film.
B0002S94OS|5.0|i dont know why people today think its stupid for hardcore kids to like and go crazy for Lamb of God. they put breakdowns in there for a reason... lol. much better songwriting than atpb and randy has matured in his writing and the guitar work is even more incredible. this cd surpassed everything i thought it would.
B000957O82|4.0|i saw this movie before in theaters and it was very good. will smith was very hilarious in this movie and i hope he makes another one like this.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|unearth never seems to let people down. constantly getting better, and not changing. sure the stings of conscience was great, but this cd is even better. it was so good to hear metal blade took heed of what these 5 guys were doing and brought it to the masses. the twin guitars of buz and ken are amazing. their breakdowns are back with a vengeance, and the melodies will stay in your head. get this cd asap if you like all that remains, shadows fall, as i lay dying..etc
B00005JNPZ|5.0|Until the final ten minutes of HITCH, this was one of the best romantic comedies I had seen in a long time.  The premise was fairly original, though in a way an inversion of the Cyrano de Bergerac theme.  The difference here is that instead of an ugly man capable of great love who gives voice to a less deserving, but handsome surrogate, Will Smith's Hitch is a man who is afraid of love enabling somewhat unattractive men who are capable of a great love, an opportunity to express it.  Hitch is a date doctor, someone who corrects the errors in a person's dating style that prevents his meeting the woman of his dreams.  The film revolves around two poles:  Hitch's efforts to help the hapless Albert--an overweight, clumsy accountant with bad taste and music and a hopeless dance style--woo the woman of his dreams, the socialite and heiress Allegra Cole on the one hand, and Hitch's own attempts to get to know (but not to love) Sara, a gossip columnist.  I like the way the two story lines intersect and complicate one another, so that at the end of the film Hitch ends up with not one but two disasters to correct.  Like in so many romantic comedies, the way to true happiness is paved with misunderstandings, and this is no exception.  My only problem with the movie is the way Hitch takes care of his own problems at the end of the film.  The person I saw this with hated the ending even more than I did, and she was quite upset that Sara had not taken what she considered to be the minimal steps that should have been expected for Hitch to be able to forgive her before trying to win her back.  I didn't hate the ending as much as she did, but I do agree that the final ten minutes of the film are much, much weaker than the rest of it.  On an intellectual level I understand why the decided to portray Hitch as temporarily bumbling and inarticulate, but I just couldn't buy the particular way that they pulled it off.<br /><br />How nice to see Will Smith in a romantic role!  And how refreshing to see Hollywood present an interracial relationship!  Granted, Eva Mendes is a dark complexioned Hispanic of Cuban descent, but it is one of the very few times we've ever seen a romance between an African American and a person of European descent.  Interracial relationships are common today, so it is nice to see Hollywood stop pretending that they don't occur.  Smith has never been funnier than in this one, and the scene in which he suffers an allergic reaction to shellfish is about as funny as I have seen in a while (the make up is exceptional in that scene).  Eva Mendes I had only scene previously in a film I absolutely detest, TRAINING DAY (as Denzel Washington's wife) and in the mess that was ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO.  She is much better served in this film, and she acquits herself admirably.  She has a feistiness and projects a confidence that I really like.  Kevin James is a stitch as Albert, and reveals himself to be one of the more physically graceful large actors to appear in some time.  Model Amber Valletta is fine as Allegra, the object of Albert's affections, but since she is quite attractive in an arm-trophy sort of way, she was perfect for the role.  Special mention must be made of Jerry Donovan, who is excellent as the reptilian Vance, who wants to hire Hitch to help him \\"bang\\" a girl he had met (Sara's best friend) so that he could forget about her and move on.<br /><br />I will confess that my own personal favorite type of film from the birth of the sound film to the present is the romantic comedy.  I wish as much effort was expended in the making of romantic comedies as in the production of movies based on comic book heroes or remakes of classics or TV shows.  That day may never come, but in the meantime I will be happy to see the occasional excellent representative of the genre such as HITCH.reshing to see Hollywood present an interracial relationship!

Special mention must be made of Jerry Donovan, who is excellent as the reptilian Vance, who wants to hire Hitch to help him \\"bang\\" a girl he had met (Sara's best friend) so that he could forget about her and move on.   <br /> <br />I will confess that my own personal favorite type of film from the birth of the sound film to the present is the romantic comedy.  I wish as much effort was expended in the making of romantic comedies as in the production of movies based on comic book heroes or remakes of classics or TV shows.  That day may never come, but in the meantime I will be happy to see the occasional excellent representative of the genre such as HITCH.
B000000H40|5.0|Obituary has released some pretty good albums, but \\"Cause Of Death\\" is far and away the best.  In fact, it's one of the best death metal releases ever, no question.  I think it's a work of absolute genius myself.  This is the album that really re-kindled my interest in the genre and I keep coming back to it over and over again, because it's that damn good. <br />

B000003TA4|5.0|I am shocked at the amount of people claiming that Nirvana had no talent.  That such bands as Alice In Chains and Sound Garden deserve much more praise becuase of their musical technical abilities.  First off, those bands are 4 piece bands, meaning, if Nirvana had decided to get some awesome electric guitar player, they'd now be considered, by you, as talented.  This is a ridiculous and ignorant way to justify talent.  Talent is creativity, it is dwelling deep within your being and expressing that outward, as Kurt and Nirvana did.  This isn't some contest to determine who can play in the key of bm as cleanly and fast as possible, music is about originality, finding your own inner talent and expressing that as best you can.  They were a band of experimination, the sounds they were creating were almost completely new, this is creativity vs. something like practice and formulaic learning.  Anyways, since when was music supposed to be about talent?  Music is about captivating the listener, moving a person beyond the level of logic, speaking to their very soul.  If music doesn't do this to you, my suggestion to you is to open your ears, stop thinking so much and just listen to the sounds as they are, it's a beautiful thing.
B000654Z2I|5.0|this German band brews up a tribal groove not to be missed--flowing \\"jam\\" in the sense of Grateful Dead but in no other way comparable to this band. Very experimental but gripping throughout. Intense stuff-- don't know what the hell he's singing about, but its sounds really cool. The only CAN album like this--I prefer it to the rest...essential listening. (FYI--Can is a fav band of Thom Yorke and Stereolab (you can really hear the influence in the latter)
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Low-key, competent performances by the entire cast in this remarkable film made for a realistic depiction of J.M. Barrie's life and times.<br /><br />Visually lovely, yet nicely understated, the movie allows the viewer to let their own imagination soar into the Neverland that Barrie created.<br /><br />You'll be moved, and you'll think about the childhood favorite Peter Pan in a whole new way.<br /><br />Reviewer: Linda Painchaud-Steinman, Park Edge Books
B000929AJQ|5.0|Many people who have been fans of NIN since Halo_1, let alone their full length Pretty Hate Machine (Halo_2) believe that NIN's new album With Teeth (Halo_19) is a sell-out and have stated that the NIN have changed totally.  Well, compare PHM with TDS and TF... listn to the instrumental's and the way Trenty sings, it is totally different. <br /> <br />With Teeth is an amazing album, it is written well and the lyrics are amazing... listen 4 the meanings, you will be blasted away.  All the songs also have a totally different sound from eachother... from the slow tempoed and meloncholy sound of \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" to the fast beats and great screaming vocals of \\"You Know What You Are\\"... WT is a great change from The Fragile which was what Trent wanted.  He has put a lot of work into this album for his fans... soo for all you ungrateful fans who call him a sell-out... well... I feel sorry for you... <br /> <br />I give this amazing album a 5/5  ... I suggest you buy it, it is a worthy addition to your Halo collection...
B000001FLA|3.0|This is a solid Malmsteen album, but I will always put his first album as well as \\"Odyssey\\" above this one.  The first 3 tracks are the big commercial singles with lots of keyboards and cheesy vocals.  You get to hear Malmsteen play lead only on the solos and this is the case for the entire album except for the instrumental, \\"Trilogy Suite Opus 5\\".  Therefore, my major argument is that it lacks the freedom you hear on \\"Rising Force\\".  My favorite track, actually, is \\"Magic Mirror.\\"  It has a certain 80's quality to it that you've got to love. <br /> <br />Like I said, I'd pick up \\"Rising Force\\" and \\"Odyssey\\" first, but if you like Malmsteen, it's worth the price of the CD.
B000000OAC|4.0|Vanilla Ice sampled queen, not the other way around. While queen might not be my favorite band ever, they were creative, and no other band sounds like them. Unlike your favorite bands ( nSync, Backstreet, britney, etc). If you like run of the mill pop, then why are you reviewing music that is out of your listening realm? You are giving perfectly good cd's 1 star ratings because you dont like the style of music they play. You need to be booted!!!

B0007TKNII|5.0|\\"Phantom\\" always had all the ingredients in place to become a good film. Action scenes can (and invariably are-sorry, but singers are usually lousy stuntmen) be done better on film than on live stage. The duel between Raoul and the Phantom is a good example of that. It's as good as many of the best duel sequences ever filmed. Special Effects benefit as well. The special effects it used for the stage productions were the best that could be done in a live performance. The film medium offers numerous opportunities to do more while still working in the service of the narrative though. Joel Schumacher takes those opportunities and uses them tastefully. The sequence where Raoul encounters the Phantom in the hall of mirrors is done very well. The scene where Christine sings \\"Wishing You Were Here Again\\" is one of the crowning moments of the film.<br /><br />Problems that plagued the stage production still exist in the film though. Not all of the music is great. The duet between the two managers (Simon Callow and Victor McGuire) seemed so much like something Gilbert and Sullivan would have written that one of them should have announced that he was a \\"Modern Major-General\\". Combining musical dialogue with the spoken word is a risky proposition at best and the stage production didn't always manage to do it spotlessly. The film doesn't either. The \\"method\\" used to provide Christine with a chance to sing is perfect. The transition between rehearsal singing and doing so with full orchestral backing is flawless. Watching Raoul charge down a flight of stairs in full voice knocks the scene on its ear. There are other instances where people seem to be singing when they should be speaking (or vice versa) as well. The build-up to \\"All I Ask of You\\" seems like music that's missing part of its arrangement.<br /><br />These are minor complaints alongside the film as a whole though. Some of the music is among the most appealing to come out of the last century. As a composer Webber's been accused of being overblown and excessive but the fact remains that his work touches hearts very deeply and keeps doing so. His critics may just be jealous. The sets, lighting and photography are fabulous. The story moves along briskly and there are some moments of genuine suspense, no small feat considering that most people who will see this film already know the outcome. The most poignant moments will touch the feelings of all but the most heartless (everyone else will be pausing to dry their eyes). The performances are generally very good.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson doesn't really make much of an impression as Raoul but that's probably because the character was never really given much depth to begin with. Minnie Driver gets most the laughs with her over-the-top performance as (what has to be) the most vain Prima Donna in history. What she doesn't wring from viewers Simon Callow and Victor McGuire (Andre and Piangi) will. Miranda Richardson is wonderfully understated as Madame Giry, the woman who holds the secret of the Phantom. Gerard Butler's voice seems a little harsh at times (especially when he barks out a note instead of singing it) but he plays the part of the tormented Phantom magnificently. His rage is fearsome and his ruthlessness chilling but the beauty enshrouded in his torment is a thing of wonder. Anyone who's ever felt any sense of loneliness at any time will identify with this character.<br /><br />Webber wrote all of the best music from this show for Sarah Brightman (including \\"The Music of the Night\\"-anyone who doesn't believe that should listen to her sing it) and it's a bond she still cherishes. She intertwines with this music as if it was a lover, bathes it with her heart and passion and releases it with a huge part of herself inside whenever she performs it. Everyone involved, audience and orchestra alike, end up in the web. It's impossible to hear her do it and not be moved. Webber knew all of this when he picked Emmy Rossum for the role and he proved that his eye for talent is as sharp as it ever was. The girl is a marvel. She has a lovely voice, one that sounds frail and delicate but has a surprising amount of strength. Her interpretation of the music is her own, and it's valid on its own. She doesn't try to replace Brightman. That would be impossible anyway. What she's done is taken a torch passed to her by Webber and found her own way of carrying it.<br /><br />This is a very good film. But that was a given even before the completion of the project. Webber was on hand as a producer and he's nearly as strong in that area as he is as a composer. He wouldn't knowingly let his greatest triumph go to seed. It would have been a surprise if the film had turned out to be a dog.t is as sharp as it ever was. The girl is a marvel.

B00005UQ9F|3.0|This story had all the elements to be an intelligent, low key thriller on the scale of \\"Rosemary's Baby.  Terrific location, good actors, unlimited story potiental.

Too bad.
B0007GAERG|4.0|First of all to address the one star rating, if anyone feels that the soundtrack Mariah did for Glitter was her best then obviously this person doesn't know much about Mariah. Mariah was at her all time high when she debuted her Rainbow album, but shortly after that she fell off without an afterthought. Hence the new millennium kicked in and the way that we thought and listened to music changed from that of the early to mid 90's. For those of you who remember or even know Mariah debuted one soundtrack and one album in that time called Glitter and Charmbraclet. I'm not going to say the albums were terrible, but Mariah left us with that \\"to be desired\\" after taste, because we we're so use to her coming out and blowing us away. The way that music had changed once the millennium kicked in threw Mariah behind the pitch leaving her to find a new style to blend with her ever so elegant five octaive voice that had enmaroured us for so many years.  <br /> <br />With the debut of this album, I truly believe that Mariah has finally found the mix to once again be the dominate diva that tops our billboards once again. From \\"It's like that\\" to \\"We belong together\\" or even \\"One and Only\\" Mariah blends the new style, yet keeps it simple with what got her to the top of the charts so many years before. Mariah is back and this album is hotter than ever, if you've still haven't picked it up because of doubt, there's no need to wait any longer because she has it back and is better than ever!
B0002G2B2W|5.0|Imagine hearing the news that your ex-girlfriend erased you from her memory. Keep in mind that you are still heartbroken over the end of the relationship. Would you be able to live with the memories knowing that she didn't even know you?<br /><br />In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jim Carrey's character Joel is plagued with the decision to erase Clementine from his memory or not. He decides to, but halfway through the process changes his mind.<br /><br />This movie is unconventional, heartfelt, and hard to put into a category. It is simply amazing. One truly feels the tumultuous emotions that a romantic relationship entails. Instead of simply presenting the great times like some film makers might have done, all sides of the relationship are shown. Clementine is presented as the eccentric, nagging, and complex person that she established herself to be in Joel's mind. Joel is almost exactly her opposite, but through his struggle to deal with Clementine's personality and later his fight to keep even the tiniest memory of her, the audience is given insight to the love that is being erased. The plot unfolds mysteriously almost like a dream.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also wonderful. Elijah Wood plays Patrick, Clementine's desperate new boyfriend. Kirsten Dunst's character Mary works with Patrick and is subject of a plot twist midway through the film.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie can be better understood when the film is completed. It helps make clear the moral that love is unavoidable and sometimes destiny.<br /><br />I am not sure why this film is considered a comedy. It is really more sad than funny, but it is also a thinking film that is presented extraordinarily beautifully.
1400034779|3.0|This book was simple and uncomplicated and showed earthy wisdom and a great love of Africa and its people. But I obviously didn't find it as fascinating as others. While I read the book in short order, I certainly wouldn't call it a page turner. There was no real suspense to hold my interest.  While it was a decent read, it definitely will not be the most memorable book I've come across.  Use it for change of pace reading.
B000000OE7|5.0|...about Queen's \\"Made in Heaven\\".  It is a magically beautiful final studio album.  The vocal tracks were laid down by Freddy right before his death and additional vocals and instruments were added after he passed.  For the most part, this is an album that is solemn, yet optomistic.  It is not as popular as \\"Innuendo\\" but is basically in the same vein and though not as good, this is a Top-5 Queen album. <br /> <br />The title track sounds like a premonition by Freddy of what is about to come.  His vocals are brilliant, and Brian May has some classic guitar on it.  This is probaby the hardest rocking song on the disc.   <br /> <br />\\"Mother Love\\" is a favorite of mine.  It is extremely sad, and dark both lyrically and musically.  It makes me think of a wounded soul thirsty for attention and love.   <br /> <br />\\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\" has a more pessimistic message: \\"I'm just a shadow of the man I used to be - too many bitter tears are raining down on me; In my tangled state of mind, I've been looking back to find where I went wrong.\\"  I believe this song was used mainly as a filler.  It is a Brian May original that he wrote with some friends in the mid-80's, and he also performs it on the Freddy Mercury tribute concert.  Therefore, I don't think it was a reflection of how Freddy felt, but it is still an awesome song. <br /> <br />The darker songs include the disco-track, \\"You Don't Fool Me,\\" as well as \\"A Winter's Tale\\".  Dark may not be the correct word, but it's not necessarily a happy feeling.   <br /> <br />On a brighter side we have \\"Heaven for Everyone,\\" \\"I was Born to Love You,\\" and \\"It's a Beautiful Day.\\" <br /> <br />Listen to the album yourself.  It's so good, the feelings you will get when listening can only be felt, not explained.
B00092ZL80|5.0|I saw this show live in 2004 and on High Def In-Demand this year. I already have tickets for their next go 'round this summer. I am highly anticipating the release of this DVD because I do believe this to be the entire concert from start to finish. The cover of the DVD states that it is a 2-disc set, so don't go by Amazon's 92 minute description. This will be the whole 2+ hour show and it is amazing. Two of the horniest horn bands of the '70s combining forces to present all of their hits in tandem only to blow the audience away with a full collaborative finale. If you're a fan of either group, this is a must have. Fortunately I am a huge fan of both and this is an ultimate dream come true.
B000002UB6|5.0|On May 8, 1970 a legendary rock group took it's final bow. The Beatles relased their last full album of new material. Though it was recorded prior to ABBEY ROAD, the trumoil filled LET IT BE was released a year later (after the band had offically broken up).  For many critics, this is the band's worst album. I, however, have always had a soft spot for this record. To be fair, the band's in fighting probably kept it from soaring as high as it could have (see LET IT BE...NAKED).  However, peel back the Phil Spector nonsense and what you have is a brilliant acoustic Beatles album.<br /><br />\\"Two of Us\\" a jolly little ditty Paul wrote about the joys of getting lost with Linda in the English countryside is hands down my favorite \\"on the road\\"-type song every written. This song, as well as the whole album, tends to evoke a gray rain soaked highway (with the sun peaking out behind the clouds casting a perfect rainbow). In a way that imagery could be extended to the recording of the album. \\"Dig a Pony\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" are two poetic and beautifully honest Lennon tracks. \\"Across the Universe\\" probably being one of the most covered Beatles songs behind \\"Yesterday.\\"  The song is light and floaty, just like the universe.  Lyrically the song is John's best poetry (yes even better than \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\").<br /><br />\\"I Me Mine\\" is not my favorite Harrison track, but nevertheless manages to fit in with the rest of the country-flavored album. Perhaps that's not a good description, the album isn't very honky tonk...but it does have a Nashville-via-Liverpool sound. \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\" are two funny and appropriate little songlets (despite what Sir Macca may have you think with his nude version).  LET IT BE is most memorable for me because it features the excellent \\"I've Got a Feeling.\\"  This song is the epitomy of why The Beatles worked so well.  The song is really two unrelated songs by Paul and John COMBINED into one. John's \\"Hard Year\\" and Paul's \\"Feeling\\" while seemingly unrelated, merge to form one of the best songs they wrote together. Maybe this is what turns off a lot of the critics, this hodge podging of bits and leftovers...but as a writer I can only sit back and admire how they took two unused songs and melted them into a song that not only eixists as a finished product, but is stronger than the sum of it's parts.<br /><br />Of course, who can talk about LET IT BE and not mention it's two most famous tracks: \\"Let it Be\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road.\\" The title track is a lovely piano ballad, that is both secular and spiritual.  What this song should be called is 'Hope' because that's what it fills you with when you hear it. I can't tell you how many times this song has saved my life. And I mean that.  \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is difficult for me. On one hand, I like the basic song. It's very sentimental and sad (which I like) but I can't stand the Phil Spector-ized original album verison. That said, the LET IT BE...NAKED verison is no good either because though the music is perfect (stripped down to just The Beatles) the lyrics were changed by Paul who opted to us an alternate vocal take. Instead of the familiar \\"anyway you'll never know/the many ways I've tried\\" he opted to make it \\"anyway you've always known/the many ways I've tired.\\"  Why is this a big deal? What makes this song so sad (for me) is that it's about being left alone (and waiting) by someone who doesn't realize how bad a shape that other person is. The song was neutral, it didn't place any blame on him or her...the redux makes her the bad guy (in a sense) because she's \\"always know\\" the many ways he's tried (and still opted to abandon him). This may seem petty, but this alteration ruined this song in ways that Phil Spector can only dream....so as much as it pains me to say...I guess the \\"wall of sound\\" version is the better of the two. Perhaps someday we'll be able to bootleg a spliced verison with the LET IT BE...NAKED music with original lyrics.<br /><br />The album leaves us the same way The Beatles did (at least as far as live public gigs)...with \\"Get Back.\\" The groovy keyboards/organ and the galloping drum beat coupled with George's usual reserved guitar work are nothing short of genius. Pauls over-the-top crooning will bring a tear to your eye once the final note is played. The last sound we hear is John thanking a crowd of people and saying \\"I hope we passed the audition.\\"  Well John, you passed-with flying colors.c with original lyrics.  <br /> <br />The album leaves us the same way The Beatles did (at least as far as live public gigs)...with \\"Get Back.\\" The groovy keyboards/organ and the galloping drum beat coupled with George's usual reserved guitar work are nothing short of genius.

B000083E79|5.0|In terms of longevity and lasting popularity, Cher is probably the most successful female singer of all time. Sure, many female singers have sold more records, but really, how many artists, male or female, can boast having their first chart single in 1965 and yet not have their biggest hit until 1999? Nobody, that's who.<br /><br />\\"The Very Best Of Cher\\" collects 21 of her biggest songs from a nearly 40 year period, including \\"I Got You Babe\\", \\"Bang Bang\\", \\"Gypsies, Tramps And Thieves\\", \\"Half-Breed\\", \\"Dark Lady\\", \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\" and the worldwide megahit \\"Believe\\". Lesser known recordings like \\"Save Up All Your Tears\\" and \\"All Or Nothing\\" round out the disc. Almost of all these songs are essential for any music fan. My favorite song on here is \\"Just Like Jesse James\\", which successfully combines adult contemporary power ballad with country.<br /><br />Now, I'm sure some of you are wondering what's missing. Well, I've done my research, and there are quite a few songs missing, but I will list the biggest songs missing. Three top ten hits she recorded in Sonny and Cher (\\"Baby, Don't Go\\" (number eight), \\"All I Ever Need Is You\\" (number seven ) and \\"A Cowboys Work Is Never Done\\" (number eight) are missing, as well as three top twenty hits from this era: \\"Just You\\" (number 20), \\"But You're Mine\\" (number 15) and \\"What Now My Love\\" (number 14). From Cher's solo era, the collection leaves off two top ten hits, \\"You Better Sit Down Kids\\" (number nine) and \\"The Way Of Love\\" (number seven). There are also two top twenty hits missing: \\"We All Sleep Alone\\" (number 14) and \\"Love And Understanding\\" (number 17). In my opinion, I would have got rid of \\"Song For The Lonely\\" and \\"All Or Nothing\\" to include one of these songs. Also, I would have preferred the slower, hip hop version of \\"One By One\\" than the fast version here, since it would add a little diversity to the sound of the music on this set.<br /><br />These complaints aside, this is a great starting point for Cher fans.

B00005LB9O|4.0|Why am I writing a review 4 years after it's release? Because I am still listening to it. The album starts off with \\"Sing\\" a powerful song with the funniest video ever. But there are some other brilliant songs as well. Flowers in the windows is such an adorable song, that's great for listening to in the car. Follow the light, too is another song to be credited. Even the humpty dumpy love song, with a rather weird title is quite meaningful. A lot of the songs has beautful choruses, lyrics, pianos, gentle guitars, strings, bass and drums. They use a lot of instrumnets to vary each song. The only reason is doesn't deserve 5 stars is because Side, and The Cage are slightly repetitive and dull. Aside from that - a must buy!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I grew up watching Sci Fi.  My parents got me started on the original Star Trek.  Then, as they came out with new episodes, I watched MacGuyver and Quantumn Leap.  Star Trek: The Next Generation came out, and I didn't think it could get any better than Captain Picard, Data, and Q. <br /> <br />I also grew up *reading* Sci Fi.  I read the Lord of the Rings trilogy when I was 9 years old, then again when I was 13, then again when I was 17, and have read it once a year every year since then.  I read the Star Wars novelizations, Star Trek novelizations, D&D books, \\"Choose Your Own Adventure,\\" and any other fantasy/science-fiction I could get my hands on.  It was all golden to me. <br /> <br />The reason I preface with this information is to inform the reader that I have an extensive background in science fiction and fantasy, and take that background relatively seriously. <br /> <br />So when I say that \\"Firefly\\" is the best science fiction show ever, hopefully that holds a little bit of weight. <br /> <br />From the first minute of the show, the viewer is captivated.  Joss Whedon, the show's director and creator, put his heart and soul into this startling vision of the future.  He made it as realistic as he could, subtley using fantasy and western overtones the whole time.  There is no \\"Prime Directive,\\" and there are very few rules in this future, except the rule that has goverened humans such as ourselves for thousands of years:  The strong survive, the weak fade away. <br /> <br />The entire series has a very western flavor to it, as it should.  It takes place in a solar system that is not our own, but one that is based on human culture.  There are no aliens with weird foreheads, and there are no giant, squid-like space entities.  There are simply humans, rich and poor, good and evil, allied and independent, fighting to survive.  Very much like the frontier lands of America decades and centuries ago, the frontiers of space are unlawful, unruly, uncivilized, and unfamiliar.  Bandits and theives rule those weaker than they, and themselves are ruled by the law of the Alliance, who occasionally show up to make a nuisance of themselves.  The central \\"Core\\" planets have advanced technology, floating cities, and lawful civilization, but the border planets are as dusty and rugged as 1890's Nebraska. <br /> <br />The central character is Captain Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Reynolds, and veteran in the losing side of a war against the Alliance years before.  He has forged out a name and place for himself as a pirate, leading a crew of extraordinarily well-developed characters.  The acting is superb in a day when episodes of \\"Friends\\" and \\"Everybody Loves Raymond,\\" seem to air nonstop on most television sets, and the special effects could put many high-end movies to shame. <br /> <br />Alas, the show only lasted 14 episodes (only 11 of which were aired), because FOX TV fumbled.  They aired the episodes in the wrong order (opting to show the second episode first, since it was more \\"action-packed\\"), and failed to advertise the show at all.  It faded into obscurity, and now has mostly just a cult following. <br /> <br />Everyone who loves TV should see Firefly.  If you love science fiction, fantasy, western, drama, special effects, hot girls, hunky guys, danger, evil, spookiness, or any combination of these, then this show will make you happy.  You'll fly through 14 episodes in 2 days (as I did) and feel like weeping that there are no more shows to come.  And there's a good chance you'll think to yourself, \\"This is the best damn science fiction show ever.\\"
B000065VB0|5.0|Peter Gabriel, former frontman of Genesis, left the band after a couple of years to go off on his own and begin making his own albums by himself. While his first two efforts \\"Car\\" and \\"Scratch\\" are excellent albums in their own right, it is truly here with \\"Melt\\" that he truly finds his place, and creates a sublime album that for all purposes is the perfect album for isolating yourself from the outside world and just letting yourself flow whether it is musically, artistically, or poetically. The sense of isolation emited from the album speaks volumes for the work in general, as the album opens with the pounding drums of Intruder, a song that seems like its ripped right out of a stalkers diary. The tracks blend together with such pristine ease, and the vocals are some of Gabriels best, (right up there with the hallucinogenic trip that is The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway). Overall all the tracks are impeccable, with Biko probably being my favorite track; never has standing up for what you believe in been more true and echoe with such realism and clarity as this track does, and it is the perfect way to end this album. Overall this is probably my favorite Peter Gabriel album besides Passion, but that is more of a soundtrack and pure mind-F#@k than this is, overall each album is great and I would recommend purchasing both as they are honestly some of the best albums put out by Gabriel.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Too bad Amazon won't let you give movies negative stars.   I kept watching thinking maybe this so called movie would get better.  I was told that it was a good movie.  I watched and watched and it just got worse.  What is wrong with the people at the Sundance festival who gave this piece of garbage awards anyway?   <br /> <br />This movie is about a super Nerd.  Even Nerds would avoid this guy.  He seemed to me to be on Prozac and Valium during the entire picture.  Don't waste your time with this garbage or you will be like me and want your 2 hours back.    <br />
0440241413|4.0|I'm not a big fan of \\"chick-lit\\" as a genre, but this book--as well as Sophie Kinsella's other books-- is truly one of the funniest books I've ever read.  I couldn't put it down and I immediately purchased her other books, as well.<br /><br />Rebecca, the heroine, is just hilarious-- justifying her purchases, alternatively ignoring and rueing the financial dilemma she creates for herself.  One doesn't have to be in the same economic predicament Rebecca is in to relate to her.  A fun, fun read.
B000002N2P|4.0|Insomniac makes me yearn for the Green Day of yore; the one where Billie Joe didn't feel the need to say he wants to \\"punch George Bush in the face\\". Sure, we'd all like to do that, but he could've at least expressed his dismay in a clever way... and American Idiot doesn't count. What a dreadful album. It's full of Billie Joe's half-arsed attempts at \\"expressing\\" his political views. And even though I share his disdain for the current administration, I still think Billie communicates his ideas so poorly that they don't mean much of anything. Leave the social commentary to the articulate, Billie. Thankfully, Insomniac has no politics, and no point... other than to show how self-depreciative we all can be sometimes. Billie should stick to the kind of introspective lyrics like the ones on these songs. With lyrics of self-destruction and self-alienation coupled with bright and sunny guitar riffs, this baby's a winner. The lyrics are extremely negative, but the music (thankfully) takes some of the edge off the songs.  <br /> <br />Personal faves: <br />\\"86\\" <br />\\"Westbound Sign\\" <br />\\"Walking Contradiction\\" <br />\\"Stuart & the Ave.\\" <br />\\"No Pride\\" <br />\\"Geek Stink Breath\\" <br />\\"Brain Stew\\" <br /> <br />Yeah, I listed about half the album, but it's just that good. Check out Nimrod too. And let's just say \\"Warning\\" is an apt title for the band's fourth major label release.
0440237688|5.0|As a high school senior, I am always looking for a book that gets my attention and holds it. I have found that book. It is THE GIVER By Lois Lowery. At the start of the book I thought that it would just be an ok book, but as I read farther and farther into it, I found out that I was wrong. I found that it is a great book to read. <br /> <br />The book begins with a young man named Jonas who is outside and he sees a plane flying overhead.  What's the big deal, you ask?  Planes are not supposed to fly over the village, so the people are all shocked.  This is just one strange thing about this community.  The village is its own little world with every thing controlled. Everybody gets a job assigned to them when they turn 12. Jonas becomes 12 and is assigned the job of receiver of memories which is a big honor. But will it be too much for him to handle? <br /> <br />The book is an interesting look at a society trying to control everything it can in its town. As you read you will see all the crazy things they do and how it doesn't always work. You will see how they suppress love and other feelings and even color. <br /> <br />Overall, I believe this is a good book for seniors or any high school student to read.  While many schools use this book in younger grades, I recommend this book for older students because of the complex ideas. I also recommend it to people of any age who like realistic sci-fi.  It's interesting to wonder:  how far are we from having this perfect society, and do we really want it??? <br />
B000274THQ|5.0|This German movie may have elements that Americans miss, but the underlying story is universal -- what a young man who loves his mother will do.  The film is set in East Berlin and begins right before the reunification (the destruction of the Berlin Wall).  The young man (Alex) has a mother who is a faithful Communist Party member who was abandoned by their father, who left for the West.  After she has a heart attack that leaves her in a coma for months before finally regaining consciousness, he wants to take her home to care of her.  The doctors warn him that any shock could kill her, and he thinks that hearing about the collapse of communism in Germany might do it.  So he brings her home and sets about creating an environment for her in which East and West Germany are still separate.  Even though she's bedridden, it's not easy.  He insists that the radio is broken but she wants to watch TV, so he has to create news broadcasts for her to go in with the videotapes they are using to simulate television.  She wants her favorite brand of East German pickles -- no longer available.  He jumps through all kinds of hoops keeping up this charade despite the pleas of his sister and his girlfriend to tell his mother the truth. <br /> <br />Obviously a lot of this movie is about the politics of Germany -- and it raises some questions about what constitutes the good life.  Is it free access to Coca-Cola or is a less stressful life better? <br /> <br />My only criticism would be that the movie is perhaps a bit long.  Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000002UUX|5.0|Whether or not megadeth is just an offshoot or metallica is up to the fans to decide. As you most likely know, Dave Mustaine (vocalist, rhythm guitarist and main writer for megadeth) was kicked out of metallica in 1983 for drug abuse. That same year he formed his own little band of jazz-thrash-metal (along with jazz guitarist Chris Poland) and released the album Killing Is My Business... And Business is Good! in 1985. Aggressive, fast paced, intelligent, and at times simply silly, it showed the perfect combination of Jazz and Thrash metal. Metallica obviously kicked themselves for letting mustaine go, and if they did not feel that way upon hearing the opening track, they must have upon hearing Mechanix, mustaine's original version of metallica's Four Horsemen. Twice as fast, twice as skilled and twice as coherent, it was Mustaine's way of lashing back at metallica for them continuing to play his songs after he left, which they had the nerve to continue doing in their timeless classic Ride The Lightning. Fast forward 5 years and you see megadeth with a new lineup, with expert guitarist Marty Friedman. If Peace Sells was a great album due to its anti-social themes, politically minded lyrics and guitar interplay (all of which Rust In Peace possesses by the way), Rust In Peace improved the guitar solo even further. Name me another band where the Rhythm Guitarist and Lead Guitarist are almost equals (AND manage to pull it off without sucking) and their master work would still not compete with Rust In Peace. Granted some bands may have one guitarist capable of ripping these awesome solos. But can you name one with two? Metallica you say? I don't think so. While Friedman Mustaine and Hammet are all at about the same level, Hetfeild can hardly compete with Kurt Cobain, let alone Mustaine (admittedly the weakest of the aforementioned guitarists). Now I do tend to ramble, so let me just give a quick breakdown of the tracks and how I rate them.<br /><br />1. Holy Wars... The Punishment Due- From the opening solo, you can tell that you are listening to the work of a great guitarist(s). Lyrics continue Peace Sells's political agenda. And then go into a different song about superheroes. Brilliant! 10/10<br /><br />2. Hangar 18- James Bond-ish opening. Based On Call of Ktulu. Possibly the most famous track from this album. Goes into conspiracy theory about aliens and stuff. The ending solo has a little duel going on between Mustaine and Friedman (i.e. one plays a small crazy sub-solo, drum interlude and them the other plays and it continues like that for a while) the most technically accomplished solo on this album (or possibly ever)by far. 11/10<br /><br />3. Take No Prisoners- More political stuff. I think you can tell by the title as you did in Holy Wars. Solo was not that much of a standout (especially after Hangar 18) but still good. The best part is the ending chant. 9/10<br /><br />4. Five Magics- This is the \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" song on this album. Cool opening and tis almost as moody as KIMB's Looking Down The Cross. Cool lyrics and good guitar work. But not as good as the opening two tracks. Still, its almost epic. 10/10<br /><br />5. Poison Was The Cure - Another cool opening. This one is more of a jumble of words with a nifty little solo. I can swear i heard \\"Set Fire To Metallica\\" somewhere in the track. Not very long but adds mood to the album. Would be a 9 if it was longer and had a longer solo. 8/10<br /><br />6. Lucretia- Good grove to the track. Cool lyrics and vocal performance by mustaine. Guitar work was not very standout on this one though. But it does add a bit of a groovy feel to the album. Not the best track but still awesome. 8/10<br /><br />7. Tornado Of Souls- This is my personal favorite track from the album. I love the lyrics and guitar work. But the part that does it for me is the crazy solo. It is one of the most underappreciated solos i have ever heard. It sounds almost like the Hotel California solo. Whileit is not as complex muscially as Hangar 18, it sounds much cooler since it is slower and you can actually hear each separate note. Killer Track. I can listen to it for hours 12/10.<br /><br />8. Dawn Patrol- Just a bassline with Mustaine rapping about the environment in a fake british accent. Metallica stole the baseline in its \\"God That Failed\\". Not the best track, but it doesnt last too long fortunately. Seems more like a prelude to the end track. 7/10<br /><br />9. Rust In Peace... Polaris- Lots of good vocal work. Lyrically, this is my favorite track. They even have vic doing the deep voice which is really cool. it has a bit of a feel like the \\"bohemian rhapsody\\" operatic part, except with much less clean vocals. Good guitar work though no standout solo. But the lyrics and vocal performance of mustaine save it from extinction. Killer Track. Ends too fast. Awesome end chant. 10/10<br /><br />In Short. Kill 'em All Popularized Thrash. Peace Sells Revolutionized Thash. Rust In Peace Perfected Thrash.much cooler since it is slower and you can actually hear each separate note. Killer Track.

0440237688|2.0|I'm not sure what lesson the author intended but I wouldn't want my children to read this book.  Better that they should read Heinlein.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|The second series of The O.C. aired in England in January after 3 months of me continuously watching the first series on DVD waiting in desperation for the second series and after watching the first episode I was a bit disappointed but after the first not-as-great-as-usual episode the series picked up and was great again. This series hasn't been as good as the first but this was to be expected as the first series was world-class but this progamme is still the best show on T.V. and Seth is still the best character on T.V. Can't wait for the release of the boxset and the extras look quite good on this boxset.
B000002J09|1.0|This music is as bad as Spinal Tap. Screeching is not singing, it is banshee wailing. Jimmy Page was better in The Yardbirds and any number of recordings where he was a session player in the 60s (and there were a lot of them, including Donovan's \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\"). AND IF I HAVE TO HEAR 'STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN' ONE MORE TIME I'LL GET ILL. No wonder Pete Townshend of The Who said that he never liked the band. He's obviously got good taste.
0156027321|2.0|Perhaps I'm not as \\"deep\\" as some others who have read this book and experienced a life changing religious epiphany, since I found this story to be quite ludicrous.  The writing style was pretty good but I found the plot line to be severely lacking.  At times the main character, Pi, speaks like the young person that he is however at other times I got the feeling that Pi had been possessed by the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi, save for the fact that Gandhi preached non-violence and this book is full of violent acts of the nastiest kind.  If you want to read a genuinely fine and philosophical sea story I strongly suggest Ernest Hemmingway's \\"Old Man and the Sea\\", however if you have a couple months of free time then work your way through \\"Life of Pi.\\"  I bet this book is quite popular in prisons for killing time while serving out long term sentences.
B00025ETIW|3.0|Okay guys we get it. You're mad because my chemical romance are gathering more followers by the second instead of really good metal bands like Strapping young lad. <br />I'm assuming, well actually I know that the majority of  the my chemical romance fan base are women. Unfortunately, shallow as it seems, most women would much rather listen to that pretty boy then Metallica and Soulfly with their ugly mugs. A mean why would you want an unkept, smelly hairy man when you can have baby face Gerard, in a snappy suit who is sooooooo pretty he's almost androgynous. Makes me want to throw him down and have my way with him. It's kind of like men with Britney spears. Her music (if you can call it that) absolutely blows, but that doesn't stop them from having sweet dreams about her, if ya know what I mean. So I guess its one up on you. In a world where image seems to matter more then talent, chemical romance have it in spades. I don't care much for their music, I'm more into bands like tool, amen, system of a down and skinny puppy but when their videos come on I will watch it because he's f*cking cute alright! <br />Thank you. <br />
0553382179|4.0|I have been to the web site and have been receiving numerous emails a day about my sink, my shoes, my laundry and finally when I should go to bed.  I was just about to scream, when a neigbor suggested I read this book.  And finally, I get it.  Life should not be difficult, we should treat our famlies, our homes better then how we treat company.  So much of this book is common sense, but when you see it in black and white it puts everything in perspective.  This is a very good book, and reminds me a little of every woman I have ever met.  So much so I have bought one for my mother.  My mother has spent 50+ years running around like a chicken with her head off, and I think it is time for her to let go of the chaos.
B000001GK9|5.0|Based on past recordings from DG and from von Karajan DG recordings especially, I believe that I have extremely high expectations when I purchanse another one. It has rarely, if ever, happened that a recording has far surpassed them the way this particular one did. <br /> <br />It takes a lot of effort, skill, and to some extent, luck to be able to pull off a superb performance of any of Mahler's symphonies, and I believe the second, third, and the ninth are some of the hardest pieces of classical music to orchestrate. The way von Karajan leads the Berlin symphony in this recording however is simply stunning. The changes of mood illustrated from movement to movement, are Im sure, exactly the way Mahler envisaged them. As varied as the movements are, the transitions feel remarkable natural, and almost seem to be telling a story, though you are never really sure what the conclusion to this majestic musical tale is about to be until you approach the end, and then its simply breathtaking and wholly unexpected. The percussion and the horns are extravagant and every bit as glorius as they can possibly be at the end.  <br /> <br />DG should be commended for releasing such a wonderful high quality recording, albeit at a slightly inflated price, but soemthing that dosent feel too unreasonable given the quality of the experience you'll have listening to this piece.
0380973464|5.0|I read a lot, a whole lot. I first read this monster from the library the month it came out, decided (after I had recovered from the experience) that it was probably the best thing I'd read in the whole of the `90s, went out and bought a hardback for myself, and set it in a place of honor on my shelves. Nearly six years on, I find that aging has only improved it. I've been working my way slowly through his recent trilogy, but Cryptonomicon is still better. His characters exist in a t least five dimensions and will stick with you from a long, long time. There's Lawrence Waterhouse, math prodigy and buddy of Alan Turing, who becomes one of the key codebreakers of World War II. There's Marine raider Bobby Shaftoe, a survivor of everything the war can throw at him -- except heroism. There's Randy Waterhouse, Lawrence's equally nerdy grandson, master Unix hacker, and generally nice guy. There's America Shaftoe, partly-Filipino granddaughter of Bobby, master deep diver, and all-round tough cookie -- which doesn't keep Randy and Amy from falling in love. There's Avi, Randy's best friend and front-man in all their business ventures -- in this case, building the world's first politically independent data haven, much to the dismay of major governments. There's Lieut. Goto Dengo, engineer for the Nipponese army and builder of the primary hiding place of Japan's stolen billions in gold bullion. And, moving like mist between the two separate generations, there's the _eminence gris_ Enoch Root, Catholic priest, doctor, cryptographer, conspirator, and take-no-prisoners philosopher. Add to this list several dozen supporting players, all equally well realized, and the richness of the narrative texture is unbelievable. Besides the sheer enjoyment you get from Stephenson's Roman-candle style, his highly original metaphors and similes, and his ironic sense of humor, you're gonna learn a lot about cryptography (both the wartime vintage and the present-day digital variety), and about irregular warfare, and a score of other subjects. Yes, it's a huge book -- but it has to be. The heft also allows space for the author's sprawling digressions on topics as diverse as jungle survival, the similarities between computers and church organs, granny-grade furniture, U-boat life, several Holocausts, imprinting of sexual fetishes, Finnish psychology, the neuro-sociological origins of the ancient Greek pantheon, how to divide up an inheritance, the socioeconomic underpinnings of paper currency, and the proper way to eat Cap'n Crunch. It doesn't all advance the plot, but don't worry about it. Every single paragraph in this thing is worth reading, savoring, and storing away for later rethinking. I'll be reading it against in another decade.egular warfare, and a score of other subjects. Yes, it's a huge book -- but it has to be.

B00005ABIP|3.0|Prior to recording this one, Greg Brown..electric guitarist and organist for the band..left the group. Many are pinning the blame for a less stellar album here on Brown's departure but I don't think that rings true. Granted, Brown was responsible for \\"The Distance\\", arguably the single best track on their last CD FASHION NUGGET, but he was also partly responsible for \\"Race Car Ya-Yas\\", easily the dog of that disc. All told, Brown wrote or co-wrote only 4 of the album's 14 tracks so it seems a bit overstating the case to say it's his departure that's caused a quality dropoff. Maybe the blame can be laid at lead singer John McCrea's feet. Whereas the first 2 Cake CDs were \\"Produced by Cake\\", this one is \\"Produced by John McCrea, arranged by Cake\\" which reveals he had a firmer hand in the final outcome of this disc.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />PROLONGING THE MAGIC doesn't bottom out much, nor does it have very many peaks. \\"Never There\\" was a catchy deserved hit. \\"You Turn the Screws\\" is a rant against the music biz. \\"Sheep Go to Heaven\\" is probably a Biblical allusion to Judgement day when the sinful (the \\"goats\\") would be sent to He11. McCrea touts the virtues of hedonism here. (\\"I just want to play on my pan-pipes/I just want to drink me some wine/As soon as you're born you start dying/so you might as well have a good time..\\") \\"Let me Go\\" is a lover's plea for freedom within the relationship (\\"let me go, she said, let me go, she said/let me go and I will want you more\\")<br /><br />LOWS:<br />There aren't really any awful songs here, but I'm not particularly wowed by \\"Guitar\\" or \\"Walk on By\\".<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />This is not a BAD outing, but I would say it's a definite backwards step in terms of the quality of the songs from FASHION NUGGET. There's more filler and fewer stellar moments, making it a fairly average recording. Perhaps McCrea's pen will be sharper next time..or the other members will step up more often with material.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Behemoth is one of metal's great success stories.  Formed by Adam Darski aka Nergal at the age of 14, Behemoth began as a primitive black metal band in Poland's underground scene.  Classic releases like \\"And the Forests Dream Eternally\\" and \\"Sventevith (Storming near the Baltic)\\" gained Behemoth a steady following.  The 1999 album \\"Satanica\\" introduced a strong death metal element, which alienated many fans but helped establish a unique sound, propelling Behemoth to the next level.  A relentless work ethic and increasingly visible tours with the likes of Deicide, Morbid Angel, and Suffocation have turned Behemoth into a worldwide phenomenon. <br /> <br />\\"Demigod,\\" Behemoth's new album, wastes no notes, a feat considering its speed and brutality.  Guitars and drums blast through militant rhythms and Middle Eastern tonalities, creating an epic backdrop for Nergal's massive vocals.  Highlights abound, such as Nile's Karl Sanders' solo on \\"Xul\\" and the acoustic guitar bits scattered throughout.  The ethos is reminiscent of Morbid Angel, down to the invocation of the Ancient Ones.  However, the riffs and solos are more accessible, and the songwriting more compact.  This is a damn near perfect album.
B000003CKH|4.0|The template musically was in place on their debut MOTORCADE OF GENEROUSITY. What John McCrea and co. do on this one is beef up the arrangements to make them more complex and spend more time on the songwriting. As a result, this one plays better as a whole and offers up more moments that stick than the first disc did.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />\\"The Distance\\" is one of 2 big alt rock hits here. It's a zippy pastiche of 50s sci-fi TV show synth and muscular guitar and easy to tell why it was a hit. \\"Friend is a Four Letter Word\\" is a tricky lyric that suggests the 4 letter word might be \\"OVER\\" though he wants it to be \\"LOVE\\". (When I go fishing for the words I am wishing you would say to me/I'm really only praying/That the words you'll soon be saying/Might betray the way you feel about me\\"). \\"Daria\\" paints the picture of a man who doesn't love himself and won't allow anyone else to either. A burbling bass line from Victor Damiani anchors an irrestible cover of Gloria Gaynor's 70s disco smash \\"I Will Survive\\". [NOTE: The band loses points for tossing in a superfluous \\"F-bomb\\" that wasn't in the original. The song makes its point on its own without throwing in a swear word to make it more \\"angsty\\".] It goes into near-orbit when a stinging guitar part comes in near the fadeout. \\"Stickshifts and Safetybelts\\" is a country shuffle that plays like a 90s update of old 50s rockabilly tune \\"Hot Rod Lincoln\\". Doris Day chestnut \\"Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps\\" is redone with Latin tinges intact courtesy of Vince di Fiore's mariachi trumpet. Yuppie holdovers are the mainstays of \\"Italian Leather Sofa\\" (\\"She doesn't care/Whether or not he's an island/She doesn't care,/Just as long as his ship's coming in...\\") The gloom is left intact on a worthy cover of Willie Nelson's classic \\"Sad Songs and Waltzes\\".<br /><br />LOWS:<br />\\"Frank Sinatra\\" unfortunately was chosen to introduce the album and it's rather lackluster. People sampling it in music stores may give up after this one and if they do, it's a shame. The horrid off-key clanging harmony vocals on \\"Open Book\\" are probably intended to be \\"loose and relaxed\\" but they end up jarring. Worst track here for sure is \\"Race Car Ya-Yas\\" which just feels like a throwaway track written at the last second to pad out the CD. Most of the lyric consists of the phrase \\"land of race car ya-yas\\" repeated again and again and uses genitalia as part of a simile comparison with hanging fuzzy dice. (y'know..the ones people dangle off their rear view mirrors). It's every bit as bad as the description would suggest.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />This is a big step forward for the band from MOTORCADE. More actual songs rather than just exercises in quirkiness. Even the \\"filler\\" tracks are mediocre rather than bad for the most part. Recommended for all fans of alternative rock and more open minded pop fans (McCrea is very accessible when he puts his mind to it).horrid off-key clanging harmony vocals on \\"Open Book\\" are probably intended to be \\"loose and relaxed\\" but they end up jarring.

B000059S9D|5.0|I should start by saying that I've been buying Porcupine Tree albums for about 10 years now, and that I'd give at least four stars to every one I own.  I do own many other albums, but I tend to write reviews only for the CD's that I really like.    The things I like in Porcupine Tree are some of the same things I like in Pink Floyd.  They can write long epic songs, with enough variety in a song (and between songs) to keep the music interesting.  The songs have good lyrics, and generally just enough lyrics to get across the point of the song.  There are some progressive-rock groups where I really like the music they do, but I feel like they're speed-reading a book of lyrics at me.  I don't want to have to work that much to catch everything that's being said!    This album isn't a carbon-copy of a Pink Floyd album, but it does pick up one \\"trick\\" that David Gilmour knows.  When writing a song, it's just as important to think about \\"silence\\" as it is to think about \\"sound\\".  A song can have a second or two of silence at some point, and that silence *will* be \\"the right note for that moment\\".  A song doesn't have to be \\"just slow\\" or \\"just fast\\" for the entire length of the song.  While some songs need the big pounding drums or dramatic guitar work, other songs really work best with a quiet backing of violins.  It depends on the mood of the song.    As to the songs here, \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" is a song about someone who is sick in bed.  I was sick a lot when I was young, so I can really relate to the lyrics and the \\"feel\\" of this song.  I think it's a great song, but maybe I identify with it more than most people would.    Several songs on this album are about a broken relationship.  For \\"Shesmovedon\\", I like how they have the title as a single word.  It's a single irrefutable statement.  Sure, you may still be stuck on that former girlfriend, but, hey, \\"shesmovedon\\".  There's a solid brick wall up, and you just ain't getting her back!  \\"Hatesong\\" is a somewhat amusing song,if you're into dark humor...  There's only a few lyrics, but they do a fine job for setting the stage for the song.  Musically it's a dark brooding song, and that certain fits the lyrics of ``This is a hate song, meant just for you...'', and ``Yes I'm hearing voices too, and I'm more cut up than you!''.  And as you might guess from the title, \\"Feel So Low\\" isn't exactly a happy-happy song either:  ``And each day that you forgot to call, just made me feel so low -- so low\\".  (solo = so low?)    PTree generally has at least one epic-ish long song on every album, and the song for this album is \\"Russia on Ice\\".  The lyrics are a bit obscure and vague, but to me it's basically a song about a guy who's drinking too much after breaking up with a girlfriend.  You've got a relationship which has gone cold, and you're going to keep drinking those Black Russians until your stomach is gone...  But there's only a few lyrics to the song, it's the instrumental work that makes this really epic.  It's 20 seconds worth of lyrics, in a 13-minute song.  It's up to you, the listener, to fill in all the details which the lyrics don't explicitly cover.  Using Your Details, not someone else's.  This is a great song.    This 2-CD version includes the *short* (6-minute) version of \\"Buying New Soul\\", where the 10-minute version would show up on the limited-release CD called \\"Recordings\\".  This is another Great Song (either version...).  It is pretty hard to get a copy of \\"Recordings\\" these days, but then it's also hard to get hold of \\"Lightbulb Sun\\"!  (as you might guess by the price of $22 for *used* copies!!).  There should be a re-release of \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" sometime in the next year or two, if I recall correctly.  So you might want to wait for that instead of spending so much for used copies.  Several of these songs (including \\"Russia on Ice\\" and \\"Hatesong\\") are also on their live album titled \\"Warszawa\\", which was released early in 2005.  So would be a good way to hear some of these songswhile you're waiting for the re-release of \\"Lightbulb Sun\\".    For fans who have heard \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Deadwing\\", this album is a little slower and quieter than those two albums.  Those albums have a much more upfront aggressive punch in some of their songs, but this album is closer to the slower songs on those albums (particularly \\"Deadwing\\").  It includes a few songs which are a bit closer to \\"accessible pop music\\" than PTree usually comes up with.  There is some great keyboard work from Richard Barbieri, plenty of drums, and lots of memorable guitar work here.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|This was the worst documentary I've ever seen! When I heard there was going to be a documentary about Metallica I was thrilled! Couldn't wait to see it. Well I wish I didn't waste my money. I even turned it off 3/4 of the way through because I simpley couldn't stand it! (and I never turn off films) If you like group hugs, and a shrink to help express your feelings about how to open a pop can with out upsetting anyone, than this is the movie for you.<BR>I don't mind the therapeutic process.. BUT FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE?!? No wonder I never heard anything about it after it got released. I'm more irritated than anything. I was expecting a rock'n movie about one of the most pivotal metal bands ever to record an album... But instead it's just a long.. long, therapy session. Absolutly nothing about the past albums, life on the road, or anything else to do with the band other than their communication problems.. boooorrring!!!!!!!!!!!
0743454529|5.0|What an amazing book. This is one of those books where you resent anything that pulls you away from reading it - you know, things like friends, family, the outside world.  I finished it in a single day and immediately wanted more! I'm anxious to see if Picoult's other books are equally engrossing. <br /> <br />Normally, books in which the narration switches between characters annoy me. First-person is tough to pull off to begin with, and when you start jumping around between different viewpoints it takes a deft hand to keep the transitions from jarring you out of the story. Fortunately, Picoult has that hand. Her voices, from thirteen-year-old protagonist Anna to her delinquent older brother Jesse, to both of their parents, to Anna's cynical lawyer Campbell, are all authentic, sympathetic, and *real*. By sympathetic, I don't mean that we necessarily come to sympathize with each character - in a book like this, it's impossible. But we at least come to understand the differing motivations and priorities that drive each character, so that their actions - whether we agree with them or not - are natural and justifiable.  <br /> <br />Case in point, Anna and Kate's mother, Sara. Sara is, IMHO, a monster. The woman should never have had children, and she should CERTAINLY not have had Anna, whom she uses, exploits, and ignores shamelessly while showering her older daughter, Kate, with love and attention. But in Sara's mind, her obvious favoritism becomes perfectly justifiable - and because of that, while we may want to hold her down and tie her tubes (if not outright strangle her) we at least understand why she does and says the things she does. It doesn't excuse her, but it keeps her from becoming a caricature, an easily identifiable villain.  <br /> <br />This complexity is what I so enjoyed about \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", because it is such a rarity these days to find books that don't use shortcuts and stock characters to tell the story. Speaking of, the main story itself isinteresting and provocative, but a subplot involving a romance between Anna's lawyer and her court-appointed guardian disappoints, being rather forced and overly melodramatic, and not as tied to the main plot as it should be. And the ending! I won't give it away, but after several hundred pages of clinging desperately to the story, the final chapter will make you want to fling the book across the room. There's no excuse for such a cop-out in the final 10% of a book when the first nine-tenths has been so marvelous. <br /> <br />However, Picoult does a great job giving us an ethical quandary to ponder without preaching at us. Apart from a few questionable storytelling tactics, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" for its amazing characters and its thought provoking plot.  <br />
B000083C49|5.0|I remember watching this in the theatre when it first came out and now that all the films are available on DVD I have been steadily collecting them..This is one of the best in that it has a fantastic commentary by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy that offers quite a bit of insight into the making of the film!  This film has quite a bit of humor..more so than the earlier and subsequent films..I think this made the film a lot more fun and gave us more of a glimpse into the characters and chemistry among the original cast..I think Nimoy did a fine job of directing the film and from what I understand this film was one of the bigger successes of the 6 films..no wonder..it's a classic! Like many of TOS episodes I feel the producers and directors of the films wanted a lasting testament to the ideals that Gene Roddenberry first crafted in his original stories..they did a fine job!  The DVD quality is excellent and the audio is amazing!
B0007DAZW8|5.0|ok. first, hello. <br />   this cd isn't perfect.  but none of them are... <br />         if you're looking for another DISCOVERY, this cd may not apply to you.   <br />    DAFT PUNK (DP) is house music.  it's strong, hard, cold, solid beats.  it makes people feel like dancing, in slow, mechanical movements. <br />    most people know DP from DISCOVERY.  these people shoud take a look at HOMEWORK.  if there was ever a surprise, it was with DISCOVERY.  DISCOVERY was a good cd, but it was a complete change from DP older style.  DISCOVERY was pop.  but it worked. <br />   and so does this cd.  DP is constantly changing, evolving.  i sound crazy, but you can hear it in their style, from cd to cd. <br />    anyway,  this cd incorporates HOMEWORK with DISCOVERY.  it's hard house beats with electronic voices.  don't listen when people say it gets repetitive.  DP may sound repetitive to an untrained ear.  but if you listen carefully, you hear progression.  start with a basic sound, then slowly add more sounds and slowly build up to your focal point/climax. <br />    don't forget people...DP is from france.  the house scene is huge  there.  DP can still shine in a midst of gems.  this cd is worth your money, depending on what you want.  like i said before, if you want another DISCOVERY, you probably won't like this.  if you liked HOMEWORK, you might appreciate this more.  if you like the newer DP-affiliated music (CRYDAMOURE), you'll like this cd. <br />   i won't go thru a breakthru of songs.  it's all solid.  and some songs are better than others.   <br />   i rated this cd a 5 stars.  becuz DP went back to their roots, underground dark house beats, just like HOMEWORK.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The usual acclaim.<br /><br />Absolutely beautiful, inspiring, uplifting music. I had tears in my eyes within the first 15 minutes. I've appreciated A.L.Webber's music since JC-SuperStar, this along with Evita are showcases for his technique. But i'm not really interested in music, i dwell on ideas.<br /><br />From the top it is the battle of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, Heaven and Hell. big deal, lots of movies and great amounts of literature are about this theme.<br /><br />What is fascinating about PotO is how it leads into what we find persuasive and compelling.<br /><br />Good has no character development, it seems almost absurd to think that Christine would choose the calvary officer. He is just a pretty boy from her pre-opera days.<br /><br />It is only the character of evil that is developed, and he grows as he teaches and shapes his progeny, the beautiful young virginal white untouched untested unknown singer.<br /><br />Evil is talented, busy (just lighting all those candles, to say nothing of moving the huge pipe organ into the catacombs and teaching himself how to play and write music for it) a genius with just a little baggage. Evil is seductive, Christine is forgiven for loving him since he goes to her at night, in her dreams. Evil is in control, dictating conditions to the owners of the opera house, demanding a weekly salary, possibly the real author of all the great pieces performed there. Evil is of course, defective, but it is not his fault, he was born that way and mistreated until he snapped. His outrage at mistreatment, his hatred of the world above is understandable and forgivable. Not a critical character fault, but a birth defect. His ugliness, his face is repulsive but people's response to it explains and excuses the stain of evil on his soul. His genius, his musical talent, his moody and provocative music is the good result of his brooding on evil and his alienation from the rest of mankind. It is not that evil chooses to wallow in sin, but that sin is unjustifiably forced on a young boy who just responses as we all would. He is excused.<br /><br />As modern people we find this persuasive, we find it beautiful as the female voice intertwines and weaves just above the deeper male voice. The music's point and counterpoint dance just as<br /><br />Evil wanted their bodies to dance and intertwine on his swan bed. But he wanted to seduce her, a willing mate, not to rape her. With his voice, with his talent, with his music he wanted to substitute for the face that repelled her, to attract her soul, her beautiful heavenly voice to his underground grotto leaving the naturally lighted world and her potential good lover on the roof. Neat stuff, things we identify with, things we see internally and would dearly love to be seduced by ourselves.<br /><br />This is what i personally find so interesting, the compellingness of the vision, that evil is beautiful, that inspiring music is gorgous despite or even best of it's origin in pain. That talent, that genius no matter how twisted, no matter how murderous is a value to be sought after. It is not really a battle of Good and Evil, for good is simply palid and uninteresting compared to evil, is is a battle to yield to evil, be be allow to submit without loosing innocence. How to be that beautiful virgin in white after spending the night below, the morning after untouched by evil itself just wrapped up in the beauty of it's genius, and that is excusible. She pities evil, she overcomes her repulsion of his mask off, she recognizes not just the beauty of his music, the debt that her gifts owe to him, but most of all she knows that even though she outwardly chooses good (raises a family with him) evil will always return to her in her dreams. and in her music. for no one recognized or tried to develop her gifts but evil did, she owes him all her voice and her success.<br /><br />nice, literary, complex, beautiful. the best of art.<br /><br />it is a window into oursouls and what we find persuasive as evil and the battles it plays in our livesnd persuasive as evil and the battles it plays in our lives
B0002858YS|4.0|ALONG WITH THE STROKES AND INTERPOL, THIS BAND RECALLS THAT SOUND OF THE LATE 70'S AND EARLY 80'S, SOMETIMES SOUNDING LIKE THE FINE POP ROCK OF DURAN DURAN AND THE ALTERNATIVE OF THOSE POST-PUNK BANDS EMERGING FROM THE DEATH OF 70'S UGLY DISCO. FOR THE PRESENT GENERATION NEW TO THIS MUSIC, I RECOMMEND YOU LISTEN TO BANDS LIKE THE SMITHS, PSYCHODELIC FURS, ECHO AND THE BUNNYMEN, PUBLIC IMAGE LIMITED AND OF COURSE THE CURE AND NEW ORDER, AND YOU'LL GET A REALLY GOOD IDEA WHERE THIS GREAT GUITAR AND SYNTH SOUND COMES FROM.
B000929AJQ|3.0|This is still good but not like head banging thrill olympics good. The lyrics are much less refined and eloquent then the older albums. There are still some very good beats but this is certainly not the Nine inch Nails most people identify with. It pretty much carries on the trend of the The Fragile. The only hateful, anti-religious, or mildly obscene songs contain the F-word and no more. A 15 year old can listen and identify with the simplicity of this album, I bet it kicks ass live!
B000001ESJ|5.0|this is rush's best album, matched with 2112..its better then 2112 but they are both amazing. plus they are from canada which makes them better.. rep-ing from toronto!
B00078XKDE|5.0|This album fits the bill if you're looking for some catchy alternative rock in today's polished, superficial music world.  The Kills exhibit skilled, art-type rock that is melodic and yet abrasive.<br /><br />NO WOW starts out with lots of WOW on the song \\"No Wow\\", shifts into poppy-type overdrive on \\"Lve Is a Deserter\\" and \\"Rodeotown\\", a single (\\"Good Ones\\") and \\"I Hate the Way You Love\\".  Those are some highlights, but the album pulls you into playing through the entirety.  Enjoy it for the ride it is!
0312330529|5.0|It's rare when you read a 900-page book and seek additional pages, but that was my first reaction after reading Shantaram.  This is a remarkable epic that is worth reading in spite of a few flaws. <br /> <br />What makes it worth reading is the first two-thirds of the book that is centered in the slums of Bombay.  Obviously there is more than a little autobiographical information in this book, and in this case, the protagonist of the story lands in Bombay while on the run from prison authorities in Australia where he escaped from a maximum security facility. <br /> <br />The depiction of Bombay along with colorful characters such as a friend and benefactor named Prabaker are unforgettable and communicate a wonder and admiration for a new world by a person who is forced to renounce and abandon his existence. <br /> <br />This is the part of the book that I loved and doubt that it will translate well into a movie.  Eventually, the author's travails will take him deeper into a world of crime, the inside of a jail cell and fighting for the Muhadjeen in Afghanistan.  My sense is that some of these stories will make for a great film; they did make for great reading although it wasn't written in the same vivid detail as the first part of the book where the author attempts to fit into slum life in Bombay. <br /> <br />Also, I'll have to admit that I was somewhat troubled by its treatment of the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan.  The book is set in the mid 1970's and while there are brief mentions of the broader political issues of the Middle East, the author almost succeeds in writing a mostly apolitical book.  It's my own personal minor quibble, but any book written after 9/11 that deals with the issues of religion in the Middle East should address a bit more of the largest issues of our times. <br /> <br />All in all, it's a minor quibble, because I think this is one of the best books I've read in a number of years.  While the author has a remarkable story that canalmost write itself, he is also an exceptional writer.  It might seem hard to believe, this 900-page book is actually an easy read. <br /> <br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book and believe that you will be thinking about its content long after you put it down for the last time.  <br />
B0007TKNL0|4.0|The film was awesome--I loved it.  They changed a few things between the stage production and the film, but I enjoyed the changes. For some reason, this DVD had a little trouble playing in my DVD player. My DVD player was purchased less-than a year ago and is a good quality brand. Every few minutes, perhaps at chapter breakers, there is a 5 second pause. It's quite annoying especially in the middle of a song. I rarely (if ever) saw something like this with other DVD disks.
B000683VI4|5.0|Tender, thoughtful, romantic. All the way around a quality movie. Cinematography was great, acting was great. Ryan Gosling as Noah did a superb job. This movie gives you hope that there is real, lasting love out there.
B000805796|3.0|It is easy to compartment artists who have previously been in bands, especially in popular music. When it comes to reviewing an artist that was formerly a part of a sweeping phenomenon, it is hard to detach the history from current efforts.<br /><br />Melanie Chisholm, the sporty one from The Spice Girls, has constantly been subjected to severe denigration post-break up. Even as a part of the campy quintet, she was the target of ridicule and a barrage of criticism over her sexual identity, catapulting her into a whirlwind of self-image issues that resulted in eating disorders, over-exercising, clinical depression and a greater yearning to prove herself as a solo artist.<br /><br />The derivative of this yearning was her debut, Northern Star, which is one of the best mature-pop efforts in popular music thanks to Madonna prot&eacute;g&eacute; William Orbit. Even with an onslaught of skepticism around her, Northern Star managed to notch up a couple of hits from the optimistic title track to the rambunctious \\"Goin' Down.\\" Even extending her contributions to the R&B community in her collaboration with the late Lisa `Left-Eye' Lopes on \\"Never Be The Same Again\\" and to the dance community with her biggest hit to date \\"I Turn To You,\\" which circumvented the clubs of the world through a heap of remixes.<br /><br />Her reign as the spice princess ended after her hymn to the homeless on \\"If That Were Me.\\" Then she became a clich&eacute; of the sophomoric slump.<br /><br />Her second album, Reason, although highly-anticipated, was a commercial dud. The lead single \\"Here It Comes Again\\" was not representative of what was about to happen.<br /><br />Reason offered a grittier Melanie that was high on amp and low on chart-friendly hits. Despite the fact that it carried some strong ditties -- lyrically and sonically, the singles failed to get noticed. \\"On The Horizon\\" provided a great chorus with a lackluster everything else.  Other released tracks like \\"Melt,\\" headed in the right direction to no avail.<br /><br />Reason's stats were so drastically different than Northern Star that Melanie C found herself dropped from her record company and unsigned.<br /><br />Taking matters into hand in a true display of girl power, Melanie C launched her own record label through her funding.<br /><br />Red Girl Records launched Melanie's latest Beautiful Intentions, after what seems to be a business-oriented hiatus.<br /><br />From the onset one can tell that Melanie is more relaxed and unburdened by corporate figureheads. Beautiful Intentions does not attempt to lure in hordes of pop fans or impress anyone. It is a straightforward rock effort that focuses on melodic amalgamation more than making smash hits. As a result, Melanie C fails to conjure up radio-ready tracks, further hindering the marketability of the record.<br /><br />Being independent is evident here, that is not to say that she is any sort of prodigal daughter of Ani DiFranco. However, it is clear that Melanie C has utilized her rock admiration to deliver an album heavy on guitar-laden songs, like the rowdy \\"Take Your Pleasure\\" to the road-trip wonder of \\"Last Night On Earth.<br /><br />Standouts include the trip-hop runaway melody of \\"Don't Need This\\" the head-banger \\"Little Piece Of Me.\\" However, that is more than can be said about the lead single \\"Next Best Superstar,\\" where the superficiality of the record industry is put under the microscope with a pinch of spite.<br /><br />Still, the highlight tracks are the tranquil ones. \\"Better Alone\\" conveys saccharine solace through heartache, while \\"Here And Now\\" develops as a no-regrets anthem with every listen.<br /><br />Other tracks meander between monotonous riffs and reiterated filler.<br /><br />Even Reason had more chart-power. However, this time Melanie looks to another direction and that is of musical satisfaction rather than mainstream success. Beautiful Intentions is an album for Melanie and her fans. Others will have difficulty digesting this mound or girl-rock without prior consideration of the artist./> <br />
B00005JGAB|5.0|Pleeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzzzzzzzzeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, if it were'nt for the Ramones the whole concept of Indie <br />RAWK would'nt even exist...the one band who were comprised totally of degenerate losers who had the balls to construct the <br />most lo-fi down-tuned bop-punk ever laid to vinyl deserve only the utmost of respect...In fact, while mainstream sindication TV <br />was spittin' out retro-50's nostalgia the Ramones were the only band beyond the shadow of a doubt to explore a path beyond ELP <br />or freakin' Boston...nuff said for now!!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britneys BEST song.. This song is great! My niece played this song at her bat-mitzvah party every hour. Ok, I know Britney has no talent writing or playing instruments, but what a cute butt! huh?   <br />Toxic is a masterpiece regardless of WHO is performing it. Who wrote that song anyways?  <br />The rest of this album sucks. Poor Britney.
B00000DD2D|5.0|I tend to stay away from collaborations and stick to the original blues recordings, but I read a few good reviews of this disc and when I saw the line-up of the artists on it, I thought I'd give it a try.  Let me tell you, it doesn't disappoint at all.  This CD has a good drive, a strong rhythm, excellent production values and will definitely pick you up.  This CD has blues classics laid on a British rock foundation.  It doesn't get too much into the rock territory, though.  I thought a really nice balance was achieved between blues and rock, such that the strong drive is always there, but at the same time, this is unmistakably blues, with excellent piano and harp to add to solid guitar work.  Even though there are a few prominent rock guitarrists assembled in this CD, there is no guitar shoot-out here.  The guitars provide a solid, pleasant, easy-to-listen backing but never take over the songs as is often the case in pure blues.  This is a great CD for driving - you will never get any highway hypnosis if you have this CD on.  If you've stayed away from blues but like classic/British rock, give this a try.  If you are blues purist and are suspicious of this all-star line-up, give this a try.  If you are looking to ease smoothly into the blues scene, give this a try.  If you like country rock, give this a try.  I think you can't go wrong with this disc.  This a good value for the money.
B0002YLC24|5.0|The prequel \\"Before Sunrise\\" tells the story of a young man and woman in their early twenties meeting each other on the train, and their spontaneities leads to spending the day and night together, talking in depth about the world, life, love and things that interest a person of their age. From this prequel you get an idea of how the two characters, Jesse and Celine, attracted each other not just physically but personality-wise by their charms. This chance encounter also adds to the drama, and is something we all, at some point in our life, have fantasized about: meeting the person of your dream, except, however, this is not the typical cliche that the couple fall in love on the first sight and made love after getting drunk. You feel that they bonded via talking a lot and exchanging thoughts, despite these thoughts can be crazy at times.     In the sequel \\"Before Sunset\\", it is nine years down the timeline. They met again, in paris, and once again it's a chance encounter. They started catching up with each other, just like what happened in the prequel, only this time the contents of what they talk about have changed by a great deal. In the prequel, there were romantic, lots of naive and idealized thinkings. After nine years, they had both experienced the coldness and cruelty of life which are reflected in their conversations. But somehow one feels that, by expressing their frustrations to each other, like they trust each other with his/her own feeling, they regain their faith of love, and at the same time, perhaps(due to the vague ending), love itself.    I find these two films very special love stories. The conversations they talk about have been experienced by most people. And therefore, while projecting your life onto the characters, you slowly become one of them. This is the magic of this flim. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy acted naturally, which makes it almost feel like a documentary. Sunset is more intense than Sunrise, and there is more dynamics within their conversations, and more emotional ups-and-downs. Julie Delpy's preformance is much better in the sequel than in the prequel, featuring an intense release of frustration of her love life. For me, that was the climax. From then on, you feel that it's the begining of another journey between these two.  In spite of the fact that the ending was perfect, I would say,(not too explicit, but enough to get a satisfication), I still hope that there will be a sequel to Sunset. And hopefully, it won't take another 9 years or anything near to that!  For me, this film is one to watch and keep.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|Four different arists converge simutaneously in that artistic work. The hidden sequel of the racism who affectes the internal life of a man of jew ascencendence who simply refuses to accept his black ascendence. He will lead this lie until his final days. And that's by itself a big problem.<br />In the other hand the term spooky will mean for him a true whirlwind when he makes a simple ironic joke in the middle of a Literature Cathedra Magister Class.<br />Third, the presence of a homeless girl who refuses to be the secret lover of his abusing father after her mother gets the divorce.<br />And finally the troubled mind of a Vietnam veteran who has serious internal wounds.<br />Four traumas that will intersect giving by result and admirable, mature and terrific reflection about the human nature and how Einstein had all the reason when he stated it was much easier to destroy an atom instead a prejuice.<br />Fine acting and splendid photograph.
B00003CXSP|5.0|My review is actually meant to be a comparison of the replacement, for Clarisse, being Julianne Moore, instead of Jodi Foster.  I wanted to go on the record as saying I definitely enjoyed Julianne Moore in this role better than Jodi Foster.  I think I usually prefer the original actor/actress, but in this case I felt that Jodi Foster reminded me more of an uneducated trailer park trash chick, who was like coming up in the world, and meant for great things , while he trains her as her teacher in the way the canibalist thinks.  While I think Julianne Moore seemed more educated, not trailer park trash, but still learning the ropes.  Not that she is the better actress, because I feel they were both really great, but I just think that her whole demeanor was stronger for the part.  This is my opinion, and I hope you other people read this, and watch both, then give a review on which actress you enjoyed more? Thanks.
B0007XT87G|5.0|How do they keep on churning out masterpieces?  Is it the brilliant songwriting of Steven Wilson, a self-taught musical genius?  Is it the incredible instrumental and vocal execution by all of the band members?  Is it the sense of foreboding and melancholy that hits you square in the gut?<br /><br />It is all of these things and more that make Porcupine Tree the most important band in the world that you should be listening to.  This latest album (not just a collection of songs, but a cohesive whole) again proves that they are on the cutting edge of technology, as well as the current emotional state of this disfunctional world.<br /><br />How can one fail to contemplate the arrogance and self-centeredness of our Western world when listening to Shallow and Halo. Whither the despair over our much too human condition, crying out in Arriving Somewhere But Not Here, Open Car, and Mellotron Scratch (Well maybe she remembers us just taking space up in the sky)?  The redemptive grace of Glass Arm Shattering?<br /><br />When the band's back catalog is opened more fully, especially Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun, one will be able to hear the progression in style and emotion over their lengthy career.  Thank God for Porcupine Tree and their cathartic art that will hopefully make this world a more thoughtful place.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Beautiful cinematography and nice use of black/white versus color.  The main themes of this film are innocence, loyalty and the importance of relationship.  No, it's not reality but it is simply lovely.  Gong Li's fresh beautiful face combined with her wonderful colorful clothing and backdrop make for a soothing and well done film.  If you want action, this isn't it.  If you want to feel like you just had a mind massage, see this film.
B00005JNVS|5.0|With the cheesy but nonetheless great nod to Looney Tunes, complete with a splatter against the giant billboard; surprising violence that evokes Quentin Tarantino's \\"Kill Bill\\"; a very stupid plot that only sets up great action sequences one after another; and the traditional video-game showdowns of heroes versus villians, \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" is stupendously silly but fun, fun, fun!  <br /> <br />Directed by Stephen Chow, this movie is a great crowd-pleasure that captures the logic-reducing entertainment of kung-fu and chopsocky movies from the 70's and 80's. It is also enhanched by the combination of slapstick cartoon comedy and of CGI effects that have replaced wires. What you get it is a fantastic, quirky movie that is paradoxically trashy and pure fun at the same time. Knowing what to expect before viewing it should be underway, as it is a movie that not only defies gravity but the reasoning power of a logical brain. Folks, the story doesn't serve the characters to develop, but to thrust them into situations where they can demonstrate their powers and show it throughout outrageous fights, choreographed with perfection and finesse that you cannot help but drop your jaw, even if you have become numb and cynical over the years of post-\\"Matrix\\", post-\\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\". In other words, not exactly a calibre to be nominated for this year's Oscar's \\"Best International Movie\\" award, but nonetheless should be and should also win because it is perfection. Like hamburger, instead of a five-star Texas steak, but the most delicious hamburger you'd ever had. It knows its stupid, but it is earnest, loving and delicate. This is kind of a film that you should appreciate for what it really is. However, it is not just your conventional kung-fu movie. Aside from the chaos and cartoon outlandishness that makes the film over-the-top and giddily energized to the max, there is an element of an operatic musical movie during its fight sequences because of the eloquence of thesoundtrack and how it accompanies the moves of the characters so rightly, and sprinkles of an engaging and heartfelt, albeit predictable, romance halfway throughout the film.  <br /> <br />Words does not do justice to the wonderment of seeing this film; just watch it, halt your brains, and enjoy. One of the best and enjoyable \\"stupid\\" movies in a very long time.
B00081U6EG|3.0|The concert is pretty good with varying types of the music, some of which I don't care too much for. But at least on my disk, there are three things wrong with it: <br />1. The packaging and the DVD disk itself promise a DTS sound. Even though I have a DTS decoder as part of my receiver, there is no option in the disk menu to select that audio option. <br />2. The editorial and the menu promises to have some interviews, but none was found on my copy of the disk. <br />3. There is a moment or two of freezing in the middle of the last song that Paul Rodgers performs with the help of Joe Walsh. This may be due to the transition from one layer to the other, but it is the most apparent among my \\"dual layer\\" I have viewed.
0156027321|5.0|A gripping and enthralling story, \\"Life of Pi\\" leaves the questions to the readers at the end of the book of what exactly happened throughout the ordeal of young Pi amidst the monstrous wonder of the Pacific ocean: Does the story exactly happen as the book narrates it, or is it just a mumbo-jumbo fantasy to cover up the ugly reality? A distinction between illusion and reality, and how we perceive the world from what it really is, this is among the philosophical ramifications that the book is dealing with and it gives the story of Pi's survival more depth and a deeper sense of mysticism. Other readers might find this a tough read because of the aforementioned philosophical qualities, but otherwise it is a great book with or without having to deal with philosophy. It is about great courage, determination and a young child's physical, spiritual and emotional odyssey through the beauty and cruelty of both nature and human spirit. Worth your time!
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Closer, one of the most raw and honest portrayals of 21st century relationships, garnered a plethora of varied reviews.  All of which stated valid points about this movie.  Closer is an excellent movie.  It is not, though, one that you can love.  Unlike the schmaltzy and plaintatively, dumb romantic comedies that Hollywood has effectively regurgitated in recent times, Closer avoids the cute factor and discusses a subject that is not exactly nice. <br />Jude Law's Dan is a charmingly suave writer who begins a passionate relationship with Alice, played by Natalie Portman, at the beginning of the movie.  Anna (Julia Roberts) is the photographer who takes Dan's photo for the jacket of his new book.  Dan is instantly smitten but when Anna rejects him, he sets himself upon revenge.  When online in a cybersex chatroom, he claims Anna's identity and arranges a meeting with oversexed surgeon Larry (Clive Owen) at the aquarium the next day. <br />What begins, obviously, is a convulated mess.  The characters are unsympathetic and cruel but it is through this harsh and acerbic light that we see what Closer is getting at. <br />The movie finely exemplifies the growing coldness of the human heart and the fleeting glory of romance.  Larry's enraged cry in one of the scenes says it all.  \\"Can we get some intimacy in here?\\" he roars and that is what the movie's all about.  Despite what the name suggests, Closer is a meticulously, heartbreaking movie that reflects what it's like to be in a modern relationship and how people nowadays, are anything but close.
B000646MNE|5.0|\\"Sex and the City\\" is the antidote for those who are sick and tired of seeing endless movies and television shows that have been portraying single people as depressed, sad sack losers who are self-indulgent with too much time on their hands. Sure, Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha can be very vain and self-absorbed at times, but they are overly optimistic and hopeful and don't pertain to the machismo of masculinity. Hence their lunch time is always consist of a giddiness of a school girl gossip, regardless of the hardships that they are undergoing during that particular time, instead of the endless moaning and groaning that single people should be doing according to the other works of medium. The series finale is predictable and a little commercialistic and perhaps too sugary, but it stays true to the roots of this unique and refreshing show: who needs the Russian in beautiful Paris when your gals are always there in New York. In other words, men can be fodder for the continuity of women's friendship and loyalty to one another. This is a brave show that not only tackles a lot of subject matters that are considered taboos even for today's standards, and that also puts back sass into primetime sitcom entertainment, but it presents the embodiment of what a single girl truly is. For those who are adamant about seeing their very first episode (like I was in the beginning), please proceed because underneath the layers of sex and conversations about genital parts over coffee and Samantha's weekly rendezvous with different guys and its overall seemingly superficiality of lipstick gloss and well-coiffed hair, it celebrates girl power, feminism, and friendship and most importantly the knowledge that every girl, single or married, should always have a gay confidante. Besides, who can actually resist looking at the continuing parade of fashion brilliance and fashion faux pas on every episode?
B000002HPT|5.0|This album sat in my collection for almost 10 years before I gave it another chance...I'm glad I did. <br />I was burned out on DT when I put this cd in and the light came on.  WOW! <br />This is an incredible album! <br />
B0007YMUZW|5.0|I could write a whole lot about this album and about Ryan Adams and his music. But here's all you need to know about \\"Cold Roses\\": <br /> <br />After listening to it a couple of times, I thought I was going to go cry. Just like I thought I was going to after listening to \\"Heartbreaker\\" those first few times. Cry because the music and lyrics are so beautiful. Cry because some of the songs just rip out your heart. Cry because Ryan has outdone himself yet one more time. Yep, it's that good.

B00005MP58|5.0|Yes, it took a five hour movie, but someone did do justice to a Jane Austin book.  This is my favorite book as well as my favorite movie.

B0002858YS|1.0|Very draining record. Halfway trough I thinking \\"god! is this still on?\\" <br />There are a countless number of bands with a similar sound that do this kind of thing right and creativly, yet we never heard them on the radio. <br />Marketing is an amazing thing. <br />The people are nothing but sponges that believe what \\"the man\\" tells them to believe. <br />I'm sure they will pour a ton of production work into the next record instead of talent. <br /> <br />My version of \\"Sombody Told Me\\" <br /> <br />\\"Breaking my back just to go mainstream <br />a few crappie tracks and a really crappie name! <br /> <br />We've stolen this act on-ly it's lame <br />But what do fans know with tastes like this? <br />I said, what do kids know but how to reminisce?!! <br /> <br />Duran Duran's act <br />Gary Numan's act we recite! <br /> <br />(Insert \\"Sing-a-long\\" for drunks; i.e. \\"woo hoo\\") <br /> <br />Never thought eye make-up made a band excite! <br /> <br />Well somebody told me  <br />that there was a Blur song <br />that sounded like our song. <br />We didn't invent this frontier at all. <br />We've got no potential <br />Our music's tangential <br /> <br />(insert \\"cutting edge/never heard on the radio\\" synth-line: Nord Lead Bank 52)\\"  <br /> <br />If you buy this record you're cool.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Like a phoenix, Mariah has risen from the ashes to prove that she is here to stay.  We should have seen it coming when she was on the Jadakiss single \\"U Make Me Wanna\\"  Although I have never purchased a Mariah CD, I have always been a fan and enjoyed her music sans Glitter.  I think that she was going through a creative struggle during that point in her life.  I purchased this CD b/c of the hit single \\"We Belong Together\\" b/c it really hit home.  \\"It's Like That\\" is totally awesome!  I can see dance teams and cheerleading squads doing routines to this.  I was TRULY amazed @ how this entire album flowed.  \\"To The Floor\\" isn't that great, but hey, 1 out of 14 ain't too bad.  I enjoy this CD b/c it is a fun and it makes you feel great! Her choice of producers was on point although I would have expected her to work w/Scott Storch.  There are no gimmicks, no fillers, just straight from the heart Mariah.  If you don't have  or listened to this CD, you must be on Halcyon if you don't see that this CD is worth your time.
B000000OUJ|5.0|This cd is arguably the greatest solo effort from any of the 9 lyrical swordsmen in the Wu-Tang Clan. The entire cd is held together by samples from the classic Kung fu film \\"Shogun Assassin.\\"  <br />When you first hear \\"When I was little, my father was famous, he was the greatest samurai in the empire...\\" you realize that this cd is special. GZA has an intelligent flow that perfectly complements this dark cd. \\"Liquid Swords\\" gets it started with the afforementioned sample, which leads into GZA's first verse of the album. \\"Duel of the Iron Mic\\" which mixes a dirty piano loop with a pulsing bass line, has some of the best GZA verses on wax. The standout tracks on the cd are \\"4th Chamber\\", \\"Shadowboxin'\\" and \\"Cold World\\" but every single song is just as good. (By the way, if you get a chance to see \\"Shogun Assassin\\" after listening to this cd, you will be able to recite the whole damn thing on your first viewing, like I did.\\" <br />Beats: 10/10 <br />Lyrics: 10/10 <br />Overall: 10/10
B000000JO3|5.0|Minor threat as you may know is a hardcore straight edge band who actually started the whole scene thing with X's on the hands, Theyre anger and ferocity towards things really show in this album such as \\"bottled violence\\", theyre speed and vigor they have throughout this album is amazing combined with interesting lyrics and great riffs turn into some amazing tracks, a definite must get for any one who really likes punk music
B00005JNQQ|4.0|As reviewers, it's natural for us to compare an artist's work to his/her previous album, movie, book, etc. In this case, it becomes \\"natural\\" to compare \\"Robots\\" to the previous animated hit by Fox, \\"Ice Age\\". If we do this, \\"Robots\\" comes out lacking against its frozen predecessor. It is not as novel in terms of its intent and also the script is not as powerful (perhaps because it's also tougher to relate to inanimate beings such as robots, than it is to relate to animals or humans). But still, it is a funny (though predictable) movie, with touching moments and plenty of excitement all through it. I particularly enjoyed the ride that Rodney is put through when he arrives in Robot City, in order to get to the headquarters of Big Weld, where he dreams of working.<br /><br />The humor can be argued to be more adult-oriented, but still with  proper supervision, I totally see it being fit for children. The fact that our 18-month old was jumping out of his seat halfway through the movie is more the result of him being hyper than the movie not being fit for children. Now I admit this is no \\"Finding Nemo\\" (which keeps him entertained all through it, time and again). So, bottom line, while not as good as or innovative as \\"Ice Age\\" and without a very powerful storyline and groundbreaking animation as \\"Nemo\\" got us used to, \\"Robots\\" is still a funny movie worth checking out.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Napoleon Dynamite is beyond merely bad. It is really bad.  It is disjointed.  It has no plot and no action.<br /><br />It was supposed to be about a week in the life of some high school 'nerds'. There was really nothing holding it together.<br /><br />There were a couple of funny spots in the show, but it is certainly not one that I would recommend. I really thought that it was a total waste of 90 minutes.  Do yourself a favor and get something else instead.
0767805712|3.0|\\"Gattaca\\" is a more than usually intelligent sci-fi film that isn't quite done justice by its uneven script. The film obviously pays a debt to Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" but \\"Gattaca\\" actually creates a somewhat more realistic vision of a future society than does Huxley's book. Here, parents are able to genetically engineer their children into perfection from birth, and while genetic discrimination is not legal, the process results in those with superior genes having available to them advantages that do not befall the genetic inferiors. <br /> <br />As long as the script sticks to the pseduo-thriller plot that finds Ethan Hawke buying the genetic identity of Jude Law and then trying to cover up his fraud, the film is fairly engrossing. However, a story line involving sibling rivalry is handled very awkwardly and threatens to derail the picture about three-quarters of the way through, and a love story feels obligatory and only half-way developed. Still, the production design is stunning and almost worth sitting through just for <br />its own sake, and a mostly engaging plot makes for a pretty <br />entertaining film. <br /> <br />Grade: B
B000005IS1|3.0|Here is a recording that comes with its share of baggage.  Some<BR>might say that once these songs were laid down in Oct 1968, then the<BR>whole 1970s punk rock development was an inevitable historical<BR>consequence.  Who knows, history works in strange ways.  But the<BR>issues to cover here are simpler: how does the music on KOTJ sound<BR>generally?, and some description of individual tracks.  For brief<BR>context my own taste is for hard, fast guitar-driven rock (be it punk<BR>or more classic).  I bought this CD after enjoying the title track<BR>long ago, and being interested to hear more, especially considering the<BR>many bands the MC5 have influenced.<br /> The entire album is a live recording, with very good sound quality:<BR>  loud, clear, well balanced both over the audio spectrum, and between<BR>  the instruments, vocals etc.  There is no annoying background noise<BR>  to speak of.  The MC5 play quite coherently and energetically.  I<BR>  arrive at my rating of 3/5 stars by rating each track out of ten (in<BR>  order 6, 8, 7, 9; 2, 7, 6, 3) and dividing by 16.  This shows a<BR>  great variation in the tracks, and a much stronger \\"side A\\" than B.<BR>  In more detail: <br /> 1 [Ramblin' Rose] A decent, short kick-start to the concert, but<BR>     nothing special.  2 [Kick Out The Jams] Their classic<BR>     straight-ahead rocker, powered by driving guitars.  3 [Come<BR>     Together] Not the Beatles' tune, rather a song about physical<BR>     luv, slightly slower paced and below the quality of the adjacent<BR>     songs.  Hindered by some stilted tame-explicit lyrics that seem<BR>     humorless and unimaginative.  Well, they were probably bold in<BR>     1968.  4 [Rocket Reducer No. 62 (Rama Lama Fa Fa Fa)] The best<BR>     song on the CD to my ears.  A no-nonsense straight-ahead rocker<BR>     fueled by scorching guitars, with the suggestive lyrics agreeably<BR>     more direct.  5. [Borderline] A short bit of halting noise that<BR>     almost seems to haveits moment for a few seconds.  Sorry, I just<BR>     don't get it.  6 [Motor City Is Burning] This is structured as a<BR>     blues-rocker (albeit with a strong rock emphasis), which slows<BR>     the pace down somewhat, though it picks up as it progresses.  7<BR>     [I Want You Right Now] Back more to the style of side A,<BR>     musically pleasing but is interrupted by a somewhat overlong<BR>     quiet section where the singer toys with the audience amid slurpy<BR>     sexual onomatopoeia.  8 [Starship] This song seems like a wasted<BR>     opportunity to do something good.  The first 90 seconds are quite<BR>     promising, building up to what you fully expect will be a<BR>     thundering guitar blast off and full throttle rip through the<BR>     void.  But sadly, as soon as the Starship leaves the solar system<BR>     it gets ... lost in space.  One is left with 7 minutes of quiet,<BR>     discordant guitar screeches, drum crashes and vague narration,<BR>     which go nowhere except to lead my fingers to the STOP button.<br /> Certainly, the MC5 influenced many punk bands, and in that sense<BR>their music can be called proto-punk.  But the punks arrived in<BR>  numbers some 8 years later, and as should thus be expected, the<BR>  songs here are very much more reminiscent of earlier 70's heavy/hard<BR>  rock -- played to an extreme.  (By comparison, MC5 contemporaries<BR>  The Stooges sound closer to punk than KOTJ.)  The only song that<BR>  sounds even vaguely \\"punky\\" to me is track 4, mostly because of the<BR>  aggressive guitar delivery.  In fact, some of the songs here tend<BR>  towards having the tedious, overly drawn out death-throe endings<BR>  that are characteristic of bombastic 70's dinosaur rock -- which in<BR>  part motivated the punk rebellion.<br />  In summary, this is a value-priced, creditable live debut and there<BR>  are some fine moments of raw rock'n'roll here. Though the overall<BR>  song quality is more uneven than one would like, the goodstill<BR>  outweighs the not so good.  This CD may be more for devout fans and<BR>  historical completists.  Most of the best parts (tracks 1-4) are<BR>  also found on the Big Bang \\"best of\\" compilation.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I am a college student going on 21 years old and I seem to have missed my time when it comes to rock music. I have listened to the Who since I was about 8 because (thank God) my parents were big fans, of Tommy in particular. But, until I saw this DVD I never knew how incredible a rock band the Who really was. You can listen to the albums all you like and they are good in their own right, but like my History of Rock n Roll professor says, \\"The best way to learn about the Who is just to see them\\" (we watched the DVD in class). The amount of emotion in their performances (especially the later ones) is incredible. I bought the Special Edition DVD about a month ago and have watched it about 15 times. I still get goosebumps every time I see the pre-dawn Woodstock footage of See Me, Feel Me (a version FAR superior to that of the studio album) because of the absolute RAW EMOTION in Townshend's guitar work and Daltrey's singing (Moon and Entwistle provide an incredible driving rhythm as always). But it isn't limited to that track, every single song is great. I would recommend buying this DVD to everyone who likes the Who, but ESPECIALLY to those of us who (by no fault of our own) were not blessed enough to be able to see the band live.
B000929AJQ|1.0|I was so excited for this release. I thought I would love whatever it was, it's NIN! It's OK. It's not great, not bad, but really just ok is not what I was hoping for. I'll hold on to my true NIN cds, and just let this one mark the official end.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|Hello! I hope someone can help me out. As all the reviews here have stated, there's nothing much more that I can add about the greatness of these films - especially I and II. But there's something not so clear to me about this boxset. It's been stated that this set contains 4 discs. But it's also said here that III and The Next KK are compressed into one double-sided disc. So what does the other remaining disc contain? Hope someone can help me. Thanks!

B00005JNQ8|3.0|Random thoughts about The Interpreter: <br /> <br />-- what kind of background security checks do they do at the UN (as envsiaged in this film) if someone with Nicole Kidman's history is so easily hired on? <br /> <br />-- how many languages does she interpret anyway?? <br /> <br />-- can Nicole Kidman get any more gorgeous? <br /> <br />-- why does Sean Penn need most of the movie to fall in love in Nicole Kidman? <br /> <br />-- same question, roles reversed? <br /> <br />-- it's always wonderful to see footage of Africa, even a baleful Africa. <br /> <br />-- is the old dictator thinking in the climactic scene, \\"shoot me if you must, but spare me the philosophizing\\"? <br /> <br />-- can Nicole Kidman get any more gorgeous? <br /> <br />-- why isn't this movie forty minutes shorter? <br /> <br />-- and even when they do find out that they love each other, the audience reaction -- at least this audience -- is, \\"who cares!!\\" <br /> <br />-- Clint Eastwood makes a better Secret Service agent than Sean Penn. <br /> <br />-- too bad nobody gets to ride on AirForce One.  <br /> <br />-- Sean Penn looks like he needs sleep even when he's had sleep. <br /> <br />-- the long set-up to the most spectacular scene of the movie is really tense and well-done. <br /> <br />-- can Nicole Kidman get any more gorgeous? <br /> <br />Finally, one problem with The Interpreter is that all of these mind-static thoughts take place simultaneously with watching the movie.  That's a big problem.  Still, while you don't for a minute believe anything that is happening on screen in The Interpreter and the Penn-Kidman chemistry is deader than a dodo, this is a good (in the wonderful Spanish word) \\"pasatiempo\\" -- which I roughly translate as \\"mindless entertainment.\\"

B000001GPX|5.0|This may not be the definitive recording of the 5th, but it's an exceptional one. I love Karajan's 5th as it is presented in his Beethoven Symphonies box, I'm not sure which recording it is, but it's with Berlin and it's exceptional. My personal favourite is on the recent DVD set with Claudio Abbado and Berlin - the attention to detail is at times mind-boggling; I never before realized there was so much music in Beethoven. This recording of the 5th has such an incredible energy. The speed is one thing: it's impressive and effective. But the clarity and focus of the voices gives this reading a very unique direction. Definitely worth having.  <br /> <br />I'm not a fan of the way Kleiber does the 7th...I find it generally too light, but that's my own preference. A note here; the pizz at the end of the 2nd is the result of different editions. It is starting to be recognized as the \\"proper\\" way of doing it.  <br /> <br />But with regards to the sound of the timpani - what?? If you like that warm, full, artificial American timp sound, then fine. If you like timpani to sound like they're meant to - lots of attack, not much sustain - then these sound fine. Especially with the VPO's peculiar Viennese timpani, this sound is characteristic of the orchestra and of the traditional way of playing the drums.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie, and was very let down.  Great cast and premise, but did not live up to the possibilities.  Watch Old School again instead of this.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album is so deep, in meaning and in sound, that it takes time to sink in.   At first the words are strange and the tones are harsh, but soon your brain begins to wrap around it and dissect it.     The albumn is packed with songs about Love, God and War. It carries intence lyrics which inspire deep sound. Bono uses amazing imagery throughout.    The album is not perfect. The single \\"Vertigo\\" feels more superficial than the rest of the album. \\"All because of you\\" gets a little out of control at the end. \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" is unremarkable.     That said, this best album since Achtung Baby and deserves to be listened to. The emotion in the live show will blow you away. Buy the album and see the show.    Song by Song:  Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own - Carries the most emotion.  Love and Peace or Else - Strong deep sound conveys heart felt message  Miracle Drug - Intricate with intence imagrey.   City of Blinding Lights - Paints a wonder picture via song.  Yahweh - Deeply religous and introspective.  One Step Closer - Smooth, intorspective, great imagery.  Oringinal of the Species - Strong performace by Bono.   Crumbs from Your Table - The one song that seems like filler.  All Because of You - Starts great but gets a bit loud.  Vertigo  - Interesting sounds but more superficial than the rest of the album.
B000000OAC|3.0|While this dips nowhere near as far as they'd go with Hot Space, this is indisputably the worst of Queen's albums from their greatest decade. Well, I guess it's disputable if you didn't like the pomposity (or grandeur as I see it) of the first five albums. However, Queen was arguably the most talented band in the history of rock, so even playing the simple material on this album, they do it up right. All Dead, All Dead is a shining jewel, and It's Late is wonderful. Excessive radio play has dampened my appreciation of We Are The Champions, but it is a very good song. The rest of the album runs from either run-of-the-mill (by Queen's standards) glam/blues rock to horrid punk (Get Down, Make Love and Sheer Heart Attack, ick). It gets a three because even at their worst Queen isn't that bad (the aforementioned Hot Space excluded).

Like Sex in the City was a joke. <br />No, really-- this is a joke. Right? <br />It's a spoof. A parady. A lampoon.

Tongue-in-cheek. <br />I mean, NO ONE can be THAT stupid? <br />Unless.... <br />Unless.. these women are so busy painting their nails, shopping for cute clothes, investigating plastic surgery, and gossiping about Paris Hilton that they're just completely detached from reality?  <br />Nah---- no one can be soooooooo stupid.. or soooo self-absorbed as to not \\"get it\\"
B000929AJQ|1.0|Awitha Teetha is certainly the most disappointing thing MTRez has ever done.  Worse than the \\"live\\" album. (Wait, can you call a recording of a pseudo-karaoke synched performance \\"live,\\" really?) <br /> <br />I don't even know where to start in naming the misfires here.  I'll try to start with the biggest offenders. <br /> <br />1. Almost all acoustic percussion.  This is the MAIN problem with the record.  Yes, yes, Trent's made a big deal about wanting to avoid the ultra-clean ProTools sound of a lot of current music.  Well, sorry, but all he's done here is hire Dave Grohl to play the drums. But Trent, you've built your career on that Front 242 robot beat.  This album SORELY misses it.  And anyhow, you aren't fooling anyone that this album isn't carefullly(ish) assembled in ProTools.  What else do we make of the sloppy edits?  Like the one at 2:02 in \\"The Collector,\\" or the HIDEOUSLY awful one at 3:41 in \\"Beside You In Time?\\"  We can hear the missed zero-crossing click! Or the obviously-repeated guitar lines throughout? It's as ProTooled as anything in the NIN catalog. <br /> <br />2. The lyrics.  Less said here, the better. \\"The sooner we realize/We cover ourselves with lies.\\"  \\"Will you chew until is bleeds/Can you get up off your knees/Are you brave enough to see.\\"  By the way, those last three lines were meant to rhyme.  Yes, yes, I know.  Please send a rhyming dictionary c/o Interscope Records, LA, CA.  The best song on the record, the lovely \\"Right Where it Belongs,\\" is spoiled by having the line \\"Are you sure what side you're on?\\" followed just two lines later by \\"Are you sure what side of the glass you are on?\\"  This is one of the best-known rock stars of the '90s. Does he have NOBODY around him with the guts to tell him he needs to edit better? This is pure amateur hour. <br /> <br />2a. By the way, note to Trent: You are 40 years old.  Screaming about how nobody understands you and how everybody else is a greedy idiot?  Not so appealing. <br /> <br />3. The flow.  Wait, what flow? <br /> <br />4. The scary atmosphere.  Wait, what scary atmosphere? <br /> <br />5. THERE IS NO INSERT IN THE ALBUM.  The DualDisc and regular CD come in a cheapo tri-fold digipack (with terrible color matching on the inside between the coated and uncoated sides).  All the notes, lyrics and credits are on a stupid PDF on nin.com -- one that's very difficult to navigate, besides being ugly and amateurish looking to boot. <br /> <br />6. That screaming at the end of \\"The Hand That Feeds.\\" I simply can't listen to it. Instant \\"forward\\" button. <br /> <br />7. The mix is muddy and all over the place. The end of \\"Beside You In Time\\" is a complete and utter disaster, in particular.  And the vocals...UGH. Put Awitha Teetha on back to back with The Downward Spiral and listen to where the vocal sits in the mix. He's put his voice way out in front throughout, like a Gwen Stefani disc or something. It's not a texture; it's the central focus. Not a good idea. <br /> <br />8. \\"Only.\\" The very worst song he's ever recorded. And I'm including \\"Purest Feeling\\" in that. Humiliating. Should be career-ending. I can only wait for the David Fincher video. <br /> <br />Trent, you have lost it. I used to be a HUGE NIN fan. I'm already bored with your new record less than a week after its release.

B00003CX95|1.0|William Wallace was nothing like the dude portrayed in the movie.  For one, he did not get to fornicate with the crown princess.  In reality, at Wallace's death, the princess was only a little child.  If he DID fornicate with her, then so much the better that a pedophhile was torn to pieces.      On another front, I have to say that the plot is rather cheesy.  The good guy is done injustice (his woman is slain) and is out for revenge.  That's his primary motive.  Somewhere along the way the freedom of Scotland got into the fold, almost as an afterthought.  In this regard it is not unlike the US's case for the Iraqi invasion -- freedom being used as a tool to elevate a completely mundane cause.  But this is after all a Western movie for the consumption of the Western masses.  Certain things sell well -- the more-or-less revisionist history of a fight for freedom being one, the other being the good guy getting the girl -- and they are exploited to the fullest extent.    In the whole, this is altogether a rather banal film.  Hence the 1 star (actually 0.5).
0385510454|1.0|boy o boy has this wonder boy run out of gas. \\"the broker\\" has a thin plot, nondescript characters and is poorly written to boot. basically i think it was written to justify a summer in italy for the irs.  grisham wants to tell us how smart and worldly he is and how he could outsmart the best of the intelligence agencies if he were born again in some foreign city.  this is a boring and fairly stupid book and not worth the money or time to read it. <br /> <br />dgs
B000028U0Y|5.0|the level of intensity in this cd is just monumental.  Cash's deep baritone is the best element of the music, making it connect with the listener in a deep way.  My favorite song is \\"greystone chapel,\\" deep and hopeful and probably the best representation of what this cd is all about.  This is Cash's defining moment arguably, and is an essential in any collection, especially for fans of country music.  Even if you have an aversion to country music you should check this out; it is so much better and really raw and rocking compared to modern day country (which is a joke)!
B0002S94OS|5.0|This CD RULES W/O QUESTION!!!! There is no comparison to a great band like this. There lyrics are some of the most intellengent and powerful/potient I've ever seen in a band. The riffs and solos showcased on this cd take the cake! The vocals rip you something new everytime he speaks! Songs 1,2,3,4,and 5 are awesome and so are the rest of the songs w/1 and 5 being my personal favs. If you want metal then check out Lamb of God!! THEY FREAKIN RULE!!!
0767824571|4.0|No movie I have ever seen makes me laugh harder or more consistently than Holy Grail. And that's after seeing it enough times that I've become one of the annoying legion who can quote entire scenes from the film. Python are a rare combination of physical, low brow, silly, and philosophical humor. Some scenes you laugh at because they are so stupid (killer rabbit), others because they are so absurd (Black Knight) and others because of the amazing language used (anarchosyndicalist commune). <br /> <br />Even though in my opinion this is the funniest movie ever made, I didn't give it 5 stars because as with most movies, it is not perfect. It falters in the last half hour and the ending leaves something to be desired. If you already know Python and don't like them, this movie won't change your mind. If you don't know them, this is the perfect place to start and if you're already a fan you didn't need to read this review because you've already seen the movie a hundred times.
0790744295|5.0|Creepshow is a classic. I love the stories and the acting is great. You have to take Creepshow for what it is, a low budget horror/humor movie done for one thing, and one thing only. entertainment.<br /><br />Movies like this are real treasures for those of us that grew up in the 80's and still miss that decade twenty years later. I thought Stephen King did wonderfully as the hillbilly farmer who finds the meteor in his backyard. My favorite story is the one with Ted Danson and Leslie Neilson. A cool little story by two of my favorite actors.<br /><br />A great little movie for a great price.
B00005JNTV|5.0|I have quite a few things to say after seeing this movie and reading almost every review on this site.  Every comment from those that loved it to those that hated it.  From the 15 year old that shouldn't have been let in the theatre w/o his Mommy in the first place to the \\"top-rated critic\\" that prolly had more expectations then all of us put together before they even went in the theatre.  I'm not saying each person doesn't have their own basis for their opinions, but it seems everybody has pre-conceptions for a movie of this hype long before they even give it a chance.  Drop your expectations and you'd be surprised how much you can enjoy ANY movie.  However, I'm going to start with my personal opinion and try my best not to include any factual information yet so bear with me: <br /> <br />First things first, people that cry and whine about the gore and \\"degrading\\" representation of women and nudity and the fact that you can't relate to the characters - what exactly did you in all your teenage/feminist ignorace expect from a rated R movie called \\"SIN CITY\\"?  It's seems to me that so many uptight people automatically see or hear something that SEEMS a certain way and they don't bother to think into the hidden meanings.  The hookers that show skin but are tough as nails simply show the adversity and determination of women to struggle through the pimps and killers and fight back the only way that ever gets things done.  So many bleeding hearts want to believe that war is bad, but they shouldn't deny the fact that the changes that COME from war are necessary. <br /> <br />Secondly, I am an aspiring actor and a movie buff beyond many peoples' understandings.  Do most of you nay-sayers even understand how difficult it is to \\"act cheesy\\"?  I've done quite a few theatre shows, and as a mandatory skill, you have to overact.  You HAVE to be cheesy to appropriately pervey the meaning behind the plot.  I truly believe the acting was exceedingly excellent and not as easy or crappy as so many of you haters think.  Each charater was shown in the way they needed to be from the pages of the comic by their respective actors/actresses.  When a director tells you, \\"Ham this up and be corny!\\" you friggin do it and hope you do it well.  And they all did just that. <br /> <br />Finally, again, only as my opinion, I believe this movie was an original, complex, risque masterpiece that needed to be done before someone else did it WRONG.  Do you people truly believe the directors/writers said in the middle of a scene, \\"Hold on!  We shouldn't put that in, people might get offended.\\"  Gimme a break folks, what the #@$! do they make movies for?  Movies are an escape from reality and are meant to tug at your emotions, even if that happens to be disgust or hate.  Actually, do you haters dislike this movie because maybe it's a little TOO close to reality for your tastes?  Does it scare you only because this seems to be what our world is working towards?  Good deeds are never rewarded...evil lurks everywhere, even where you least expect it...the beauty that you see on the surface doesn't always match underneath...  That's what this movie really shows and I think it bothers alot of you.  This is the underbelly of what our planet is slowly building towards and that makes you mad that we can enjoy it as entertainment. <br /> <br />Now, the facts:  This movie was as original as they come.  It had very distinct lessons to learn from EVERY character.  It had star power that each showed off, if anything, their diversity.  It is true to the comic and is an amazing genre-bending story that has been attempted and failed at every time...until now. <br /> <br />My suggestion to anyone reading these reviews that hasn't seen it (or that have and simply want to hear others' opinions), don't think too hard when you watch it.  Don't pick apart what you do and don't like about each scene.  Watch the movie and, at the end, decide for yourself.  You'll either love it or hate it...there doesn't seem to be much middle ground here.  Use your brain and not your eyes to figure this one out.   <br /> <br />Personally, as a wannabe actor, a movie freak, and a comic book artist/reader I can't wait to own this one and put it at the front of the stack! <br /> <br />the jokA <br />
B000929AJQ|1.0|I thought the CD was a pretty big disapointment.  There was really only one good song on the CD ( The Hand That Feeds ).  The cd just didnt have any edge to it.  Mabey it should have a name like \\"Without Teeth\\".  The CD just seems to need a lot more work.  It could have been a lot better.
B00000I3JM|5.0|First time I heard The Blue Nile was \\"A Walk Across the Rooftops\\" on the radio back in 83.  It was a moody texured sound that fit my teenage angst at the time.  This was one of my mellow, moody chill out albums along with Starfish by the Church.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2005.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />As soon as I put this disc in...  All the memories I have tied to this CD.  It's back like an old friend after a long absence.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|do not waste your time or money on this juvenile,lame-a** plot,piece of trash. if i was about,say..13,14, i'd say \\"cool man,that was gory\\",not caring about plot. but i'm 30yrs past that. i do love blood&guts so....but GD, there HAS TO BE A STORY LINE. anybody who liked this should think the\\"faces of death\\" tapes are the ultimate. put this one straight in the roundfile.

B000002GJS|4.0|This has to be along with 1984's Reckless, one of Bryan Adams' <br /> best albums. This album includes the super smash hit single of <br /> 1991 Everything i do i do it for you, still to this day one of <br /> the most popular love songs ever written. But this also has some <br /> great rockers too, such as Can't stop this thing we started,There will never be another tonight, Hey honey,im packing <br /> you in and All i want is you. This was the last great album by <br /> B.A. after this his songwriting and music started going downhill <br /> and he has never been able to recapture the magic from this golden timeframe.
B0007TKNII|3.0|Musicals to me are a big mystery. You have your plot, your characters and their motivations but rather than talk it out through dialogue they start bursting into song. At least in Grease it looked odd but it still had catchy tunes. This just seems like singing singing and more singing, dialogue and again with the singing.  <br /> <br />Christine Daae is an actress working at the Opera Populaire(instead of the Paris Opera House). She's a considerable talent if it only weren't for the high-pitched prima donna Carlotta. An accident during rehearsals as Christine start singing and blowing everyone away. <br /> <br />Her teacher just happens to be the famed Opera Ghost, or the title character Phantom of the Opera, who has specific requests about the show and consequences will come if broken. The opera house undergoes new management so they don't believe in it and put Carlotta in the lead role, disobeying the Phantom's request of it being Christine. Plus, it seems she has fallen for Raoul, another young man so the Phantom feels rejected so he kind of loses it. <br /> <br />One thing about the film is that it does look great. The architecture, set design and the costuming both look great. And Emmy Rossum might be a tad bland on the acting side, she showcases some surprising singing chops. If only the men were better. <br /> <br />And the movie were more interesting for that matter. Singing upon singing and it just feels way more longer than it should. Not to mention the Phantom rarely exudes that menace he's supposed to have. <br /> <br />If you're into the actual Broadway musical or just a fan of musicals in general, try it out but if it's not your thing, proceed with caution.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is without a doubt one of the best musicals of all time.  The singers are amazing, especially Emmy Rossum who shines in her role as Christine Daae.  One thing about this movie is you really just need to sit back and relax, don't rush it, just absorb that fantastic music and sets.  You are guarenteed to love this movie!  So go ahead and buy it!

1592400876|4.0|As a fan of literature throughout high school and later as a college student majoring in English, the importance of punctuation was always apparent to me. However, I didn't always have the strongest grasp on even some of the most basic punctuation marks. This was a slight source of embarrassment, but it seemed that I was always able to hide amongst the ranks of uninformed punctuators. After some of my experiences it only makes sense that Eats Shoots and Leaves, would be in existence. Horrible grammar and punctuation surround us at all times, and as Lynne Truss points out, no one is the wiser. <br /> Truss, however, does far more than simply point out the multitude of incorrect punctuation that passes us by on busses, gets posted on billboards, and is transmitted via e-mails, or any other form of communication. Using herself as a model \\"stickler for punctuation,\\" Truss guides the reader through humorous examples of misguided punctuation, and proceeds to inform the reader exactly why the error at hand could be considered an irritating, yet entertaining error. It is quite obvious that Truss is personally invested in the war on bad punctuation, and is therefore more interested in educating the reader as opposed to making them feel inadequate. As a reader who is a less than stellar grammarian there are time when Truss' lessons are slightly jarring in their directness, but it is all in the name of education and awareness, and it beats the pants off any text book I've ever seen.    <br />
B00005ASGG|5.0|John Ford gained fame as one of the greatest directors of Western movies, creating the mythic template that became the standard of the genre. In `The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', Ford pulled aside the curtain to look at the reality behind the Western myth - a reality far more complex and interesting than the simplicity of the legend. In doing so, he created a masterpiece that is arguably his greatest film, and certainly a crowning achievement to his great career.<br />The film opens with Senator Ransom Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart) and his wife making an unexpected homecoming to the little town of Shinbone to attend the funeral of an unknown pauper. Stoddard had left Shinbone years before and gone on to greatness and fame as the first governor of the state, an ambassador, and powerful senator, so his return to this quiet little town causes a great stir. He reluctantly grants an interview to the local newspaper to explain what motivated him to do so. That story is the body of the movie. It is a story of the frontier history of the town, the story of how he gained his fame - it is the story of the man who shot Liberty Valance. It is also a story that the editor refuses to print, for as he tells Stoddard, \\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\\"<br />The story of the young Ransom Stoddard, come to the wild and lawless frontier town of Shinbone to open a law practice is one of moral and ethical complexity. The first person the idealistic young man meets is Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), a tough as nails road agent and the personification of evil and lawlessness. Valance and his gang rob the stage Ransom is in, and severely beat him when he gallantly tries to protect a female passenger. Left lying in the road, he is rescued by Tom Doniphan (John Wayne) a man much like Valance in his toughness and independence, but lacking the black heart, and taken in to town to be nursed by Doniphan's girl, Hallie (Vera Miles). An idealistic greenhorn, Stoddard insists that Valance should be brought to bear by the law. Doniphan, a realist, explains to him that in this town, the gun is the only law, and he had better get one or get out. Doniphan dislikes Stoddard, both because of his greenhorn idealism, and because Stoddard is a threat to his relationship with Hallie. Thus the stage is set for a classic lover's triangle in the battle for the young ladies affections, between the strong, roughly charming Doniphan, and Stoddard, weak and naïve, but educated, cultured, and idealistic. Liberty Valance and his vendetta against young Stoddard becomes the focus around which this triangle revolves, and it is only when he is killed that the situation is finally resolved. Valance's death determines the future fortunes of both Stoddard and Doniphan, and illustrates the often complex and problematic relationship between law and force as civilizing agents.<br />Both John Wayne and Jimmy Steward delivered outstanding, nuanced performances in their respective roles. Marvin's role was less complex, but he did a splendid job portraying the personification of lawless evil and mayhem in the Wild West.  Vera Miles held her own, though she was surrounded by giants. In addition to the leads, there are many familiar faces in this film that played their parts well, including Denver Pyle, John Carradine, and Lee Van Cleef. Edmund O'Brien and Andy Devine both delivered standout performances as the colorful, drunken newspaper man and the fat, cowardly town marshal, each providing comic relief in what is essentially a tragic film.<br />Though filmed in 1962, Ford chose to shoot in black and white, and using that stark pallet created a visual masterpiece of light and shadow. He bookends his film with scenes of a train arriving and departing from Shinbone, and with that visual silently delivers the message that ultimately it was the iron horse and not the shooting iron that tamed the Wild West.<br />`The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' is one of the greatest and most important Westerns ever made. With  a legendary director and stars, an all-star cast of extras, and its tragic and nuanced story of how legends are born, this is one Western that you cannot afford to miss.<br /><br />Theo Logosde.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|Who knew that such a successful spoof on the zombie movies would come from England? The film has its share of gore, including one very gory scene while it still has its laughs. Pretty short intro mind you.<br /><br />Shaun is basically a slacker. He works at an electronics store, isn't really all that ambitious, and his idea of taking his girlfriend out revolves around taking her to the Winchester, a local pub. He lives with Ed, a slacker worse than he is who plays Timesplitters 2(I think) and doesn't write down people's messages, only his own. There's also Pete, who can't stand Ed of course.<br /><br />Shaun's girlfriend Liz ends up dumping him and noticing a lot of weird things happening around town. But once things due start to happen, he's completely oblivious like the bloody handprints in the store or a very empty street. That changes when a woman appears in their backyard. He pushes her onto a small pole and is impaled...only she stands right back up with a gaping hole in her stomach. Now it gets serious as he tries to fend off the zombies(he doesn't want them called that however) with his girlfriend, Ed, his mother, father-in-law, and Liz's 2 friends.<br /><br />The comedy from the film mainly comes from subtleties or just plain ridiculousness without being off-the-wall. Realizing that zombies can be killed through beheading or massive brain trauma, they start flinging vinyls at them, only to end up singling out certain records because they're too good.<br /><br />The acting is surprisingly strong too with a great scene involving a Reservoir Dogs spoof involving a mexican standoff. The gore is a bit subdued since you're not gonna find anything really really graphics, until near the end anyway.<br /><br />Rent it and gross out your date while still making them laugh. One of the few movies that can do this.
B00005AQE8|4.0|Like Many, I may not be a huge fan of Tupac but I admire his work and what he did for hip hop music; therefore when I reviewed this album I reviewed it as fairly as I could, and to be honest with you...I thought the album was Ill, But Two Discs seemed one too many to me. It's pretty obvious from the beggining that Disc One is the good disc here, but disc two has some tight tracks but for the most part just plain wack.

0316172324|2.0|Substantively not as good as \\"The Tipping Point\\", but delivered with the same easy prose.  Especially in the beginning, there are some interesting recounts of real life situations.  Throughout the book the author draws some conclusions that are tenuous at best and thus the book is probably better if read with a critical eye.  The number of copies sold may be misleading in regards to the real world, business knowledge that can be drawn from the book.  All in all, I recommend this book as simple, leisure read that should be approached critically.
0393035158|5.0|Their are thinkers...and # thinkers and it is the NOT thinkers that worry me the most.  I don't claim to be accomplished at it but I keep working at it.  Years ago I picked up a book by M. Scott Peck, M.D. titled, \\"The Road Less Traveled and Beyond\\" and was struck by some points he had to say in the first chapter and I quote:  \\"...How often, in fact, do we stop to think about what we believe?  One of the major dilemmas we face both as individuals and as a society is simplistic thinking--or the failure to think at all.  It isn't just a problem, it is THE problem. ...If we don't begin to think well, it's highly likely that we may end up killing ourselves. ...Thinking is difficult.  Thinking is complex.  And thinking is--more than anything else--a process...\\"  Reading Sam Harris' book brought this into focus.  I've discovered over the years that most people DON'T want to think for themselves because if they do, they might discover something new and they might have to do something about it and they don't want that responsibility.  It is far easier for them to be \\"sheep,\\" to be in the herd (safety?) and have someone else tell them what to do on Sunday (or whatever day is holy to them).  Then, they leave and live their lives like the rest of us.  They are just not conscious!  Sam Harris says it like it is and doesn't try to be P.C.  This book will infuriate the NON-thinker (might even get someone to want to do away with the infidel!!!), stimulate those who are asking questions and it is a joy and a confirmation to those who know.  If you are a dyed in the wool believer of whatever faith and aren't comfortable in asking real questions, don't even bother to get this book...it won't do you any good...at least not in this lifetime.
1592400876|5.0|A 5 for sure! <br /> <br />I have never read a book on grammar that is entertaining and keeps the reader moving. The book is a practical commentary on the misuse of grammatical rules and structures. At the same time, the book is a social commentary on why there is a drop in grammatical awareness, as well as the tolerance for poor grammar. <br /> <br />I believe all English majors and future teachers, regardless of the subject or grade level, should read this book. It not only explores the \\"evils\\" of modern grammar, but also gives insight on how society has embraced a culture of poor grammar. Looking at the real world is, in my opinion, the best tool for teaching students. Allowing students to find misuse of grammar in their world gives them some autonomy rather than another ditto from the dusty file cabinet. <br /> <br />The book will keep you amused and charge up your \\"geeky\\" obsession with a grammatically correct world!
B0007XT87G|4.0|Well, let's put it this way. I downloaded this album on a whim and the next day I bought tickets to see Porcupine Tree live.  I gave it a listen and immediately knew I was listening to an intelligent, original and new favorite band.  I'm a fan of Rush, Yes (new and old), Pink Floyd, Coldplay and Megadeath - and this album somehow hit my sweet spot.  Sure, it's \\"white male\\" music...but it's SMART white male music.   <br /> <br />Track 5, Arriving Somewhere But Not Here, is the best damn 12 minute song I ever did hear.  And after playing it for the 10th time, I found my girlfriend grooving to it - the same girl who upon hearing it for the first time said my music tastes were different than hers!  And it never gets boring because they mix it up - one of the appeals of Megadeath. <br /> <br />Anyway, congrats Porcupine. You've got a new fan who downloaded your music for dirt cheap but is now ready to see you live and explore every last album of yours.
B00005JNQ8|4.0|\\"The Interpreter\\" begins with Sylvia Broom (Nicole Kidman), a mysterious UN interpreter from Motobo (a fictional African nation that is the film's focal point), overhearing signs of an assassination attempt against the Matoban president. Eventually, when problems occur and a masked man threatens her at her home, the CIA steps in, as they happen to be waiting for the Matoban president --a famed extremist-- so as to protect him from New York City opposition and protesters. This is when Tobin Kellar (Sean Penn) steps in, often followed by a middling Catherine Keener. At first doubting Broom's honesty, Tobin begins to take a liking to her when he discovers that, like him, she lost a loved one. It is at this point \\"The Interpreter\\" takes its most interesting and perceptive turn. In taking time to study Tobin and Broom, director Sydney Pollack achieves a bit of elevation above most films in this genre.  <br /> <br />More frequently than necessary, non-stop explosions and CGI are shoved down our throats, but Pollack achieves an appropriate balance between character and suspense. And now that most critics spend entire columns talking about the film's intelligence, a point must be made that \\"The Interpreter\\" does not go without its fair amount of excitement. In fact, a scene where most of the film's major characters some how end up on the same bus (in the middle of New York City, no less) is so well-directed that all thoughts of contrivance are forgotten, and it soon blossoms into one of the best-filmed scenes of this year. Its craftsmanship would have even made Hitchcock salivate. Ultimately, \\"The Interpreter\\" is a solid thriller worthy of wide audiences, though its smarts may unfortunately be taken as box office poison. However, if you're into intelligent thrillers, it's highly recommended.  <br /> <br />Above all else, \\"The Interpreter\\" attempts to comment on the modern world with its central characters, who share the pain of loss. \\"Why can't you name the dead?\\" asks Tobin. \\"You only name the dead once you're ready to move on,\\" responds Broom. Neither seem ready to move on, but in the mean time I guess they have each other, a relationship in no need of translation. We've all had similar connections; they're all over the cinema: \\"Lost in Translation,\\" etc. Pollack opts to use this relationship as a metaphor for a fallen world lacking any form of similar cohesiveness. The international community's inability to accept superficial differences and value more profound connections --the every day problems and people that shape us, struggles and loss, comedy and tragedy-- is part of what the movie is concerned with, beyond suspense. Here, characters matter: the world matters.
0330485377|1.0|After hearing rave reviews about this book I had very high expectations for it. It seems to be somewhat hard to believe that any book can be intresting when the most important event in the book, the entire climax is in the first chapter. When I was done the first chapter I wondered what the rest of the chapters would be about...well apparently nothing.<BR>I usually finish books in a week or less but I had to stop reading this book halfway through because it was so horrible. I was often afraid to read it because anything regarding murder and rape is a bit intense for me but the way this book presented such a serious event was horrible.<BR>No strong emotions were expressed through any of the characters, especially not the main character who tells this story. Not only did I think the book was poorly written I was also extremely disappointed by the end. This book left me indifferent and it was a big waste of my time. sorry alice. your characters were too flat and just plain dull.
0385510438|4.0|In John Grisham's The Last Juror, he gives us a break from his usual fast paced, conspiracy laden legal thrillers.  Instead, he offers an old fashioned, Southern-style tale best told on a lazy hot day sitting on a veranda with a tall glass of sweet tea.<br /><br />The main character is Willie Traynor.  Willie shows up in small town Clanton Mississippi to work for a dying family-owned weekly newspaper.  Willie isn't particularly ambitious, and his rich grandmother has pulled the plug on his college education after 5 years at Syracuse with no degree. Through a series of unforeseen events, Willie ends up purchasing the newspaper and turning it around.  Southerners are slow to accept outsiders, but Willie ends up being a \\"character,\\" which charms most of his fellow neighbors.  He starts dressing in seersucker suits and bow ties, purchases and restores an older home, visits every church in the county (but refuses to join any of them) and befriends people on both sides of the color line (this is back in the early 1970's when things were still very segregated).  He quickly befriends Callie Ruffin, a self-educated black woman who speaks perfect English.  They meet when Willie wants to write a human interest story about her remarkable family (seven of her eight children are college professors with doctorates).  Miss Ruffin also serves as friend, mentor and mother-figure to young Will.<br /><br />Things in quiet Clanton change dramatically when a woman is brutally murdered. She knows her killer, and gives his name to a neighbor before she dies.  The killer's family has political clout, and a guilty verdict isn't always a foregone conclusion.  The defendant also threatens the jury that he will get them if he is convicted. Miss Callie is the first black woman to be picked for a jury in Clanton, and actually holds the position of The Last Juror.<br /><br />Grisham has used Clanton for two previous books, and some of the characters make repeat appearances.  The best of the bunch is lawyer Harry Rex.  But Grisham does a fine job fleshing out the characters for this book, the likes of which could only be found in a Southern town.  The plot isn't as action-packed as his previous books, but he still manages to deal with important issues including integration, changes to penal codes, local politics and political corruption.<br /><br />My only complaint about The Last Juror is that I saw the end coming a mile away (and I don't usually figure out the villain in a mystery).  Otherwise, I thought The Last Juror was a fine book and a fun read.  After some weaker efforts, Grisham has managed to come through with a fairly big hit.the bunch is lawyer Harry Rex.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|this movie had me on the edge of my seat at the end and i understand now why Jamie Foxx got nominated for best supporting actor. he was brilliant. and to be also truthful, Tom Cruise was no slouch either. i don't know but i was just thinking as i was watching the film i was thinking what a trip it would be if Tom turn around and go into his Lastat character from \\"interview with the vampire\\" and bit the hell out of jamie and face the camera and say, \\"oh-oh, wrong movie\\". the reason why i gave it four stars is because the silly plot, why would a hired killer take a cab to go on his killing spree? interesting. i'm ready for a Tom Cruise movie where he plays those cute nice roles. but really, this was a great movie. i think i can watch this movie with a guy. lots of great action and of course, i love me some Jamie Foxx. i just had me a Jamie Foxx film festival this weekend and it was just me, him and my DVD player this weekend and i had a ball. all by mysef. Thanks Jamie. i looked forward to our next encounter.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|One of the best things I like about it is that the kids think its cool and don't even realize it is not a \\"shoot-em up\\", or vulgar, or depressing. It is all about using your wits, and \\"whatever you find along the way\\" to get yourself out of whatever jam you are in. <br /> <br />So glad I found this on DVD.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I am so glad that someone finally tackled putting this story on film with Lloyd Webber's beautiful music.  As with others who have written reviews, this is one of my favorite shows, and I am a nonrepentent Lloyd Webber fan. <br /> <br />The film changes the story around a bit from the stage production, and I think it may have taken some of the mystery away from the \\"Angel of Music\\" and the Phantom himself.  The stage productions I have seen present the lagoon scene much later in the story, and it keeps the Phantom as a shadowy figure whom even Christine doesn't really know and has never really seen.  I also think the Phantom is much more accessible in this film than in the stage version.  In the film, he is sighted many times by people right on the stage rather than being the subject of a \\"ghost story\\" until his love for Christine makes him come forward as in the stage versions.  One wonders if the film Phantom wouldn't have been sharing lunch with the crew considering how accessible he is.  Also, one of the other reviews shown here states that the Phantom is made too sympathetic.  This is true, but I think he loses that sympathy when he speaks from Christine's father's crypt making her think that it is her father recommending that she go with him rather than with Raoul.   <br /> <br />The film cast is very good.  Messrs Butler and Wilson, and Ms. Rossum are all excellent actors and show it.  I'm glad Ms. Rossum has finally been discovered.  I saw her first in \\"Songbird\\", and I think she is finally blossoming into a beautiful and talented young woman with a lovely voice.  Simon Callow gaves his usual wonderful performance and the \\"over the top\\" performance of Minnie Driver as the Prima Donna is wonderful.  She deserves the supporting actress nominations she won from several organizations. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a film which should be owned and watched over and over just as I listen to my cast recording.  Gerard Butler does not sing as well as Michael Crawford or other actors who played the Phantom in other productions I have seen on stage.  His voice was stretched several times.  However, both Mr Crawford and Ms. Brightman, as talented as they are, are getting a little beyond the age where they could play these parts on screen.  The only regret I have is that with all the production scope of films, one misses sitting in the audience after the lagoon scene on stage wondering \\"how did they do that\\".
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Every so often there comes along a movie that is just so wonderful and perfect, one can hardly believe it was possible to be made at all. But Finding Neverland is one of those movies, sweet, innocent and wonderfully charming, it captures the heart and whisks  it away to a land of fairies, pirates and where children can stay young forever.<br /><br />J.M Barrie is played by the wonderful Johnny Depp, who is both kind and thoughtful. His innocent childish heart shining in every work he writes and the stories he made up to amuse the brothers Davies, while quietly romancing the mother played by equally wonderful Katie Winslet.<br /><br />This is a movie that will steal your heart from the opening scene to the heartbreaking last, and I wonder if it is at all possible not to cry at the wonderland Barrie created for Sylvia.<br /><br />Watch this movie, and let yourself become young again, because after all age is just a state of mind.

0375507256|4.0|We've all seen the sentence: \\"...this book stays with the reader long after the book has been closed\\" - well this book really gets a hold on your mind! <br /> <br />While I agree with some of the criticism of other reviewers, I found this book thoroughly engaging. It is a kind of hyperfiction and takes us on a wild, eye-opening ride to let us see how our \\"greed, hate, and delusion\\" have taken us on a downward spiral. We degrade the earth, the native people, all resources - and are not learning from our mistakes.  <br /> <br />I see it as the fiction companion to Jared Diamond's books. Great storytelling, interesting structure, a book you cannot put down. Enjoy!
0385512058|3.0|Ferrazzi does not offer a single original idea in this book.  If you are an avid reader of similar networking books, such as Tim Sander's book Love is the Killer App, or Susan RoAne's How to Work a Room, you should save your money. <br /> <br />However, Ferrazzi does do a good job of bringing together all the ideas from other bestsellers, so the book serves as a good summary.
B000066C87|5.0|Gosford Park is a fabulous English film about a day in the lives of a bunch of aristocrats and the lower working class servants. The all-star ensemble features many A-list serious English actors including some of my favorites Emily Watson(house maid), Kristin Scott Thomas(the wife of a wealthy man), Helen Mirren(the housekeeper), and Maggie Smith(a super snob). Actually, Ryan Phillipe is also in it with a fake British accent. Other sophisticated character actors include Jeremy Northem, Clive Owen, Michael Gambon, and Stephen Fry as the police inspector.<br /><br />The story is about the little things that goes on during the day while everyone is getting ready for a grand party. There are secrets and backstabbings between the two classes in the house. For instance, Emily Watson is secretly having an affair with her master/empolyer. Helen Mirren is withholding her true identity from the son who never knew her. Kristin Scott Thomas is cheating on her husband. The seemingly worry-free Maggie Smith might have to face finiancial problems if her sponsor stops giving her allowances. Then someone gets murdered and the houseful of guests and staffs all panic....<br /><br />This film received numerous Oscar nominations, and both Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren were competitors in the best supporting actress cateogory. I think Smith was brilliant, because she really captured the essence of her character, but it's an unlikeable one. Helen Mirren stood out when she had her breakdown later in the film. She did a great job holding herself together until she couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film tremendously, because it's funny, dramatic, suspenseful, and touching. It's very entertaining for a period English film, and it's one of my favorite Robert Altman film.
B000002U9W|5.0|well i dont have time to say much but this is a cool album.  The first song is the best in my opinion.  well i get a new favorite like evry week but who cares.   <br />well ill tell u about the songs <br />i will give grades <br />1.

Give it a listen and u may like it.  enjoy
0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is one of his greatest achievements in literature.  Not a particularly long book, it does do a lot with the 100 some-odd pages it has.  The story starts out with introducing us to the two antagonists of the novel, George and Lenny.  These two are an oddity in Depression-era California because for one, farm workers nearly always traveled alone and because Lenny is mentally retarded.  The two are on their way to getting another job after having been run off their last one.  The goal of our antagonists is to one day earn enough money to buy their own farm and live of the `fatta the lan'.'  This will soon lead to the novel's major theme of despair.  During their short time on the farm, George and Lenny meet many characters, all with their own personal despairs.  Candy is the old swamper who, like his dog, is outliving his usefulness, and fears he will be disposed of, also, like his dog.  Curley is a young man with a chip on his shoulder.  Feeling he will always be ridiculed, no matter what he does or who he marries, he is always pugnacious and looking to prove himself by fighting bigger guys.  Curley's wife dreams of stardom.  She is pretty and was always told she could be famous.  She now resents living on a farm and not having a chance to live out her dreams.  The old Negro, Crooks, has turned to books for companionship after years of neglect by all others.  So set in his ways, he rails against himself for even thinking that anyone could be his friend after Lenny and Candy visit him.  All of these characters, along with all of the minor farm workers, feel like they each have their own personal story of despair that they could share with you.  When George finds out that Candy has money put away and is interested in investing in the farm with him, it seems like the dream could become a reality.  But, if you know anything about Steinbeck, this cannot be the case.  Lenny eventually gets himself into some major trouble, shattering all of their dreams and George faces an impossible decision which will change both their lives forever.  It's amazing how such a succinct novel could have you caring so much about the characters by its conclusion.  Steinbeck makes his characters full and real and makes their pain the pain of the reader.  Again, this is a masterful novel and a must read that gets my full recommendation.
B000002AP1|5.0|Ahh the stooges. I'd have to say that this cd epitomizes the energy that is Iggy Pop.  While Fun House is a definite rival, Raw Power takes the cake; serving listeners with the most scrumptuous ear-pudding they'll ever experience.  Never heard the Bowie-version of this cd...personally i don't give a poop.  How can this cd be topped off?  It's the rawest, the most powerful, the wildest it's gonna get.  And for that i love it.
B00049QP74|5.0|Un retour russi pour l'ex-leader de dire straits. Du grand Mark Knopfler, tant au niveau de son jeu de guitare toujours aussi gnial, que de la qualit de ses mlodies. Un incontournable !
B000002LQR|5.0|How dare you insult this work of art. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the greatest rock bands ever, and Blood Sugar Sex Magik is a classic album. Every song on here is great especially Give It Away and Under The Bridge. Those are the two songs that got me into this album. Breaking The Girl is another great song. It brings tears to my eyes whenever I listen to it. Anthony Kiedis is a great singer, and he sure as hell can rap better than that whiny P.O.S Fred Durst. Flea is one of the best bassists in rock. He can do slaps, pops, I mean anything unlike that loser from Limp Bizkit who just reapeats the same lines all over and over. John Frusciante is a good guitarist who can lay down some cool funky riffs and rip some pretty good solos as well, and Chad Smith is a good drummer as well. Overall this is a great album and every rock fan should own it. RHCP rule!<br /><br />One last word to Bozo: WE CAN LISTEN TO WHATEVER WE WANT, SO F*CK OFF LOSER!
158799190X|5.0|Look no further if you need a book to fully engage all your mental capabilities. To list a few interfaces, the topics covered in the book are a blend of Literature, Philosophy, Mathematics and Finance. I must confess that my understanding of the contents after reading such a high density text is partial, but I am determined to read it again. <br /> <br />The book is an excellent discussion on the concept of probability and asymmetries in real life. We get a clear view as to how the human brain naturally lacks the ability to grasp this concept and is trained to think linear while life is full of non linear outcomes. <br /> <br />Imagine a sturdy typewriter over which a group of monkeys are allowed to dance. If billions of these creatures are at work, statistically, one of them might produce the Iliad, just by chance. Imagine if we were to honour this fellow and expect him to produce the Odyssey next.  <br /> <br />In another instance a clever trickster selects 10000 names at random from the telephone directory and sends them a recommendation to buy a particular stock. By the end of the week his forecast comes true to 5000 of these mortals. The next week he mails another recommendation to these 5000 and after the repetition of this process for a few weeks, we have about 125 hard core believers who are willing to pay anything for advice from this portfolio expert.  <br /> <br />The millionaire next door may just be an outcome of chance, the lucky monkey on the typewriter. However the society showers lots of praise on him for his vision, hard work,  business acumen and the like. <br /> <br />When the author was asked once if he was expecting the market to rise or to fall in a particular week, he says that it would rise. But he sells calls in apparent contradiction to his own opinion. The explanation is very interesting. He did expect with 70 % probability that the market would rise, but very slightly, but there was a chance of 30 % that it would fall steeply.  <br /> <br />There are several outcomes in life and in markets that are rare - black swans. But these are the exceptions that provide great opportunities. The author says that he is one of those happy crisis hunters who may lose small amounts of money frequently but makes tons of it during rare volatile events. The author uses the Monte Carlo simulator to visualise outcomes where mathematical equations are too complex or provide partial answers. <br /> <br />Entertaining, educative and at times too sharp in criticism of \\"proven theories\\" chances are that we have more questions than answers to many problems that we confront in our daily life.  <br /> <br />Journalists and MBAs  should be forewarned that they might feel like the creatures on the typewriter after reading this book.
B0007TKH66|3.0|Than again, DS9 could not either, until I bought the boxed season 1 and eagerly purchased all the rest. I don't hold much hope that ENT will have the same affect, sadly. I don't know if I'll buy into this series, literally. I do know that I pray that Paramount has something new in the works.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|For the reviewer that said it would have been nice if they told how the dead came back to life. They tell this in \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is the second part of the Dead triolgy which is soon to have a fourth part in \\"Land if the Dead\\" which looks like it will kick all the booty. It all starts with \\"Night\\" then goes on to \\"Dawn\\" then \\"Day, and now \\"Land\\". I would just come right out and say the answer to your question, but I would think if you haven't seen \\"Night\\" then I don't want to give any of it away. It all started there, and zombie movies in my opinion haven't come close to anything as good as \\"Night of the Living Dead\\". Now I guess I should say something about this movie. Dawn is a great movie all out, any fan of the zombie genre has seen this. It's worth the pricetag even since you get 3 different versions of the film. If you don't have this in your collection now, stop reading this and go out and buy it!!!
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Prior to the release of Graceland in 1986, Paul Simon was already a musical superstar. From his 60's days as one half of Simon & Garfunkel to his solo work the 70's, he created some of the most memorable songs in music. Through it all, the basis of his music was an acoustic guitar and deeply rooted in American sounds like doo wop, folk or jazz. When one heard the South African rhythms that came from Graceland, the last person you'd expect them to come from would be Mr. Simon. The lyrical content of the album is no surprise as Mr. Simon is one of the best in the business, but the musical backing is fresh, new and vibrant. \\"The Boy In The Plastic Bubble\\" just explodes out of your speakers and for some reason the song reminds me of a carnival. Ladysmith Black Mambazo adds stirring vocals to the sublime \\"Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes\\" while adding a plaintive almost mournful sound to \\"Homeless\\". Linda Ronstadt supplies a fine harmony vocal on \\"Under African Skies\\" while Los Lobos assists on the albums closer \\"All Around The World\\". \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" had a hilarious video with Chevy Chase but beside having a good video, the song is as bouncy and catchy as anything he's ever recorded. He not only uses South African beats, but he explores zydeco music on \\"That Was Your Mother\\" and stays at home on the title track. Graceland is the peak of Paul Simon's long and illustrious career.  The reissue, like all the others in the Paul Simon collection, is first rate.  The sound is greatly imporved and the packaging replicates the original album nicely.  Also like the other reissues, the three bonus tracks of demos are okay, but not revealing or required listening.
B000000H42|5.0|After their Roadrunner debut \\"Melissa\\" became an underground hit, \\"Don't Break the Oath\\" found Mercyful Fate at their apex.  Loaded with satanic lyrics, incredibly complex guitar melodies, and King Diamond's eerie voice, \\"Don't Break the Oath\\" is one of the best albums to ever be found in black metal.  \\"A Dangerous Meeting\\", \\"Desecration of Souls\\", \\"The Oath\\", and \\"Come to the Sabbath\\" are Mercyful Fate classics, and even the instrumental \\"To One Far Away\\" is pure metal joy.  The band would breakup not long after \\"Don't Break the Oath\\"'s initial release before getting back together some years later, but nothing they released since has compared to how powerful this album is.  Contrary to what a previous reviewer has stated, it's no secret that Mercyful Fate and King Diamond are not for everyone.  Yes, King's voice is an acquired taste to say the least, but this reviewer knows of fewer frontmen that can do lyrically and musically what King Diamond can; that's why he's been around for over 20 years.  And I wouldn't necessarily call Dio \\"real aggressive, kick a$$ metal\\" either.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Without a doubt this is Ryan Adams' best album since \\"Heartbreaker\\".  Though it is still too early to christen it the best album he has released, it definitely is going to compete for the title. <br /> <br />This album is a return to his country-rock roots but without sounding like he is just rehashing old songs and licks.  From beginning to end this 2-disc set is impeccable.  It seems to meld the singular brilliance of \\"Heartbreaker\\" with the consistency of \\"Gold\\". <br /> <br />A must listen.
6304779607|4.0|Another good action based movie/film. A good recommendation to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film despite there are some on and off (maybe is sound and loud which I've forgotten) during the playing of this movie/film. Enjoy.... <br /> <br />

His book is very practical and concise explaining to the reader methods for improving his current professional-social situation, whatever it may be.  It was full of insights and useful tips that I will surely pick up and put to use. It was very valuable and it opened new thinking pathways toward professional and personal success, after all in life it's all about people and the relationships we foster. I liked the warm friendly energy the writer projects with a direct go getter attitude.  I recommend this book to anyone wishing to live a richer life surrounded by meaningful relationships.

There are many good numbers of explosion and gun fire exchanges but what makes it a good laughing joke is that the police whom are sci fiction persnnel in this movie reacted in a 13 dots character. It is still a good recommendation to those whom prefer this genre of movie/film afterall. Enjoy.... <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Since this album already has many fantastic review that employ terms such as \\"prog-indie-acid-Latin-jazz-funk\\", I won't add another to the pile. Suffice to say that this album, and their previous one, is magical. Emotional. Terrifying. Addictive. Brimming with energy and exploding at every seam. The quiet/ambient parts that some people complain about actually need to be there, to provide the listener with a cooling-down period between the bouts of musical insanity.  <br /> <br />Yeah, there are a lot of new fans that I've seen at recent concerts who stand around looking bored through the half-hour-long jams, and who I'm sure are the ones who wrote the scathing reviews for this album. But take my advice if you will, don't buy into album reviews written by someone with ADD.  <br /> <br />No, go buy this record, and then burn it for your friends who have never heard of TMV. They'll be left wanting more, as will you. At the very worst, you'll learn some Spanish. :)
B000244EMO|5.0|Predator, to my mind, is not just the Best Ah-nuld movie, just nudging out T2, but it might be the best Action film ever put on screen, and in this collector's edition, it gets the treatment it deserves.<br /><br />Predator tells a rather simple story: American Special Forces operatives are ordered into the South American jungle to rescue some local government dignitaries.  After discovering and destroying the \\"rebel base\\" that supposedly housed the \\"officials\\", team leader Dutch (Arnie) discovers he's been dpuble-crossed by his old buddy, Dillon (Carl Weathers), now a CIA man.  This could have been a great movie right there, but Predator adds an alien that kills for sport that's dropped right into the jungle and begins picking off the squad.  What follows are a number of spectacular action scenes and just the right amount of dialouge that shows just how scared these guys, the baddest of the bad, are of this thing that's hunting them.  The script is lean and mean, never giving up more than it has to, and the direction by John McTiernen is perfect as well.  We're only given an idea of what the Predator really is and what it can do, until the final showdown in the jungle.  The suspense, for an adrenaline fuled action flick, is layed on with the right amount of frightened humor and energing dread as each character begins to realize they're probably not going to make it home.  The film never fails to entertain, and has a rewatchability factor that's off the charts.<br /><br />The DVD Collector's Edition that FOX has put out is a joy to behold for Predator fans.  The first disc features a DTS soundtrack that will shake your bones, especially when Jessie Ventura is firing the minigun.  The predator's sound effects, from the breathing to the \\"lock on target\\" sounds are crisp, and the dialouge never gets overwhelmed by the action.  And when it gets quiet, boy is it quiet.  McTiernan has a good, not great, commentary on the film that talks a bit about the problems getting the film made, which is interesting enough.  His best commentary is on \\"Die Hard\\", but this one is good.  The text commentary with technical details is fun to have on as well.<br /><br />Disc 2 is a great tribute the whole film, with a new Documentary that gives time to all of the actors, filmmakers, and the writer.  You get some great on-set stories from Weathers, Arnie, McTiernan and Ventura, and the is supplemented with seven featurettes that show the wierd looking lobster like costume the special effects guys came up with.  It's Van Damme in the suit, which is even funnier.  The disc is rounded out with a couple of deleted scens and the trailer.<br /><br />For Predator fans, this is the disc that you need to own.  FOX has been putting some terrific collections together since they abandoned the \\"5-Star\\" collection, and this is one of their finest.  Grab it now.g the film made, which is interesting enough.  His best commentary is on \\"Die Hard\\", but this one is good.

You get some great on-set stories from Weathers, Arnie, McTiernan and Ventura, and the is supplemented with seven featurettes that show the wierd looking lobster like costume the special effects guys came up with.  It's Van Damme in the suit, which is even funnier.  The disc is rounded out with a couple of deleted scens and the trailer. <br /> <br />For Predator fans, this is the disc that you need to own.  FOX has been putting some terrific collections together since they abandoned the \\"5-Star\\" collection, and this is one of their finest.  Grab it now.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|This movie works on so many levels. It works well on all of them. <br /> <br />As a documentary of the mentality of the cold war (this movie was released only a couple years after the Cuban Missile Crisis), it is very insightful, even if it is satire at its finest. One could probably do a psychology paper on the apparent regression of humanity as you climb the rank structure. <br /> <br />As a comedy it is just plain a gut buster. <br /> <br />As a period piece it contains the first big screen look at James Earl Jones, <br /> <br />As a movie lovers movie it enjoys tips of the hat from numerous films including Independence Day. <br /> <br />Wonderful movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I discovered Firefly after it had been canceled. After hearing that a DVD had been released, I decided to look it up on Amazon and saw that people with all kind of tastes were writing rave reviews. It was a while though before I felt willing to hand over my cash. Although I'm a Buffy and Angel fan, I've never been keen on westerns or sci-fi, not to mention the two together! It took a couple of episodes to get into it and initially I was thinking that it was just okay. Then suddenly I was hooked and the theme song was resounding in my head continuously. A fully-formed world like Firefly takes its time in establishing its characters, their development, and it makes you work a little bit to figure out its universe. But it's so worth it! By the time I'd finished the last episode, Objects in Space, I felt bereft and was already missing this odd assortment of characters. Thankfully though, a movie is coming out so the Firefly world lives on. (I've since lent the DVD to a couple of friends who had the same reaction, ie. it took them a few episodes before they were sucked in).
0671799320|3.0|I find a quote from Henri Deterding within this book highly interesting. Regarding Shell's efforts to involve Americans and American investors during its operations in the USA(while the country was still a net exporter of oil): \\"It is, of course, always galling...in any country to see an enterprise doing well without the local people being interested...It is contrary to human nature, however well a concern like that may be directed...not to anticipate there will be a kind of jealous feeling against such a company\\". While the oil industry was all OK with the sentiment of local control of oil operations (refining, marketing, selling, etc.) they (and the author, Daniel Yergin) have definitely not been disposed towards it in their operations in non-industrialized countries. How is local competition even to start up in producing countries if all the land containing oil fields is completely bought up by multinationals on ridiculously long 70,80,90,100 year leases? The results in Mexico, Iran and elsewhere speak for themselves. <br /> <br />I found that kind of thinking symptomatic in this book - which is highly informative and interesting, but clearly obviously biased in favour of the oil industry, ignoring or glossing over some of the abuses committed in its favour. When speaking of Iranian resentment towards the British in the 40s, for example, Yergin dismisses it as conveniently finding a \\"foreign scapegoat when so much was wrong at home\\" completely absolving the Brits of any reponsibility for their actions (including the carpet bombing of Persian villages in the early 20th century) in a country they had so much power over. <br /> <br />Read this book, but with the ability to read between the lines.
B00070QXL8|3.0|Oh how we love to cry \\"not as good as the first movie\\", but in truth very few movie sequels capture the freshness, or spirit of an often inventive and new idea like an original. Sadly, that is also the case here when comparing the first and infinitely better Bridget Jones Diary, but there are a few saving graces to make this at least mildy entertaining. The story picks up 4 weeks after the end of the first movie (although 3 years have elapsed in real time) and we find ALL the main characters reprising their roles. Bridget is still oozing the giddy romance and, likeably bumbling naivety of a 30 something schoolgirl, alongside Colin Firth's stoic, but gentlemanly romantic lawyer Darcy, and all seems well despite some nagging incompatibility issues between the two. The clash of class cultures between them continues (albeit in some very contrived scenarios) until doubt, envy and the adjustment of two single lifers suddenly sharing, looks set to send things off the rails. Enter at this point dashing bad boy Hugh Grant as Daniel, stirring up old memories, and mixed emotions, and conveniently now working for the same TV company as Bridget and we are set hopefully for some light entertainment. Problem however, is that none of the engaging aspects of Bridgets character from the first movie, or the concern or sympathy that were previously generated is here, and most of the original cast (nice to see as they are) are just minimally sprinkled in the plot for the purpose of continuity without any real inclusion. I kept asking myself why a sequel was necessary (as I often do, despite the obvious money spinning aspect) when the first picture was so complete, making this a reheating of old material to a large extent. There is enough charm to keep the picture moving, and the characters are all played excellently, but the script is limp overall, some parts being often less than funny completely (especially the Thai prison scenes). The occasional nice dialogue and one-liners try but fail to lift this picture out of the doldrums, and the cringe aspect of most of the embarassing situations Bridget falls into is painful at times. If you liked the first movie, chances are this will amuse you, but it's not in the same league unfortunately. There are some nice extras on the DVD including some funny interviews with the leading characters, deleted scenes, and the usual director comments etc. My best advice? rent before you buy.

B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard of the Killers when I was in L.A. last winter.  They seemed to be all the rage there at the time, so I broke down and bought the CD.

B00005JNQ8|4.0|I have never subscribed to the movie maxim that a great director makes for a great movie, but here it was never more true. Sydney Pollacks political thriller set inside the United Nations is a masterful pot boiler full of suspense, credible plot lines and directed with a masterful even handedness that is never overbearing. Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broom, a multi lingual translator working in the UN in New York, who overhears a plot to assassinate the dictatorial leader of Matobo (a war torn and divided African State). She is summarily placed under the protection of the Secret Service in the form of Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), an action that actually heightnes the nightmare into which she has become immersed, and the intrigue and suspense begins to build in even layers. Both Kidman and Penns characters are intertwined as they each deal with their own recent personal losses, but Pollack deliberatley steers away from a formula pattern of attraction, instead delving deep into character development and a great storyline. Is Kidman a target? a victim? or even a suspect? we find ourselves asking as the story unfolds. The two begin to play a gripping dance of evasion and revelation that keeps them both guessing as they head to stop a potential international crisis. There are some dramatic sequences, and thought provoking side comment along the way, giving the whole picture a complete and professional feel seldom seen in other films of the genre. The movie itself was groundbreaking as it is actually filmed  inside the UN (the first time this has ever been done), but this is just an interesting caveat to a great movie. Pollack himself pops up for a small but believable cameo (as he seems to do in most of his movies) but he takes a back seat to some top class acting, chiefly from Kidman and Penn in the lead roles. The early 2005 release will probably preclude an Oscar nod for next year, but this is right up there, and represents some of Pollacks best work, of the calibre of Three Days of the Condor, and The Firm to name just two. One or two very minor inconsistencies and flaws I felt personally, kept me from giving this 5 stars, but make no mistake, this is an excellent movie from all angles. Enjoy!ree Days of the Condor, and The Firm to name just two.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|A book entitled \\"I Greci al cinema. Dal peplum d'autore alla grafica computerizzata\\" (=\\"The Greeks on the screen. From peplum-movie to computer graphics\\")has recently been published by the Faculty of Preservation of Cultural Heritage, Bologna University, Italy. Professors in Classics, Historians, but also filmmakers joined their efforts with the purpose of tracing an historical outline of the movies dedicated ro Greek history and mythology from \\"The fall of Troy\\" by Giovanni Pastrone (1911) until today. Troy by Wolfgang Petersen is very well considered by these scholars.Vito Zagarrio (III University of Rome) advises us \\"to enjoy the glamorous special effects, to enter the new digital universe that allows any journey across the time\\" and to \\"enjoy the magnificent duels, especially the one between Hector and Achilles\\". The Historian of Antiquity Francesco Lucrezi (University of Salerno)is particulary interested in the character of the \\"self-conscious, rebel, invincible Achilles\\", with special regard to his representation in \\"the excellent movie Troy\\".  <br />I agree with these statements. Troy is a fine work, with good acting and a magnificent production design (very close to literary sources and archaeological evidence). I recommend it.
B00005JNRB|4.0|Dirk Pitt. Adventure has a new name? - so reads the tagline, and to be honest it's about time something new came along to replace the likes of Indiana Jones, and James Bond (against whom it is difficult not to draw comparisons). Matthew McConaughy is suitably charming and buffed as the handsome adventurer / treasure hunter alongside Steve Zahn's able but bewildered sidekick Al, in this global trek to find a phantom Iron Clad ship from the civil war that has somehow ended up in Africa. This obssession of Pitt's of course enrages his sponsor and employer Admiral Sandecker (superb casting William H Macy)who outwardly only tolerates his best asset but cares with a veiled admiration. The crew happen to be in Africa of course on another salvage operation, when they get a whiff of the Iron Clads possible location, but things take a turn however, when they must intervene to save Dr Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) who is on the run from the local warring factions after discovering illegal toxic dumping. The threeway escapade takes off with plenty of high jinks, action and adventure in a wholesome but believable way which is both refreshing and entertaining. Clive Cusslers novel may not have been represented to the satisfaction of the puritan fans, but the sober undertones of the story and one or two serious moments, do much to help keep this light romp on the ground. More than a buddy movie (although many cliches are apparent) this is a good contemporary story, and McConnaughy represents an ideal Action Icon for a modern audience. The reasonable success of the picture will undoubtedly pave the way for a myriad of sequels, but for now sit down, grab the popcorn and enjoy some old fashioned action and fun brought bang up to date. Enjoy

Paranoid Android leaves me with a truly euphoric feeling, exit music makes me feel touched, and No Surprises & Karma Police make me tingle. Electioneering rocks, and I could listen to Subterranean Homesick Alien for hours. <br /> <br />OK Computer RULES with a capital WOW.
B000000HHE|5.0|I have not seen this in stores for 2 years and a week a go I finally saw it and picked it up. I am glad I did. They were the original Tribe Called Quest(Q-Tip) even appears on here. Usually I hate skit's but they or good on here like \\"Transmitting Live from Mars\\" and the one about needing the numbers. Some of there music sounds like hippies other music is fun and some is funny. There are funny songs like \\"Potholes in my Lawn\\" and \\"Tread Water\\" then there extremely great pop tunes like \\"The Daisy Age\\" and \\"The Magic Number\\". Then there were also some socially consience songs like <br />\\"Jennifa Taught me\\" and \\"Buddy\\". I was dissapointed not to here the Buddy Remix that version is better.Then there is \\"Me My Self and I\\" which was there only Top 40 pop hit. Go out and Buy all there album. Beats, Rhymes, and Life.
B000063COX|5.0|The title says it all.  this is the beginning of what would become one of the greatest metal bands of all time.  Although its nothing like the style of the more famous albums lead by Dickenson, DiAnno isnt lacking anything.  In fact, i personally like him better.  his vocal style may not be as dynamic as bruce, but i think its more powerful.  more raw.  and it doesnt seem quite so whiny.  But its sad that most self-proclaimed metalheads havent heard of this cd.  they might have heard killers, and everyone knows number of the beast, but this one seems a rarety to those who dont explore maiden.  i would definetally recommend this cd though to anyone who likes killers or wants a taste of early metal.  Phantom of the opera is quite possibly the greatest track on here, followed by prowler.  prowler is almost verging on the style of wicker man or something of their new works (musically, vocally its close to something like purgatory). <br /> <br />All-in-all an excellent cd and a must for any metal fan!
B0002EXH4K|5.0|While Metallica were raking in the $$$ for their self titled 91 effort, one that essentially is the turning point in their career starting a slide of selling out, Megadeth were still at terms with their Thrash roots and Countdown is just as good a album or even better then their 80s work. Metallica stopped writing 8 minute epics and starting writing 4 min throw-aways but Megadeth can not be accused of this, they had always written brilliant thrash anthems in the 5 min and under section. And they cant be accused of their song getting softer either (that wouldent happen until Cryptic Writings and even then they produced pure Speed classics like FFF which metallica had failed to do since Justice) just listen to a song like Ashes in Your Mouth to hear the power. So anyway this is my breakdown of the songs - <br /> <br />Skin O' My Teeth - Is there a better way to start an Metal album then a full out attack on the ears. Great drumming, awesome riffage and some good lyrics about Mustaines dangerous life. Rivals Wake Up Dead as best start up song. <br /> <br />Symphony of Destruction - This is the single that got me into Megadeth and for good reason. The chugging riff is one of the catchiest things Mustaine has ever written, the lyrics have great social commentry  and are awesome to sing along to (especially live). If you want to introduce anyone into Deth start with this. <br /> <br />Architecture of Aggression - Another great chugging anthem with possibly my favourite Chorus. I love how mustaine crams the lyrics in. It works. <br /> <br />Foreclosure Of A Dream - The first slower song of the album, but still with some heavy ass riffage and more great social commentry added to by the brilliant video which everyone should by Exposure of a Dream for. They play in a set that is an exact replica of the cover to Countdown to Extinction. Brilliant. <br /> <br />Sweating Bullets - Haha, this song is just brilliant and is the Highlight of the album for me. Daves twisted lyrics will never ever top this song and the 3 note riff in the verse coupled with the bouncy chorus makes for one heck of a Thrash anthem. Three words - Black Tooth Grin. <br /> <br />This Was My Life - Good song, catchy. <br /> <br />Countdown To Extinction - Nice ballad, more social commentry (seems to be a theme does it not) <br /> <br />High Speed Dirt - Ive never really cared for this little tune about what happens when you fail to open your parachute when, well, parachuting. Great sound effects at the end though. <br /> <br />Psychotron - One of my favourites, more great riffery, good solo, lyrics about a thing (part bionic and mechanic, not a cyborg). Should be played more often live. <br /> <br />Captive Honour - Another great song about being imprisoned. Pretty funny at times (Life? I aint got a life) probably unintentionally. <br /> <br />Ashes In Your Mouth - This song took a while to grow on me, its probably the most complex of songs on the album, with some absolutely kick ass drumming. I now appreciate it for one of the best on the album and maybe that theyve ever done. Should have been included on the new Greatest Hits. <br /> <br />Well there you have it, one of Deths best albums, probably my favourite and although it is a change in direction from RIP it still kicks major ass and is better then anything Metallica did during the 90s. Dont wait get this and then get every other Deth album.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Not much to say other than that this is an absolute classic thrash album. Although we're painfully aware of what Slayer has digressed to in their last 3 albums, this album alone keeps people coming back to their shows. There's 10 songs on here and there's not one that is bad. Ignore all the negative criticisms from the 13 year old Linkin Park fans/Hot Topic patrons, this is a kick ass record from start to finish. \m/\m/ <br />
B00005JNTV|2.0|First of all my friends had to drag me to the theatre with them to see this movie. The violence was completely disgusting at points. The scene where that freak \\"Marv\\" severs Elijah Woods arms and legs, restricts the blood flow by tying off his arteries to keep him from bleeding to death and prolong his agony, before finally severing his head was a real turn off. Marv is someones idea of what a hero is supposed to be I guess. But he is clearly not mine. Bruce willis has a strong role here but its not enough to save this movie. Overall Sin City was such a downer that it left me wishing I had stayed home and popped \\"Return of The Jedi\\" into my dvd player instead.
B00005JNDZ|4.0|Even though Renee Zellwegger always looks as though she is saying the word, \\"oops\\" even when she isn't speaking, she is undeniably cute and a fine actress to boot. This film is nice. Not wonderful, not a brilliant piece of film-making and certainly not an unfamiliar theme. Just nice. <br /> <br />Zellwegger is her usual self; pouty, cute, irresistable even when deliberately overweight. But the plot has worn thin and her almost-virginal innocence is getting old. Clumsy girl meets boy, girl gets engaged, girl goofs up, girl gets sidetracked, girl gets boy back.... <br /> <br />That said, if you're in the mood for a pleasant evening, this is the ticket. If you're in the mood for a great, innovative story with exceptional delivery, choose another movie.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This clever British spoof on the zombie movie features the less-than-brilliant Shaun and his friends, all capitalist zombies working at McJobs, faced with the prospect of battling the undead. Guns being out in England, they use cricket bats, golf clubs, shovels, and in the two most memorable scenes of the movie; record albums and pool cues. I think it takes a particular black sense of humor to appreciate whacking zombies in time to Queen music, so if this does not sound funny, this movie is not for you.
B00006GFAB|4.0|When you're a member of KISS, a band that has gotten the reputation as \\"The hottest band in the world\\" (a reputation that not even The Beatles or The Stones ever got)and You're still popular when you've been around for thirty-two years, You're going to make new music, right? For KISS, the answer to that question is no. Like The Beatles and AC/DC, KISS has proved to be a legendary band, and while they will probably always be popular and have their place in the hearts of most people,still, unless the band makes a new studio album, fans of the band will probably still have the complaint they have had for a while.........there are too many KISS compilations available! I am a huge fan of the band, but I agree about there being too many KISS compilations out there. But even though \\"They Very Best of KISS\\" happens to be ANOTHER compilation by the band, it lives up to the album title. Read on for my review of this: <br /> <br />This album takes a thorough look at KISS. Most of the material on here is here is 70's material, but that is what most fans request for greatest hits compilations, so that is OK. I liked KISS' music videos in the 80's better than I liked the videos they made in the 70's and 90's, but my favorite music from KISS is definitely the 70's material. KISS has always been a band that is about fun, good times, and rock 'n roll, and occasionally there are songs by the band about \\"having fun\\". Everything KISS is about shows in their music, which is why they are such a great band. The 70's material selected here were all excellent selections. Unfortunately, KISS doesn't have the honor of being one of the bands that saved rock and killed disco (hence, the song \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\")but they do have the honor of being one of the biggest rock bands of all time. I wasn't alive during the whole disco craze,but I don't care for some of the new music that is being released today, so I like getting to put in a CD from a band I like when I don't like most of the stuff (I'm a huge Velvet Revolver fan)that has made it's way on to the radio. <br /> <br />Lastly, Ace Frehley's excellent cover version of Hello's \\"New York Groove\\" was included on this album, and three songs from the 80's line-up of KISS (\\"I Love It Loud\\", \\"Lick It Up\\", and \\"Forever\\")as well as a touching tribute to late KISS drummer Eric Carr (RIP),\\"God Gave Rock 'n Roll To You II\\", an Argent tune KISS did a sequel to in the early 90's. A very good compilation, but this loses a star for being another KISS compilation and also for not having the song \\"Tears Are Falling\\" on here. If you want a good, cheap (the group's 2001 self-titled box set costs over $50)look at KISS from the 70's to the 90's, pick up this compilation. You will probably get the good look at KISS you want, and there a few rare photos inside the album sheets.
B0002DB52M|1.0|I hate renting movies--and realizing they're not very good when they're over--but this was even worse--I couldn't even watch more than the first 30 minutes--and ten minutes into this movie I knew I'd thrown my money away.

(oh yeah-I guess that was intentional-there should have been a warning on this dvd-all scenes are filmed like a rehearsal) <br />Can't say much about the story line-since I (and those I was watching this with) decided we just couldn't take any more of it- <br />but if this was supposed to be interesting-I think I'd rather watch a spider spin a web! <br />\\"Stepford Wives\\", \\"Dogville\\" and \\"Birth\\"--is Nicole on a losing streak or what?

0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond is the most refreshing intellectual shower I have received during the last ten years. <br /> <br />I would describe Diamond as a neo-renaissance man with a lateral view that spans history, evolutionary physiology and science communication. Furthermore he manages to summarize world history into a SINGLE albeit long essay (this book). On top of that he embarrasses history experts by having written one of the most outstanding historical analyses of the last decades. <br /> <br />My superlatives seem to be justified when reading supportive comments by giants such as Edward Wilson or Paul Ehrlich... <br /> <br />Diamond can be considered an evolutionary biologist. In that category, he completes the queue ranging from Ernst Mayr to Stephen Jay Gould. His impact on non-scientists rivals that of Richard Dawkins. <br /> <br />I would suggest that \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" becomes the compulsary 101 history course for all graduate education; worldwide. Tell Unesco that. <br /> <br />But most important of all is the underlying statement that science - once again- comes to the rescue in the heated public debate on prejudice over cultural identity and increasing racist attitudes. Only using one basic science tool, namely, objective analysis, Diamond unveils the reason why, say, Europeans are what they are today and all of the might of the Inca's couldn't possibly have taken over Africa. <br /> <br />Professor Diamond.

0515127485|5.0|Robert Harris is one of the finest \\"page-turner\\" authors you will ever read. He has a real knack for increasing both brain cell activity as well as the pulse rate, and Archangel is another book in the slowly increasing Harris titles that will absolutely keep you up late turning the last 100 pages.<br /><br />It is difficult to speak about the plot without giving away too much. Basically, a historian, well passed his glory years, stumbles upon the possibility of a very valuable and reputation-saving diary left by the Man of Steel himself, Joseph Stalin. As the historian, Fluke Kelso (what a great name for a has-been), begins to investigate, it becomes very clear that certain parities would much prefer if he let the matter rest. I can't tell you more; but the author really makes the most of this premise. Many figures from Russian history are brought to startling life.<br /><br />Harris powers of description are really superb, and his images of Russia, especially rural, northern Russia, were so bleak and otherworldly I felt shivers. What I really love about Harris is not only are his story ideas enthralling and richly promising, his abilities as a writer back up the promise. How many books have you started because the story idea sounded great, only to find the author wasn't a good writer? Well, have no fear with Harris. His plotting and pace really make you feel like you are racing to the end, his characters are people you care about and oddly lasting in memory, and his historical research is really top notch.<br /><br />I guarantee you will be thinking about the words of Zanaida Pupava, the legal student paying her way through law school by turning tricks in a \\"new Russia,\\" long after you finish the book. -Mykal Banta
B0007TKNL0|5.0|If I never see another musical again, this will make up for everything.  I have never enjoyed a converted play before until now.  It's a breathtaking production with superior talent...WOW!
0316172324|3.0|I took away a lot from this book through its anecdotes. The content of this book is stimulating and fresh. I was getting excited and sucked in with the potential of where this was going. <br />Then some of the anecdotes went on a bit long but I could live with that. <br />However the book suddenly ground to a halt without drawing it all together and looking at the implications for readers wanting to hone their own ability to use 'blink' intuition/gut-feel in their own lives. <br />Right at the end he also added an anecdote that pretty much contradicted one presented earlier. He'd earlier spoken of a musician who was best evaluated when you could see his total presence. At the end he talks of better evaluating a musican performing behind a screen. While both were discussed in different contexts, it would have been good to integrate these disparate findings and fine-tuning the learning these offer as the outcomes had different implications. <br />I must say that since I finished the book my mind has been buzzing around making connections from the content he presented and I've been much enriched by this. It would be nice to think this was the effect of an approach to writing he deliberately set up so that we'd have to make what we could of the book through our own Blink/intuition. Then again perhaps it needed more writing and careful editing! <br />So the paradoxical - it disappointed yet I'm richer for it and glad I read it - and may lend it to friends!
B0000AUHPG|3.0|This film has much of the feel of a spaghetti western. It is directed by the king of spaghetti westers. It relies a great deal on scenery, intense staring, minimal but memorable dialog and sudden action broken up by long sequences of walking, staring, panning, or full frame closeups. What makes it different from others is that it obviously spent lots of money on production costs. <br /> <br />The scenery in Monument Valley is memorable and helps \\"define\\" the western. The cast includes lots of BIG names, many in cameo roles. The cinematography is first rate. The big problem is the lack of an interesting story. <br /> <br />There are several threads to the story. A railroad baron needs to build his railroad through a certain locality but wants to keep costs down. A fallen women comes west to as a mail order bride only to find her new family gunned down before her arrivval. She is heir to the land the railroad wants. An enigmatic stranger has problems with the railroad's head tough guy for personal reasons. There is also a \\"bad guy\\" running around who is not quite as bad as thought and whose life intersects at various points with all of the above. The motivating factors for the cast are greed and vengeance. <br /> <br />This formula can work. It obviously has for them many fans of this film. It did not work in this case with me. Most of the time, I just wondered when something interesting would happen. I got tired of the panoramic sweeps and long images of people riding by on horseback. Maybe I was just not in the mood. <br /> <br />Henry Fonda gives an outstanding performance as one of the bad guys. He is sadistic and evil to to core. This comes across without any problem at all. Charles Broson alos does a great job. He remains an enigma throughout much of the film but eventually we learn his motivation...if you can properly identity the character of the actor who plays him 20 years before. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale also do a good job, and in her case, a very decorative one. It's a shame to me that these fine performances did not come together with a better story. <br /> <br />This movie may well appeal to many for any number of reasons ranging from the strong performances to the scenery to even the love of the genere. As for me, I'm glad I saw it but have no desire to ever watch it again.

B0007N1AI6|1.0|I listened to this CD when I was driving back from home. I listened to the first song, it sucked, I listened to the 2nd song, it sucked and so on and on and so on. I just couldn't help about half way through each song skip to the next one thinking that it would be better than the last one and when I got to the end, I was more than happy that it was over. I've been a Priest fan since '86, I own them all and even that (unopened) boxset. This CD reminds me of two previously awful CD's that I purchased by the same musicians. One is CRUCIBLE (HALFORD'S SOLO), Two is DEMOLITION (OWEN'S SECOND W/PRIEST). It went from the store, to my hand, to my car, to the cd shelf at home. My brother in law was more excited about this cd than I was. I guess when you get older you tend to read more Barnie Books, but hey, if you love Barnie and want to hear \\"I love you and you love me\\" over and over again, purchase and listen to this CD that's exactly what you'll be singing when you done listening to it.
B000929AJQ|3.0|If you really want to hear music that will change your life check out the band Psychic TV who are about to release a new album. Psychic TV's leadsinger Genesis P-Orridge was the one who started industrial music with one of his other bands in the 70s then created the rave scene in the 80s in England before being Exiled from that country because of his (anti-)cult Temple Ov Psychick Youth.<br /><br />This is old man Nine Inch Nails, if you grew up with this band and got burnt out with age then this is the album you'll rediscover them with. I mean did you see those arms on Treat Reznor, that boy's been working out and I'd imagine it's hard to find time to be as moppy and pissed off when you're lifting 5 days a week. But forget all that, it's NIN without the crap, (others might consider it the edge or what makes it real) when I was younger I wouldn't have wanted NIN without the crap, and in all honesty I'm not sure how many rotations this album with actually see in my diskman because you know that crap I was speaking of a minute ago (the real edge blah blah blah) well that's what keeps you coming back for more, the Emotion. But what has this rich healthy famous musician got to worry or feel F-ed up about. Anyways my point, it's mature NIN, and if you were old enough to be into this band when they released Pretty Hate Machine (...), right back to my point, if you're old enough then this is kind of cool but if you're young and F-ed up and looking for something that makes sense in music you probably wont get any long term satisfaction from this one, actually I guess that applies to both young and older crowds. sum up -IT'S COOL BUT IT HASN'T MUCH LONG TERM APPEAL...pretty much like everything these days.<br /><br />**ALSO EVERYONE** I recommend checking out and listening to [...] to stay informed about what's going on and have a few laughs also animated political cartoonist [...]
B000002L99|4.0|Though many complain about HAGAR i actually like his vocals i mean he isnt dimond dave but he aint a bad singer i was hesitant to try any hagar stuff but i found this album in a bargain bin and i have to say it rocks this is some of eddies best work the first 6 songs kick A$$,GOOD ENOUGH is a great opener and WHY CANT THIS BE LOVE is one of my favorite hagar song GET UP is awsome sounds alot like early van halen DREAMS is another classic on this album SUMMER NIGHTS and BEST OF BOTH WORLDS have to be the crowning jewels on this album. <br />LOVE WALKS IN is another good ballad and 5150 is a great track the only track that brings down the album is the last one INSIDE. <br />but overall if you want to get into the HAGAR years of VAN HALEN buy this album.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|The Phantom of the Opera is an opulent, shadowy spectacle that gives the classic story the full Andrew Lloyd Webber rock-opera treatment, implying Webber himself to be the mad songwriting genius behind the mask.  Gerard Butler does a decent job as the Phantom, sounding alternately sensitive and deranged, and Emmy Rossum gives a luminous performance as Christine.  Joel Schumacher's direction is well thought out, and sends the stage action winging from the rafters of the opera house to the depths of the Phantom's underground lair.Although more serious in tone and considerably more expensive, Phantom still begs some comparison to The Rocky Horror Picture Show as a new entry in the rock-horror musical subgenre.  Both films had their start on the London stage, Rocky Horror in 1973 (film released in 1975) and Phantom in 1986 (during a Rocky stage tour in England).  Both are updates of classic literature and film and feature intense leading characters.The connection between the Rocky Horror and Andrew Lloyd Webber camps dates back to 1972, when Webber and lyricist Tim Rice brought director Jim Sharman and set designer Brian Thomson from Australia to stage the London production of Jesus Christ Superstar.  In the cast was a young Londoner named Richard O'Brien, who soon quit over creative differences to write his own rock musical play.  The Rocky Horror Show, directed by Sharman and designed by Thomson, was a smash hit in England and ran for seven years before being revived.  Its influences on stage and screen are still being enjoyed today.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|By 1978 there were very little hard rock bands left such as AC/DC,KISS. and other bands such as LED ZEP was diying up by now disco was rampid along with what would become punk.but out of southern california came a band determind to make it big this band was VAN HALEN with one of the best front men the world had ever seen along with the guitar player that revolutionized the guitar with 2 fingers VAN HALENS debut is one of the best.The first 6 songs on this album are awsome this includes some of the best ear candy in rock history \\"ERUPTION\\" wich intruduced finger tapping to the masses along with hits such as RUNNIN WITH THE DEVIL,YOU REALLY GOT ME,AINT TALKIN BOUT LOVE and JAMIES CRYIN  this also contains other good songs such as FEEL YOUR LOVE TONIGHT,ICE CREAM MAN,ON FIRE the only song that i would say i didnt like was LITTLE DREAMER.OVER ALL THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM.  SO BUY IT   PS all those who say would you still listen to it if it had no solos NO is my awnser because that would not be van halen.van halen is all about the solos like it or not, weather it be guitar or drums track 2 eruption need i say more?
B000002I7H|4.0|This is the best Albert King one disc compilation.  The reason I give it only four stars is that it isn't an career overreview. It only contains his mid sixties songs - the entire 1967 Born Under A Bad Sign album and a couple of singles from the same time. However I have heard that Born under a bad sign album itself is just a collection of singles. The 2CD Ultimate collection is by far better, including all on this one and even more - afew live tracks and spanning his whole career, but it's too expensive. And anyway, this was Albert's strongest period. The songs are similar to B. B. King's in the style of Albert's singing and use of orchestra, but the orchestra is even more of a background here for Albert than it is for B. B. Also, Albert is getting funkier on a few tracks, although he would become even more later, for better or for worse. (You Choose). His guitar playing is sharp , beeing gritty and a bit slick at the same time to create just the right combination. His playing belongs to the best blues ever witnessed.  <br />If you don't have enough money to buy the Ultimate collection, get this. It's worth every penny. <br />
0385510454|1.0|This is a 350 page book and the first 200 pages of it is basically about Italian sight seeing and learning the language.  You should buy a travel guide and skip these 200 pages.  The rest is a very poorly written spy story.  Mr. Grisham admits at the end of the book that his background is not in technology and alot of the research for the first 200 pages was based upon his visit to Bologna. <br /> <br />Do not waste your money.  Grisham is just getting a free ride because of his earlier work.
B0000AOV85|5.0|...and it was worth it just to hear Roger Waters on guitar...a six-string, no less! ...and David Gilmour on the pedal steel and Moog! These new acoustic performances, among others, of the album's songs are interwoven with conceptual films (including the animated ones) from the period when the album was originally released, and framed by interviews that look like they were filmed not too long before the DVD was released (2003)-the aforementioned Waters, Gilmour, along with Richard Wright, are among the interviewees and performers of other acoustic pieces that were filmed individually (no love lost, eh?), the interviews being informative and honest, touching on the band's internal conflicts and \\"lost\\" member Syd Barrett (sigh.)-all of this is in the bonus materials section-as for the feature itself, the three band members are joined by the fourth, Nick Mason, for the interviews, along with the people behind the making of the album (Alan Parsons, etc.) and assorted journos, they being again interspersed with studio and concert footage (more new acoustic with the period stuff but wait until you hear the \\"Money\\" demo!) and photos-in short, more talking heads than music, but what do you expect from a documentary? (I read this was originally shown on VH1)--Pink Floyd, like a lot of \\"classic rock\\" groups (Sabbath, Priest, AC/DC, etc.), have started reviewing their past, much of it resulting in archiving footage and performances so it can be released to their adoring public-some of these releases are left wanting in their presentation and selective in their material, but this offering from one of the chief progenitors of progressive rock and the \\"concept\\" album is a comprehensive overview of one the most listened-to albums (reel-to-reel, Quadraphonic, 8-track, cassette, DAT, mini-disc, CD, DVD audio...) in the history of rock and roll.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|As someone old enough to have seen the original stage production with the sensation that is Michael Crawford, I wasn't much interested in the film version, which was released in December 2004 to unfavorable and dismissive reviews.  However, now, having seen this new release by Joel Schumacher, I wonder what all the criticism was all about.  While the story has morphed from the original Lon Chaney version, it has happily evolved into a classic that will be watched for years to come.  Gerard Butler as the Phantom, and Emmy Rossum and Christine, shine in their roles and bring a compassion and vulnerability not seen before in this drama.  The director, Mr. Schumacher, infuses his film with the deeply caring hand and eye of an artist.  This release is destined to find its way into the film collectors' catalog as one of our favorite classics. <br />
B0007N1AI6|3.0|I was so ready to be charged by this album and initially I was.  There are still some tracks here that charge me up and always will, but the letdown tracks are also quite abundant here and I'll try to clarify my opinions on both. <br /> <br />\\"Judas Rising\\" - Freaking great tune.  Really kicks in with full force and utilizes the token Halford scream to get the blood flowing. <br /> <br />\\"Deal With The Devil\\" - Some good riffing, but a little repetitive and, like a few of the songs on this album, suffers from a Spinal Tap-ish quality. <br /> <br />\\"Revolution\\" - A blatant ripoff of the riff from Jane's Addiction's \\"Mountain Song\\", which in itself seemed to ripoff somebody else's metal riff.  Add to that the godawful chorus and this one is a real laugher. <br /> <br />\\"Worth Fighting For\\" - Moderately paced but well written, this is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of track.  I personally like it quite a bit except for the overwrought message in the title.  Like much of the album, it really relishes in the mid-80s metal feel. <br /> <br />\\"Demonizer\\" - The best track on the entire album.  This sounds like something Slayer would have written, except that they would have been encouraging the demon to stay in instead of singing \\"Out, demon, out!\\"  An amazing song that switches tempos and really outdoes classic Priest with its abundance of riffage. <br /> <br />\\"Wheels Of Fire\\" - A classic opening riff.  This song really reeks of late 70s/very early 80s Priest.  In that sense, it is sometimes boring and simplistic, but mostly it makes me miss that era. <br /> <br />\\"Angel\\" - Blatant ripoff song #2 as Priest creates a riff that is way too much like the opener to Dokken's \\"Alone Again\\".  No, it isn't quite the same, but it's too similar to ignore and they should have known better.  Ignoring that part of the song, it reminds me of the old 70s Priest when they would mellow out a bit and fans would ignite their lighters.  It's good in that sense, but it ticks me off that they couldn't be more original in their songwriting. <br /> <br />\\"Hellrider\\" - Definitely a retro intro similar to \\"Judas Rising\\".  Initially the song is destroyed by a chanting, robotic opening verse which thankfully seems to disappear later in the song.  The riffs are fantastic, however.  A real rocker that uses a bit too much double bass like more than a few of the songs on this album. <br /> <br />\\"Eulogy\\" - This one basically serves as an introduction to the final song.  Not much to report here.  It's slow, mellow, and short. <br /> <br />\\"Lochness\\" - About 7 minutes too long.  I love epic tunes, but this is not Iron Maiden's Ancient Mariner.  It almost seems like they did this just to have an epic and just to fill up enough material to rush their reunion album out.  Don't get me wrong.  The song is good, but there's a bit too much filler material inserted in here and the riffs are often extended by twice as many measures as they need to be.  By the time it fades out and re-emerges near the end, you'll want the Loch Ness monster to jump out of the water and gobble up the band.  It doesn't help that this is another song oozing Spinal Tap in both subject matter and self-indulgence. <br /> <br />So that's my opinion.  This CD is worth buying, but the purchase is almost strictly nostalgic with the exception of a few songs.  Maiden's \\"Brave New World\\" and even the more recent and weaker \\"Dance Of Death\\" had much more to offer.  I'm not saying that as a Maiden vs. Priest kind of challenge, but just recognizing that Maiden (who owe their career to Priest) came back with more of a vengeance than the band that screams so well for it. <br /> <br />Buy this CD, but don't expect to be floored. <br /> <br />**I bought the CD with the DVD and the DVD has some live tracks that are mixed particularly well for 5:1 sound.  The performances on the DVD are decent, but not mindblowing.  You are definitely reminded that these guys are not spring chickens!  The documentary is somewhat interesting, but watch it before you watch the live performances because the documentary includes most of those and has entirely too few dialogues and interviews.  If you watch the live performances beforehand, you'll be fastforwarding through a good portion of the documentary.
6305363668|5.0|I have seen the original 1982 version of the movie several times, and I read the Phillip Dick novel it was based on.  I will compare the Director's cut with both, after I review the movie as a whole.<br /><br />This is my favorite Sci-fi movie.  Those who have read my other reviews know I divide science fiction into true science-fiction (which is based on what could possibly happen), science fantasy (which is fantasy is a futuristic setting, like Star Wars), and science horror (which is primarily meant to terrify, with the Alien movies and Jurassic Park fitting into this vein).  Both the movie and the novel fit clearly into the first section.  The movie is very thrilling, but the action and suspense do not distract from the themes being explored, and you leave the movie focused more on the themes than on the action (at least I did).<br /><br />The acting is great.  It wasn't until seeing the movie again that I recognized William Sanderson (Newhart, A&W Root Beer Commercials) as J. S. Sebastian.  Rutger Hauer's portrayal of Roy Batty seemed low key at first, but by the end, his performance reminds me of Malcolm McDowell's in \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"  Harrison Ford is, well, Harrison Ford.  Sean Young is an attractive love interest, and Darryl Hannah and Joanna Cassidy are appealing as well.<br /><br />The movie deals with three themes:  1) prejudice, with robots being the new slaves; 2) mortality (in the movie, the androids can only last for four years, and the primary antagonist, Roy Batty is in search of prolonging his life); and 3) what makes a creature human (the androids show signs of humanity and feeling, while the humans, including the protagonist Rick Deckard, can seem to have robotic lack of emotion.<br /><br />The Director's Cut adds a little to the mortality theme and even more so to the humanity theme.  One of the things done here is the removal of the voice-over that many hate.  I actually enjoyed the voice-over; it made me smile when Ford says his ex-wife referred to him as sushi, cold fish, and the concluding voice-over helped with the upbeat ending, though I considered the ending to be a little out of place.  The lack of the voice-over omits any hint of the marital status of Deckard, though there is definitely no suggestion of him being currently married.  At the end, the upbeat ending is gone, leaving one to believe Sean Young's character may not last more than four years (the voice-over says there was no expiration date for her, allowing for a happily ever after ending).<br /><br />Having not seen the movie for over 20 years between seeing the original and the director's cut, I saw some scenes I didn't remember, and wondered if they were part of the director's cut.  One scene I knew was added was one of a unicorn running, which was as out of place as the beautiful tree footage at the end of the original.  However, that out-of-place scene does heighten the question of whether Deckard was human or an android.<br /><br />Most of the time a movie is based on a book, people feel the book is better than the movie.  This absolutely is not the case here.  The movie uses the characters from the book, and some of the setting elements such as most animals being artificial instead of real, but from there it has no similarity to Dick's book \\"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?\\".  The novel is more nihilistic (that is, that there is no purpose to anything).  The book also has an anti-religious tone to it, which the movie lacks.<br /><br />This movie is very violent.  Even the love scene is a little rough for some people.  The violence and one topless scene earned the movie's R-rating.  Thus, I would not recommend it for children at all, and that teen-ager's should see it with parental presence.  To me, though, the development of the themes more than makes up for the roughness of the picture.ex-wife referred to him as sushi, cold fish, and the concluding voice-over helped with the upbeat ending, though I considered the ending to be a little out of place.

B0007N1AI6|3.0|With the \\"Metal God\\" back at the healm, the traditional Priest sound is back in place. Don't get me wrong I did listen to and appreciate the Ripper albums for what they were worth, however they didn't sound like Priest. All the old school elements are present on this Priest release. Glenn and K.K.'s shredding are as good as they've ever been. Ian Hill's bass is solid, and Halford's vocals are versatile and are reminiscent of all previous Priest albums. However it is in the songs where Priest fail to regain their past glory. \\"Judas Rising,\\"Deal With the Devil,\\"Revolution,\\" and \\"Lochness,\\" are almost as good as Priest has ever been.  However songs like \\"Worth Fighting For,\\"Angel,\\"Hellrider,\\" and \\"Eulogy\\" sound quite uninspired and really do not do anything for the album. Bottom line is that Priest is back, and they still have the talent to make metal history again.  The original material on this album is hit and miss, but it's still worth the purchase to see the DVD material, and for the good songs mentioned above. LONG LIVE THE METAL GODS!!!!!!
6300183971|5.0|I would like to be an exception to SharpX13 \\"Jeremy\\"'s comment that those who read the book loved it and those who didn't hate it.  I've never read any of the Dune books, and I also haven't seen any other David Lynch movie besides this one (though I did watch some of Twin Peaks).  Yet, I enjoyed this picture immensely.<br /><br />  For those who haven't seen this picture, it has excellent special effects.  If the job of a movie is to take you to a world you've never been, this would qualify for exhibit A.  It is too graphic and intense for the younger crowd, with a PG-13 rating.  It is long, but not boring.  This movie made a very strong impression on me.
B000929AJQ|2.0|\\"With Teeth\\" is a very strange title for this record, as it has none.  It simply doesn't have the raw edge of all of his previous work.  This morning I listened to this and then followed it with Pretty Hate Machine, just to get a direct comparison.  PHM is *much* more lyrically and musically interesting and involving.  You can tell that there was a lot of emotion that went into PHM, whereas \\"With Teeth\\" just doesn't feel like he put as much of himself into it, and none of the tracks have the musical complexity of past releases.  There simply aren't as many or as interesting layers of sound in it.  Makes me sad, because I've been a NIN fan for a long time, seen them live, was an awesome show, but next time they come through, I hope the live show avoids the new material...
0143034901|5.0|This book has all the features of a truly great novel: The characters are painted with gentle yet forceful strokes and remain authetic even those that represent the most fundamental forces in the human mind. As the story unfolds it takes us still further into the minds of the caracters as the struggle to love and live in tormented postwar Barcelona.<br /><br />The story takes on the grand legend in a way that could easily turn melodramatic but it remains authentic and captivating all the way through.<br /><br />There is no way this review can do this book justice. Read it and enjoy - it will stay with you for a long time after it is finished.
B000929AJQ|5.0|let me start of by saying that i am a huge nine inch nails fan.  that being said, i thought the fragile was a good album, but not a great album.   with teeth on the other hand, is what we have come to know and appreciate from trent reznor.   <br /> <br />i am not going to break down song by song, because it has been done so many times, but i will let you know what i tell people when the ask me about the new album. <br /> <br />it has a little bit of pretty hate machine, a little bit of broken, a little bit of the downward spiral and a little bit of the fragile but at the same time different all together.  <br /> <br />i highly recommend this to any fan, whether they be die hards, old fans who have left or new fans who are just getting into nine inch nails.  <br /> <br />FIVE STARS!!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|There's not much more to say than this album is the best album i have ever heard (and i own hundreds). One of the few albums where every songs is great, you can't even decide which one is the best.
B0000931QA|5.0|Along with Scenes from a Memory by Dream Theater and maybe Dead Winter Dead of Savatage, Operation Mindcrime album is the king of all prog metal albums. It has everything in it, great lyrics, great music, great singing and playing, and mostly it grabs you and takes you inside of it. I got this album 15 years ago, and still until today, whenever I listen to it, it has the same effect. Get it!
B000002JAX|5.0|Love both of her CD's....recommend them highly.  Norah Jones...move over....wonderful voice and presentation.
B000929AJQ|5.0|DISCLAIMER:  <br />--- <br />I'm 16. So I'm a kid. Just shoot me. <br />--- <br /> <br />FIRST OFF,  <br /> <br />As I was scrolling down the reviews list I noticed a disturbing trend: <br /> <br />NIN's 3rd album, THE FRAGILE, was a sprawling masterpiece of layers, undercurrents, hidden lochs, and massive geography. It was country-sized Industrial-space rock for the masses. <br /> <br />Except the masses didn't like it. They wanted to see sculpture, they wanted buildings, not mountains and plains and ocean floors.  <br /> <br />They also missed out on one of the 5 best albums of the 90's and one of the 30 best albums of all time. Their loss. <br /> <br />The Fragile was all bite and no bark. It took me over 8 months to fully analyze and \\"understand\\", and about 3 months to actually adore. But once I did, it was completely embedded in me. I can't get enough of it. <br /> <br />Anyway, back to present day. <br /> <br />What we see know are all the little drecks I swore I'd never turn into:  <br />Fat little armchair critics demanding that, just because NIN crafted a country out of sand and mud, that they can't come back and do some straight-up architecture. <br /> <br />(I guess architecture was like, SO last week.) <br /> <br />--- <br /> <br />THE ALBUM <br /> <br />While Reznor's ever-present lyrical annoyances are here, as everyone has mentioned AD NAUSEUM +15, the lyrics on this album are much stronger than those of Pretty Hate Machine, The Fragile and Broken in particular.  <br /> <br />Let's face it; the Downward Spiral will always have the best lyrics, unless you count Lost Highway. <br /> <br />The songwriting is straightforward. No self-album-referencing riffs, very few repeated lines, and generally an ironically coherent scatterboard variety of music is present. <br /> <br />But what's interesting is *how people embedded in the fanbase are flailing this album as if Reznor never wrote straighforward music before*.  <br /> <br />In fact, wasn't the crowd begging for a new PHM? (I wasn't, but most of them were) <br /> <br />Oh well. People get caught up in expectations and subconsciously load their guns to protect TEH MOST INACCESSIBUL ALBUM TEH EVAHHH, THE FRAGILE, IT MUST B HEARD TO B BELEEVED and forget that NIN was always primarily straight-up architecture. <br /> <br />But more on the architecture.  <br /> <br />The overall sound of the album is diverse, as I've said. The verses seem mediocre on the first 3 listens or so, then fair, then great by the 14th or so. The choruses are so good that they even top \\"Sin\\" and \\"Ruiner\\" in a few key moments, namely \\"Sunspots\\" and \\"Only\\", two definite future fan favorites. <br /> <br />For non-NIN fans, this is THE album to be converted to. Don't even begin to think otherwise; my classmates, little prep losers, are  already digging this album, for better or for much, much worse. <br /> <br />It's not that this is a \\"sellout\\"; (that was reserved for either PHM or \\"Deep\\") it's just that it's good. It grips you just like the Downward Spiral, but takes you for a less grating ride. <br /> <br />With Teeth is an album you will want to listen to over and over. It's filled with little gold nuggets, ranging from the very beginning beat, the piano outro on the second track, the chorus on the third, the frightening cachophony following \\"With Teeth\\"'s piano interlude, the syncopation on \\"Only\\", the dentist drill of \\"Sunspots\\", the strobe pulse orgasm of oblivion on \\"Beside You In Time\\", and the subdued but unique little final goodbye, whose lyrics are, for once, worth listening to. <br /> <br />Drop your pretentions, listen to this knowing that the next best thing on the radio is either Weezer or Audioslave, or listen to it pretention-free and remember that this will be remembered as one of the top 20 albums of the decade in just 5 years. <br /> <br />Oh, and armchair critics: <br /> <br />The way out is through. <br /> <br />(PS. Guys, if you wanted originality, why not pick up some of TheStrokes or some Jet? Talk about Pretention Therapy)
B00000J8EK|5.0|I don't understand why this album gets panned by critics and fans of the Chemical Brothers.  In my opinion this is their best CD.  So many styles of music were explored here with many having their roots in other genres (shoegaze, house, acid, trance).  Overall this is a much more varied album than both Exit Planet Dust and Dig Your Own Hole combined.  I was tired of those two albums years and years ago but this one still gets played while hundreds of albums I own don't.<br /><br />Favorite tracks: Asleep From Day, The Sunshine Underground, Surrender, Dream On
B0008ISM40|5.0|I've been a NIN fan since the beginning and love them more after With Teeth than ever before.   Normally I would go into a lengthy review, but it seems there's not much to this that hasn't been said.  If you like NIN, you already have this.  This review is just my nod of approval.  10 out of 5 stars.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I wasn't going to write a review.  I just came on to check the release date of their next album.  Then I checked Train of Thought (or \\"trainwreck\\" as one reviewer put it, heh) and was pissed off at how overrated it was.  Then I check this out and get pissed off at how UNDERRATED it is. <br />First off, Train of Thought sounds like Metallica cerca Load era, and it sucks really bad.  With that out of the way, onto this one. <br />I can't even begin to describe how beautiful some of the tracks on this album are.  Blind Faith, Misunderstood, Disappear, About to Crash, Goodnight Kiss, Solitary Shell?  Are people so desperately in need of distorted madness that they can't appreciate how intensely beautiful the music is here?  Are we really so caught up on lyrics?  So what if they're cheesy???  THIS BAND IS KING CHEESE!!!  And that's why I love them--they cram the elements of metal, opera, and broadway into one seriously talented band!  The genre SCREAMS cheesiness!  Not to say all cheesy things are good.  I back away from MTV shielding myself with a crucifix.  But sometimes everyone needs a little cheese.  Besides, this is MUSIC.  You want great lyrics?  Buy a poetry book.  At least the stuff here doesn't embarrass me. <br />Ripoffs?  Like what?  Tool?  Does DT even listen to Tool???  That riff is a universally basic guitar interval.  Almost every dark metal band has a riff like that.  And where the hell are we getting Radiohead from?  I listen to more Radiohead than DT and I see no resemblance whatsoever.  As for the rest of these so-called ripoffs, I don't listen to Rush or Pantera or YES, but from what I've heard about Tool and Radiohead, I can't really take anyone's word for it here. <br />Really, we're quibbling over semantics here.  This is an album that you can either like or not like (or hate--plenty do, and that's their right).  Personally, I prefer Awake and Images and Words to this. <br />In summary, DT HAS indeed made a great album here (I say third best).  And I saw the whole album performed in concert, but the concert sucked.  Then I saw them a year later doing all their old stuff and that concert totally rocked.  DT is subject to disappoint at times.  But they've got potential.  This album shows them way the hell on top of their game.  The one that follows, well... eh...you decide.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Ryan Adams is an overblown egomaniac. Ryan Adams is an underrated musical genius. Most listeners of his music fall into those camps, and the debate lives on. But one thing cannot be denied: Adams is a very good musician, and his brand of whiskey-soaked alt-country is in good form in \\"Cold Roses.\\"<br /><br />The two-disc album not terribly new territory, with echoes of \\"Heartbreaker,\\" albeit more subdued. And as the first of three scheduled albums this year, with his new band the Cardinals, hopefully \\"Cold Roses\\" representative of what Adams is going to stick to in future. It's certainly what he's good at.<br /><br />The songs here tend towards bluesy, midtempo rock, with countryish guitars and solid drums. The Cardinals are definitely a band that suit Adams' style, and they have a comfortable feel, as if they have been playing with him a long time. Songs like the gritty country song \\"Cherry Lane\\" are among the highlights of the album. There are also some slower, softer numbers like the poignant \\"How Do You Keep Love Alive,\\" which balance out the more robust songs, and show the softer side of Adams' music.<br /><br />Like many other two-disc albums, \\"Cold Roses\\" does suffer a little from double-disc syndrome, wherein some of the songs feel like they were put in to flesh out the tracklist. Fortunately, this is restricted to only a couple of songs. The majority of songs are strong and solidly written, with a well-worn sound like that of a comfortable slipper.<br /><br />After a few years of experimentation -- through the deeply forgettable \\"Rock'N'Roll\\" and the lovely acoustic \\"Love is Hell\\" -- now Adams is back at his roots. The Cardinals are guitarists J.P. Bowersock, Cindy Cashdollar, bassist Catherine Popper, and drummer Brad Pemberton. They all do marvelously, especially since they are an experienced band, with prior work with people like Heather Nova, Hem, and past work with Adams himself.<br /><br />Adams's voice is scratchier than in his past albums, but except for a few strained vocal moments, he sounds a bit world-weary but pleasant. He also gets joined by singer-songwriter/pianist Rachael Yamagata on three songs on the second disc, playing her instrument and lending her pretty voice to Adams' older, rougher one.<br /><br />Bluesy country-rock is where Ryan Adams belongs, and he does well with his new band the Cardinals. Here's looking forward to Numbers 2 and 3 this summer and fall.ounds a bit world-weary but pleasant. He also gets joined by singer-songwriter/pianist Rachael Yamagata on three songs on the second disc, playing her instrument and lending her pretty voice to Adams' older, rougher one.

B00008NRL8|5.0|When GP produced this work in 2001, they never imagined the impact in Argentina's artists. Since then, a quiet revolution has been taking place in a genre where Piazolla in the 60s-70s made the last renovation. Now in Buenos Aires, there's a myriad of electrotango followers such as Bajofondo Tangoclub, Narcotango, Tango Crash, Tanghetto, Mac Dougall Tango and young people has returned to their grandparent's music in a new shape.
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game is an excellent piece of science fiction written with the original written in the same year as Star Wars yet, as with Star Wars, it hasn't dated for the same reason; the science fiction is a back drop to the human drama and story.  We aren't blinded with science or the cleverness of the author, what shines like a bright light through this book (and the rest of the saga which I confess all 7 'Ender-verse' books inside 3 weeks) is the depth of the characters and their struggle with what they are and what is wanted of them. <br /> <br />In the end you will either care about the characters OSC has created or you won't (I did).  However, you will put the book down satisfied as it has good pace, great plot and a twist only predictable moments before it happens. <br /> <br />I would urge you to complete the Ender saga.  While book two is a little slow the pace picks up again through 3 and 4 with the end result, a 'complete' work of fiction that is trully touching, memorable but more importantly, very thought provoking. <br /> <br />And in reply to those who feel Enders Game is riddled with un-PC references, remember it was written nearly 30 years ago.  Words have different meanings now to what they did then and some allowance needs to be made for it.
0743455967|5.0|I was also afraid of being a writer. The ideas and words in my mind were and in many ways are puzzles I have a hard time connecting. One thing about being a writer is that you can and you sould be expressive; it is your god given rite. Although I'm sure a lot of people would argue that with me. I read half his book in one three hour sitting, savoring each and every word as though it was psychology to my confustion. Years of college instruction on writing couldn't make up for one six hour reading that King offers here. Now, I look at my existance in a much brighter, less frightning way. King paves your way with his steps and by the time you are through reading this mastepiece you find yourself in the seat of a writer.
B00005B36H|5.0|In my opinion, Tool is the best thing to happen to music since Vivaldi, and this is the best album they've put out.  So, by simple logic, Lateralus is the best album ever.  Maynard's voice is, as always, simply captivating, Danny Carey is god on drums, and Justin Chancellor and Adam Jones do a great job.  I would list 'standout tracks' or whatnot, but I listen to the album straight through over and over again.  To me, it's a sonic masterpiece, not a collection of songs.
B00000E2VC|5.0|A disc to treasure. 10 Mazurkas beautifully played by Michelangeli, and staggering performances of the G-Minor Ballade and B-flat minor Scherzo, all in superb sound. I recall when this recital was issued on LP that most critics panned it. I don't know why. It has always been one of the outstanding Chopin collections and one of Michelangeli's finest achievements. Put this alongside the Testament 2 CD live recital (with the Schumann Carnaval), and the Ravel and Debussy recordings as perhaps this great pianist's finest recorded legacies.
B00000AFGM|4.0|Now while Mechanical Animals wasn't Manson's best effort to date, it is by no means a piece of crap, and I'm extremely offended by your statement that only \\"freaks and weirdos\\" listen to this.  While a good portion of Manson's fan base is composed of the gothic  kids, he also has a large number of fans that are considered 'normal'.  So, you're ignorant.   <br /> <br />Some standout songs on this album are Great Big White World, Mechanical Animals (I don't know why people would not like this song), I Want to Disappear, I Don't Like the Drugs, and of course Coma White.  The rest of the songs are also good and enjoyable, but not the standouts that those are.   <br /> <br />Not a great album for the beginning Manson fan, as this will not give you an idea as to what to expect on some of the other albums.  Very different.  But, it's a good album, and you should pick it up sooner or later.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Let me say this once, I listen to music that I'm told by people who listen to this that it isn't music. Ha ha ha! She can sing ol' Brit but she's no musician, she has nothing unique about her at all. You want something good, try Nile (fantastic), Cryptopsy, Lamb of God, Masonna or anything from any other genre in fact. The beats are all the same and the obvious playing and replaying of the hooks is funny. Grow up. <br />
B0007YMUZW|3.0|I have liked Ryan Adams for awhile, and have liked just about everything that he has come out with. But if your not familiar with Ryan Adams as an artist, I wouldn't have this be the first album you get. The album isn't bad, \\"Let it Ride\\" being one of the highlights. However, in this album his voice seems strained, and I really think it hurts the overall sound. For Ryan Adams fans, take a listen, you'll probably find a few songs you like.. Otherwise, I would go listen to his early stuff first.

0920668364|5.0|This is a wonderful depiction of love in its most ideal form...a notion of unconditional love being passed on through the generations. This book is cherished by all my family, from youngest to oldest, and will continue to be adored by our descendants. For those of you who find this book \\"weird\\", because of the mother's efforts to show her love to her son, please remember this is only allegorical, a fairy tale about idealized love, not an allusion to any bizaare mental condition. It is meant to show the unerring devotion we need to give to our children and how those efforts are ultimately rewarded. This is an hypnotic, heartachingly beautiful book about love in its primary and most incomparable form, the love a parent has for their child.
0517543052|5.0|This a fantastic book not just about mysticism but, like Blake, the mysticism of everyday life. <br />It is the ultimate self-help book and every page is filled with the joy of living. <br />Like Blake every page of this book is filled with illustrations and a poetic mysticism. <br />Self-help books come and go but this book should be on everyone's book shelf. <br />So much is said in the very word's or the book's title \\"be here now\\". <br />In the seventies I remember this book being in every dorm room. I think many of us benefited from it. <br />Perhaps some of us have forgotten its power so  pick it up again. Buy it for someone you know who never had the experience of reading this book. <br />If you owned it once and lost it buy yourself a new copy. If your copy is old and dog eared buy yourself a new copy. <br />I had the pleasure of knowing Ram Dass personally. He was always caring and never acted like the celebrity he was.  <br />Now Ram Dass needs our help as his situation as he approaches old age is not good. <br />Do yourself and Ram Dass a favor and buy this book. If you bought it before buy it again. <br />
038572179X|3.0|Pay attention to the review that says \\"at heart, Atonement is about the pleasures, pains, and dangers of writing, and perhaps even more, about the challenge of controlling what readers make of your writing.\\" This is exactly what I didn't like about Atonement. It started as a very interesting story about misunderstandings and private perceptions, jealousy and ambition, as a precocious young girl begins to grow up. But as the novel progresses the author becomes more interested in writing about writing, and less in writing about the characters. It's ultimately a meditation on what it means to be an author. It was a big disappointment for me for a novel with such interesting themes to turn into a solipsistic exercise.
B00005QW5X|5.0|A brilliant story about love, the struggle for recognition as an artist, rock and roll and isolation. <br />It's also about a transsexual but that is almost incidental. <br />The music borrows from punk and glam rock but is completely original and hard driving and is accompanied by equally hard driving images and animation. <br />For those of you who have not see the movie I don't want to give too much away. <br />Hedwig Robinson heads a band called the Angry Inch. She/he was born as Hansel in drab East Germany and leaves thanks to his/her marriage to an American army officer and a sex change operation. In America she meets a young man named Tommy who she falls in love with. She grooms him as a rock star. But when Tommy learns of Hedwig's anatomical anomaly he leaves her, steals the songs she wrote and becomes a superstar. Through the movie Hedwig stalks Tommy as she and her band playing in a third rate dives of the \\"Bildgewater\\" chain in every city Tommy is playing to sold out crowds in stadiums. <br />In between the rock and roll is a lot of philosophy. Sadness and humor are played side by side.  <br />As far as the humorous side of this movie sometimes it is sidesplittingly funny. <br />Hedwig's self deprecating lines are brilliant. <br />The movie is both outrageous and sympathetic to the human condition (not just for transsexuals). <br />This is a tour de force by John Cameron Mitchell wrote directed and stars in the lead role. <br />This is not just a cult movie! As far as I am concerned it blows the socks off of \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\". <br />A really treat to the eyes, ears and mind. <br />Truly a d*mn joy! <br />You will want to own this movie.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Yes, I know changes were made, but I still think this is the Holy Trilogy... Star Wars, Empire and Jedi. Why do I think this is the Holy trilogy ? Because I grew up watching these films. Star Wars started it all; merchandising, soundtracks, comic books, etc... then Empire came aboard to kick all of out butts (Luke, I AM your father), and even though Jedi was somewhat corny, it still was great !!!
B0007TKH66|5.0|I've seen all the Star Trek shows from start to finish. After purchasing Star Trek Enterprise season 1, I have gained way more respect for this series. Most of the Star Trek shows ( TNG, DS9, and Voyager ) all started slow in the first couple of seasons, and didn't really become good until the 3 & 4th season, but enterprise is really quite good in the first season, \\"right off the bat\\".I had forgotten how good the first season really was, until I watched it over again with this boxed set. I think the fourth season has been great, and I am sorry that the show has been cancelled, it could have easily gone another season.<br /><br />The DVD set is the best one out of all the others in the Star Trek universe, done in 16X9 anamorphic 5.1 DD. So if you have a Hi_Def widescreen TV, the show looks exceptional for a TV show. I'm wondering how the DVD's will look once you get to the last season, when I believe the show started using Hi-Def cameras.
B0002V7OI8|3.0|This movie has it's moments, but it's not the best disaster film you could see. While the scenes when the comet finally hits is impressive, I feel the filmmakers took too long getting to the climax. much of the movie is just talk. And although the CGI effects in the 30 seconds of disaster scenes are impressive (espacially for a 90's movie) parts of the movie are pretty unrealistic and corny. I'm not saying this movie was bad, it's not. It's just that it could have been more exciting, like Armageddon. This is an OK film for a rainy day, but Titanic and Independence Day are much better films of this genre.

630469654X|1.0|I remembered watching this movie as a child, and had high hopes that it would be an enjoyable medieval adventure.  I was severely disappointed. <br />The soundtrack was truly terrible.  At the most inappropriate moments throughout the movie one would be beset by a cacophony of pounding 80s electronica.  So distracting and overwhelming was it that it was easy to lose tract of the movie. <br />The movie itself was appalling.  The characters were flat and unbelievable, and good actors did not manage to carry poor dialogue.  Oh dear.
0811826848|5.0|A friend of mine got me this book for Christmas in 2000. This was an addition to my Beatles memorabilia(I got the 3 double-disc Anthology CD's and the eight-volume VHS tapes between 1995 and 1997 respectively). This \\"coffee table\\" book was authored by all four Beatles Paul McCartney,Richard \\"Ringo Starr\\" Starkey,the late John Lennon and the late George Harrison(Harrison was alive when this book went to press and came to bookstores). All four Beatles give their own life histories through the 1970 disbanding. Lennon tells about the death of his mother Julia who was run over by an intoxicated off-duty policeman. Lennon wrote several odes to her,those being entitled JULIA,MOTHER and MY MUMMY'S DEAD. The latter two songs were Lennon's post-Beatles compositions both appearing on PLASTIC ONO BAND,released in late 1970. This book is a revision and update of the 1964 Capitol Records album THE BEATLES STORY. Many people over the years have written books about the Beatles legacy but this item is the ultimate one. Lennon and McCartney first met in 1957 when Lennon was 17 and McCartney was 15. McCartney brought a few buddies to see John's band called The Quarrymen. After the concert,John and Paul had a nice get-acquainted chat and became fast friends. Paul joined the Quarrymen and a short time later,he recruited Harrison. These Liverpool,England lads always loved American Rock 'n Roll. McCartney was 14 when his mother passed away. TBS did not say how she died. McCartney's dad was a cotton salesman. Harrison came up the Beatles' legendary \\"mop-top\\" hairstyle. He recalled in an interview that one day when he and the other Beatles were swimming,they emerged from the pool with their hair over their foreheads. They decided they liked it,and it has remained. Ringo joined the Beatles following the ousting of Pete Best. Best didn't seem to be doing a great drumming job,according to John,Paul and George. Naturally mournful-faced Ringo was previously drumming for Rory Storme & The Hurricanes. The oldest Beatle,three months Lennon's senior,was called Ringo because of his passion for wearing lots of rings(four on each hand). Illness forced Ringo to drop out of school as a child(he had been in and out a few times). Ringo sought employment at an engineering company before his drumming career. In 1958,18-year-old Ringo received his first drum kit that Christmas. He's still drumming today although he sings more often. Ringo always loved to sing during the Beatles' performances,but preferred to leave the vocal work to his three fellow Beatles. Pre-Beatles,Harrison had a short-lived job as an electrician. He quit because he \\"kept blowing everything up\\". Lennon,who came up with \\"Beatles\\",caused controversy in 1966,telling a concert audience that the band was \\"more popular than Jesus Christ\\". The outrageous comment led to a bonfire in Alabama. Fans placed their Beatles memorabilia into the fire. This also led to the band abandoning touring and spending their business time in the studio. Harrison developed in interest in Indian music and culture. You can hear Harrison playing the sitar on songs like NORWEGIAN WOOD(THIS BIRD HAS FLOWN) and WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU. While recording the LET IT BE album in January 1969,the band gave a free concert atop the Abbey Road Studios roof. You can see a clip of it in the 1988 Warner Bros. documentary IMAGINE-THE DEFINITIVE PORTRAIT OF JOHN LENNON. What led to the Beatles' break-up was managerial and musical differences between Lennon and McCartney(the pair remained friends though). All four Beatles were already married so I guess we can say another reason why they broke up was because so they could spend more time with their wives. Lennon was already into his second marriage to Tokyo-born Yoko Ono. Lennon's first marriage to Cynthia Powell ended in 1968. That marriage brought Lennon's rock star son Julian who is now aged 42. Since the disbanding of the Beatles,all four members have pursued successful solo careers. I dedicatethis item to the memories of Lennon,who was murdered in 1980 in New York City,where he last lived and Harrison,who succumbed to lung cancer in 2001.
B000002UE9|3.0|This is not brain surgery! They were looking for \\"nothing but a good time\\" and they wanted you to have fun with them. Once you go past the makeup and silly clothing, you get a party record. Is that not what rock n roll music was to be? You have two camps of rockers \\"I want a woman, so lets go party!\\" and \\"I want to change the world with my music.\\" We all know which one of these are Poison! I think it is time to bring back the original album cover guys.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Many Beatles fans who own the three double-disc Anthology CD's,and of course the original releases of their albums,own VHS or DVD copies of the official documentary of this rock 'n roll legendary band. Paul McCartney,Ringo Starr and George Harrison tell all their fans about how they made it big in their native Liverpool,the rest of England,America and other countries as well. When they came along,it was Goodbye,Elvis. Too bad John Lennon didn't live to tell stories also. Here is the life histories of all four Beatles. Well,until the band broke up. Many believe that Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and McCartney's first now-deceased wife Linda Eastman broke up the Beatles. George and Ringo were married men themselves at the time of the break-up. This is definitely a revision and update of the 1964 Capitol Records album THE BEATLES STORY. Ringo became the Beatles drummer after Pete Best was fired. Previously,Ringo was the drummer for Rory Storme and the Hurricanes. John,Paul and George performed together under several different names such as John & The Moondogs and Silver Beatles and then The Beatles. John told a story about how he and Paul met in the 1988 Warner Bros. documentary IMAGINE-THE DEFINITIVE PORTRAIT OF JOHN LENNON. The Beatles became teen idols just like their American Capitol Records labelmates The Beach Boys. Their fame and fortunes led to a short film career,making the films A HARD DAY'S NIGHT,HELP! and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. Controversy arose in 1966,when Lennon told an audience that the Beatles were \\"more popular than Jesus Christ\\". This outraged many fans,inspiring a bonfire in Alabama. Fans placed their Beatles memorabilia into the bonfire and saying things like \\"The Beatles are dull and ordinary.\\". Lennon later apologized for the outrageous comment. Lennon meant no harm in saying that. So the Beatles quit touring and spent all their business time in the studio,experimenting with new sounds. Harrison,joined forces with an Indian man named Ravi Shankar and studied the sitar. He developed an interest in Indian music and culture. Hey,he took an Indian woman to be his second wife. His first wife,Patti Boyd dumped him for his best friend Eric Clapton. Lennon married his college sweetheart Cynthia Powell and had a son,Julian now aged 42 and a rock star himself. In '68,John and Cynthia divorced and John romantically hooked up with Tokyo-born Yoko Ono(John and Yoko first met in '66 when Yoko was married to her second American husband). In '69,John and Yoko married several days after Paul and Linda Eastman tied the knot. Ringo married now-deceased Maureen Cox in '65. They were divorced long before Ringo married actress Barbara Bach in 1981. Ringo is an actor also,appearing in a few films over the years. The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein died of a drug overdose in 1967 and the band were negotiating on who will replace him. Paul McCartney suggested his father-in-law manage the group and the other three Beatles suggested Allen Klein. George Martin continued to produce the band's music through 1970 when the band broke up. Since the break-up all four Beatles have had successful solo careers. Paul formed Wings with Linda and some new people. John,who was murdered in 1980 at age 40 in New York City where he last lived,has formed a short-lived Plastic Ono Band,with Yoko of course. George co-founded the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne,Bob Dylan,Tom Petty and the late Roy Orbison. Ringo formed his All-Starr Band with various musicians joining and leaving. Harrison succumbed to lung cancer in 2001 at age 58. I dedicate this item to the memories of Lennon and Harrison. Lynne,formerly the frontman for the Electric Light Orchestra,produced the two most recent Beatles' songs,FREE AS A BIRD and REAL LOVE. Those songs were both 75% original,with Lennon's previously recorded vocal,circa 1977. Also,many Beatles fans own the literary \\"coffee table\\" counterpart,authored by all four Beatles.
0670033375|3.0|The first half of this book is very interesting and well worth the read.  It convincingly describes the collapse of several ancient, and not-so-ancient, societies.  I'm not sure why he provides an extended discussion of problems in Montana and how that relates to his central thesis of the book, but it is interesting.  I'm also concerned, as are some other reviewers, about the lack of discussion of societies that faded away rather than collapsed, like the Greeks and Romans.  The author attempts to apply principles from the collapses of these ancient societies to portend what the future holds for us, but it is not convincing. We live in a global society, and it's difficult to see how the collapse of these isolated societies is relevant to today. <br /> <br />The main problem I have with the book is that it focuses almost exclusively on physical and environmental limitations and almost completely neglects institutional constraints.  The corruption of third world governments and misguided policies of first world countries, it seems to me, are significant problems.  For example, one could argue that the primary problem is overpopulation, and that cheap, available birth control could rapidly reduce population growth, but policies espoused by the US are directly contradictory to that.  How can we hope to solve the most fundamental environmental problem when we can't even agree that it's a problem?  The author says that he is cautiously optimistic about the future, but that conclusion does not flow from the evidence presented.  He argues that population and economic growth place unsustainable demands on the resource base, but doesn't say how he expects these pressures to decline to a point at which they are sustainable.  I think he's optimistic because if his conclusions were drawn from the evidence he presents, he would be branded as just another alarmist, and the book would not be taken seriously. <br /> <br />The author paints a bleak picture of China, arguing that rapideconomic growth and rising incomes will cause the Chinese to place a huge strain on the world resource base.  It seems to me that the wealthier a country is, the more able they are to afford to protect habitat and resources, in which case rising income is a good thing.  True, economic growth will strain our ability to provide nonrenewable resources, but perhaps rising incomes will provide the ability to afford alternatives. <br /> <br />The author points to examples of sustainability from New Guinea, where the population has maintained itself for centuries.  Unfortunately, for advanced societies, that level of existence would be unacceptable.  From the author's perspective it seems impossible to achieve sustainability without a dramatic decline in living standards.  If it was a choice between mere subsistence and extinction nearly all would make the obvious choice, but we would never face such a choice, as change is incremental and there is a great deal of uncertainty.  It would be more convincing if the author identified a society in which the standard of living was at least close to that of the first world and which appeared to be sustainable, but no such place exists. <br /> <br />The author doesn't plot a course for the future, and rightly so.  His prescription would be so harsh that it would have no chance of being adopted.  After reading this book I feel trapped between hope that mankind will muddle along as we always have, and a resignation that it's only a matter of time.  One might argue that we will survive because we are smarter than those people in ancient societies that collapsed, but the author argues convincingly in his book \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\" that we are probably collectively less smart than people in those ancient societies (essentially because the gene pool is weaker now because a higher proportion of individuals live to adulthood and enter the gene pool).  So if we're not smarter and our institutions are unable to adapt, the only thing I canthink of that offers hope is technology. <br /> <br />The author downplays technology, and this is one area in which I strongly disagree.  Yes, it is costly to convert seawater into fresh water, but if we can discover a way to do so cheaply, we could expand cropland in some of the poorest areas of the world.  There are cleaner sources of energy that are too expensive to be commercially viable, but as petroleum-based energy sources become more scarce and expensive, these sources may become viable energy sources.  And although it seems like it would be a long way off, we may someday be able to mine nonrenewable resources on other planets. <br /> <br />Overall, the author provides an interesting, thought-provoking discussion of some very important problems.  The book caused me to spend a lot of time pondering these issues, and the more I pondered, the less comfortable I am drawing conclusions about our future based on the evidence of several collapsed societies.  But it does provide some general warnings that societies can, and do, collapse, and that it is not outside the realm of possibility that mankind could face a day of reckoning when environmental factors could cause cataclysmic changes in life as we know it.  I certainly hope it doesn't happen anytime soon. <br />  <br />
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Before you listen to this CD, I caution you to brace yourselves. The reason why is that, if you're of a certain age (say 22 or younger) you don't remember when rock'n'roll was anything other than earnest, angsty and, above all, angry. That's Kurt Cobain's fault -- fact is, he offed himself a decade ago, and we've been trapped underneath his fallen body since then. Don't believe me? Turn on your typical \\"modern rock\\" station and tell me what you hear.    If you think Rock'n'Roll is Serious Business that should be attended to by Serious Songwriters with Important Things to say, and Heavy Emotions to express, then you won't like this. Yes, it's dance music. Believe it or not, you used to be able to dance to rock'n'roll, even (perhaps especially) when rock'n'roll was made by people who were self-consciously artistic. And Kurt Cobain doomed us to a decade-long sentence of Karaoke Hip-Hop dominating the charts when he and his ilk (Eddie Vedder, Chris Cornell and the rest of the gravelly-voiced lumberjacks from the Pacific Northwest) led rock'n'rollers in surrendering the dancefloor without a fight.    Franz Ferdinand is a straight-forward, classicist post-punk/dance-punk act. That means they sound like a lot of bands -- Josef K, Gang of Four, etc. Thing is, in an age when our mass culture is scraping the bottom of the barrel for old things to remake, it should be obvious that there truly is *nothing* new under the sun. So why not remake something that was good in the first place, especially when that something (in the case of Josef K and Gang of Four) is something that was never even released stateside, or is nearly impossible to find in stores (or online.) I'd wager that Josef K's sound is still new to 99.9999% of people (or even of music nerds like myself.) Why not hear this, now, instead?    Anyway, as for the album, it's fantastic. The tracks are very similar, but that's because they are trying to sustain a few emotions rather than run the whole gamut of human experience in the course of forty minutes (most rock bands would do well to learn from this example,) and in that endeavor, they succeed mightily. Until the last track, where they slow down a little, this CD is pure kinetic, dance-punk energy -- no wasted space, no self-indulgent solos, just killer rhythms, laser-gun guitar and *self-consciously* campy lyrics. Above all, Franz Ferdinand play with a confidence that gives the whole CD a celebratory, triumphant feel that is truly exciting.    Make no mistake, there was a time when men with guitars ruled the dancefloor. Franz Ferdinand serve as prophets for the time in which they might rule again. It's everyone's choice as to where they want to be when that time comes: having some mindless fun, or sulking in their parents' basements. I know where I'll be.

B0006U4UAU|3.0|Usually I don't go for Techno-trance type music...and that's not exactly what LCD Soundsystem is.  Think of the best techno you've ever heard (okay, TRY to think of good techno) and marry it with some of the grooviest pop/rock you've ever heard. Then take that strange creature and shoot it in the dead.  Just before it dies, you'll have LCD Soundsystem.<br /><br />What we have here is something that came really close to being awesome, but got hung up on the usual genre foils.  \\"Daft Punk Is Playing At My House\\" opens the album with a scream (literally).  A funky beat propells the song and will propell you onto the dance floor (or where ever you are). This song blew me away, and is one of the reasons why I bought the record. You should buy it too, just for this song (come on...you love cow bells!). \\"Tribulations\\" and  \\"Give It Up\\" are two of the other great songs.  But perhaps the real crown jewel of this whole thing is \\"Never As Tired As When I'm Waking Up.\\"  Where to begin with this one...? Imagine The Beatles \\"I'm So Tired\\" from THE WHITE ALBUM merged with Moby (less Moby more Beatles).  This song will make you weep with joy, from the murky Pink Floyd sounding vocals to the primal scream release at the end. This song and \\"Daft Punk Is Playing At My House\\" are two of the best songs I've heard this year.<br /><br />Now, for the bad news. The rest of this album (the other 12 songs) are all relentlessly boring, too long (the main genre problem-techno music has always been too tedious for my taste), and amazingly uninspired.  Maybe all the Mojo was used up making \\"Daft Punk...\\" and \\"Never as Tired...\\"? This is really a shame, because I wanted to love this whole thing.  Should you avoid this album like the plague? No, if you like techno buy it now. If, like me, you aren't a big techno fan-here's what you should do: Go to iTUNES and download the above mentioned songs.  There are worse albums, to be sure.  The only fault I have with this one is that it's just not my cup of tea (overall).up of tea (overall). <br /> <br />
1401206905|5.0|When this miniseries first came out back in the eighties it left everyone breathless. David Mazzucchelli's art is some of the finest I've ever seen. It moves like a motion picture yet every still  is ready to be framed (nice homage to the famous Hopper painting on the side: Gorden and Sgt. Essen having a late night coffee in a cafe called ... Hopper) <br />Frank Miller tells a story right from the beginning of the Batman saga. Bruce Wayne and Lieutenant Gordon discover they are both fighting on the same side to clean Gotham from the human filth. The only way to survive in the mess is as a team. They become friends.   <br />On top of the fantastic graphic novel this book includes over 40 pages of sketches, layouts and script pages. Every Batman fan should have it, what do I say, this is one for you. Buy it. You won't be disappointed, I swear.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|I have suggested in this very forum that it is mystifying to me that people will fork over huge sums of hard earned money to see a middle aged rock \\"star\\" whose last relevant music was decades old (hello Mick Jagger, how ya doin' Rod Stewart?).  That sentiment certainly does not apply to Robert Plant.  He has never released a truly bad album and this one ranks with his best.  There is not a bum track on this disc, and \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" alone is worth the price of admission.   <br /> <br />While there are other 60's and 70's heroes of mine who have aged gracefully (see e.g. Van Morrison), only Neil Young comes to mind as being able to rock as convincingly thirty plus years into a career. Here's to another decade of great music from arguably the best rock and roll voice of them all.
B0002IVN9W|2.0|Besides a couple good songs, this much ballyhooed \\"critics darling\\" of a band's new album is nothing to write home about. <br /> <br />Annoying, smug, whiney vocals. <br /> <br />Obscure, abstract song titles. <br /> <br />Threadbare hooks. <br /> <br />Probably makes the Neutral Milk Hotel clones, the Decemberists, proud.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Desperate Housewives is one of the BEST shows I have seen.  Some people I have heard stamp the show as a Soap...well I cannot comprehend their reasoning because Desperate Housewives has MUCH more drama and humor and variety than the Soaps on the air now!  Desperate Housewives will never replace Sex and the City (which I also love) but it does have perfect timing. I have been needing a show like this.  I cannot wait till Season One is released, I will be the first to buy it when it reaches the shelf!

It's sad that radio stations are ignoring her as well. But so what, right?? <br /> <br />But, now she's doing music for herself. She doesn't need a zillion fans like Mariah and Beyonce or Britney, to feel important.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I was never much of a Green Day fan until I bought this album. Heck I'd never really even knew about them. I bought this album on a whim as much as any anything else. I hate how much the radio plays this album though. Radio ruins good music. This is not a radio album, you can't really get the meaning of the CD unless you listen to the whole thing. This will be an album that people will remember years from know, and it should have won the  Grammy for Best Album no offense to Ray Charles.
B0006GAI6O|4.0|SHALL WE DANCE? is a Hollywood fairy tale about ballroom dancing; what is portrayed here doesn't exist in the real world. In the everyday ballroom world, many dance studios are money traps for lonely women who take years of expensive lessons only to be able ultimately to follow their young, attractive dance instructors and nobody else on the dance floor. The studio system is a racket and is not realistically portrayed in SHALL WE DANCE? But this, after all, is a love story of sorts with a ballroom background and not a documentary, so all is forgiven. We ballroom dancers will enjoy this entertaining, sweet film about our activity if only because there are so few such offerings. Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez both give subdued performances as the angst-filled lawyer and the jilted Blackpool-level dancer, respectively. What motivates the middle-aged Gere character to go to the studio in the first place is never really clear. It could be a desire for romance or just a need to accomplish something new. But then why not sky diving or fly fishing? Susan Sarandon gives a competent performance as the spouse settled ridgedly into the suburban, upper-class housewife role with blinders on. The best scene for me was when JLo (an assistant teacher at the dance studio) was explaining and demonstrating the rumba to the Gere character: \\"It is a vertical expression of a horizontal wish...\\" That was one of the few scenes with any emotional intensity. My favorite characters were the stereotypical private detective and his Great Books-quoting black assistant hired to follow the lawyer. Light fare, SHALL WE DANCE? is a perfect flick for a first date or a date with your spouse, but it won't win any trophies at Blackpool.
B000000WJZ|4.0|A lot of people will tell you Mellon Collie is their best album, and some say Gish is better. Here is why I think Siamese Dream is better than the other albums: <br /> <br />Gish: Siamese Dream is more focused and easier to get into. The Smasing Pumpkins had a little bit of brushing up to do after this album. <br /> <br />Pisces Iscariot: Great Album but has some weak songs. Weaker than the weak songs on Dream: <br /> <br />Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness: A mixed bag as far as quality. On the one hand, there's Thrity-Three, 1979, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Stumbleline, and some others. But, there is also Jellybelly, We Only Come Out at Night,Tales of a scorched Earth and other ridiculous songs. <br /> <br />Adore: Weak overall, but has some good, very heartfelt songs. Forgettable though. <br /> <br />Machina: Meh. It just isn't that great. <br /> <br />Siamese Dream itself is an excellent album, with some of their most memoriable songs. It transistions between all out and mellow grunge rock, with Corgan's usual scratchy, whiny voice thrown in. This is probably the best example of the true band before their mid 90's shift.  <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah has outdone herself this time.  Whatever she did preparing for this album, she must do in her future albums.  'The Emanciptaion of Mimi' is probaly her best done vocally album to date.  She hits all the high notes, low notes and everything in between.  Album highlights include \\"Mine Again\\", \\"one and Only\\", \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" and so much more.  This album is one of the rare albums that you can actually listen all the way through with the exception of \\"Get Ya Number\\".  This is absolutely a must own album.
0743454537|4.0|I have never read a book by this author before.  I am usually found reading biographies or other nonfiction so in order for me to pick up a book such as this and be captivated since page one really says something about the author.   <br /> <br />I love the format of the book.  The author uses each chapter to skip from character to character and tells the story through their point of view.  This allowed me the ability to see the story from each persons point of view.  At the same time it also makes it very difficult to be 'one sided' in your choice of 'who's right and wrong' in this story.  This is a good thing in regards to the plot/topic as the question of legal, moral, religious, and ethical values can be so easily skewed depending on the source.  Here, the author grants you the ability to see the story through each persons eyes.  I cannot imagine this story being written through any other format. <br /> <br />I gave this book a four star rating as I have not hit the last chapter to date and have heard some debate over how effective the story ending was.  Dear reader, you will have to be the judge, (no pun intended) on the ending.
B000750OEA|5.0|Living in rural Oklahoma and having the musical taste that I do, I thank the powers that be almost everyday for the internet!  I absolutely love Europop, always have ever since I was a young boy. I never turn on the radio or MTV here in the states because I can't stand the TRASH they are playing. It all sounds the same, unoriginal, and just plain crap. Kylie's collection was a God send for me. I bought in in conjunction with the Ultimate Kylie cd. I own every offical Kylie cd and a few singles now thanks to the internet. This DVD collection is awesome. I made a copy for myself to preserve my original and I can play my copy anytime.  I also have her Greatest hits (87 to 97) cd and dvd and they are every bit as good. I became infatuated with Kylie ever since the release of her \\"Kylie\\" album in 1987 and still have the original cassette my mother bought me as well as my overly played \\"Locomotion\\" 12 inch single!  This collection (Ultimate Kylie)is right up there with Pet Shop Boy's \\"PopArt\\" Now I just wish Bananarama could do at least a dvd version of thier greatest hits video (that I can't find anymore) and something from Ace of Base other than thier \\"Sign\\" home video would be fantastic!  I'll keep my fingers crossed!
B00000I2UC|5.0|It is pretty funny to see this selling on Amazon for almost 20 bones. I vividly remember picking this and Disintegration by The Cure up used for about $5.50 each in probably 1991.<br /><br />For me, JAMC have always been a singles / album tracks band. I have never loved any of their releases from start to finish but this recording has incredible tracks in spades:<br /><br />Blues from a Gun, Between Planets, Head On, Halfway to Crazy. These are all perfectly constructed, riff-heavy, kickin' rockers that I cannot listen to without reaching for the volume knob. Fantastic
B0008ISM40|5.0|Very nice.    I'm not going to write a review. You can't review NIN. You have to experience it. Every release, every song. Every remix. Each one will grab new people while it loses others. I encourage everyone to grab this and experience it yourself. Nails fans who have followed through everything can appreciate this release. And for those who are just discovering NIN, welcome to the fold. You're in for quite the treat. Your new favorite word: HALOS. Get them all. I have. And, those who hunt and peck for a song here and there or can't get past the one release they first found, may not get it.     In fact, I'm not sure I get it. I just listen to it to saturate my brain with it. It haunts the mind, as all Nails do. I just know that I listened to it 40 times online before I bought it, then bought it from (...)pre-order, then had to go to NYC on the release date, so I bought ANOTHER copy just so I had it to rip to my iPod while there. I just ordered the Japanese version as well. I'm contemplating the vinyl. I listen to it 5 times daily, easily. The last CD I had that got that much rotation was The Fragile.     Yes, this is a much simpler CD to listen to than the darker Spiral or the epic masterpiece Fragile. Could be called 'poppy', if you had to limit it to a particular genre-esque classification. But NIN fans don't have to do that. We just smile quietly, put on the headphones, and ABSORB.    Thank you Trent. See you on tour.
B00000APLB|3.0|To preface this review:<br /><br />A. I am a self-professed Monster Stones Fan<br />B. I love all Stones era's (I do not believe the world stopped turning when Mick Taylor left the band)<br />C. I think Punk Rock was good for the Stones, it kicked them in the pants and helped to inspire Some Girls<br />D. I like Ron Wood (I even listen to his solo albums)<br />E. I do not have anything against Billy Preston in theory<br /><br />As far as obligatory mid-70's Double-Live albums go, this is not horrible and the band deserves some extra credit by trying to do something different, filling up side three with a club show blues set. Unfortunately there are serious problems. First however, the highlights:<br /><br />A. The Fanfare / Honky Tonk opening is cool<br />B. The If You Can't Rock me / Get Off My Cloud medley is a good idea<br />C. Happy and Starf@&#%*r rock out like nobody's business<br />D. Gotta give the band credit for doing the deep-funk Fingerprint File live (they ought to consider pulling this weird gem out of mothballs for the upcoming tour)<br />E. It's Only Rock and Roll, JJF, Sympathy, etc. are all fine<br /><br />Where most other reviewers seem to disagree with me is the blues set: I have always thought it was wretched. In theory, I think the idea of the Stones ridding themselves of all but a few key sidemen and getting down with some blues standards in a sweaty, smokey bar is a gift from God. My problem with this El Mocambo set is the execution. Why is it crap?<br /><br />A. Billy Preston's clavinet?<br />B. Mick Jagger's smarmy I'm a-Studio 54-jetset-superstar-playing-at-being-a-bluesman-while-drinking-champagne vocals?<br />C. Ronnie not yet integrated into the band well enough?<br />D. Keith phoning it in?<br /><br />I cannot put my finger on it but I am pretty sure A and B are strongly contributing factors. Although Billy Preston is a very capable keyboardist, I have never understood the prominence the Stones allowed him in their band during this period. If you listen to the bootlegs from this tour, they were letting him sing not one but two of his own songs, something which they have never let Ronnie (or Bill Wyman for that matter)do. If anything, these songs need Ian Stuart's barrelhouse piano, not the ingratiating crapola Billy Preston is playing here. Finally, I think Mick just sinks this these songs with execrable insincerity.<br /><br />So there.two of his own songs, something which they have never let Ronnie (or Bill Wyman for that matter)do.

031286504X|5.0|That's right, what was I doing when I could have been reading this book?  'I am Legend' is perhaps one of the finest reading experiences that I have encountered in some time.  I love horror, and I cannot believe that I missed this one for so long.  I would highly recomend 'I am Legend' to any fan of the genre, yet it goes beyond that.  The story, although taking place in the late 70's, was written in 1955.  The book holds up incredibly well in this day and age, and that is a true testament to the author Richard Matheson's genius.  I fully intend to read into the rest of his works.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Andrew Lloyd Weber must be spinning in his grave. Oh, wait. He's not dead. And he used his own money to produce the film version of his mega-hit musical \\"Phantom of The Opera\\"? What went wrong?<br /><br />The Opera Populaire enjoys a loyal, devoted public. Unfortunately, they are being held hostage at the hands of a tempremental, egotistical chanteuse by the name of Carlotta (Minnie Driver). Fed up with all of the headaches, the owner of the Opera sells it to Firmin and Andre (Ciaran Hands and Simon Callow), two junk merchants eager to become respectable, backed by Raoul (Patrick Wilson), a young, rich benefactor. They soon have to find a replacement for Carlotta, and Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson), suggests Christine (Emmy Rossum), a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Phantom (Gerard Butler). She does an outstanding job, much to the delight of the Phantom. But the Phantom's demands, Raoul's growing attraction and other factors soon begin to play out with disastrous consequences.<br /><br />Andrew Lloyd Weber's \\"Phantom of The Opera\\" has become one of the most successful musicals of all time. It has played around the world, for extended periods, proving that it touches a large segment of the population. A film would seem inevitable. When someone is so closely identified with a piece of work, it makes sense that they would want to oversee every aspect of the film, to make sure `they got it right'. Weber used his own money to produce the film, presumably so he could retain control of the project.<br /><br />I know many of the fans were hoping Michael Crawford, who originated the role on Broadway, would be cast in the film. I was never able to see Crawford in the role, and saw a much later version in London, with someone I don't even remember. The musical was still fun, mesmerizing and a spectacle to watch. The film is mesmerizing and a spectacle, but not always for the right reasons.<br /><br />Instead, the filmmakers chose Gerard Butler (\\"Dear Frankie\\"), a little known Scottish actor for the role. I have seen Butler in a few other films and can recognize that he is actually doing the singing. He does a very good job; his voice has a deep timber that works well with the music. Emmy Rossum is certainly a beautiful young woman and she creates a character who is certainly timid and awed by her first appearance in an opera. However, I didn't think her singing voice was that much different from Carlotta's. Carlotta's voice is supposed to be horrible, ear screeching and embarrassingly bad. Christine's voice is certainly more pretty, but the character is not above trying to reach those high operatic notes which can sound like nails on a chalkboard to many. The voices of the two characters are not different enough to set the characters apart. Her voice is also drowned out in some of the more active areas. If she is singing with almost anyone else, she is almost always drowned out. Patrick Wilson is also very handsome, but again, his voice is not very strong.<br /><br />The acting between the three leads is very close to that of a play. In a play or musical, you have to take certain leaps of faith because you are unable to have scenes which provide insight into a characters thoughts or feelings, unless they are acting or singing these same thoughts. In a film, there are tricks and methods to reveal these things. In the film of \\"Phantom\\", the filmmaker sticks pretty closely to a theatrical model. Therefore, we have to believe that Raoul and Christine are attracted to each other after remembering they grew up together. They fall in love after singing to each other. Normal dramatic devices are thrown out the window. I think if you can take this leap of faith, you might enjoy the relationship between Christine and Raoul. The relationship between Christine and the Phantom is similar. She is naturally drawn to him as a mentor. But the relationship also has some creepy overtones. At one point, he pretends to be her father. Hello, Mr. Freud? Earlier, he has finished singing a song to her, romancing her, and shows her a wedding dress he has had made for her. A tad creepy. And not creepy in the right way.<br /><br />What doesn't work as well is the relationship between the three characters, the love triangle. Christine's admiration and love seems to flip flop between the two characters depending on whoever is currently singing to her. Naturally, Raoul and the Phantom want to beat the crap out of each other. At one point, as Raoul is about to kill the Phantom, Christine yells out \\"No, not like this.\\" Well, why not? Because if he did kill the Phantom at that point, the story would end and they would liver happily ever after. But the filmmakers can't let that happen, they have about another hour of stuff they want to do, songs they want to sing.<br /><br />The song \\"Masquerade\\", which provides a key point in the stage production is a good example of what is wrong with the film version. \\"Phantom\\" is a lot more like the musicals the studios made in the 50s than it wants to be. With the recent releases of  \\"Moulin Rouge\\" and \\"Chicago\\", it tries to borrow a page from their success, but ends up creating a hodgepodge of a musical mess. \\"Moulin Rouge\\", which I loved and many hated, used a lot of rapid editing and pop culture songs to tell the story of a doomed relationship in early 20th Century Paris. \\"Chicago\\" slowed down the editing quite a bit and told a jazzier story. \\"Phantom\\"'s lyrics and style are more like a rock opera but it's sensibilities lie more with films like \\"Brigadoon\\" or \\"Meet Me In St. Louis\\". \\"Phantom\\" desperately wants to be hipper than that, which is why director Joel Schumacher frequently cuts away from the action to weird, out of focus, quick shots. \\"Masquerade\\" is a good song and could clearly stand on its own. However, it is an old-fashioned musical number. People dance down a large staircase in a highly choreographed manner. Schumacher cuts away from this action to brief, quick shots of other dancers, some of which are out of focus. It's hip. It's young. It's MTV.<br /><br />Schumacher is the other major problem with \\"Phantom\\". The attention to detail and production design for the film are fantastic. From the opening segment, shot in black and white and created to look like old newsreel footage, to the color sequences in the old opera house, the film is a sight to behold. The black and white segment takes place in the opera house, many years later, when it is in disrepair. As they relight the fabled chandelier, the opera house quickly dusts itself off and we see it in all its grandeur and glory. The scene is magnificent and quickly clues us in to the fact that a lot of money was spent to recreate these sets. As the film progresses, we realize that Schumacher is in love with the production design. No, not in love. He has developed an unhealthy infatuation. Someone should have filed for a restraining order to keep him 100 yards away. As we first follow some characters through the backstage area, Schumacher's camera pans up and down, back and forth, to show us the extent of the set. This is necessary and useful to show us that this world is \\"real\\". However, he does this exact same movement more than once through the same set. Each time we visit a new area, his camera lingers over every detail. Look at this production design folks. It's brilliant. We get it, Joel. It quickly becomes tiring, repetitive and only serves to draw us out of the action and the world they tried so hard to recreate.<br /><br />Because of all of the excessive shots lingering on various pieces of the set, my boredom in the central relationships and my irritation with some of the singing, I changed the audio on the DVD to the French language track and turned on the English subtitles. You know what? I actually enjoyed the film more. The French singing was a little more beautiful and didn't detract from my experience. But I hardly believe this is what the filmmakers want us to do. Toobad they didn't have different angles on the DVD for me to switch between.<br /><br />If you are a huge fan of the play, you will probably enjoy this film version. If you aren't, skip it.

If you aren't, skip it. There are far better musicals out there. <br />
0345457684|1.0|I read this book because my book club had selected it. What I found is a disturbingly dark story set in a nightmarish vision of the future. Yes, it has an interesting idea in the form of a human's \\"essence\\" being placed in multiple bodies (sleeves), so that death can be thwarted. And it's certainly fast-paced, something akin to a roller-coaster ride through various episodes. The notion of power & wealth as corrupting influences is broached. But none of these ideas is explored in a substantive fashion. And the characters are cartoon-character \\"types.\\" The paramount feature of this book is its descent into unremitting violence. There is so much killing that it's impossible to keep track of the body count....or to care. But it's the unending description of bodily mutiliation during countless torture sessions that is so wearying. Eyeballs plucked out of their sockets by pliers. A restrained female's feet being burned by blow-torch. A sodomized wolf emerging from a whorehouse chamber of beastiality so brutally crippled that it must be euthanized. Is this over the top, or what? I began to feel sorry for an author that must live inside a mind that produces such visions. It's bad enough merely to visit these thoughts. Bottom line: reading this book is like wallowing in a sewer. The images are scary enough; but what's really frightening is knowing that this book has found an appreciative audience!!
B000005JA8|5.0|'A squid eating dough in a polyethaline bag is fast and bulbous, got me?' <br /> <br />If I can think of one album that divides its listeners into the two extremes of love to utter hatred, it would be 'Trout Mask Replica.'  All I have to say is that this is a very listenable album, and I've listened to it straight through too many times to count.  I can play you music that would make Captain Beefheart sound like Britney Spears, such as John Zorn, Albert Ayler, late-Ornette Coleman, late-John Coltrane, Mike Patton, incarnations of Robert Fripp and King Crimson, and many more.  I think the main problems associated with the acceptance of this music and avant-garde music in general are intelligence and open-mindedness.  I'm sorry if I offend you, but if you went back in time and played the Beatles to Eurpoeans during the Renaissance, they would tell you it was crap.  The only reason why any new styles of music get discovered is open mindedness, as well as the intelligence and maturity of the listener.  Music doesn't have to sound the same all the time.  Sometimes the best musical channels to express the most honest feelings cannot be limited to the structural constraints of pop music.  All I have to say is that if you don't 'get' this album then you are guilty of closed-mindedness and emotional immaturity.   <br /> <br />Now that we have that out of the way, I want to cover several songs here - I promise not to do all of them! <br /> <br />'Frownland' - one of my favorites; I love the imagery of the line \\"my smile is stuck\\" as well as \\"I cannot go back to your land of gloom\\".  The Captain sounds like a drunk sailor!  It makes you really witness a place called Frownland.  The music is layered and if you focus on each individual instrument you will find repetition, much to the dismay of the nay-sayers. <br /> <br />'Dust Blows Forward and the Dust Blows Back' - you can hear the Captain recording this on a pocket recorder as he hits 'record' and then 'stop' in between ideas.  He is brilliant - a genius, if you will, who improvises poetry better than any rap artist of the 21st century.  This is also similar to the track 'Orange Claw Hammer,' as well as 'Well'. <br /> <br />'Dachau Blues' - is this a tribute to fallen Jews?  Either way, I love the catchiness of the chorus as well as the bass and percussive elements of the music. The Captain sounds like a church preacher, trying to make evil forces go away. <br /> <br />'Ella Guru' - I don't know...I think this song is too commercial for me.  Possibly the captain was trying to sell out.  It still has a really catchy chorus with great vocal harmonies.  Also, one of my favorite all time Captain lines is \\"She do what she mean; she do what she do; Got somethin' for me, got sumthin' for you; she show sumthin; she young too\\".  The Captain also has some communication with the ever mysterious 'Mascara Snake'.  \\"That's right the mascara snake, fast and bulbous, tight also!\\"  <br /> <br />'Moonlight on Vermont' is another favorite of mine.  The beginning sounds like The Birds or Jefferson Airplane.  10 seconds later that image leaves you as the captain enters like a psych-ward escapee! <br /> <br />The best track, without a doubt is 'Neon Meate Dream of a Octafish.'  The Captain sounds like he's having an argument with himself about the horrific realities of this octafish. \\"In jest, incest, injest, injust, in feast, incest, 'n specks, 'n spreckled, spreckled, speckled speculation.\\"  There's also another classic one-liner here with \\"Cavorts girdled in latters uh lite.\\" Absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br />'China Pig' is a decent blues song, going back to earlier material such as the SAFE AS MILK album, which is sterile and lacks the beauty of TROUTMASK.  However, 'China Pig' has a nice raw sound and fits in better on this album. <br /> <br />I've danced to \\"My Human Gets Me Blues\\" a few times.   <br />The 'Mascara Snake' makes another appearance on 'Pena.'  Who is this entity...this spirit?  <br />Other epic songs on this cd are 'The Blimp,' and 'Old Fart at Play.'  <br /> <br />In closing, I'd just like to say that if you don't own this, don't listen to the narrow-mindedness of the reviewers who put this masterpiece down.  You're not going to get super commercial crap...you'll actually get a refreshing dose of creativity and originality in music - an element missing from most popular music.  Also, if you like Troutmask, I also recommend 'Lick My Decals Off, Baby' - it's out of print, but if you find a copy for sale, buy it.  It's extremely rare, and very similar to 'Troutmask Replica.'
B000929AJQ|2.0|I honestly wasnt expecting much from \\"with teeth\\" after hearing rumors and specualation, and quite frankly what could you really follow up a masterpeice like \\"the fragile\\" with?  Well I didnt get much either.  This album has some serious flaws glaring on its slick surface.  The 3 and a half minute pop ditties on this record dont fit anywhere into the NIN we all know and love.  Honestly its like Trent died and they got some look alike to make another album unbeknownst to his fans. I see a trend coming,...that being a bunch of bad albums from this once shining light in music. NIN fans will defend this album to the hilt but of course thats there right.  If you like it for what it is fine but DO NOT expect anything approaching a masterpiece.  Maybe Its time for TR to hang up the black clothing and computers and call it a day...........
B000003489|5.0|Easily one of the best Trane cd's...and greatest jazz recordings of the 20th century.  At this point in his career, Trane was moving away from his 'sheets of sound' years where he would spend hours before a set, working out harmonies from the chord changes to come up with the 'perfect solo'.  With the help of working with Miles Davis on KIND OF BLUE, Trane was shown the light in using modes in his recordings.   <br /> <br />While 'Giant Steps' isn't as musically free as 'A Love Supreme' or 'Interstellar Space' it is still technically efficient as far as its place within a more structured jazz model.  My favorite tracks are the hard swinging 'Spiral' and 'Mr. P.C.', reminiscent of big-band Mingus recordings of the era.  Other highlights are the two most popular songs - 'Cousin Mary' and 'Naima,' the latter of which is a tribute to his first wife.  He also has another tribute to her after they split called 'Wise One' and can be found on the album CRESCENT.   <br /> <br />While any fan of good jazz would love this album, it's still a great introduction to those new to jazz.  I believe this album is much more accessible than KIND OF BLUE, as it is much more upbeat - you want to dance or snap your fingers to it.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|This is an amazing cast. I'm gald I got this movie. You can really feel the romantic chemistry with Christine, Raoul and of course the Phantom...You will find yourself intoxicated with love and sadness...Happy movie watching...
0385312083|5.0|I've been reading and re-reading this book once or twice annually for nearly thirty years. I just cannot get over the poignant, filthy, worn out world of hope and shame this guy creates. Vonnegut was there in Dresden during the bombings. He has seen things that no one should ever have to see and he sorted out in his mind a way to present chaos,loneliness,inhumanity, humanity, space critters, plane crashes, fire bombings, time, and life itself into a book. He finds a place to look out at the world and contemplete time and aging. \\"I'm an old fart who smokes too many Pall Malls.\\" and \\"My breath smelled like mustard gas and roses\\". To me these are heart wrenching lines in the context of the story. This is an anti-war book, just as it is a book trying to deal with the nature of mortality and time. It is also a book which attempts to deal with truth. The fire bombing of Dresden was an absolute military secret and until the mid-70's, the US government wouldn't admit that it had even happened. That this book was even released in the form of telling a story of Dresden is remarkable. But, as Vonnegut says, \\"I was there.\\" I love this book and I always will. Everytime I read it I am aware of a new feeling or a new idea the book has proposed in my mind. Brilliant stuff in a simple, yet complex; funny, yet deadly serious tour de force of a book.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This film has generated a notable divergence opinion: Sundance audiences laughed, but Ebert poo-pooed; my brother-in-law returned it 15 minutes in and rented something else, my sister and I laughed all the way through; some have longed for a time machine to get their 86 minutes back, others wanted one so they could go back and watch it for the first time again.  My theory is that the people who were popular in high school are the ones who hate it and those who weren't, love it.  It's often the popular kids' stories who get told, but this film is narrated from the perspective of Napoleon Dynamite, one of the truly original characters in the history of film.  The conventions of film narrative are secondary to characterization, but the film does not choose to portray the conflicted lives of the hotties, but the tortured lives of the high school B crowd: Napoleon and his friend, Pedro, and love interest, Deb, are all strangely peculiar but also representative of the communal ostracism suffered by the unpopular kids in almost any American High School.  The film starts with the hilarious image of the stoically individual Napoleon and just gets funnier and funnier as we get to see all the offbeat mannerisms that make him who he is: he curses the popular kids who taunt him with an exasperated, \\"Geez!,\\" he is blissfully unaware of the existence of fashion, he seems dimly aware that he is somehow the object of ridicule at the school, but does nothing to alter that perception.  As viewers, we are not laughing at his expense, but at his total lack of inhibition to express himself exactly as he is, not as who he thinks others would want to see.  This scares the popular kids and that's why some of them did not like this movie.
B00005JN0T|3.0|This was a cool movie, but the story lost my interest <br />after a half hour. I still enjoyed it though. Will Smith <br />did a good job in his leading role. I wouln't buy this  <br />movie, but I do want to see it again on cable, in HD!
B000002C1W|4.0|Momentary Lapse and Division Bell are both good albums. If you like Floyd, don't skip these. Pick three favorite track off both albums, throw in a few from About Face, and you've got yourself another PF masterpiece. <br /> <br />I listen to Yet Another Movie more than any other PF song. A great haunting Gilmour-style Floyd number. AMLOR is worth the price just for that song alone.
B000268QB2|5.0|Does anyone else hear Freddie?  I SO do!  Hmmm...I wanna hear him!  I want to believe he's singing here and I have a chance to hear some more of his music somehow.  I'm a sap.  But this is a very good CD- only gets better with time plus my voice goes well (in my mind of course) and it makes singing with him fun!
B000024ZLX|5.0|You must understand that the Final Cut is not like the previous PF albums - it's not supposed to be. This is the next level. This is Pink Floyd fully grown up. Roger Waters' exquisite composition brought so elegantly to life with the full talent of the London Symphony Orchestra. It is the possibly finest amalgamations of rock and classical music ever recorded.  <br /> <br />Rarely in history does an artist reach the peak of notoriety and then take the opportunity and money at his disposal to employ the world's greatest symphony orchestra for a rock composition. When it happens, it even less commonly works. The Final Cut is one of those rare occasions.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|Its possible that some of the viewers who were disappointed that the movie wasnt serious enough may have missed the point. You just cant compare it to movies such as When A Man Loves A Woman because 28 Days is a dramatic COMEDY. The director says so herself in the special features. But just because it partly fuctions as so doesnt mean its showing addiction as entertaining. The comedy was to show how sometimes humor can help people get through difficult situations. And it did this without making addiction seem lighthearted. There were numerous scenes in the movie that made it absolutely clear how destructive addiction can be on one's self and those around them, such as the scene where the children are telling their mother how much her using has hurt them. Not to mention portraying the desperation that could cause someone to jump out of a window, ruining a loved one's wedding, relapses, and overdose. A movie that touches on all of these certainly cant be called a fluffy film. But that it can do so and also make you laugh is something special. The only real complaint I can find is that the scenes between Sandra's character and the ball player were a bit contrived, underdeveloped, and didnt always totally connect. But other than that Bullock and the rest of the cast were quite charming in a film balanced well between seriousness and laughter.
B000002HMH|5.0|You people who hate this CD and call Metallica \\"pop\\" and \\"alternica\\", are nothing but tools.  You hate them because they changed, and the strict parameters of metal tell you what to listen to.  Holy crap people change?  No way...  They cut their hair.  Big deal, you ever have long hair?  It's annoying after awhile.  Anyways.  You \\"metalheads\\" are nothing but elitest.  You say metal has to be this and metal has to be that, otherwise it's not metal.  Guess what, metal used to be about doing something different and not giving a crap what other people thought.  Metallica did just that.  They were experimenting, and didn't care what you people thought, so what?  The CD certainly isn't fast, but it is damned heavy.  All the songs are great, and it wouldnt hurt to come out of your closed mind once in awhile. BTW best album = Puppets.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|i agree with many of these reviews but i take it one step further- i will never listen to train wreck ever again- only their other stuff- so why even 1 star?
B0000CDLA7|1.0|For Dream Theater- this is not very good- i never thought i'd give a band like DT a 1 1/2 stars- but im comparing this album to others that they have done- Awake is my favorite, followed by Images in words- then Scenes from a memory- falling is next- then 6 degrees- this is last on the list- hope their new one is prog- and not metal! Sorry DT!! I still love ya--
B00005UEAR|1.0|the 1st CD here is horrid- long overdrawn tracks- the 2nd CD is much more tasty- but for 22 bucks?!?!?!?! no- 2nd worst DY behind TRAIN WRECK- pick up awake or images and words- 5 star albums there- oh yeah-- or scenes- great prog- not this
B0007P3582|1.0|It strikes me as odd that the weakest artists seem to get the most attention. <br /> <br />Take J-Lo, for example. You have to admit that J-Lo does not have vocal talent, or songwriting abilities (that's why she doesn't write her own songs). Yet she is achieving big success with her second rate singles and albums. <br /> <br />Now take 50 Cent. While I do enjoy some rap artists, (Outkast and some Eminem come to mind while typing) I feel that when you are rapping, you should have a style of speaking, not just mumbling, what 50 Cent does in all of his songs. <br /> <br />The lyrics are also very weak. Disagree with me? Look up The Beatles, Coldplay, Kate Bush, anybody with talent - look up the lyrics, and compare them to 50 Cent's (obviously there's bad language). See the difference? <br /> <br />Rap can succeed with excellent beats. However, 50 Cent's beats are rather dull and unexciting, playing over and over again. <br /> <br />As a whole, this is a very poor album which was not enjoyable to listen to. <br /> <br />0/10 - Terrible
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I've seen this movie a zillion times, the last viewing really hit me hard. There was more tallent in this that I could not capture at first. On the note of viewing it in my \\"simple mind\\", I had a chance to see a cast that reigns supreme.... a great production...with lines that are so HS and true, if you believe in yourself and know who you are! <br /> <br />Judd had to have had a mere experience with this. He is amazing and very believable. I knew guys and girls just like the BC ones...I dated a few zoon dweebies, sorta had sex with the jocks, laughed at the weirdos with my cheerleader friends and still managed to marry a guy who's an amalgom of all of them/ <br /> <br />mostly he's a bad boy with a great heart............... <br /> <br />Breakfast anyone??????????????// <br /> <br />brakin
B0000508U6|5.0|I love Coldplay for their amazing originality and their great songwriting. I think that Chris Martin's vocals are fantastic. <br /> <br />I have known and liked Coldplay for a very long time now, but have never really listened to an album of theirs. <br /> <br />So one day, I tried listening to it and found myself very disappointed. I felt that most of the tracks were mediocre fillers. <br /> <br />The next day, I decided to play it again and actually LISTEN to the music. So I did. And I LOVED it. <br /> <br />Now, this is an album that I play frequently. My personal favourites are 'High Speed' and 'Sparks'. Look out for a secret track. If you want to find it yourself, find it yourself. I'll put the way to find it under my rating out of ten. <br /> <br />10/10 - One Of My Favourite Albums <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />- Way To Find The Secret Track: It is after the song 'Everything's Not Lost'. You have to wait for about forty seconds (thinking hard now) after the end of the song. It is on the same track. It's small yet sweet and has wonderful music. -
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot is destined for classic status.  The entire album is absolute genius.
B000002U9E|5.0|I really enjoy this album. It's actually my Dad's, but I think of it as a shared CD now, since I play it so much.  <br /> <br />Anyways, my Dad loves Kate Bush and has raved about this album for as long as I can remember. So, one day, as I was on the computer, I decided to play it. I'd heard it all before, but never really paid attention. <br /> <br />The album is fantastic and one of my favourite albums ever. Kate Bush has a great voice and every song is worth listening to. It's very original. <br /> <br />10/10 - A Timeless Classic <br /> <br />
068987474X|4.0|i really enjoyed this book. i got a good laugh but it just wasnt exactly what i am looking for. i my only be 15 years old but alot of this stuff was common sense. i loved how it told everything truthfully and bluntly! it explained a couple things for me but overall didnt help me too much. and if it wasnt very helpful to me i doubt it will be THAT helpful to grown women!!! i mean COME ON!! lol but overall a good read for some amusment and just to clear a little up, i think that Greg is an awesome writer!!
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo & Stitch is a lovely Disney animation about a lonely, imaginative girl named Lilo who lives with her sister, Nani, in Hawaii. Nani allows her to adopt a dog.. not knowing that the dog is actually an alien, who is labelled an international source of chaos and is being chased! <br /> <br />Lilo finds her first real friend, and has a lot of fun adventures with Stitch, while two aliens go on a search for Stitch. Lilo doesn't know, until the secret gets out.. <br /> <br />This was a highly entertaining Disney movie, with a good soundtrack (Elvis had some great songs). <br /> <br />9/10 - A Charming Disney Movie
B000669GAI|4.0|This band had so much promise in the early 90's and have fallen off over the years. The first few cd's were frikin' great and then it started to slip in my honest opinion.<br /><br />This greatest hits compilation is what it claims to be and really nothing more. The radio friendly tunes are here and a few other gems, but it's really nothing earth shattering. It's basically straight ahead Rock & Roll done Pearl Jam style. Eddy Vedder has a unique vocal delivery and the guitars are present although a little unimaginative at times. The rhythm section of Jeff Ament and Matt Cameron is top notch. These two guys can lay down a very good groove. Overall it's pretty good stuff even though it does tend to sound the same after a while. Nonetheless it's a good cd from one of the better grunge bands to come out of the early 90's.<br /><br />The packaging could be better. The jacket really doesn't give you any details about who these guys are or what their about. Considering that this Best Of offering will probably be picked up by casual fans, you'd think they'd advertise a little more? It also would have been nice if we could actually read the track listings on the back of the jacket, but hey, who does that right?<br /><br />All in all a good cd that rocks from start to finish.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This is one of my favourite Christmas movies. <br /> <br />It's all about a Father, who wants his family to have the perfect family Christmas - but like everybody, he's not perfect.. and he causes some major problems. <br /> <br />It has all you need in a good Seasonal film. Humour, morals (come on, the ending had something) and the ability to make you really excited about Christmas, especially if it's close. <br /> <br />I only saw it for the first time last year - but I watch it quite a lot. It's one of those films which are addictive. You watch it once and you watch it again and again and again. <br /> <br />It's a real Christmas classic for me. <br /> <br />Just a warning though: It's not your average Christmas film. There's some rude words and suggestions in it. Thing is though, I think it's been edited for the UK.. because something that has been described in the movie wasn't on my DVD. <br /> <br />10/10 - Great Seasonal Comedy
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I hardly need to add my voice to the thousand-plus already here, but I wanted to encourage anyone who stumbles across this DVD series to just buy it.  You will not be disappointed.  You will find yourself watching them more than once.  This series will not gather dust on your DVD shelf. <br /> <br />The characters are unique, interesting, diverse and wonderful.  The acting is top notch - it really feels \\"real\\". <br /> <br />I can only hope that somehow this series will be picked up again, and it seems to me (in light of the recent Family Guy story) that the best way to help ensure this possibility is to buy many copies of the DVD.
B00005JMJG|5.0|For once, a romantic movie with DEPTH!    And that's just not in the amazing plot. In this movie, you can actually feel for the characters, feel that they really, in the end, don't want to lose their partners.    The plotline: after learning that his girlfriend has removed him from her mind literally, by going to a centre where they perform an unusual operation, he does the same thing.. and only while this is taking place, does he have second thoughts.    The plot was fascinating. The idea of 'hiding in a thought that they don't know about until tomorrow' was a great one, even if it didn't work out for them.    There were some moments where it was confusing to understand exactly what was going on - but some brilliant movies aren't understandable straight away.    This review has been edited. It was not straightforward, and did not have enough information about the actual movie to be considered a real review.    10/10 - Deserves All Of The Positive Reviews It Gets
0345457684|4.0|This book is a great read. Though the setting is a future highly advanced from our present, it remains identifiable with the cultural and political ideals, or lack thereof, of today. It is a completely different world that the characters inhabit, yet not so foreign that it is beyond understanding. The book is also not without humor, which is something I always enjoy in a novel. The novel also portrays an entire reality, as it is, the good and the bad, with a whole lot of the bad, so if you don't like books that get a little raunchy at times, then this probably isn't the book for you. The only thing I had some trouble with was the description where technology is concerned. I am fairly unknowledgable when it comes to certain technologies, so there were parts when the descriptions were beyond me, but not to an extent that it damaged the enjoyment of my reading. Overall Altered Carbon is a great book that I enjoyed immensely, enough so that I'm currently reading the sequel Broken Angels.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I'd be a liar if I said that I didn't enjoy this movie. Quite frankly, the opposite. I felt that it was well-made and quite funny at times. <br /> <br />However.. <br /> <br />In my opinion, it's not the masterpiece that everybody's making it out to be. It's simpliness, and the fact that it doesn't have to be a spectacular, high-budget, adventure movie is brilliant - and a real change from the usual movies at the moment. But there was something missing, something missing that would make this a GREAT movie..  <br /> <br />And in the end, I was left unsatisfied. <br /> <br />7/10 - Enjoyable, Yet Overrated <br />
B000929AJQ|1.0|I am one of the very few honest people who is NOT afraid to tell it like it is.  Pretty Hate Machine was great, Broken was amazing, the Downward Spiral was amazing, the Fragile was decent, and this album is terrible.  Going through each track, I found myself hopelessly tuning out due to sheer boredom.  Most of the tracks are slow to mid tempo and sound like a 400 pound fat man trying to walk through quick sand.  It really falls short.  Melodies?  Some people think it has a ton of great ones, but personally I think that A-ha has them beat, and a million other bands.  I wouldn't be as harsh, but after 6 goddamn years of not releasing anything for NIN, I feel entitled to bitch and am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO glad I didn't kill myself buying tickets to the sold out shows.  For everyone else, your a sucker.
B00009XITP|5.0|Among the current crop of female child actresses already or about to turn into hot properties for their impressive talent and major sex symbols for their knock-out looks is Amanda Bynes.  Its an impressive class that includes the names Keira Knightley, Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff and Kristen Bell. But Bynes is one actress who has already reached television stardom through her shows \\"The Amanda Show\\" and \\"What I Like About You\\" and at the age of 16 she traveled to Europe to appear in a movie appropriately titled \\"American Girl.\\"<br /><br />Before it was released (in early 2003) its title had been changed to \\"What a Girl Wants\\" and I sat there in a movie theater knowing little about it. I knew it had been filmed in my home country and starred Colin Firth who had been so good in \\"Bridget Jones' Diary,\\" I came away impressed by the comic timing and the looks of an actress that would obviously in years-to-come set movie screens on fire.<br /><br />\\"What a Girl Wants\\" is at its heart a story about a girl searching to find herself. Bynes plays Daphne Reynolds and her mother Libby is played by Mrs. John Travolta (Kelly Preston). The two live in New York City and Daphne spends her time helping out at weddings where her mother is a singer and longing to know a father she has never met. It is observing the father-daughter dance at one of these weddings (where the filmakers used real fathers and daughters) that our hearts go out to Daphne and she determines a drastic plan of action - traveling to London and confronting her absent father.<br /><br />The movie has it all - heart, laughter, suspense, romance. Its culture clash theme has been done before and better (Crocodile Dundee for example) but we have so much emotion invested in Daphne's plight that we cannot help but become engrossed in this movie.<br /><br />Jonathon Pryce proves that his villainous turn in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" was no fluke by pulling out a great performance here as the political advisor of Daphne's father (Firth). Thing is, Firth's character -Henry - is running for political office and Pryce sees Daphne as a liability to his boss' career and her presence an obstacle to his becoming father-in-law to the wealthy and politically powerful Henry.<br /><br />This DVD has an impressive number of special features, the crown jewels of which are the two scene specific audio commentaries, one by Bynes and the second by the director and two writers.<br /><br />I Liked how the subtitles automatically come up when commentaries are playing. If you have only seen it once it helps keep track of where you are in movie.<br /><br />Light, fluffy, exuberant Amanda Bynes chats about working with the other actors, and how intimidated she was by some of the people she worked with. In her commentary she mentions how the weather was when a scene was shot - it was hot, hunid, raining etc<br /><br />Obviously Bynes has a great deal of respect for Firth and Preston and  almost inevitably Bynes spends a lot of time talking about clothes - big boots when hopping over the wall, commenting on how ugly the dress to a ball is etc. Bynes literally coos over emotional moments.<br /><br />Hers is a fun commentary, but there are some gaps. I liked the recounting of anecdotal moments such as her account of being mobbed by fans on bridge that crew could not get permission to close for shooting.<br /><br />On the second commentary director Dennie Gordon joined by the two writers Jenny Bicks and Elizabeth Chandler (the Amazon listing is incorrect in identifying them as actors). As one might expect this is more technical in details and as such serves as a nice contrast to Bynes solo track. The writers discuss such matters as how long they worked on it, the original inspiration and discuss different titles (the original title \\"American Girl\\" is mentioned on both tracks). The director talks about how wonderful the actors are and seems particularly pleased with Bynes performance.<br /><br />Overall this is a veryenjoyable family film and a great DVD package.
B000059XUO|5.0|One of the most cult movies. Dramatic story, dramatic life of Brandon Lee in central role. Deep conventionalized video record.<br /><br />Brandon Lee - we remember you.
B00004RJSA|5.0|This is one of the most wonderful Brandenburg sets I ever have listened to (Including Tafelmusik, Goodman, Chamber orchestra of europe, Orch age enlightment, Hogwood, Leppard (best of traditional versions, superb), Richter). It has great freshness, dinamic pulse and spontaneus vitality. And those virtues are consistently maintained along the whole set. Of course not always everything sounds like what one would like (for when you listen several versions, you begin to draw an \\"ideal version\\") because interpreters will not have the same oppinion that you, eg the last movement of the 6th (I would have liked a more \\"demonic\\" or \\"maniac\\" pulse, but it's fine as it is), or the not ideal \\"hooty\\" oboe sound in the 1st concerto.  <br />You have strenght and vigour: look at the beggining of N 1 or to the whole 3, among incountables exemples. You have transparency of textures (in the 5th is the first time I can hear what Bach wrote for the ripieno strings). You have intense speeds (The 4th Presto is real presto) without being breathless (like Goebel's set). You have also delicacy (the minuets in the 1st (first time it is made with real grace instead of the usual strenght, at odds with this courtly dance). And spontaneity (the recorder parts,the imaginative solution  to the misterious slow mov of the 3rd, or the cadenza of 1st mov of the 5th, which is felt like an \\"improvised\\" fashion, with parts prestissimo and sudden stops, very different from the usual \\"sewing machine\\", uniform speeds of actual harpsichordists). And a lot of attention to instrumental textures, essential thing in ancient instruments (look at the horns in the first, the trumpet in the second, the strings in general).  <br />To sum up, very, very vital. Not ideal -who can does it?- but better, better than the Brittishs. It has a real, extroverted  personality. To listen to again and again, a lasting source of seduction.
B000268QB2|5.0|Amazon.com erroneously lists 10 tracks instead of 11 (Track 10, Untitled 1, for some reason is not listed). Incidentally, Untitled 1 is also one of my favorite songs on the album. I highly recommend \\"Hopes and Fears\\"- it is easily one of the best albums of 2004 , if not the #1 album.
B000777J2S|4.0|This cd is unlike any I've ever heard. I would recommend you buy it based on that alone. The songs are so touching and genuine that you can't help but feel moved. You must hear it. If nothing else listen to the sound bites.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I am 33 year old mother of 3 young children.  I absolutely loved this movie.  It took me back to my high-school days and had me cheering for the class under-dogs.  It was a very simple yet very clever and unique story line.  I especially enjoyed the clean humor.  My 4 year-old son even loved it.  This movie is going to be a classic.  I wish there were more movies like this.  Teen-agers may think this movie is stupid and pointless, but Generation-Xers will cheer all the way home!!!  Finally, a movie made for teens with heart and a lesson.
0446677450|5.0|RDPD demands of you. It grips you and challenges your status quo regarding studies, careers, all financial thinking. Most people will read it and say great book, excellent book, put it down and do nothing afterwards. If you're yearning for change and you want to become a millionaire, then this is one way to get you there. If you don't already have some insatiable desire to become a millionaire, this book will not give that desire to you - it has to be there, ready to explode from within using RDPD principles. If you are quite content with the corporate life and do not wish to become your own boss, you'll appreciate the book but from a merely `Good book' mindset. Why Buy: To become a millionaire. As a gift for an entrepreneurial minded friend. As a unisex gift you keep for the day you forgot to buy someone a gift for an occasion you should not have forgotten.

B0007TKNL0|2.0|This movie wasnt a total failure, but was by no means a success.  Whether the phantom was a little better looking than he should of been is not my gripe.  My gripe is that he was supposed to have the most amazing voice ever.  He's the key person that is supposed to out sing every one in the story.  But he's the one that sucks.  I mean, I know I can sing so I dont open my mouth.  Why oh why did they cast this guy.  I read a review about there being 11 other people that have played the phantom.  Hell, why didnt they just take those voices or something.  I mean, he REALLY doesnt do the role justice.  I would of been happier if even Raoul sang the phantom.   <br /> <br />The movie still did give you some of the feeling you get at the theater in that when that chandelear goes up, you are all psyched!  :)
B000929AJQ|5.0|This album is perfectly in its time, perfectly of our time, a beautiful and sad portrait of us, all of us, right now. The final track could be a commentary upon the rest of the album, especially for those who keep complaining that this album isn't \\"The Fragile\\". There are layers of meaning present here previously unheard of in the entirety of the rest of the man's ouevre -- Every other time he's opened his mouth, he's said: \\"I hurt. Right here.\\" But now, rather than complain of a pain, the man is simply exhibiting symptoms of variously general and specific malaise. It's good. It's very very good. <br /> <br />He's done it like this before... But now, but oh! But he's gotten so much better. Seeing that Trent can still do it like this, do it simple, but do it so much better now, re-steels my faith in his vision and bolsters my resolve to walk with him through any number of years of aimless wandering. So long as he pops up now and then and rocks, I'll forgive him any missteps, and trust his judgement when I don't know exactly where he's going. People say he's experimenting here, but I'm more of a mind that he's just doing it straight. Showing himself to be one of the true masters and monsters. He and a very few others built the musical world many of us live in, and periodically the new immigrants need to be reminded of the old kings, else these kids with no sense of history, well, they're just gonna repeat it aren't they? But whatever else happens now, Trent's got this thing handled...
B0007WF1WI|5.0|I just recieved this (Dual Disk) CD last week! I am from Australia so you can't purchase it here in Aus, so I had to buy it online here. It only took 10 days to arrive! I absolutely love the 'In The Zone' Dual Disk CD!! It has all her hit singles, 'Me Against The Music','Outrageous' and the Smash Hits 'Toxic' and 'Everytime!' It's seriously Britney's best Album she has ever made and I Love the DVD! The DVD features the incredable 'Megamix','Toxic' and 'Everytime' Videos! The album is also digitally enhanced so it's well worth your money! If you's haven't yet got 'In The Zone' CD yet YOU MUST BUY THE DUAL DISK, IT'S A MUST HAVE!!! It's at Britney's Best!!!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I am a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies, books, games, soundtracks, etc. This is an awesome score, however it is actually the weakest of all three.  <br />Howard almost loses the chanting choir, which gave the first two such depth and horror.  <br />This soundtrack relies much more heavily on the orchestra, and the young soloists. <br />It is still a beautiful soundtrack, but I missed the chanting/brass/drums effect.
0736041850|5.0|This book is an excellent resource for intermediate level bodybuilders.  It contains gorgeous drawings of hundreds of exercies and variants for all muscle groups.  Accompanying text explains how to do each one and what muscle groups or parts of muscles are emphasized.  It's very useful if you need to learn how to diversify your workouts. <br /> <br />The book is very focused (thankfully).  It contains nothing about how to put together a good workout schedule, so it is not a good first resource for beginners.  It also does not cover preparing for competitions, nutrition, or anything like that.
B000002UAU|5.0|I love this album.It is one of the Beatles best.The songs sre amizing!From the classic \\"Sgt.Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, to \\"A Day In The Life\\" not one bad song.The reason I like the Beatles is because they were always a little different.A great example is featured on this album.It is on the track \\"Within you and Without you\\" George plays his sitar, which gives the song a cool feel.The rest of the songs are good to.This is great album for Beatles fans!
B00025ETIW|5.0|I first heard of MCR on the radio with I'm not ok (I promise). I absolutly love that song!! Then came on Helena wich i love too. So I decide to buy the CD. First listening...not sure if i liked it or not. Since english isn't my first language and that what Gerard says isn't alway clear the first time, i read the lyrics. Lyrics are pretty damn cool even know this is not usually my type. After few more time listening, I'm completly sold to MCR!!! Pretty good CD to listen to while driving (Watch your speed!!!).<br />Pretty much every songs are great, but I think Interlude break the beat of the CD, it is not my favorite and if it wasn't there I wouldn't miss it! I have to say that my favorite is probably Thank you for the venom, with Helena and The Ghost of you pretty close.
B000008COG|3.0|This is an ok album.See,ths is one of those albums that you don't hear much about.The songs are good,not great.The best song is Heatseaker.This Means War is good too.Now there is no bad AC/DC album ,so just because it is underated,it still makes a good addition to any AC/DC colection. <br />
B00005JMXX|4.0|Maybe I'm just a sucker for Dennis Quaid's smile (shrug)....but I actually liked this DVD. I'd heard over and over what a dud it was from my co-workers, but, since I'm not apt to make my choices based on movie reviewers, I gave it a go. The dialogue wasn't bad....the special effects were fine, and the story line interesting. Gave me stuff to think about even though I might not buy the premise wholesale. All in all....a good movie ride.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This is without a doubt,Slipknot's best album.It has all the ingreadents of a good metal album.The great thing about this album is that it has plenty of good,loud metal songs(ie:Pulse of The Maggots,Duality,and The NaMeLess)but it also features some great acoustic songs(ie.Vermilon PT. 2,and Circle.)which sound just as good as the hard stuff!The best song has to be a tie between The NaMeLess and Pulse of The Maggots.If you buy one Slipknot album,make it this one.
B0007TKH66|5.0|If you liked Captain Picard, you will love Scott Bakula (Captain Archer). He is not afraid of taking the tuff decisions. Can't wait to buy Seasson 3 (when aliens tried to destroy the Earth and Captain Archer goes through the entire season trying to stop them). If you haven't watch Enterprise at all, believe me... the stories are much compelling than previous Star Trek and you won't be able to stop watching episode after episode.
B000000OQF|5.0|This has to be the best GNR album.This is the album for any and all fans of GNR.This album contains the classics \\"Welcome to The Jungle, and \\"Sweet Child of Mine\\",to of the Gun's best songs.I coudn't find anything wrong with it.It is the one album any fan of rock music MUST HAVE!!
0312330529|5.0|My sister brought this book and raved and raved about it,and said that I just HAD to read it.Well,I brought it,and it took me 3-4 weeks to plough through its' 933 pages. <br /> WOW!!!,what a ride,what a journey,a thoroughly engrossing epic.I couldn't put it down,and, like everybody else, didn't want it to end. <br /> A tale of love,strength,endurance,betrayal,and an unbending will to survive.From living as the local Doctor in the slums,to sheer terror high in the hills in Afghanistan,from gut wrenching torture in a Bombay prison,to daily life on the edge as a gun runner,drug traffiker,and passport forger for the local mafia,Gregory David Roberts endures all.And does so with a gentle wit and humour,not to mention an alertness,integrity,and self truth. <br />  All of which allow him to \\"come through the other side\\" to be where he is today. <br /> It doesn't what is put before him,whatever crisis it is ,it is just simply dealt with in the moment,finding resources within himself that I think most of us never even think about,let alone discover. <br /> The characters are unforgettable,from the hilarious Prabaker and Didier(whose Leopold's reminds me of a former local South American night club/Restaraunt/Bar here in Auckland, New Zealand),to the cowboy styled Vikram,and the courageous,admirable Lisa Carter. <br /> If I do have a gripe about this book,it  is   possibly too long,Roberts'  writing style somewhat  ponderous,going on,and on at length about one characters lips or her raven hair.I have to admit I skimmed over a lot of what was written,as it seemed irrelevant,and unneccessary. <br /> But nevermind,this is a thoroughly engrossing ,rivetting book from which a lot can be learned,and is a hard act to follow.I highly recommend it. <br /> What on earth do I read now?!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Karl Rothko, <br /> Auckland, <br /> New Zealand. <br />
B000069AUI|3.0|I ask myself this question because if I hate something I want to hate it all the way. It's kind of like that Bugs Bunny cartoon where it's done in opera style, and Elmer Fudd is trying to kill Bugs with thunder,lightning,fire,earthquake,wind, and SMOG!!!!!!!!!!! I felt like doing that after hearing \\"Clocks\\" for the first time. I remember it was 2 weeks before my wife passed away, and I'm in a Walmart getting a haircut. I honestly thought it was the Dave Matthews Band, and I'm like \\"No wonder I hate them.\\" However, it was filed away as a distant memory like Norah Jones' \\"Don't Know Why?\\" as the last time I really enjoyed hearing old Norah was when I was returning from vacation, and heard it in an Days Inn parking lot right on the Tennessee/Georgia border(Georgia side), but since my wife's passing \\"Don't Know Why?\\" doesn't have the same appeal to me anymore, but with \\"Clocks\\" not only does it \\"NOT\\" appeal to me, but it makes me miss my wife all the more. It makes me feel like I'm the only one left on earth, and all my surroundings are desolate wasteland. It's enough to make me want to blow out my brains. However, as I believe in interracial dating, and trying to understand more than just the surface of people I had to sample the rest of this album. I will say that Dave Matthews has a gripping influence on the lead singer, and so does Procul Harum , and Pink Floyd. There are some cuts on here that I kind of like. There's some interesting arrangements, but now comes the question can I overcome my intense hatred of \\"Clocks\\", and put an end to my prejudice of Coldplay? I took a very important step tonight, but the rest will take time. I can say that it's not as bad as originally thought though.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I had no experience or knowledge of the story of The Phantom of the Opera other than a CD of the Broadway production I inherited from my mother's estate, given to her by one of her Vancouver grandchildren who must have enjoyed the travelling version. Obviously it didn't impress me all that much since it disappeared in some garage sale or other. Forgive me, oh please forgive me!... <br />Having seen the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera, I am a phan forever...my main criteria when watching a movie is how often I look at my watch...I didn't once; I was too busy worrying about how my fifteen year old son whom I'd forced to accompany me was taking in the experience...he was definately hooked for most of the show...that should be a review in itself...at the same time, I found that I was totally absorbed by the music and settings of the movie...hadn't a clue who Emmy Rossum or Gerard Butler or Patrick Wilson were...of course I recognized Simon Callow and Miranda Richardson...but they weren't the point...and they didn't intrude into the increasingly involved plot between Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) <br />and the Phantom (Gerard Butler)and Raoul (Patrick Wilson)... <br />it's really a potboiler, cheap romance of a plot...so you have to get your thrills out of how it's presented; do you remember that high-school musical that the guy/girl you had a crush on had the lead in? That's the kind of vibes I felt coming out of the audience for the characters...which was amazing since this was a movie. So beyond the romance, the obvious physical romance between the Phantom and Christine, there is lots of glitter and glorious escapism and stuff that will make you glad you went to see the movie. It's absolute eye-candy and if you are a fan of wonderfully overwrought melancholy music that tends towards schmaltzy...you have found home.   <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Troy feels like the writing & dialogue wasn't running at full capacity, despite the abundance of resources. The end result is a loose interpretation of The Iliad, spoken in a wee bit too casual English. But Troy isn't afraid to show off its humongous budget to the viewer, and indeed it is an impressive sight. The visuals are stunning, the battle sequences are exciting, and the movie does seem shorter than its actual running time. For escapism, Troy is a great choice, but purists will find plenty of flaws...
B000002N2P|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS GREAT, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS DOOKIE. I REMEMBER WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND MY FRIEND GOT IN ON TAPE. YES KIDS TAPE. ANYWAY THE SONGS HERE ARE SOLID, BUT NOT THEIR BEST EFFORT.
0316776963|2.0|The story is rather interesting until you hit the last few chapters where you realize it's more of the same.  The author is able to communicate his sense of humor and life experiences and I was engaged until I realized that I was not going to get any insightful life lesson learned from his stories.
B000002MP2|5.0|THIS IS GREEN DAYS BEST ALBUM PERIOD. IT NEEDS REMASTERING BUT IT STILL SOUNDS SOMEWHAT DECENT. EVERY SONG IS JUST ABOUT GREAT ON THIS ALBUM. I REMEMBER LISTENING TO IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. I ALMOST GOT THE FEELING I DID WHEN I FIRST LISTENED TO NIRVANA'S NEVERMIND. SIMPLY AN AWESOME ALBUM.
B000001Y5D|5.0|I finally picked up this CD for the one song, \\"What's Up.\\" Without question, that song had stuck with me for years. I wasn't expecting much; I just wanted that one song. I was completely blown away. This CD is absolutely incredible!<br /><br />There is not one weak song on this creation. I dare say that \\"What's Up\\" is not even the best one; I'm rather fond of \\"\\"Spaceman.\\"<br /><br />I would call the sound of 4 Non Blondes that of a well-produced garage band. I couldn't picture them filling up massive stadiums, but I bet they would tear down large concert halls.<br /><br />The singer's voice is unique and powerful. The lyrics are introspective and satisfying. The music, itself, just rocks. The whole combination creates a powerful experience.<br /><br />It's most unfortunate that this band began and ended here with, \\"Bigger, Better, Faster, More.\\"
B0002OERI0|5.0|OTHER THEN THE GROUND BREAKING DOOKIE THIS ALBUM IS THEIR BEST. PERIOD PEOPLE.EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM FLOWS PERFECTLY. I CANT BELIEVE HOW GREAT THIS ALBUM IS
B00000J2PH|5.0|...period. I'm not going to go into detail of all the reasons why I love \\"Tapestry\\". You need to get it and also all of Carole King's 70's albums, some of which are better than others, but all have great songs and are worth it.
B00004XQP4|5.0|THIS ALBUM HAS MANY AWESOME SONGS BUT NOT MY FAVORITE GREEN DAY ALBUM. DOOKIE OR AMERICAN IDIOT IS THE WAY TO GO IF YOUR JUST GETTING STARTED WITH GREEN DAY'S MUSIC.
B000002U82|1.0|Most successful album ever? you wish! Thriller and Sgt. Pepper are! This is a very poor album by a highly over-rated group.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|let me put a disclaimer out there first: i am a big ryan adams fan. that said, i don't think anyone could be disappointed by this album. it is a wonderfully timed release; an album to put in on a beautiful day and simply enjoy life for all its wonder. from a music standpoint, ryan adams' songwriting combined with the amazing talents of jp bowersock, catherine popper, cindy cashdollar and brad pemberton make for one of mr. adams' best releases, and that's saying an awful lot. i would try and put somewhat of a term on it; folky, twangy, \\"alt-rock\\"... but the fact of the matter is its all these and none of these. in an age of music where things are repeated until cliche, this album in a beautiful breath of fresh air. enjoy it. (and pre-order his next one due out in august as soon as you can. if this album is great, that might be transcendent.)
B00006CXXU|2.0|This album contains two good songs (\\"Voice Within\\" and \\"Fighter\\") 1 ok-ish song \\"Dirrty\\" and pads the rest out with crap hip hop songs and bad ballads. Never has an album been filled with so much crap to make up the song numbers. A waste of $15.
B0000029GA|5.0|The production on here is immaculate.  At the time you didnt need alot of money to get Dj Premier, Larger P, Pete Rock, Q-Tip to produce your alubm, you need skills. On one side Nas' Illmatic is a blueprint on how to make an album, On the other it is a lyrical masterpiece.  Every Line, every drum, ever sample is on point.  Illmatic wasnt a commercial hit, and thats part of its charm.  Illmatic has no room for flaws.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I am really shocked to see the negative reviews.. Im not gonna call ya'll \\"haters\\" as was predicted in your reviews, but how can u deny the greatness of this album???  <br /> <br />Firstoff, someone said that \\"Dragon days\\" is filler, and i just gotta say NO - that is a great song!! I can't comprehend how someone could just throw that song out and classify it as bad, thats jus ridiculous... and her remake of \\"if i were your woman\\" was, i think, a great idea. Obviously there is no way to match the greatness of the original so why not put a good beat to it and make it hip-hop??? i loved it...  <br /> <br />then there's those sayin that \\"when you really love someone\\" is the same as \\"fallin\\" but that is Also inaccurate. What they do have in common is that piano lick in it, but if you go back in history to all the songs of the past, you will find that in COUNTLESS songs!!! The two songs are entirely different if you take the time to listen...  <br /> <br />In any case, i find it hard to see how anyone could bash this album, but thats just my opinion...
B0000029GA|5.0|True. This is Nas's best album. Straight fire all the way through. But Jay-Z is in a class by himself. (Not post- Reasonable Doubt Jay-Z, but everything before In My Lifetime Jay-Z.) Best track is New York State of Mind. Beat and everything. His flow is crazy and matches beautifully with the beat. Second favorite is the next track with Az. Both flows are milotic.

B0007TKNL0|4.0|With only being slightly familiar with the story of The Phantom of the Opera, I really didn't know what to expect from it when my girlfriend dragged me the theater to watch it a while back. My first experience watching The Phantom of the Opera was an extremely confusing one. First of all, I have never actually sat down through an entire musical in my life. As sad as that may seem to some of you, musicals just aren't in my taste. So it was rather hard to follow the dialect in this film because 95% of it is singing. I was immediately turned off when I realized that most of this film was singing. I had no idea it was based on a musical play by some guy named Andrew Lloyd Webber. I guess I'm not cultured enough to have known that at the time. But anyways, secondly, I couldn't believe Joel Schumacher had directed it. I've known Schumacher for doing films like Falling Down, Flatliners, 8mm, Batman Forever, all really good films, but all out of the realm I believed The Phantom of the Opera to be in for a director of films of those nature. So not being a musical film fan and being terribly confused by the director, I had no way of telling if The Phantom of the Opera was a good movie or not. I really could not seem to figure out if I liked or not. It SEEMED like a musical that would have cultured play attending fools who listen to Beethoven and stuff like that jumping up and down in their seats. It SEEMED like it was a good movie, but I wasn't sure for myself. I felt like a blind person critiquing a painting. To me, at first, The Phantom of the Opera seemed like a contrived boring and annoying piece of movie, but I wasn't sure if that was because it was actually was like that, or if that's how all musicals are and I just don't have the stomach for them. I left the theater in a blunder and vowed not to put myself through that again and told myself I would take a neutral stand on my opinion of the Phantom film.<br /><br />But this weekend The Phantom of the Opera creeped into house and for some odd reason I felt so compelled to watch it after I told myself that I'd never watch it again. It was so strange watching it again, almost like I was watching it again for the first time, only better. The music I found so annoying and the singing that was so hard to understand in the beginning, I found myself able to follow the storyline better through the music and singing this time around. After a while, the music and singing didn't even seem like music or singing at all, I was following it just I would normal dialogue in any other movie. I felt emotionally connected to the characters. I really enjoyed the photography and the sets more. Everything in this movie seemed so rich to me now, it's really hard to tell what happened, but for some reason I had the ability to get into this movie. Maybe I had matured since I saw it (doubtful) or maybe this is just one of those movies you need to give a second chance. I think I was able to get in to The Phantom of the Opera the second time around because I knew what more to expect. I wasn't able to be disappointed because I knew what I was about to watch, and accepted it more the second time around for what it is, and not for what I wanted it to be. So is this a good musical? I don't know, your asking the wrong guy, but is it a good movie? I'm pretty sure it is.o house and for some odd reason I felt so compelled to watch it after I told myself that I'd never watch it again.

B000005RFM|5.0|\\"Sabotage\\" separates the true Black Sabbath fans from those only into albums like \\"Master of Reality\\" or \\"Paranoid\\". Not that there is anything wrong with the early-70's albums, they are classics. \\"Sabotage\\", however, was the culmination of ALL the elements that made Black Sabbath the quintessential heavy metal band of the 70's. \\"Sabotage\\" is full of some of the best riffs in the Sabbath catalog('Hole In the Sky','Symptom of the Universe'), the darkest soundscapes('Megalomania', 'Supertzar'), the finest lyrics('The Writ', 'Thrill of It All'), and overall, the greatest flow. \\"Sabotage\\" is the ULTIMATE STONER album. An album that was designed to be listened to as a whole, while zoned out on good weed or acid. If you are going to buy one Sabbath album, make it \\"Sabotage\\". You will end up wanting to take it to your grave!!! So think beyond 'Paranoid' and 'War Pigs', and check out Black Sabbath at their creative peak, you will not regret it!!! Get buzzed and everything is going to work out fine...yeah-e-yeah...check out \\"Sabotage\\" and blow your mind!!!
0440224764|3.0|I don't know how The Partner by John Grisham has escaped me for so long as this is one of his earlier books.  It has the action packed, conspiracy laden plot that we have come to expect from him.  I read this 480 page book in less than 24 hours.  While it was entertaining and suspenseful, I knew it was impossible for one character to have everything figured out.<br /><br />Patrick Lanigan is a partner in a law firm in Biloxi Mississippi when he is killed in a fiery car crash.  He is burned beyond recognition, and his remains are cremated and then buried.  But when several weeks later, 90 million dollars goes missing from his law firm, Patrick becomes the chief suspect.  Four and a half years later, Patrick is discovered living in Brazil, and is captured and tortured by some disreputable characters who are working on behalf of the companies that were bilked of their millions, including two insurance companies.  Patrick does have the money, although he doesn't know the exact location of it.  But he also knows a terribly powerful secret that can bring many people crashing down if the information was to be made public.  The Partner becomes a literary game of chess as Patrick uses this information while bargaining with the FBI, the Justice Department and Harrison County Law Enforcement.<br /><br />But while The Partner is entertaining, it is totally unbelievable.  First, Lanihan has managed the almost perfect crime, and there are just too many coincidences to be realistic.  He becomes an expert at disappearing, becomes proficient in a new language, masters electronic surveillance, tackles offshore banking, learns to hide money, creates gasoline bombs, and a host of other skills.  I'm not sure that Lanigan was even likable, and when the book ended with a shocker, I wasn't sure if I was glad or sad for Patrick.  In fact, there weren't a whole lot of likable characters in The Partner, except for maybe Sandy McDermott, who was Lanigan's college friend and served as his lawyer.<br /><br />So if you're looking for something with lots of action and some twists and turns, The Partner is vintage Grisham.  But don't expect it to be believable.  It's more a light, summer beach book than a work of great literature.lawyer.    <br /> <br />So if you're looking for something with lots of action and some twists and turns, The Partner is vintage Grisham.

B00003CXE7|1.0|I have been of the opinion that Ridley Scott is an opportunist with no originality.  While Braveheart itself fabricates history, it is not without some enthusiastic immitators.  Ridley Scott evidently took the Braveheart forumla to heart, and his attempt to clone it is the flick Gladiator. <br /> <br />I realize it's a matter of personal taste, but the choice of Crowe as the leading character is a poor one.  There's always something filthy and unseemly that comes through Crowe.  I can't put my finger on it, but it's a persistent problem with Crowe as far as I am concerned. <br /> <br />Now back to Scott.  His latest venture, Kingdom of Heaven, again follows the Braveheart formula, and exploits the hatred towards Islam in the West.  An opportunist he is.
