B00AGH6FD8|5.0|love the show, very cute and funny !!<br /><br />Only one scene is too graphic and not sure why it was put in a kids movie...but other than that funny,  Very old
0307719774|5.0|My friend got this book first! I loved it because I HATE writing diary or journal entries but I'd like to document the years somehow. This is a perfect solution. GOod questions! Some are silly, some are thoughtful and in between.
B00CCX9DUG|5.0|i love her style of writing i love the history mixed with fiction. it was one of those books i hated to put down. she just can't write fast enough for me, although it didn't end so now i have to wait for the next one. if you like romance you will like this and it shows how some men just can't ever have enough
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a cute little game that draws you in and once you pull up for air, you realize you just spent an hour petting a virtual horse! Lots of things to do to keep the user from getting bored.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|OMG. I didn't see the end coming ... It's one of the beat TV shows I've ever seen. I've told everyone I know that they have to watch all the Seasons.
B004N868DS|5.0|The first thing u will notice about this pad is that its HUGE!!! lol If you have the space to put it u will have no problem, u will never be moving the mouse outside the pad ever again.  Its metallic ass the mane suggests it, with rubber corners so it dont slide, seems very durable and sturdy, with good quality rubber and a really nice, quality, long and ergonomic wrist support that u can put whenever u want.    The pad have 2 sides, one optimized for control (blue one) and one optimized for speed (black one), and incredibly i notice the difference with my Roccat Kone XTD Max mouse, that really surprised me.  I play de FPS with the black side, and RPG or Strategy with the blue side, also i consider the blue side best for normal activities in windows. i did this comparison using the same profile and DPI in the mouse if u like to know.    Its a really nice looking pad, that feels its gonna last for a long time and surprised me in a very good way.  Its a bit expensive, but u get what u pay for and the time this is gonna last could definitely make it worth the extra.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love the detail, I can't wait to finish the whole series.  I've been watching the show and together they make it real.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game.  I unfortunately spend alot of time medical waiting rooms and this game keeps me occupied.  Doesn't require alot of brain power and the minutes fly by.  I would recommend this game to anyone
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Really helped me understand the Halo universe better and is a very deep book of the origins of Halo.<br />So far it's been a great book but you just have to make sure you understand what they are talking about.

1451695195|1.0|It's patently obvious that NDE's are just the hallucinations of the dying brain. If oxygen is restored in time, you come back. If not, you don't. It's terrible how hucksters like Eben Alexander make money off of gullible people desperate to believe in an afterlife, with books like \\"Proof of Heaven.\\" Curious that no one ever survives and NDE and reports he saw the devil and the flames of hell. It's always light and peace and loved ones and Jesus-what people expect and want to see. I will bet a lot that non-Christians who have NDEs do not see Jesus.<br /><br />A recent A University of Michigan animal study shows that shortly after clinical death, in which the heart stops beating and blood stops flowing to the brain, rats display brain activity patterns characteristic of conscious perception.  Within the first 30 seconds after cardiac arrest, all of the rats displayed a widespread, transient surge of highly synchronized brain activity that had features associated with a highly aroused brain. They also displayed nearly identical patterns after undergoing asphyxiation.  In fact, at near-death, many known electrical signatures of consciousness exceeded levels found in the waking state, suggesting that the brain is capable of well-organized electrical activity during the early stage of clinical death.­­­<br />[...]<br /><br />Science has the answers people.

B0044ZQ8QC|5.0|Now overshadowed by the twin pillars of Bach and Handel, it’s difficult today to appreciate the renown enjoyed by Arcangelo Corelli in his own time. He was, however, the artistic locus on which much of Baroque instrumental music converged. Perhaps more than any other composer, he pointed the way in how to write the solo sonata, the trio sonata, and the concerto grosso. Without his example, music in the late 17th and early 18th century might have been very different.<br /><br />Corelli was a rare breed for his day. He was an Italian composer who, so far as we know, never wrote a note of vocal music. Instead, he focused on the violin, and indeed it’s been said that most schools of violin playing begin with Corelli. Further, in a time that reveled in exuberant showmanship, his was the musicianship of restraint. Rarely did he engage in the pyrotechnics of, say, Pietro Locatelli. His violin works never venture into the higher registers, and his scales and arpeggios seem less showy and more subsumed into musical substance. Finally, in a time when composers were expected to churn out music on demand, Corelli lavished his attention on a small but exquisitely crafted set of works in a handful of forms—his entire reputation rests on a mere six opus numbers.<br /><br />But more than most composers, what Corelli lacks in quantity is more than compensated for in quality. There’s a sinuous and cool perfection to his music that excited the admiration of his peers. It’s no accident that Handel’s own concerto grosso masterpieces were closely modeled on Corelli’s example.<br /><br />Brilliant Classics’ 10 CD set offers smooth and spirited original instrument performances. Intonation is flawless, vibrato is sparing and judicious. While some might miss the meatier heft of modern instruments, the lean transparency of these performances aptly suit Corelli. The recorded sound is clear and luminous. Continuo playing is supplied variously by harpsichord, organ, archlute, theorbo, and guitar.<br /><br />This is listener-friendly music. Corelli never taxes the patience of his listeners. Throughout the entire set, only three movements exceed four minutes. So if you don’t care for a particular selection, don’t worry, another will be along anon. Always the music unfolds with refinement and grace.<br /><br />In short, Corelli holds up well as a progenitor of all we now hold dear about late baroque music. Those who came after scaled heights first mapped by him. As the 12th century scholar John of Salisbury wrote: “We are like dwarfs sitting on the shoulders of giants. We see more, and things that are more distant, than they did, not because our sight is superior or because we are taller than they, but because they raise us up, and by their great stature add to ours.”.<br /><br />This is listener-friendly music.

B00992CF6W|3.0|while the gameplay is fun, the fact kindle fire cannot get updates kills it for me. here I am two updates behind IOS users, which is most of the people I connect to. what's up with that?
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I really love this app. I feel secure using it to store my passwords and to generate new ones. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that, sometimes it fills in a password that I use in a separate profile; this is not really a drawback, but a work-around on my part.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is fun and challenging. An easy game to learn and play while traveling. Even my grandchild can play it with me.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game played everyday did great to pass time. Now that it updated last night I get this message that says new version available go to app store, but when I do it doesn't say anything about there being an update. Please fix or I'm going to have to delete the game because it is not working.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent, a page turner that I really enjoyed? Kept me going  and wanting more, will look for more from this author

630512762X|5.0|Whoever put John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, two of the sexiest men in the world and two of the best actors alive today, together in a film was a genius.  No other two actors could have pulled this movie off so well and so right.  I hope no one can really trade faces on people like this!  The result in this case is really something to see.  This is an action-packed film that will keep you glued to your seat wanting to see what will happen next.  It's a fantastic showing of Good versus Evil.  Whoever wrote this excellent film is a genius.  It's a film about right versus wrong, good versus evil, relationships between husband and wife and between parents and children and between siblings yet it's also about the psychological struggle of a good man who has to pretend to be a bad man in order to prevent a catastrophe.  There's plenty of action as well:  shootouts, explosions, fist fights and chases.  This is an exciting film and I love it.

B0073ODRKG|5.0|You can't beat what you get in this set and for a great price.  You get Madonna's eleven studio albums in one set, including &#34;Erotica&#34;, &#34;Hard Candy&#34;, &#34;Madonna&#34;, &#34;True Blue&#34;, &#34;Like a Prayer&#34;, &#34;Ray of Light&#34; and &#34;Music&#34;.  Whoever designed this set did an excellent job because it allows you to take all eleven CD's around in a small box to play whenever and wherever you like.  Please note:  The CD's are in cardboard envelopes instead of the normal plastic CD cases, but that makes them lighter to carry, which is a plus in my opinion.

0743581490|1.0|I was very disappointed. I ordered this DVD through Amazon but it was sent from a different source in England. I was not informed that it would NOT play in the United States. When I tried to watch the DVD, a sign appeared on the screen saying &#34; Playback prohibited by area limitations.&#34; That should have been public knowledge before I ordered it and before it was sent from England to the United States.  The return address was:<br />Video Lynn<br />4 Lower Cardiff Road<br />Pwllheli<br />L153 5BY<br />So I ordered a DVD that cannot be viewed in the United States. There should be some warning on Amazon that this could happen if the product is sent from another country.
B006UW4OB8|1.0|I have been a great fan of eWallet on my Palm PDA so I readily adopt it when I switched to Android. But too bad : since a network data connection is required for allowing it to launch, this program is actually useless when you really need for it... e.g. when you are travelling far abroad (with expensive data connection from your provider) and must have access to your codes.<br /><br />In summary I will switch to another app and I have lost my $11.95.<br />Luc
B007HVBW2A|5.0|This movie definitely looked good! Flawless streaming, no connection problems. One of the best horror movies, even compared to today's.

B009NY43NY|5.0|Love the Sookie Stackhouse story!!  I have been reading them since they first started showing up on the shelves.  I am really sad to see them end, and I personally would have liked the ending to be different, but it is still an awesome book!

B00C3MKCIS|5.0|This album was recommended by Amazon because of the music I search.<br />Thank you so much.<br />I wasn't sure about this because I've not heard anything by Simon and being Phil's son I had doubts.<br />I'm so glad I gave it a chance, from the opening instrumental track to the eighteen min. ending. I was enveloped by the slick time changes, great musicianship and general emotional beauty of this album.<br />This is the definition of great prog, without going into detail about the individual tracks it's an album that you can wrap youself into and come out when it's over wishing it would just keep going.<br />I really hope SOC can produce it's equal or better Dimensionaut in thier next album.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I heard a lot of good things about this series but never watched while it was on TV. The show is full of drama and humor. Characters and those playing the roles are great.
1907523685|5.0|One of my more favorites of her works.  She originally wrote this as a gift for a friend, and it's telling in her dry and sometimes not-so-dry sense of humor.  Again I took another jump into her joyous semantic soaring - it seems that you can feel her smiling, if not downright laughing throughout wondrous and wonderful tale.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I enjoyed playing the game until it updated. Now, it will not let me play.  Now, don't know what to do with it.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Once I updated it kept telling me to go to the app store to download<br />the newest version of this app and now I can't play . Don't download unless you want to play temporarily.

B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I tried to really like this movie, I did.<br /><br />It's the only OZ movie we've gotten since, &#34;Return to OZ&#34; one of my all-time favorite childhood movies with Fairuza Balk for the first time ever. I tried to keep comparisons to the classic icon, the original Wizard of OZ to a minimum and to understand that nothing was going to live up to those expectations.<br /><br />But even with those considerations I can't, in good conscience, give this movie anything more than 3 stars because for me it was simply a mediocre movie.<br /><br />It felt like the magic and the life of OZ had been sucked out and in its place was a metric crap-ton of CGI. I really miss the practical effects of the old days. There's just something tactile, something tangible with practical effects that you just don't get with CGI.<br /><br />The story basically fills in the gaps with information about how things came to be in the first movie; unfortunately it didn't give us anything new and I was kinda hoping for a little bit more. The story felt rushed both in the narrative of the story and it felt like maybe the writers were scrambling to get done and lacked a bit of depth. However it was interesting to learn the origin story and see the transformation of both the Wizard & the Wicked Witch.<br /><br />In the end it was an entertaining movie and I did enjoy it, but I was let down. I feel like the source material is so rich and vibrant and this opportunity was a little bit squandered on a lowest common denominator, giant-douchey-corporation-approved film that will get mediocre responses from the widest range of audiences while being awesome to nobody.

B008PALI5S|5.0|Mahler's Symphony Nr. 8 E-Flat Major would have to be the most mammoth undertaking in symphonic history.<br />I have many versions of this work in all formats and love them all, but; this reading by Dudamel and his combined LA & Venezuelan forces would have to be the definitive version to date!<br />Not only has he assembled the largest forces to EVER to tackle this work, but has been able to bring the whole work home with exhilarating results; fresh, clean and decisive articulation. Every note down to the quietest pianissimo can actually be heard in this recording; most other recordings you cannot hear these softer passages.<br />The choirs, all Venezuelan handle the massive work with ease and I must make mention of the massive children's choir who perform this work from memory: NO SCORES, what so ever. How the hell they managed it is beyond me and shows just what kind of choristers they are and my hat goes off to them.<br />Then we come to the soloists: Eight of the most perfect voices I have ever heard. The only one I know is the alto Anna Larsson the remainder are completely unknown to me; but what voices they poses. The three sopranos are: Manuela Uhl; Juliana di Giacomo and Kiera Duffy: the two altos are Anna Larsson and  Charlotte hellekant: the men are: Burkhard Fritz (tenor), Brain Mulligan (baritone), Alexander Vinogradov (bass).<br />Alexander would have to the youngest bass I have ever heard in part and what a magnificent powerful voice he possesses. ALL the soloists are exemplary.<br />The combined orchestras play with so much passion you can almost feel the music oozing from the very beings and all this held in the most capable hands of just ONE man, Gustavo Dudamel.<br />So!! If you like me have many recordings of Mahler's \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\" but NOT this one; go out and purchase it, I can tell you now, you'll never listen to your other ones again once your ears have experienced this.<br />Passionate, explosive, and sonically majestic don't evenbegin to describe it.<br />Do yourself a favour and experience what I felt when I played this Blu-Ray performance. You only live once and you will only witness once Mahler at his VERY, VERY best. Mahler vs Dudamel, the fight is not over until the last note resounds!<br />Crank the volume up, pour yourself a drink, sit back and to hell with the neighbours and be prepared to be taken on a sonic journey of a life time.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I bought this case (Verso Prologue, Tan) shortly after receiving the Kindle Fire for Christmas, and I was definitely pleasantly surprised. It holds the Kindle very securely and I never worry about it falling out of the case. It looks awesome and I've gotten so many compliments from strangers in coffee shops and this girl who sat next to me in class, and now we're close friends so it makes a great conversation starter :)<br /><br />One thing I haven't seen in many reviews is that is also actually works really well is you want to stand up the Kindle to watch a YouTube video or Netflix or something. The texture of the case provides enough friction to keep it upright, so that was an unexpected plus for me.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who has a Kindle Fire...what a great case.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This'll be a better movie then it is a book I believe.<br />The characters just aren't very believable - they don't seem real.<br />The story is interesting, but reminds me of Harry Potter playing &#34;D20 Modern:Urban Arcana&#34;.<br /><br />Leave this one to the young adults.  It doesn't transcend age ranges like say: The Percy Jackson series or Harry Potter.

I don't want to give much away but this book is basically an autobiography and only part of the book is actually about the raid on Bin Laden's compound.<br /><br />I also bought Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell.

B003U69IX6|2.0|We were planning to stream this movie for my son's \\"movie\\" birthday party on our new HD TV, and luckily we tried it out in advance because it did not work!  The movie itself (having rented it from Redbox as a back-up) is surprisingly outstanding.  It tells the tale well with much less violence than I would have thought, and fewer \\"inuendoes\\" than I expected, but was surprisingly well-acted and had an excellent pace.  Anyway, when we tried streaming it as an Instant HD movie, it played for a while and then kept quitting.  I just needed to turn the TV off and then back on (while leaving the Wii U through which we were streaming it still on) and the movie would have continued while I was doing so.  But we were not interested in having this happen many times during our son's party, so we rented it instead.  When we called Visio (our TV's maker) we were told if you search Google re: this problem with Amazon streaming for HD you will find pages of reports of the same problem.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Love it as a kid, and still love it as and grown kid! A must see to bring out the inner goonie of all.
0385528787|4.0|I enjoyed this novel immensely and yet I am a little dissatisfied with it.<br /><br />As the ending of the trilogy, \\"MaddAddam\\" works quite well. There are hardly any questions about the future of the new humanity that Atwood leaves unanswered. We can see how Crakers will evolve. Their future is not dire, it's not utopian, it's not a salvation as Crake intended it to be, it's not even much different from the path the humanity has already seen throughout its history. I especially liked how Atwood weaved a birth of religion into this story. Which bring up the question - will things be really different this time around, or will Crakers transform into war-waging, violence loving beings as we are?<br /><br />For all its seriousness though, \\"MaddAddam\\" is a surprisingly funny and uplifting novel, something I didn't expect from an Atwood novel, and certainly not from a story which started as gory and unforgiving as \\"Oryx and Crake\\" was..<br /><br />What is lacking, I guess, is scope. At the title suggests, this book is supposed to be about MaddAddam, a person as vital to the narrative of this story as Crake is and was in \\"Oryx and Crake\\". But do we get to really know him? I don't think so. I feel like we got a better glimpse at Crake through the eyes of Jimmy in \\"Oryx and Crake,\\" than we did at MaddAddam through the eyes of Zeb, and Zeb is just not as exciting as MaddAddam. These two books (\\"Oryx and Crake\\" and \\"MaddAddam\\") could have been a neat mirror of each other - depicting the two leaders on the opposite sides of the conflict that lead to basically the end of the world as we know it. And yet, I felt the figure of MaddAddam was underdeveloped and underexplored.<br /><br />It still was a great pleasure to read, however.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|For $10 it is unreal to get 18 tracks on this. Purchased this as a gift and the person loved it. Has legend Hawaiian musicians Gabby, Keola, Sonny on here, you will understand why they are legends. Classic Hawaiian, very calming, easy listening, a must-have for your musical collection. Would buy it again and for others as a gift!

B0052U6KB6|4.0|One recommendation is do not do your first couple of runs with no socks... my heal got pretty tore up. But overall I'd say this is a great product.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Keeps you second guessing your own predictions.  You have to keep turning the page, because you don't feel like you have enough information to solve the mystery.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great read! Will keep you turning the pages to see if your prediction is accurate.  Also read GONE GIRL, by Gillian Flynn!
B00DAXXO98|5.0|This us a great series. Kevin Spacey is perfect as the house whip I can't wait for season 2. Great cast of characters.
B00005V9IL|5.0|When is this great flick coming out in Blu-Ray?? Anyone know? It would be a total waste otherwise!! I have seen this movie a while back &amp; I thought it was very good.
159315724X|5.0|I received this book so fast and it was in great condition.  It's an easy read, really gets you excited to make changes in your life.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Wow this is a ok  book but we need to like look a word up in a different way like have an educational book for school like say for instance  your at school studying for a test at the last minute and nothing but one question about Martin Luther king  all they have to do is look it up with the keypad
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app works pretty well. If you have too many background apps open it might be a bit slow, but that can happen, just close what you don't need. The Save function works now, when I got the app it didn't. It's fun for those of us who just occasionally feel artistic and want to mess with old photos. Not sure how it would stack up to someone who really knows what they are doing when it comes to visual editing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome job of despicable me minion rush it is coolest game ever because of the characters are funny and they could be huge
B004AFFZNI|2.0|I thought i got the hero 3 case but turns out i got the 2  it was my bad. so yeaaa
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this is a great game the kind of game you lose track of time, you won't be disappointed. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B007EPFRNO|4.0|Good album, very Sabbath like, I can not tell different. The slow metal is amazing and full of seventies references, goos art too.
B00BTHWFEC|4.0|Great album, show Orchid how it is done, great drums although it is not Bill Ward. Will see them in October.
B009F1ZYQK|4.0|Good art, good album, really NWOBHM. Wanna get the first album too. Even if not Bruce Dianno was good. KILLER BASS.
B009439HP8|5.0|One of the greatests surprises. The music is great, band is great, album an adt great too. Wanna see the alive!
B000HL2J0G|4.0|It's a flashback to when I last saw it, which, as I remember was quite a few years ago. Fun!
0385366752|1.0|But this is a most unsatisfactory book.  The characters are not likable----perhaps one minor character, but other than that, no.  And the ending was not at all satisfying.  I assume we are supposed to think that the core characters get the fate they both deserve.  It didn't work for me.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this series-enough twists and turns to keep it interesting, enough comedy to make you smile.  Give it a try-I think you will like it, unless you insist on blood, gore and vampires.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Wow - what a powerful story.  It feels like it must be based on reality though it is just a novel.  The narrator's voice is so true and funny and poignant.  You probably already know something of the plot.  She starts off telling you that she lost her brother and sister.  Only in time does she revel that her sister Fern was a chimp who was raised along side her as a scientific experiment.  When the narrator was five, Fern was sent away and the family really never recovers. It affects each one differently.  Layer by layer she peels away the memories and traumas.  Very hard to put down.  Beautifully, beautifully written.  This woman can write!! I cannot recommend it enough.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This compound seem to work better thn others I have tried. It was easier to work with and it doesn't dry out if I don't use it too often.
B00BB8UJKG|4.0|A sweet portrayal of life in the small town.  Good music, great acting, and yes beautiful girls.  Rosie O'Donnell wasn't even kind of funny.
074401493X|5.0|This product is very nice!! The art is lovely and the guide is spectacularly accurate! I also loved the key chain, which i turned into a neckace.
0670014893|4.0|It is a testament to the deadening of our ability to be shocked at the collateral loss of life in espionage or military settings of fiction that the deaths in A Delicate Truth seem at first to be trivial. Even in real life we cannot read of drone attacks on terrorist camps and not know without doubt that some of those blown up were just cooks or camp family members. Yet le Carre manages to turn the ship around on us, the hero is not now the weary fighter who knows that disaster lurks whenever resolute men are not willing to do what needs to be done, however shocking to civilian sensibilities. Now the hero is a midlevel diplomat who has enough spycraft to satisfy our appetite but also a civilian's sense of balance about what is too secret to be investigated and who should be held accountable when things go wrong and why privatization of intelligence and military services ala Blackwater have serious implications for all of us. Four stars though because the characters are not le Carre at his best.
B00B8BR1YS|4.0|I like the performance of Gwineth. Its Amazing, with many reasons años Academy Awards winner. The life of Shakespeare in a nice way to see
1451627297|3.0|11/22/63 has Steven King's usual page turning writing and an interesting idea with nice touches of the historical novel thrown in. However the constraints of historical fact trip him in the end. The necessary resolution of the story is spoiled with an unimaginative finish and the consequences of a somewhat confused understanding of the Butterfly Effect that has interference in human history prompting geological consequences. Good enough for a plane ride, but no better than that.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Oh how wonderful it is to view this dvd.  The new version of Sabrina is terrific.  The music is devine, and the characters all play their parts in a whimsical fashion.
B00D9T8Q3W|5.0|I've read two other books with Will Robie as the main character. I wish I had read this one first.  I was pleased to know how he met the teenage girl, Julie.  Really enjoyed the book and recommended it to a friend.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|This was so realistic.  I loved watching the planes zipping in and out of the clouds, mountains and other planes.
B00821OX98|3.0|Although the general story line of FS is interesting, overall there's too much drama without the aliens. As far as pure Sci-Fi is concerned, one doesn't get to see much of the strange alien creatures and too much of the strange human creatures...
B003JH8LPW|5.0|As usual, Dan Brown did not disappoint, what a great read!  Brown has a way of immediately capturing my attention from the first page to the last page.  THANK YOU!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game, runs well, decent graphics.  There are ads before games but usually just one and you can skip it. (Tap on the screen and you get the option to skip.)  I'm very happy with it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I purchased the black one and the white. The black was for my husband, and the white was for me. I received another Kindle cover with my Kindle for my birthday a few months ago. The first one covered some of the screen, so making my way to the home page was difficult. The Marware is perfect. The Kindle clips right in and holds it really well. The cover stays shut without even needing the elastic band.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Clutch is like a fine wine.  Getting better and better with age.  I reccomend it to anyone who maybe lost interest in them.  This album will bring you back!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I would recommend this app for easy access to all the music stored on my phone, PC, and iPad . I was<br />Looking for simplicity and this is it. Thanks from a senior citizen.
B006LSZECO|2.0|If you like being stuck in a psycho marriage then this book is for you. Feel the thrill of unlikable characters who are nuts and hate each other with an unsatisfying ending. Well written. Sad. Psycho.
1416550518|3.0|The book starts out well, but begins to drag by the middle.  I didn't like the ending.  Without giving anything away, it was too wrapped up neatly.
1781162646|5.0|Practically all of Stephen King's books are good.  This one is no exception.  You are at once scared and hopeful until the end.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This made me aware of the power of other factors besides innate intelligence and skill that determine why 'outliers' came to be so.<br />Good read for parents and grandparents in particular.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A wonderful insight to our best friends take on life. A very enjoyable and fast read. Any animal lover will like it
B00A6WSTIW|4.0|I like the real looking shark, and the real looking shark attacks. I didn't like the sciencetists reations to the killer sharks. the were only thinking dollars not human life that was unreal. thanks!
B005LAII80|4.0|full of action for action lovers like my self. and 3d is out of this world. the ending was very hart warming.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A fascinating story told with humour, sensitivity and meticulous detail.  Exciting twists which left the reader vascillating about their alliance to one or other party.  A difficult plot to finish ...
B004SRWW0C|1.0|Root folders can not be copy pasted untill the device is rooted.... it's a waste of money... doesn't does what the description says...
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I wish there were  more ways to earn coins, but this is a great game! My kids love watching me play.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I got as the amazon free app of the day but I would pay the 5 bucks to have the awesome photo editing features this app features.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great fun. An  appropriate for my kids.  Graphics are tons of fun.  I even like th  music,  campy beach feel to it.
B004I744AS|5.0|I am an English professor but I found that playing Words with Friends that some things had changed when I wasn't looking, like words that begin with &#34;Q&#34; no longer have to have a &#34;U.&#34; Amazing, but scary. Dictionary had the information I have needed every time.
0802473156|3.0|I bought the book used as a gift as the guy likes used books. Since it was a self help book though I steered clear of the &#34;gently used&#34; description as it said it may contain marking, highlights, whatever, and instead chose &#34;like new&#34; option which I took to mean no markings. The book is in great shape and exactly what I wanted but it came completely highlighted with passages that someone else had taken as their own and not at all a gift I could give to someone that was supposed to get his own take on it and highlight stuff on his own. I ended up keeping the copy for myself and reordering elsewhere.
B00BOXZAG6|1.0|Slow movie -- started out slow, ending just kind of &#34;fizzled.&#34;  I'm not sure what all the positive reviews and hype was all about...  Aside from the sci-fi gimick, the plot itself was the age-old &#34;boy meets girl, boy falls for girl in forbidden love, boy loses girl, boy wins back girl against all odds.&#34;  It was way too predictable for my wife and me -- I walked away from the movie a few times and could still pretty much tell what was going on...  If not for the fact that I had paid (so much) for the blu-ray version, my wife and I would have just turned off the movie before the &#34;blah&#34; ending.<br /><br />I felt like I wasted $17.50 and 90 minutes of my life.
B007W7P5L8|4.0|This keeps my Kindle screen scratch-free, helps it stand and provides some light deflection.  Best of all though, the color helps me find it easily when I'm traveling.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Short puzzling game, each step could be used for anything. When you feel truly stuck you notice something you never noticed before!
B0029O08WA|5.0|The Twilight Saga: New Moon Soundtrack is great to listen to even without watching the movie.  It makes me think of love and loss and hope.  The music is great to listen to any time.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|It does not have nothing innovation, and it works very slow, resume I put it in the trash. it is all
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Quick easy game that almost anyone can play. My entire family plays it from ages 4 to old and we all enjoy.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is easy to use and easy to read. Good clarity. I like the screen shots and multiple map locations.
B006PAV1XO|5.0|Quirky movie like both main actors always do but worth the watch on a lazy day. A Humorous and slightly strange movie
B001F0VHEM|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my mother and I was hoping it would be like new. Thank you guys so much she is enjoying it very much so!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Was looking for an app to tidy up my Kindle HD and this was perfect. Clean, intuitive interface. Definitely recommend.
B000XB5WHW|5.0|It was more than I bargained for! Thank you soooo much, I am enjoying my purchase thank to you guys!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|The only better album is Cold Fact by Rodriguez.  This was so good, I bought 3 other copies to hand out to friends and relatives.  I listen to these two albums all the time
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie. The story is very unique and its not a predictable ending. Also, viewing it as an instant video worked out really well. Totally easy process.
B00DJUPLY8|1.0|Didnt work for me ... went to a (non-YouTube) website, played the video... nothing to click to save it.  Besides, sometimes I would prefer to download either without fully viewing or while viewing, so the base paradigm doesnt fit.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|An education into autism and weird people.  It's about real people which illustrates the variety of differences between all of us.  Good, not great.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|The only possible contender for BEST ALBUM EVER is &#34;Coming from Reality&#34; by Rodriguez.  This was so good, I bought 3 other copies to hand out to friends and relatives.  I listen to these two albums all the time
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Great language and quite confronting.  Good read. Couldn't wait to get back to the book. Kept me guessing, even though I thought I had worked it out.
B002SQ364Q|4.0|'nuf said... buy it, enjoy it.  Watch it, and then watch Woodstock.  It'll put a whole other spin on the latter.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|A lot of fun!!!  Its great how quickly the game moves- I love the fact that it skips a turn if a player doesn't play quickly enough.  Really keeps things moving along.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Very engaging game!  It kept my interest all through the end! My one complaint is that it was too short.
0312983867|5.0|I love every Evanovich book, but Stephanie Plum is the best series. Book was in the condition described. Shipping was fast. I am happy with the purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Everyone is complaining about how it's not updated. It takes time to rewrite the update onto kindle fires ok people
B008458O3S|5.0|My friends and I were racing each other through the levels (after I got them all addicted).  We would gchat each other whatever level we just passed and smack talk.  It was very fun.
B004ZGI1V0|2.0|So surprised these good actors were in a movie that made little to no sense.  Many holes in the plot.  Bruno Ganz was brilliant.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|If you like the Bejeweled type match games, this is an interesting twist. I played through twice, kept me company for a couple weeks, even though most games I play for a few hours and then lose interest.
1401324649|5.0|Loved the adventure.  Loved the twist in history.  Loved the characters.  I gave to several others who also enjoyed it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Buy it and then play it.  Then tell your friends to also buy it.  The graphics and sound are so fun and the gameplay is intuitive.  The difficulty ramps up very well too.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I found this story very flat and lacking the cohesion of Khaled Hosseini's stories, &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;, and &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;.<br />If I take these two great stories from the equation, then I see his effort this time as a genuine attempt to join a family tree together over many generations, and now it lacks the empathy I would like to see for such a wide coverage of people.<br />The Folklore Tale added at the start, was more like a red herring in the scheme of things, in my mind.<br />On the plus side, it did build splendidly in places and promised much, but never quite made it in any.<br />A good read of course, but we have been spoilt by Khaled's two outstanding Novels, preceding this release.<br /><br />Peter O'Connor,<br />Brisbane.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|You match up tiles like a Bejeweled clone, meanwhile your matches translate into various attacks, defenses and power ups for your little dungeon guy.  Very fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the Minions. They are so cute and this game is a blast! Download it's a lot of fun. Check it out for sure. They frustrated me at first then I got the hang of it. Now its just fun. I forgot all about the birds._ I hope they aren't angry!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Anyone can enjoy this movie. Great story based on a &#34;real&#34; person. All of the actors are good but the stars are the lady played by Sandra Bullock, the football player (played by?) and the son. I never tire of watching this movie.
B00CXQL828|5.0|An Amazing Power Trio!!! Very Catchy Hooks, Kicking Grooves, Rip Snorting Licks, and Powerful Vocals. Love every Minute of it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|when i heard their was a temple run 2 ..i was doing anything possible to get i mean downloader all types of apps to get it...
B0002X314C|5.0|The John Ledgend CD &#34;Get Lifted&#34; was packaged very nicely with padding.<br /><br />I CD has very nice tracks on it.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|I mean honestly, this book was so funny! I have read books that made me smile, snort and do an appreciative Ha! - but not many that made me actually laugh out loud (where family members looked over their glasses at me), but this book did.<br /><br />So if you want to have a really good time of an evening, do yourself a favor and read about Drew and Kate. Drew is such a rascal.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|These friends with super brains have their squabbles and petty annoyances with each other but always come together to help one another.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Her story is amazing and inspiring.  She shows more strength than anyone I know.  I felt  very encouraged by her positive and healthy attitude.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|There are some albums where you like 4 out of 10 songs.  There are some albums where you like 8 out of 10 songs.  8/10 is a highly decent ratio.  I bought the CD with only 8 tracks on it.  I loved all 8.  That is a very rare thing for me.  If you love Ozzy,  If you love Sabbath,  You must buy this.  It won't let you down.<br /><br />Three days in owning the CD and I just had to learn to play 'God is Dead?'.  I love the work that much.  It's fun to play and not terribly difficult to learn.<br /><br />My only gripe is in regards to \\"Deluxe\\" and \\"Non-Deluxe\\" albums.  This has nothing to do with the band.  It's just evil marketing.  I've seen these before with other bands.  Cradle of Filth's Thornography is one of them.  Though that one actually IS deluxe.  It had like a video disk or something.  Back to Sabbath.  I bought this then googled the album and found there are not 8 but 12 songs!  I'm looking for the empty space/hidden tracks,  I'm looking for a missing second disc.  Nope, mine has 8.  So I see this page for the deluxe and there are only 11.  I'm going to buy the missing 3 songs here so I can have a cobbled together 'deluxe' but damn...  where is the missing 12th?  Can't Marketing just make one damn disc with all the crap on it???<br /><br />Anyway, buy it.  No rancor directed at the band.  This is awesome music and you'll love it.
1589795474|4.0|This book has some advice that would be good for anyone. It helps understand the difference between needs and wants. Although much is common sense, the information is presented in a practical way.
0307887448|3.0|I'm a videogamer, and another gamer recommended this book to me because it has videogame references.  However, it references decades-old videogames and other pop culture from the 80's, the most hilariously lame decade of all.  If you were born in maybe the early 70's/late 60's, a lot of these references would probably be very relevant, but if you were born in the early 80's like myself, you might be too young to really enjoy any of these, and without that frame of reference, the rest of the book plays out slightly like a watered-down mashup of the Matrix meets LOTR.<br /><br />That being said, I honestly think this book would have been more enjoyable if it was reimagined as a graphic novel.  It might be easier and more enjoyable to get the 80's references if they were visual.
B000067QMD|4.0|You get 6 which is a bonus since it only shows 2.<br />When I boiled them 2 of them warped but still made it work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was captured from the first page. Catniss is the best character I've encountered in a long time. I loved the whole thing from beginning to end. The descriptions and plot line are so imaginative and engaging I couldn't put it down.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|A refreshing movie! I love the diversity of this movie! I cant wait to watch it again in a couple of months, as i always watch my fav movies over and over
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second Hunger Games book was Justas good as the first. I really enjoyed the whole story and its development. Great characters, great plot. All around a GREAT book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is a simple concept that can entertained me for hours. It is great to distract yourself for just a couple minutes on your break at work as well.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Harry Hole is my kind of hero. Jo Nesbo is filling the hole (no pun intended) left by Stieg Larsson's passing. Good mystery, but the names are hard to del with for n Irish-American tongue. Excellent storyline, fast paced and interesting. I'll read more by Nesbo.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Good movie with a good story. I recommend this to all baby boomers. The music was enjoyable--even the opera. Watch it, you will like.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I hesitated to read this last chapter after reading the first two. I was afraid it would end like it did. A friend recommended that I finish what I started saying that the ending was as good as it could be in a world like that one. She was right I loved it!
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Fairly good product; just need to take your time after the etch is made. I used the ice bath/ and a butane torch to get a clean cut 8-10 bottles.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book took me longer than his other two to get to the point where I wanted to do nothing but read it, but I did get there and enjoyed the journey. I love learning about Afghanistan through Khaled's books (yes, I feel I have spent enough time with his writing to be on a first name basis). But one of the things that is most important for us to see is that wherever you go in the world, people have joy and sadness. In this book, you get to see the joys and agonies of people with very different social standing in Afghanistan. You get a sense of tradition versus modernity as well. I highly recommend this book, especially for those who enjoy thought- provoking stories.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Riordan starts his series off with a book that really holds one's attention.  A great read for mythology enthusiasts.  Uses humor to help the reader along the mythology trail.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Best album I have listened to all year. I play it incessantly.<br />Recommended  it to everyone I know and love.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|This trilogy by Dashner kept me wanting to read more.  Fantasy, sci-fi, and adventure are knit together in this futuristic novel.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Compelling, great actors, nothing contrived.Close attention to details right down to 1/2 full bottle of catchup in fridge.<br />Series is the best I have ever seen. Scary because it really could happen.
6305120706|5.0|This is the epitome of theatre, or at least the video form of it.  The music is mesmerizing, the talent grand.  Elaine Paige and Ken Page steal the show.  My students loved it.
B00C5UV3YU|5.0|Totally awesome.  This has all the Videos that I wanted of Destinys Child and more.<br />Package arrived on time and in excellent condition.<br /><br />Thanks
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is an easy read for Grisham fans.  I lost interest in his last couple of books, but this one was better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is the absolute best. You start with watching one episode and end up watching the whole season. :D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This whole series is so well written one can get lost in the story.  It does not read like typical adolescent literature.  The twist and turns of the series left me wishing she would write more.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Great, easy reading. I really enjoyed the characters. I think the book is pretty dark but somehow has an uplifting quality to it. I again could not really get into the last part of this book. So far with the two JoJo Moyes books I have read the first two parts of the book keep me really interested and the last part just sort of dwindles.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I've been playing for about a week now and have not spent any real $$$.  I play on my aneroid phone and my kindle.  I never run out of energy.  game gets more challenging as you advance levels.  GREAT GAME!!!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|We bought this to download on our kindle for when we were out of wifi areas but wanted to entertain my 3 year old son. We had never seen it, but soon after him watching it the first time, it soon became his favorite movie. He has since moved on to other favorites, but it definatley served its purpose in entertaining him when we needed it!
B005PK56TA|4.0|I watched this series because of the positive reviews and because I enjoy Connie B. in Nashville.  I watched the entire series in one weekend and will likely pay for season 2. I loved season one.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|I admit, I had already seen this movie when I purchased it, but it came in the mail quick and was in perfect condition, and I still love watching this movie all the time! I even bought the soundtrack!
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is a lot of fun worth playing  downloaded quickly so far easy puzzles I,m sure they will get more difficult
0316228583|1.0|What a disappointing read! I hoped it would get better, but was disappointed until the bitter end. There was no character in the book that I cared anything about. It was not at all appealing; too many pages of drugs, sex and people hating each other. Even those sad topics could be, and have been presented by authors in an interesting story.  Wish I had read some reviews before we bought the book. Hopefully JK Rowling finds her voice in something readable in the future. A final note, I've read a few of her Harry Potter books and they were pretty good. I was not expecting anything similar, but I did expect an interesting story.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Very addicting show love the characters! The surgeries and the plots are fun to watch too! I would recommend this in a heartbeat!
0307269981|5.0|This is the second book in the Millennium trilogy by Stieg Larsson. All three books in this series are a 'must' read, and should be followed by the Swedish-made movies (as well as the American-made version of the \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\"). Lisbeth Salander, the heroine of the books, is one of the most original and interesting fictional characters of the past 30 years.
0553801473|5.0|My wife is enjoying this book even though there are so many negative reviews. Hope there are additional books written for this series.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Really enjoyable album. I listen to it almost daily and there are so many solid songs on it. I love showing people that there is more and better macklemore than just thrift shop. There are a few songs that are pretty crude that i tend to skip especially around company, but other than that it is a great album. I also bought otherside to compliment this album as its one of my favorites.
0345529057|5.0|My wife really enjoyed this set of books. She could hardly put them down. I even had to buy her a book light so she could read in bed. LOL I highly recommend this series.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|I have to admit that i had listened to them for a while and was really excited for this album when i bought it. After getting it i was not able to maintain the excitement. I guess i had listened to them for a while on pandora and am just not super in the mood for them right now. I go through different music moods, so i am sure i will come back around to it. It is enjoyable and i will probably buy their next album down the road though so don't be discouraged if you like what you hear.
0307887448|5.0|Here's how I review. No synopsis, no narrative. Just get to how I was introduced to the book, what I liked and didn't like and maybe some spoilers. Enjoy!<br /><br />I came across this book through my libraries recommended books function.  This book ROCKED! It has officially made my 5 star club list.<br /><br />::: Things I liked :::<br />-Anyone who grew up in the 80s or 90s, watched TV and played video games will loves this book!  It is full of tons of awesome pop cultural references and nostalgia.<br />-The characters are awesome especially the main character Wade.  You really feel like you go on a journey with him through the book.  Well done in the character development/ believability department!<br />-The world setting and concept of the OASIS game was very well done and produced many good imagination moments.<br />-All of the action and adventure of the book is enthralling.  It reminded me of watching over my friend's shoulder as he attempted to clear a hard boss battle when I was young.<br />-I got so hooked on the ending of this book that I read for two hours straight as the sun was setting so I finished the book in the dark with only the light of my kindle paper white illuminating around me. It was awesome!<br /><br />::: Things I didn't like :::<br />-Not much to say here.<br />-There was only one f-word that I recall and a little section on masturbation but it is brief and easily skipped.  Considering modern-day gamer culture this book is remarkably clean and I would not have liked it as much otherwise.<br /><br />::: The Verdict :::<br />Hands down this book joins my 5 star club.  It is a small club comprised of books that I will own and read repeatedly.  If you grew up in the 80s or 90s and loved tv and video games you must read this book!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. Has all the basic functions you want from a calculator. Keypad has a simple functional design. Just right!
B00004CX86|1.0|I 've always loved &#34;The Bridges of Madison County&#34; however, I purchased this movie on Amazon about a month ago and just recently opened the package to watch the movie.  I'm highly disappointed due to the fact I can't watch this movie.  When trying to watch from my computer or my son's tv it states I have to select a region.  I select Region 1 for US and it states not correct region.  I'm frustrated that I cannot watch one of my favorite movies.  Would order another but I don't want to throw another $10 in the wind.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a really good app but whenever I plug my kindle fire in, it always shows me the app
0767903374|4.0|Anyone who has an urge to buy this book should go ahead and buy it. It's tough - the exercises are great at getting to what's needling you. See for yourself
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Amazing journey from a credible Dr. Into the realm of the afterlife. Inspiring and captivating reading. This read connects science with the spiritual.
0761171703|4.0|My son saw me doing some ballet stretches and suggested I might be interested in seeing this and he was right. I bought the book soon after and while I love the book it was viewing the videos that made it truly spectacular for me.<br /><br />Jordan does share some of his story with us but this is a photography book. There are quotes to go with most of the photographs and a fabulous \\"about the photos\\" at the end for background.<br /><br />FYI: I am not a dancer, I just took some classes for flexibility.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I love Lady Antebellum and this is a great CD. They have so many great songs on this one. I highly recommend it!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|One of my favorite books I recommend it to anyone who likes adventure stories or pirate stories. An excellent combination of action and adventure
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game so far but I'm waiting to see when this update glitch kicks in because I'll be disappointed...I also run out of energy too soon...
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well I love this app. Me and my friend  play multiplayer all the time. She plays<br /> on her ipod and I play on my kindle fire HD . The one problem is that she get the updates and I'm just still on 1.7.1 and she's on 1.7.3. The updates really need to stop for a while
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I can easily recommend this app. It is useful as well as easy to use.  I use it often with great results!!
B005LAIHHC|5.0|The majority of people I know hate this film (actually, everybody I know), but I loved it. I'm not saying it is a good movie by any means, but I found it funny throughout, and actually found myself laughing out loud at a few scenes after everyone else had abondened it.<br /><br />This is just my opinion though, watch at your own risk because I am definitly in the minority in liking this one.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Other is quick and easy access before I go off to work in the morning.so I like the idea that the weather channel is quick and easy.<br />...
0525952926|5.0|So much of the time when you buy a book through the mail, the cover is torn or wrinkled or the book is smashed or the binding is bent. This book arrived in perfect shape. It deserves a five star rating!
B000002HJR|5.0|Absolutly brilliant. Philip is a great singer, the rest of the band also fantastic. Music is heavy and slow, just as I like it.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|It's hard to say this after watching this film, but I AM a huge Will Smith fan.  After getting that caveat out of the way, now for the review...  This movie has the power to bring an insomniac the joy of a good night's rest.  Absolutely atrocious, spotty, and downright annoying dialogue.  I'm not sure whose idea it was to have Will Smith speak as if he was an android with a 70 IQ, but way to go. I would only suggest this movie to enemies of the United States in the hopes that they would feel sorry for us for releasing it to the public, and in turn, lay down their arms. Don't waste your time with this film unless you're looking for a slow painful death.
0143034901|5.0|I confess this book has been sitting on my shelf, unread, for many years. I picked it up on a whim at a sales table at the bookstore I worked for, and tucked it away as one of several books I would get around to reading once I retired.  Well, its time came, as I just grabbed whatever to read sitting in the car waiting for a young friend to come out after an appointment.  There were times when she'd come out, and I'd tell her we'd leave in a few minutes, I just needed to finish this chapter...  And when my very large dog needed a good run in the fields, he'd sometimes come back a bit too soon...  Well, it's finished, and I have to say, this book is one of the finest reads I've ever had!  Not sure what genre I'd assign it to, but there's history, murder, mayhem, uber villains, romance, love, hate, greed, compassion, and entirely fascinating characters.  I'd find myself actually gasping out loud at times, and chuckling at others, and when I reached the end of the book, the \\"Dramatis Personae\\", I realized my mouth had shaped itself into a lopsided grin...
B001FAFO3W|4.0|I brought this movie for when my grandchildren and it was ok just as I remember it from when my children we younger
B0060ANP10|5.0|I'd forgotten how electric Winter can be. His slide guitar work is some of the best ever recorded. On this album, he has a few standard blues numbers that are great to hear again and he does a great version of &#34;Let It Bleed&#34;. But the best is the title track. Amazing!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app and really takes the guess work out of worrying about your battery life. If I get up in the morning and the battery looks low I can check to see if I have enough reading time on the train and either pop it on charge for half an hour or leave the device at home and take a book. It also has a comforting facility that shows you your batteries health. Excellent stuff.
B0010DGYJW|5.0|But I love the story line, and too many of the songs catch me up. Especially love &#34;Hold On To My Heart&#34;
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I loved the music and Rodriguez is a humble, unpretentious man.<br />I like the fact he gave his money to his family and friends.
B000002UD7|5.0|Shopping and Rent - the two best songs on here. Shopping isn't really about shopping, and Rent pretty well makes me think of every guy I've ever lived with, as I think they must have been singing it to me: &#34;I love you, hon, you pay my rent&#34;
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love the music and the words. So true!<br />I especially liked &#34;Forget It&#34;!<br />I listen to this CD every day!<br />Great artist!
B0000026DJ|5.0|Can't sit still in my seat to this music. Music with a message and a beat - what could be better?
B009NY43NY|4.0|I was worried I wouldn't like this book after reading so m any negative reviews, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Charlaine Harris had a pretty difficult task in wrapping up this very much loved series, but I think she did a pretty god job. I'm happy with the way it ended.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson brought together the last part of Robert Jordan's story rather well. People should remember that the last few scenes were written by Robert Jordan and are amazing. What a good way to end a series that was started over two decades ago.
0131101633|5.0|Bear in mind that this is the first edition and has some missing/out of date stuff. It still gives you a great overview of the C programming language.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|It allows you to watch live streams and does what it's supposed to, but it's always the audio or the stream that gets caught behind. I tried to see if it was my Internet but it wasn't. The app's layout is also quite odd. My rating of three is generous.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I saw the preview of this show a long time ago and I thought that it looked dumb, but to my surprise it is soooo goood. I love Sci-fi and this show is for all who like sci-fi. I cannot stop watching and I cannot wait till i get to the next episode. If you are not sure of this show, give it a chance and you will see.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing game you have to get it totally worth the memory just started and already love it try it try it I dare you
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie - it was a great blend of sassy and touching.  I had a little trouble understanding some of the dialogue but maybe that's because I'm nearly as old as the stars.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was a little disappointed after waiting for this finale.  I think Charlaine Harris was in a hurry to get this last book finished.  Not nearly as we'll written as the others in this series
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|THATS Entertainment!  Great  movie with interesting Funny characters. I Loved every character. Every character was well acted. Everyone even the non-miraculously powerful characters came out Strong. Hawk, and Black Widow, where amazing, Loved the Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Eventually, I even liked the flippant millionaire, - Ironman. I like old time heroes!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Can find just about anything using Google. Whenever I have a question or problem I immediately go to Google to find the answer. Easy to use and accurate. Love it!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my wife and it got here fast and my wife loved it.  I would recommend this to anyone
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I love this musical. Whether I see it on Broadway or on film, I never get tired of watching it.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|One of the most important purposes \\"science fiction\\" serves is to make us ponder \\"what if?\\" Childhood's End offers a novel twist on the concept of contact with a superior alien culture and the effects that might have on the world as we know it. Despite the absence of fantastical alien technology and gratuitous \\"blowey-up things,\\" the story is a compelling look into one possible future of mankind. It was hard to put down.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is so addictive that you'll never want to stop playing! I highly recommend this game to all those who love Iron Man.
B000OMD4C0|5.0|Great compilation of mostly acoustic songs and, as with Smith's songbook, very intense. Hearing those songs in vinyl is better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think it's irritating that I'm forced to make a comment.  Why can't I just hit the 5 stars?  Really, I have to type X number of words?
B008XG1X18|3.0|I use the app on my kindle fire but cant open it much of the time! it wont work and makes me force close. please fix these issues so I can use the app more often!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game because you do not have to be connected to play. Its an addicting game. I would recommend it.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Good deal!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is very helpful in knowing the weather for the day. I would recommend this to others who like to know the weather like me.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I enjoyed watching the movie, It had lots of action and was entertaining. However it was a little on the long side
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really like Hosseini,s writing.  Sometimes it is like poetry.  I,m looking forward to his next book.  When will it be published?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Our middle school child's school has the BYOT program which allows him to read his books from his android phone  thanks to the Kindle app
B00AR83PN4|2.0|I did not like playing this game, I was boring to me and I got it for my husband and he didn't like it either
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great movie all the characters are really cool, not boring to watch at all.. I'd recommend it for a weekend movie with popcorn of course :)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is very amusing and strategic! A world of puzzle pieces that build your own reef! I love this relaxing game!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app. I can see what the day will be like, check for approaching storms, and even keep an eye on weather in other cities. I haven't had any problems with the app at all. I'm very pleased with it!
B005HSL626|5.0|I luv this game it is so fun and very easy to figure out. The most cool game ever. If you play more than classic its too cool.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|If you're an artist of any kind or you lack the wherewithal to DO what you've been putting off for so long then let this be your first step in changing that! You won't regret it
B00632HWOG|2.0|Yahoo!Mail recently FORCED me to change from their Classic mail to the new version, and since my Windows XP is not compatible with IE9, which is needed for the new Yahoo!Mail,  my email is now a mess. In addition, any time I've tried this whole year to get help via the Yahoo!Chat, for which I paid I fee,  I have been unable to make the connection. Very poor service.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|Mama is a unique horror film, because unlike most horror flicks that come to mind like Resident Evil this doesn't so much try to frighten you as disturb. Unlike Nightmare on Elm Street and it's ilk, it's not a slasher that scares you with disturbing violence, and unlike Cabin in the Woods (also very worth a watch) it doesn't try to be unique, it just is (especially in an American market, not so much in European and Asian). What makes it so unique to my experience is that its not a horror movie for horror's sake, but rather the horror is a vehicle to tell a tale of a tragedy, and although the tragedy is there, the focus here is not on that so much as the result of it.<br /><br />So, basically we have a tragic event, which interacts with another tragic event (which if it were played out would be a tragedy) and what do tragic events lead to? Lack of resolution and thus ghosts. Now, I'm a little conflicted in saying \\"ghost\\" because you're never told that's what is going on and you might substitute in another creature of sorts, because it doesn't quite follow the normal ghost stereo type with some things that head into the demon, though that doesn't line up with the back story, so I'll just simplify and say \\"ghost\\". And if you worry I've given too much away, we're about five minutes into the film.<br /><br />Mama in some ways is very open about what is going on with the audience and in others it ... almost hides things. It also sort of twists around the events that (while maybe not altering the predictability of the end game) make it an interesting ride. It's not cluttered or sloppy or badly structured, in fact it's very tidy, tight, well thought out. It just isn't going to be quite what you expect it and that is why it's probably getting a fair few good reviews.<br /><br />Okay, so story is interesting and different. Acting, because it relies so heavily on the two girls, is a little bit strained: there is not enough nuance in emotions, and many feel like over reactions. One could dismiss that as \\"we don't know what they've been through\\" and so maybe its justified. Actually talking about what they've been through, between act 1 (the setup) and act 2 (the main events) there is a five year period, which is where the intro credits roll. And in the back ground are like child drawings of what they go through whilst they are lost in the woods with their \\"Mama\\". This is really well done, and although it doesn't paint a very complete picture, it is a really well done and used device.<br /><br />The acting on behalf of the adults is ... okay. None of the actors I would call massive, that's not to say they haven't been in some good stuff, but on the whole ... I'd say it is passable. The important elements are there and Jessica Castain does carry the important role of \\"the scared adult\\" very well. Actually her emotional development and the character she portrays are excellent. But all the characters have this withdrawn feel (add to that the generally grey colour tones for weather and backdrop) and its clear this movie is not about the actors but the story. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is also decent, and I loved that he is in there in a double role, and very subtle in how he portrays two brothers, but given his character is away for most of the film, he isn't that important.<br /><br />Direction: the way the story is combined together with the direction (i.e.: how the scenes are put together) is fantastic. Consider [[ASIN:B003204MQS Paranormal Activity]] where the premise was fresh, the tension of looking for what's happening is awesome. Mama plays this very differently, you never guess if it means to show you something and there is a lot of subtlety, but also a lot of excellence in how the shots are set up. If you want a case study of how to shoot a film where the audience has a different set of information to the characters, and neither knows what is going to happen, look no further: Mama does this well. It is easily one of the tensest films and easily compares to [[ASIN:B0041VV03A Splice]] but what it did with mostly soundtrack and setting, this one does with visuals and soundtrack. It is superb.<br /><br />Soundtrack and visual design are both good. Soundtrack is arguably cliched but it works, and even though there were some instances where I considered that every work that wants to build tension uses the same technique (and it stands out) what happens next puts that thought out of my mind, and its easily forgotten again. Visual design, as mentioned above, is largely grey and dark, there will be instances where it is not and it works well on a subconscious level, again this isn't complex stuff but it works really well.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I've seen a couple of reviews saying this is derivative, and yeah ... maybe it is, but this isn't something that comes up that often that you go \\"oh great, another kids grow up in the wild watched over by a super natural being that can't let go when they are 'rescued' flick\\". And while that is the premise there is a lot to this that makes it excellent. Basically, it knows what it is, and tries to be the best version of what that can be. However, it isn't quite what you think, and once you think back over it you'll see not only how truly sad the events were really where on the spectrum the ending falls. This is a movie that will probably stick with you for a little while, which in today's market, is rare.asily compares to [[ASIN:B0041VV03A Splice]] but what it did with mostly soundtrack and setting, this one does with visuals and soundtrack.

B00C1TOTK0|5.0|Warner's release this week of \\"SHANE\\"(just in time for it's 60th Anniversary)on Blu-ray should be a cause for celebration for anyone who loves classic Westerns. Through an arrangement with Paramount, the team at Warner's has done an exceptional job in restoring this George Stevens masterpiece to it's original glory. If you own the standard DVD or even have an old VHS copy in your collection then you seriously need to get rid of them and upgrade to this stunning new Blu-ray from Warner's Home Video. \\"SHANE\\" has never looked better and I've owned all formats(except Laserdisc) of this classic Western over the years. \\"SHANE\\" won an Oscar for it's Technicolor cinematography by Loyal Griggs and it is all the more breathtaking when you watch this new Blu-ray presentation. Stevens had Griggs use long lenses when filming outdoors in Wyoming and the Grand Teton mountains look even more majestic in Blu-ray than previous home versions of the film. If George Stevens had gotten his original choice of actors, \\"SHANE\\" may have looked at lot different. How about this for a cast: Montgomery Clift(as Shane), William Holden(as Joe Starrett) and Katherine Hepburn(as Marian Starrett)! As fate would have it, none were available. Having seen the film many times over the years I can't really imagine anyone else in the roles but Alan Ladd, Van Heflin and Jean Arthur(her final film appearance). In fact, it's the expert casting that makes \\"SHANE\\" one of the greatest Westerns ever made. Future Oscar winners Jack Palance(as Wilson) and Ben Johnson(as Chris) are just as good in their supporting roles. Besides the exceptional Blu-ray picture, one thing that stands out is the Audio. It's loud and you can hear everything, from the violent gunshots on camera to the birds singing and dogs barking off camera. The Audio(DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 along with French and Spanish in Dolby Digital 2.0) alone would be reason enough to upgrade to Blu-ray. The only negatives I could say about this Blu-ray is thatit comes in one of those Eco-cutout cases and Warner's could have done a better job with the front and back cover art. There's a photo of Alan Ladd in a Western costume on the back of the Blu-ray that he never wore in \\"SHANE\\". Don't know where the graphic artists got that from. \\"SHANE\\" is 118 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.38:1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, French and Spanish. Special features include a commentary by George Stevens Jr. and the Theatrical Trailer(if you really want to see the difference how stunning this Blu-ray is, watch the trailer after you watch the film). Congratulations to Warner's for making \\"SHANE\\" look stunning for it's 60th Anniversary so that it can be enjoyed by many generations to come. It's a must own and gets the highest recommendation.
B00COGXX7A|3.0|I liked this romantic drama. It had some nice twists and turns and an ending that most may not have seen coming.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|the power supply did not work in any outlet.  When the cord was used in a device with a USB outlet, the Chromecast works perfectly.  The power supply DOES NOT work and without a near by USB power source, it would not work at all.
B004UID2LC|5.0|love this app i watch y tube every time ... to get all the info i need.....i love watching all the famous videos
B006LSZECO|4.0|While I enjoyed the book, I surmised the &#34;big twist&#34; fairly early on. That being said, I kept reading anf generally liked all the various turns the novel took. My primary point of contention, however, is that neither of the primary characters are particularly likeable.
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|Coming up in the era of rhymes(bars), it's easy to listen to J. Cole. The first song &#34;Villuminati,&#34; sets the tone, except for the timbaland- sounding beat. Which used on some other songs on the album. That's the only thing I didn't like about the album. From that aspect, the bonus cd is better. Overall, it's a solid album. Was worth the wait.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was obsessed with this game until yesterday... now it wont open due to update glitch.... this must be fixed immediately I am sure many others like myself have invested time and money into this game that is now wasted....Come on gameloft it has been over 24 hours... we should at least have a response to what happened by now!

B002KKCVQE|5.0|I have bought 4 pairs of Teva's for my last 4 pairs of sandals, these are always comfortable. My only complaint is sometimes they slide around when you get the right mix of water, sweat, and grime (even if they fit well).

B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I am not one for love stories, but this one was cute.  I appreciated how the author described &#34;new love&#34; and brought you through it with the characters.  I would recommend as an easy summertime read.
B0013527I4|5.0|Now I do not know how exactly good the DVD qualities are but last night I was watching some of the muppets because I just felt like I needed some of that good old fashioned muppet humor that you just don't get anymore. Maybe I'll ask my mother for these for my birthday. I think the whole collection will be cool to have. Anyways funny as hell.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love Downton Abby. Can't wait for next season. I will keep getting Prime if I get to watch it free.

B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Love love love<br />This movie made me think... and had sooo many twist and turns kind of oike a roller coaster.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|My great niece's family had rented this so much they said they should just have purchased it.  Their 6 yr old just loves the movie and wants to watch it over and over.<br /><br />I bought it (it is very well prices) and it was so much fun to watch the 6 yr old open the box.  She started jumping up and down and wanted to watch it right away.  She couldn't believe it when they left to go home and she realized she got to take it home to keep.<br /><br />The movie itself is very cute combining real people with cartoon characters.  The whole family enjoys the movie.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Where do I begin? The 70s had already shown a couple of good reasons for why they would be a well-known decade in horror history. \\"Black Christmas\\", \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", \\"Jaws\\", and \\"Halloween\\". A little over ten years had passed since George A. Romero shocked the world with \\"Night of the Living Dead\\". In films, it's rare for lightning to strike twice. For Romero, however, this wasn't just another great bolt of lightning: it was a perfect storm of a movie. A perfect follow-up to an already great film, \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" was nothing short of greatness in itself. The writing and characters were fantastic. Something that was definitely lost through time was having likable characters (I'm looking at you \\"Cabin Fever\\"). The suspense and dread were just perfect and never overwhelmed the fun of the whole thing. Speaking of which, it might not be safe or smart, but come on: having a whole mall to yourself while waiting out the zombie apocalypse? That sounds amazing! Finally, the gore. Yeah, compared to something you'd see now, it might be nothing. But it's jaw-dropping for me. It just proves that Tom Savini was the master of his craft back then. If you're a zombie movie fan and you haven't seen this movie, you're missing out on a huge piece of zombie film history.
0156027321|5.0|I was amazed to find that there were so many people who gave this book a one star rating. And then I got an idea. I looked up The Old Man and the Sea, The Great Gatsby, Slaughterhouse Five, The Grapes of Wrath, and Dune and, low and behold, there were about 10% one star reviews for each of them.  What does this prove?  I can't answer that. In my opinion, they were all great five star books. I am putting Life of Pi into this grouping because of one reason, the writing is that good. I know it was based on another book and that the author of that book was not credited and I would have read that other book to compare, but it's out of print.  Would it have been out of print if the writing were as good as the writing in this book?  I doubt it. Does that make it right?  I can't answer that. All I know is that the writing is amazing.  Some people were bored in parts.  Let me be bored to death with no action as long as the writing is beautiful.  Everybody is looking for something different in a book. That's what makes the world go 'round.  I found what I was looking for.
B002N44XSG|4.0|Its a good book for a rainy day. If your bored and you got nothing better to do, then this book is for you. Personally it wasnt as good as Riordan's other books to me.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|I highly recommend this filter for diving.  The quality of my video was incredible (79 ft wreck dive and 30 ft reef dive so far).  I did have small bubbles in a lot of the video.  Part of this may be remedied by holding my hand over the top of the reg when exhaling forcefully with my head straight up and down (diverting the bubbles around the camera and avoiding sending bubbles into the bottom vent holes and between the filter and the housing).  Would additional vent holes on all four sides allow more water to flow through and flush the air bubbles out?  I don't know.  The bubbles did not detract enough from the video quality for me to not recommend using this filter.  I have not tried putting filters inside the housing, but I believe this is a much easier and more elegant solution.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This game was fun but after I finished all the missions it of it boring plus you have to buy other costumes but on when you get to create your own junk it's kinda fun but hey it's up to you so buy it of you want hope you have fun :)
B007T2XC7A|5.0|GREAT MUSIC!! GREAT ARTIST!!!<br />This CD is so different for Nora but she still rocks the house with her music!

B00CATSONE|4.0|I didn't know about Tesla before reading this book. Thanks Sean for introducing the \\"man who invented 20th and 21st century''
B007REV4T8|5.0|I love this Bond movie as I have memorized the earlier years with Sean Connery. I used to think Pierce Bronsnen was my fav after Sean but Daniel Craig has it over Pierce and is pretty close to Sean Connery.

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It's a fun bubble pop game I'd recommend it. The first few levels are very easy but it seems like it's getting harder but not to hard
B000WGWQG8|4.0|Being a history buff and absolutely in awe of the genius of the American founding fathers, I really enjoy these types of films. Paul Giamatti does a good job portraying an extremely complex man, from middle age to his death on July 4, 1826. The 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, coincidentally, within hours of the death of Thomas Jefferson, Adam's long time rival. All in all a great telling of a great story; The founding and early life of the miracle that is The United States of America.
B003QTBT5C|5.0|I love the tracks that feature the singers of other bands, Apoc is incredible, and this album doesn't fail to deliver.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much and my little cousins and friends love it too this is a must download app !!!!!!!!! &amp;:)
B001QEFYAK|3.0|This movie is pretty cheesy, but a good cheesy. It's kind of a cult classic and is more of a comedy than a serious zombie movie. The first 'Return&#34; was better and a real classic.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have tried several apps to provide a soothing ambience at night and help me unwind prior to sleep. This app does not have a visual element like a fireplace or aquarium app would, but the audio elements are well selected and blend together nicely. Highly recommended for insomniacs like myself.
1400069807|5.0|This is the third book about food and nutrition I've read this summer. The others are [[ASIN:1937856240 Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition]] and [[ASIN:1455509361 My Beef with Meat: The Healthiest Argument for Eating a Plant-Strong Diet--Plus 140 New Engine 2 Recipes]], which I recommend along with this one by Michael Moss.<br /><br />The following quote by Moss (on page 337) pretty much summarizes what Salt Sugar Fat is all about:<br /><br />\\"It had taken me three and a half years of prying into the food industry's operations to come to terms with the full range of institutional forces that compel even the best companies to churn out foods that undermine a healthy diet. Most critical, of course, is the deep dependence the industry has on salt, sugar, and fat. Almost every one of the hundreds of people I interviewed in the course of writing this book--bench chemists, nutrition scientists, behavioral biologists, food technicians, marketing executives, packaging designers, chief executives, lobbyists--make the point that companies won't be giving these three up, in any real way, without a major fight. Salt, sugar, and fat are the foundations of processed food, and the overriding question the companies have in determining the formulations of their products is how much they need to achieve the maximum allure.\\"<br /><br />Another quote that summarizes another minor, but notable, theme throughout the book (on page 341) is:<br /><br />\\"On a personal level, I found that many of the executives I talked to go out of their way to avoid their own products.\\"<br /><br />Quite telling, don't you think?<br /><br />While I had been personally weaning myself from various processed foods for decades, it wasn't until I adopted the whole foods plant based diet two years ago (advocated in both other books mentioned above) that I went the route of \\"no exceptions\\" on processed and fast food. This book by Moss, simply confirms my decision and gives me more reasons to stay the course. Thank you, Michael Moss, for a well researched, well written book that should help many people become healthier, as they free themselves from their addictions to salt, sugar, and fat..

B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I was not a big FOB fan until my niece turned me on to this CD and now I can not get enough. Very well done.
B004ODLUGM|2.0|My 19 month old **LOVES** the book (and so do Daddy-Man and I).  When we heard there was a movie, we found a copy to check it out before buying it.  Thank goodness we did, because this is NOT a movie I recommend for younger kids.<br /><br />Somewhere in our childhood, we all learn that every creature is food for something else.  It's a sobering reality, but it is a truth that little kids (the target audience of the story) do NOT need to have driven home with an animated freakin' hammer!  Throughout the whole movie, animals are killing and eating other animals. It was completely unnerving and totally unnecessary to the story which already has Mouse in peril with the 3 predators he encounters.  Even though we don't actually see the animals being eaten, it is made very obvious that this is what is going on and it happens repeatedly throughout the movie.  This level of \\"violence\\" in a children's animation was very unexpected.  The movie should have a rating of PG 13.  I'm guessing the \\"G\\" rating is for \\"Gruffalo\\" and not \\"General Audiences\\"  :-/<br /><br />As an added insult to fans of the book, the movie turns Mouse into a fictional character in his own story!!  The book is a story about Mouse.  The movie is a story about a mother squirrel (Helena Bonham Carter) who nearly got eaten in front of her kids and to help calm them, she tells a story about a pretend mouse.  Not cool.<br /><br />The 2 good things about this movie is 1) the original art style of the book is used and 2)  when they finally got to Mouse's story, the movie stuck to it, word-for-word ... with some interruptions throughout the story to return to Helena-Squirrel and her kids ... and then when Mouse's story was done, went back to Helena-Squirrel and her kids.  Unfortunately, having the whole squirrel-thing breaks up the brilliant cadence of the original written work which flows so beautifully from the book.<br /><br />If your children (or you) love this story and really want to see it acted out, make paper puppets on popsicle sticks or something.  Just ... don't let them watch this movie or they'll have nightmares about things under the water getting them (GULP-GULP-GULP!)  **Shudder**aper puppets on popsicle sticks or something.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Well this app is good to teach kids about having a responsibly and it is good at teaching kids that if you want to do the fun stuff on the app then you have to work for it .and it teaches them that you have to manage money to get what you want.so if you want  your kids to be more responsible this is the app I should go with .and my oldest girl doesn't ask for things as much as she use to she also has started saving for collage and she is only 10 years old.it is something to think about.
0393061310|5.0|Jared Diamond's research is top-notch, and his voice is clear throughout the book.  Highly recommend this easy, and thoroughly informative read.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is a movie you can watch over and over again! It is not just a singing &#34;chick flick&#34; even guys love it!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Another good album from a solid band. If you like their past albums you will definitely not be disappointed  I am glad to see that they are not selling out and going mainstream. My wife calls it baby punching music.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|great<br />movie got to like sci fi it dont slow down you will like it i liked  it i i
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|crashes midgame more often than i think it should, requires waay too much of a time investment to get to the armors my 3-6 yr olds want, and has no way of stopping my 3 yr olds from deleting the armors once they've been earned - which is just a huge additional setback for my 5-6 yr olds.  your target demographic is not my complete family!
B000B8QG4A|4.0|This movie will never become old or outdated.  It is a classic.  I have loved it for years and will continue loving it.<br />Songs are great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I will not repeat all of the other 5 star reviewer's comments. They are spot on, so no need for broken record ramblings. I found myself reading this at work and at lunch, so I felt compelled to add another count to the 5 star ticker.  I am glad I came late to this game so I do not have to wait for the follow-on books, purchased today. Well done Hugh.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Jodi Picoult is a great story teller and her novels are always hard to put down. I object to the portrayal of the guy in McDonalds who molests Emily as \\"the creep\\". There are people who look different and have menial jobs that just want a fair chance in life. This type of stereotype just adds to the abuse they receive regularly from people. I have a special needs sister who just looks different. Her eye muscles are weak from prematurity, and she gets rude looks and stares when we are in public. This type of portrayal in a novel is damaging to real life people who look different, or creepy to more fortunate people. It is a shame that a novelist of this calibur didn't make the \\"bad guy\\" a handsome, popular sort that no one would have suspected. It flawed the novel for me.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This upgrade is one giant step back for mankind..... This new version should be withdrawn immediately! The previous version was so clear and efficient in conveying the weather quickly at glance. New version requires too much effort to see through the &quot;clouds&quot;  please get the old app back.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I was moved by the story of this young man who was so hurt that he felt the need to hurt others. The book makes it clear that he is accountable for his actions, but provides the reader with some insight as to why he did what he did. The relationship between the two young characters is almost painful to read. It conjures up memories that most readers will be able to relate to at some level from the angst of middle and high school. A well written book that you won't want to put down!
B008XG1X18|4.0|UPDATE: This app finally updated, and it is MUCH better. Granted it still crashes suddenly, but not nearly as frequently as it did before. Hopefully others are seeing improvements too! The only thing now since another app update, some pins don't load when I tap them to have a closer look. So I have to either not pin a pin I want to have, pin a pin I can't see closely, or try to find a duplicate, which is usually the hardest of the three.,<br /><br />I still prefer the app to using Silk because when I use the Silk (which I strongly dislike due to constantly freezing and crashing) my Skype automatically signs me out.<br /><br />I still love being able to swipe to the left and right if I want to search for something or if I want to see if anyone \\"liked\\" or repins what I pin. It also shows which \\"likes\\" and repins are new by outlining them, which the app didn't have previously. I noticed it did take a while for pins that I uploaded to show on the main page when the uploaded pins did show up on the board I pinned them to. It was a little strange to have a delay, but they did eventually appear.<br /><br />Although it's not a new app feature, I appreciate the \\"Psst! Looks like you already pinned this\\" message when trying to pin a repeat.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Just finished viewing this movie.  Great story, great characters, great acting. There are very few recent movies better than this (and I see a lot of movies). Just ignore the negative reviews; they're written by people who are totally clueless. I might give this 5 stars, but you have to leave room for the exceptional movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Both my kids (and I) love it. Being able to interact, play with each other is really great. Perfect for allowing them to play a video game where I can participate too.
B002PJN59M|4.0|It was a good movie especally the effects for the 70s.<br />Buy it, its a good movie. I wouldn't let young kids watch this, it is a bit gory.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is perfect for those boring times when you're waiting in the doctor's office or waiting for your kids after school. Easy and fun way to pass the time.

B0063IH60K|5.0|My husband and I both like this game it's relaxing and compulsive at the same time I want to go faster and faster he wants to solve every hand. So it suits our different styles. Hopefully it will keep Alzheimer s at bay!
B00DSY8D36|4.0|I love this app! It would be soooo much better if u could have the capability to look words up with a direct link to a dictionary. Copy/paste would be very useful also.
B00DS13U7I|5.0|Every song has passion, soul, energy, and a positive message. Very talented musicians and songwriters, I have been listening to this album on repeat since I got it. They are an incredible live band as well, their performance at Outside Lands was awesome!
B000P0J0D8|5.0|This is a Classic! Everyone was so wonderful in the film! Full of action, laughs (Brad Pitt) & pure violence (James Gandolphini)<br />I can watch this any day of the week!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Kept my interests throughout the book. Author used intertwining plots which made this novel one of the best  I have ever read❗
B005GFPZYK|5.0|He tells the story of fighting a war on terror in a manner that the news media will never tell.  He tells it like he lived it.<br /><br />I found it interesting that such a hardened, focused, and intense fighting man could show his tender side when describing his love for his wife and children.<br /><br />Doing the job he did and, his dedication to America and his fellow soldiers, I truly wish I could have known him personally.
B009S33I68|5.0|I am about finished, and I'm hooked. It's hard to put the book down at night. I really enjoy the details of the battles. And, some perspective/details from the Viet Cong camp adds to the rich history in this book.
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|It was interesting.  It was different.  It was not as expected, but a far cry from &#34;good&#34;.  It felt like a wasted attempt to make something truly memorable.
B00AYB16EO|1.0|Absolute drivel. I stayed with it hoping to have a few laughs to no avail. This was a complete waste of my time.
1933952806|5.0|Tris book has helped me understand my new camera and how to configure It is a must for every D 7000 owner.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|To me, this movie is about the realistic side of optimism. Lots of dry humor and quote-worthy quips, and a great message to boot.
B005SEXPMS|5.0|Excellent series,lots of twist and turns  keeps you on the edge of your seat and constantly guessing.  This was time well spent.
B009CGRUW4|5.0|I saw this film for the third time.  Like all of the classics (Alien, The day the Earth Stood Still, Star Wars, Jaws, Starman) you come away with something you didn't notice the last time.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Love science fiction, but this movie fell pretty flat. Special Effects, which were very good in this film, cannot make up for the wooden performance of Tom Cruise. Morgan Freeman couldn't even save this movie. An interesting premise that got so convoluted by the end of the film you just didn't care anymore. Not the wisest $4.99 I've ever spent but I'm glad i did not pay to see it in the theater!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Another exciting ride that stretches the imagination.  Excellent graphics scenery and action with an unexpected twist in the plot. Works for the whole family.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Yes it works but pop up ads? Come on now... not worth your $$$. There are other alternatives out there that are probably cheaper if not the same price with no ads.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|This film is a combination of the Ring and  Narnia.  The integration of the animation and real acting is exceptional.
B009WUBERW|4.0|There were so many cliches it was ridiculous, but that's why you're watching the sequel anyway, right? Of course they had to get Chuck Norris in there.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I never read the book, however I really enjoyed the movie. It was a bit depressing, but the whole thing was great in the end. The quality was really good too.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've been extremely happy with my chromecast. Setting it up took about 5 minutes and it's pretty mindless. You're prompted to visit a website and install the utility on your computer. Once you type in your wifi password, you're set and it's ready to cast. It hides behind my television and is plugged into one of my TV's USB ports, so whenever the TV is on, it turns on as well. It streams Youtube, Netflix, and Google Play services rather flawlessly. I had a few moments where it got lost and I couldn't find the controls to pause or stop a video on my phone. Casting a tab (a beta feature) worked well, but I think it has a lot to do with having a fast, reliable router. I tried it at a friend's house and the playback and quality definitely suffered on his inferior equipment. He's looking to upgrade his setup just to keep this feature. Overall, Chromecast is a great way to get videos onto your TV. I'd love to see more sites and apps supported, and it looks like that will happen, as HBO and Hulu have said they will support the device later.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 is better than season 1 if that is possible.  I am now officially addicted to this show and can't wait to start watching season 3.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Time Killers is a fast paced thriller that drew me right in from the very first pages. The detectives, Max and Jesse really have great chemistry from the moment she enters the picture as Max's new partner.<br />The body count starts climbing quickly and the killer has every intention of torturing and killing those on his list.<br />There are many ways to torture but this killers unique way totally makes sense to him and the reader.<br /><br />There is also a lost memory that comes into play that was very ingenious and really ties the whole story up for a wonderful read and a great ending.<br />I love a good suspenseful novel and this is a 5 star read for sure.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|There are reasons this movie got the highest professional reviews of any movie for the Summer of 2013. I've seen every single Star Trek episode 4 times. I've met many of the original stars. I go to conventions. One early convention I attended, William Shatner imitated the call of a whale which left everyone scratching their heads. LOVE him. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />The engine room in this edition of Star Trek was phenomenal. It was shot on location at the Livermore National Laboratory in a department called NIF (National Ignition Facility). If you don't know what it is, please google the L.L.Lab and click on \\"NIF\\". You will find the highest technology program in the whole world. If you are intelligent (here's your test!) you will understand what's going on at this facility.<br /><br />The target chamber in NIF was chosen as the backdrop for the Enterprise engine room because it's AWESOME... I was able to attend the movie premier with some of the engineers, scientists and physicists from NIF, and it was a PARTY.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch is the best. His voice has a quality they didn't have to enhance for Kahn's deep, resonating & venomous voice. His voice is amazing.  All the acting was superior to any Star Trek movie so far. Bam.
B008469DGY|5.0|This game is really fun and is a real challenge.  My friend recommended this game to me and I am glad I have it available to play
B009PU2KIQ|4.0|Having grown up in a household full of musical taste that included blues and rock staples like Taj Mahal, SRV, and Clapton and then throw in growing up in New York during the 80's and 90's with the rise of hip hop—there's a wide gamut of flavor and experience. That said, the biggest knock on this album in other reviews is it's mix and match nature, and in my opinion it fits perfect. He obviously is rooted in blues and a brilliant guitar player—but what is also just as obvious is his interest in other music as well. If you can get past the patchwork nature of the songs which at times feels like a collection rather than an album, you can easily admire them individually by an artist pushing to define himself and music.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I have not played it enough to really give it the proper rating.  I would rather rate it at a later date!
B008JFUN6E|1.0|Very different from District 9 in every way. District 9 was unique, uncomfortable (in a good way), and socially relevant. Elysium is Damon doing the liberal left wing dance... again. This guy should go ahead and enter politics, that is, officially. We all know where he stands and that's fine, but his movies are becoming less and less entertaining. Propaganda films are supposed to be far less expensive... documentaries are supposed to be non-fiction... and political adds for the left are supposed to air on CNBC, posing as news stories. I trusted the director for another gut wrenching film- one that challenged my soul; instead I just feel a sense of blah and nausea. Damon's self righteous blather is just plain boring. He has transformed from innovative to insufferable.

I also like that there are articles of the day and word of the day. It's nice to increase your vocabulary and learn about something new everyday. The articles are quite interesting and great to read. I strongly recommend this app if you want a little something more than just definitions while at the same time if u just want a quick lookup, it's easy to use as well.

B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|I've watched this movie about a dozen times, but this is the first time I've watched it on Blu-Ray and it's a real trip!  Brilliant coloration, dynamic sound, and of course one of the most faithful tellings of the original story of the Prince of Darkness.  I highly recommend this movie, especially on Blu-Ray.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is really fun and addictive I just wish u could be able to rank up  like to be a sergeant or corporal
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I've read several of Gaiman's books meant for adults.  Although this one was a bit too short, it was what one would expect out of Gaiman's fertile imagination.  For Gaiman fans, it's a must.  Others would enjoy it also.
B001AUEMFS|4.0|I think it is a good song but you will have to listen to it for yourself to make that decision.
B00005JJX8|5.0|Why can't they make movies like this anymore!<br />DVD came in great condition, played without any problems and enjoyed the movie, thanks again.
B00C8985DU|5.0|I found Wings Over America, was  an amazing set filled with booklets of interesting comments ,pictures and photos. The including of  the disc Wings over the World (The old 1979 tv special) was some what of a special surprise. The music of the cd's the same as the old vinal package of the original work brought back wonderful memories of what 70's Rock was like in the day. I was glad the deluxe set also had photo's of the arenas and tickets for the shows. The music to me sounds fresh and exciting. Paul and Wings always sounded better live than on a record. That band was made for Live appearences. I listened to it solidly in the car for three weeks. I can remember as  a 16 year old in 1978, coming home from school, throwing away the homework just to put this on headphones cranked up as much as I could stand it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is a fun game.  Challenging hidden objects.  Not enough levels though.  Needs to be at least twice as long..  it was over before I knew it
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Enchanting series...like stepping into a whole new world. A little unoriginal, but very enjoyable! The plot is great- I couldn't put this book down!
0385535147|4.0|The book has a good story line and moves along at a good pace....easy reading and difficult to set aside.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing!<br />It was thrilling and filled with suspense. So I have  finished the second and on to the last one. The ending is very surprising.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME I LOVE THE MINIONS I JUST LOVE IT. Especially this part : its so fluffy I'm gonna die!!!!!!  lol
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Yes, there is a lot of press on this book. I found it very insightful and helpful as it seemingly paints a clear picture of 1stC Palestine, which appraently was very well documented by the Romans. It places Jesus in the context of the real day to day surroundings and while not necessarily challenging his miracles as many people saw these it does challenge the whole media (The Gospels) regarding Jesus. Worth reading!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME SO AWESOME THAT ME AND MY FAMILY GO HEAD TO HEAD WITH EACH OTHER THAT I BE PUTTING THE HIGHEST SCORE UP LMAO BUT ITS REALLY FUN
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I liked his writing so much that I ordered 14 more of his books thru Amazon and e-bay..Read 1+ every week
B003AWRMCE|5.0|Best western movie of all time. Nothing else needs to really be said. Eastwood is at his finest as far as the acting and directing goes. Story line is epic. Perfect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun, addicting game!  It's easier and more fun than temple run and has lots of exciting things from the movie!
B005J4TLQG|5.0|I'd have to say that this was an excellent movie. We very much enjoyed the story line and the characters. The rainforest was used was very entertaining. A must see!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 8 year old and her friend love this game. It is challenging yet they are able to complete each level.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|How disappointing to find Season 3 gone from my Comcast...  but how happy I was to find it available on Amazon Prime! It was my entertainment on the plane to and from my recent trip!
B00A285OOW|5.0|Gregory once again captivates with this addition to the Cousins War series. I highly recommend this book, whether you have previously invested in Philippa Gregory or not, to anyone interested in historical fiction or stories about strong women.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|the play has right mix of the drama from the story, thrill from the cases and emotions from the mix. You will never get lost from the story
B0089LOG02|5.0|Such an awesome book. Loved the twists and the plot gave just enough to keep you guessing what happens next. Liked how the book moved between times. Characters were perfect. Highly recommend.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book has a very good story line.  Hard to get through some of the sexual parts, a little over the top!<br />Really enjoyed the characters, I will read the next book as well. Have to see where it goes.
B004SIP7AS|4.0|As a definite Jane Austin fan and owning most of her filmed adaptions also, I must admit that I did find it a little hard to get into the Gwyneth Paltrow English accent. Not being American myself and having lived in the UK for 7 years and having a very strong English accent when I arrived to the US, I probably have more of an ear for it though. After getting over it though after the first 20 minutes or so, I definitely found myself drawn into the story and the characters and reacting just as though I was reading the book. It is a great story and a nice little adaption. The only ones I generally find are better are the authentic BBC ones.
B000H1QYXY|5.0|I think you have to already be a George Micheal fan if you are looking at this but even if you are not this has all of his best stuff.  I can't get enough of his songs.  I am an 80's music lover and this is 80's quintessential... seriously fun dance music and love song ballads.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Peter is an average boy until he arrives in a land of fantasy. He enters a magical world where adventure and many surprises await. This story reminds me of Alice in Wonderland, only with some darker elements. This land, however, is quite unique, and Peter's adventures kept me guessing throughout the story.<br /><br />There are many unique and unexpected characters within these pages. My personal favorite was Hally, who had me laughing aloud as I read. In fact, for over half of this story, I was reading with a silly grin on my face and not caring who happened to see me. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this story and was sad but fulfilled when it came to an end.<br /><br />This story is charming without being cute. There are many twists and turns that keep a reader intrigued and wanting to know more. Believe me, this is a hard book to put down! There are many fresh ideas presented within this tale, and it is a true pleasure to read. I highly recommend this story to anyone who enjoys reading at all.
B000002LCK|5.0|This is the has it all New Order Album.  Love the 80's gotta love New Order!!!!  This CD came quickly and played great I would buy from them again.
B009JBWOU0|3.0|Pretty good trilogy.  The Joker steals the 2nd movie.  The first movie is good but the third, I think, remake of the creation of Batman.  The graphic novel(s) include Superman and are actually darker than the movies.  However, of all the Batman movies these three are probably the best done.  I purchased them because I hadn't seen any of them except the first and that was a long time ago.  If a Batman fan purchase, otherwise rent or download on Amazon.com Kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The updates are very late compared to Apple, but this is a very fun game. I have a lot of fun playing this game. :)
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|In all a fair SF movie.  Was surprised that the writers and technical (graphics) people actually put in scenes that had major plot implications right at the beginning.  I thought at first they had made the usual technical mistake I often see where the words don't match the pictures (HISTORY CHANNEL should be considered famous for this) but quickly realized about mid-movie that they hadn't.<br />No, won't spoil the plot.  Probably too confusing for most if not all movie reviewers, I don't remember a lot of reviews on the radio or in the papers and apparently it had a short run time at the theaters.<br /><br />Recommend if you haven't seen it.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|So, this is the third John Green book I've read, and it is tied with Looking for Alaska as my favorite. This book is so easy to relate to. I felt what the characters felt. Give this book (and his others) a chance. John Green really is great at what he does.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I read this book in an effort to reduce my joint pain.  As a 63 year old, active man, I hate pills.  As a result of the suggestions in this book, and after 5 months, I haven't felt this good in 20 years.  The weight loss is an extra benefit.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I adored this movie since the first day I saw it on TV. I had looked in a lot of places before coming here to find it. I watch it all the time now.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Love Paramore! They do not disappoint with this album! I love \\"Ain't it Fun\\" and \\"Grow Up\\"! My new favorite album!
B00821OX98|5.0|FUN TO WATCH WISH THAT MORE SEASONS WERE AVAILABILITY TO WATCH FREE. TO BAD THAT IT IS A TEASER WISH IT WORKED MORE LIKE NETFLICKS
B006YG9HJE|5.0|Seriously, you've got a series with Maggie Q in it! Do you really require my recommendations? If yes, you should pass on this video.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I couldn't get past the second chapter.  Boring and lots of unnecessary bad language.  I wouldn't recommend it.  A waste of money!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|These games are so much fun.  I have no idea why I like this concept so much but I do!  I've got almost all the &#34;versions&#34; of this game and I tend to beat them pretty quickly.  I think I like that they make you think, but you have to think differently each time, as opposed to say Sudoku where you are thinking, but doing the same calculations/processing the whole time.
1607744104|5.0|I'm the gardener in the family. My husband could not care less until I got this book. He is now going to have his garden.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show! Can't get enough of it! I love that this show is clean and you still get a great drama.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. I am so glad I got it for the right price. Thank you Amazon.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Plugged in and down loaded pictures from media card!  Simplest down load yet!  Much easier than camera-computer set up.  Enjoyable, easy to carry!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed the series and the final book was just a good as the first, definately a good read and LOVE Kindle books
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I usually don't care for GaGa but this is such a catchy song! Irresistible to dance along to (after a few plays) sing along! Hasn't been a pop song like this one in a year or two! Refreshing to say the least.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Decades ago, I got hooked on Upstairs, Downstairs. This 21st-century above-below-stairs soap is a worthy successor ... and with more than enough twists and turns to make your head spin. The writing is superb, the acting awesome. I can't stop watching and now am devouring Season 3.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had one already and knew it was what I wanted.  It lived up to expectations.  It did work great.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great story, and lots to do! Nice and clear graphics, easy to figure out if your a beginner. But can become extremely in depth. I highly recommend this game
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Boys on a typical adventure rang true.  Huck Finn it's not; though it clearly aspired to be.  Far from thought provoking.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Alright so sometimes the acting wasnt \\"Emmy\\" quality. But this movie is hilarious for people in marriages that have dysfunctional times :) I laughed pretty good. I loved all the fighting! I mean most marriages go through tough times (weeks, months, years) and we get to watch theirs. With a comical twist. Its funny because a lot of marriages go through the same trails and tribulations.<br /><br /> SO if you have a good marriage but sometimes it gets derailed by some pretty stupid stuff. Than you might appreciate this movie. If you have the perfect marriage (or never fight) or just got married than maybe wait a few years and try watching it.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|while the second book was a little bit of a let down, Steig Larsson has bounced back with this one with a tight story and some good suspense. Story unfolds well with a good ending. Nice breezy read. Money and a weekend well spent
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the great puzzles and excellent gameplay. The plot was a winner too. Keep these games coming and well done!
B008DM4OTA|4.0|First I got my 4 yo son the free version of this game and he really enjoyed it, so I got the paid version. The free version is a good preview, but the paid version has more animals with more ailments. My son loves helping the animals and plays the game whenever I let him have my tablet.
B007HO392S|5.0|great cd she is a a great singer and seems to be getting better all the time. I think she was the number one idol winner as far as talent
B007704HO6|5.0|An absolutely fantastic read!<br />Here's an story about two souls healing through unconditional love!<br />Thank you James for this brilliant read!<br />Namaste!
B003U53GK8|2.0|The final season will probably not answer questions you probably have. You can stop when the bomb is ignited a be just as happy.<br />Some of the other reviews talk about how symbolically relevant the last season is and if that's what you need you'll probably enjoy. But if you been trying to figure out how the island moved, etc. and expecting a really good story from Abrams you will be disappointed. You will expect more.
B008OM0M4U|3.0|All I can really say is that it was an ok movie..  Not for kids at all but all in all a good flick
1438509480|1.0|I wish I made a review on this product earlier and I might have gotten a refund.<br /><br />Beside the poor translation, the book has printing errors on multiple pages.<br />Like this on page 77:<br />XIV. What is rv&nfLovia, or happiness: but a7~o~&d~wv, or, a good da~rnon, or spirit?
B0086DBE62|5.0|I don't remember buying this, but it was a pretty good movie for younger girls and I guess me ha
1451648537|5.0|Sufficiently detailed without getting too bogged down in technicalities, this portrait of Stee Jobs should hold up well over time. Am now looking forward to the various movie versions of Jobs life.
B006LRUVUA|3.0|My Dad could operate my computer, but the point was for me to manage Mom's Kindle so they could skype with their granddaughter that is teaching in China. The reverse situation did not work she has been gone for three weeks and they have not been able to skype on the Kindle. I really need to be able to help them as they r in OH. I am in TX.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|Decided not to buy the season.  I don't particularly enjoy the bad side of people.  Nor do I like watching other people have sex.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|I enjoyed this book series for the most part. It wasn't great, but it was entertaining, and I really liked some of the characters. This movie was a terrible reflection of the book. I don't think someone that hadn't read the novels could even have followed the story. The casting was a mistake in almost every case. This was a huge disappointment. I suggest anyone finding themselves interested in this story, skip the film and simply enjoy the novels. No wonder it seemed to flop in the the theatres.<br /><br />Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\"
B004TSXUWY|3.0|This is a good thriller but didn't scare me like my european friends because the concept is very similar to a bollywood movie that was based on another old hollywood flick called mementos. So I enjoyed it in one read for 3 hours straight but didnt have a sleepless night afterwards.<br /><br />One time read and good one at that.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|This movie was a major disappointment. The special effects are impressive, but the story is not. Some of the characters and aspects of the orignal movies that I expected to be represented or touched upon were absent. None of the characters were particularly likable. I think an opportunity to really please long term fans was sadly missed. I am not surprised that this movie was not successful in theatres. What a shame.<br /><br />Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\"
B005LAIHGI|3.0|An ok bawdy, insulting funny-ish movie similar to but not as funny as Borat. Very politically incorrect things in film, and some stupid silly stuff also, but  an okay film if you want a few laughs, maybe.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Fast shipping. The show pretty much speaks for itself so no props needed. Can't wait for S3 to come out on BR
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I was quite surprised. Thought this was supposed to be a movie for children. No. I enjoyed it. Good story, action, colorful, spectacular special effects, good acting, kind of a modern fairy tale for adults. (Stange way of putting it maybe, I know...but that's my opinion.) Kind of long and some scenes in flying thru trees maybe a couple hours into movie is kind of drawn out. Think movie is in the 3 hr range, more or less. Maybe plan to watch it in two sittings. I think it deservedly won whatever awards it did. Pretty much a family movie, but careful anyway...there's violence. Best to check ratings. This would have been great to see in 3D on IMAX screen. Small screen doesn't do it justice...but it's still a very good movie. Make lots of popcorn.
0393327345|5.0|This book is so entertaining and most of the quotes will stick with the reader throughout all of their life.  I'm glad he was able to put his mind to paper, and the loves the characters and twists.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|This is a gem of a latter day horror movie based on a Stephen King novel. Monsters, oooh. Seriously though, it supposed to be in a lakeside community in Maine. A family needs supplies, and there is a heavy mist not far from supermarket where the father and his son go. The mist is still there, and some military vehicles. They go in, and 3 soldiers shopping in store are quickly called to report for duty. The outdoor mist is stronger, and people who try to leave are unable to...seems monsters are around, scoop up people who try to leave, and eventually want to get into the store.<br /><br />Chaos within store occurs, a doomsday sayer riles up the store customers and staff, noises are heard in the store...and the monster or monsters are trying to get in. The supermarket staff and customers try to cover windows, beef up doors so nothing can come in. Through the back loading dock door, a tentacle grabs out a worker. People who try to leave are being devoured. Grisly.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert! the tension builds nicely in this film, but is generally uniform throughout. Turns out, it seems that the military, we're led to believe, was performing experiments and some unsavory creatures came thru from another dimension. There's more, but...well, it's a good scary flick. So, you may want to look under the bed before retiring. :)

B002D0L0R2|4.0|Funny to see John Travolta in drag with Chris Walken as her dad. Funny lines, upbeat music, nostalgic cars and props, outfits, dancing, a feel good fun movie.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I learned so much from this book. One how I go about changeing the way I think about creating,but also the tools he suggests.
B0000714BP|5.0|I love this movie. It is so genuine, lovely, funny, and hopeful. It questions homophobia and rightly so. There are very educated, candid conversations about being gay, the differences between being transgendered, transvestite, and transsexual. The movie follows three fabulous ladies, who just happen to physically be men, on a journey of discovery and adventure. Stalled at a small town, they teach the townspeople how we are all human and we should overlook our differences. Something new is not scary, just taking the time to understand and learn about something that you don't initially like, can change your whole world and make your whole perspective better, happier, and rose-tinted.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|Talked into buying this by my adult son. Didn't realize he had an infantile sense of humor. This was just plain stupid.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the app I play it every day. I love muiltiplayer. It just needs more updates. Add enchanting and redstone

B00B7Y0206|1.0|The app is just not loading videos. It was working fine at first but now it just loads them and suggests that you upgrade to avoid advertisements. Very disappointed in the ability of this app to actually load anything.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|Great storyline and action packed as usual. Robert Downey Jr is the perfect Iron Man. Don Cheadle fits his role perfectly.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|done as far as can ... can't advance any further...not available?  makes it kinda irratating.... clarity and depth is great
B00BESLHEA|3.0|This movie would have been much better without RZA. I accepted Russell Crowe as a bad ass but RZA was not convincing as an actor, and definitely not a martial arts actor.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|seems kinda slow  and no further levels... only goes so far....otherwise not a bad game....graphics pretty good ...all in all ok game
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. When I thought it was over, if keeps giving me new levels and options. I just wish I could unlock the suits quicker.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The author is an excellent writer -- articulate, clear, and obviously passionate (as well as scholarly) in his sharing of his research. The historical situation prior to and during Jesus' time is well-rendered and would make for good discussion in study groups. The book also provides a stimulating &#34;other view&#34; of what Jesus was/is up to in his time and our time.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Very predictable. I ma not much into bestsellers, but had a few good positive surprises already. (Hugh Laurie, Stieg Larson) This book is for teenagers, or not even so. Spend your time on more valuable readings.
1593080409|5.0|These are classic Holmes short stories, with a few longer pieces.  Fun vocabulary, mostly London locales and situations of the late 1800's.  Have used Sherlock Holmes as examples of deductive reasoning as a guest lecturer teaching Sudoku to a 4th grade class.
0375826726|5.0|I purchased this novel for my 14 year old granddaughters birthday. She has been reading the series.  She really enjoyed this novel. The cost and the shipping are both within reason.
B009ZQJVAK|4.0|I love British humor at times and this is one of those times. The plot was Ok - predictable and sitcom-esque at times but it worked. The music was OK, not great - but certainly fitting. We liked the actors and thought they did both the funny and the serious well. The trailer is a good indicator of the show.
1401323820|5.0|Great and quick read. Once you start must finish it , holds your interest.  Enjoy. The price is very reasonable and the shipping too.
B009JBWOU0|3.0|Happy to have the films, but disappointed that the set did not have more bonus material for each film. It felt a bit bare bones.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is a well written book by a genius. Hard to imagine anyone with the imagination to write such a book in a way that will keep its reader captivated!  I loved it and will recommend it to others.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I love this show. the 25th addition has something extra at the end if it.<br />The 1985 cast from Broadway comes out and the originals sing a few of the songs.<br />Especially Colm Wilkenson  sings Bring him Home.

0061122416|5.0|This has been one of my all time favorite books. I gave mine away so had to buy another one to keep on hand!
B00004THAY|5.0|Love Eric and B.B, together.  Both have such incredible voices and play well opff each others sounds. This is insane to make someone write a certain amounts of words for a review. It's Eric Clapton and B.B. King. They could sing commericals and it would sound awsome.
0374214913|3.0|Read this with my book club and ithought it was alright, but not one I would recommend to others.  Wish I wouldn't have spent so much money on a hard book.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I like Bruce Willis in pretty much anything, but his character in the Die Hard's and the rest of his tough guy movies is so much fun. The rest of the cast in this movie is equally awesome. Can't wait to see RED 2.
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|This was a very enjoyable read. People who enjoy books about books and/or storytelling should be rewarded by this novel.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Adds a little challenge to the birds, which is great.  They're getting a bit boring, though.  A break from them should reignite interest.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|You take care of the pets and then people adopt them. The part I don't like about it is that you can't breed. But still it's really cute and fun!!
B0078ZTWP4|3.0|I used to use Coleman white gas lanterns in my wall tent during fall seasons.  Last fall, the unthinkable ALMOST happened, the lantern fell from its hook and crashed to the floor and started spouting flames that fortunately, I was able to put out before my whole camp and the surrounding forest went up.  After that experience, I swore off the white gas lanterns and started searching for LED lanterns that would be bright enough for use in a wall tent.  Based on reviews here, I purchased both the Lighting EVER lantern and the Rayovac 300lm (SE3DLN) lanterns last November, and first thoughts was hey, these are both great.  on the comparable HI settings, both put out about the same intensity of light.  They are identically sized with identical battery installation issues/non-issues depending on your pivot plate, as described elsewhere.  There are slight differences in construction and operation that other reviewers have posted, such as the sequence of hi-lo-off vs low-high-strobe-off.  However, after having used the lanterns this summer I have to say, I still LOVE my Rayovac, but I'm less than thrilled with my EVER lantern.<br /><br />First of all, when turning out the lights, the silly sequence of the EVER forces you to cycle through the STROBE setting every time.  off-lo-hi-strobe-off every time, with STROBE being the last position before OFF.  The Rayovac has some sort of timer inside, if you turn it on and push the button in rapid succession, you can get to any setting, BUT, if you leave the setting alone for a while, the next button push in Rayovac is \\"off\\".  Not so with the EVER lantern, you must cycle through lo-hi-strobe to get to off.  Which means, if you aren't thinking about it, you push the EVER lantern button once, and suddenly the tent is a lighthouse for miles around strobing furiously while the half-asleep wife and kids moan \\"turn it off, turn it off!\\".  And since you also happened to be looking directly at the unit to power it down, your retinas are seared and you get to see stars inside the tent for the next 30 minutes.<br /><br />Second, while both have blinkin' green LED's that are always merrily flashing away, the Rayovac implementation is much less intrusive while than the EVER lantern.  The EVER lantern green LED vigorously blinks every 2 seconds with enough lumens to light up half the tent.  Literally.  The Rayovac green LED blinks only every 5 seconds or so, AND, is so dim that I barely see it at night.  The temporary solution was to leave the EVER lantern rolled in said shirt and stow it under the bed.  BAck at home, I removed 3 screws in the bottom of the battery compartment, accessed the PCB undeneath, and unsoldered the blinkin' green LED for a better permanent solution.  Simple and painless if you have the tools.<br /><br />Even with the green LED removed, the EVER lantern still has the quirky off-lo-hi-strobe-off sequence that you have to cycle through every time you use the unit.  That alone is enough to make me pay the extra $8 ($27 vs $19) to purchase the Rayovac.  For the hassle factor of having to remove the dumb green blinkin' LED and for the power button sequence, I give this 3 stars.<br /><br />BTW, two of these Rayovac lanterns in a 12x14 wall tent hung at either end is a really great alternative to white gas lanterns, with no shadows and enough light to cook or read a book.
B0044KU7KU|3.0|When I heard, \\"Na Na Na\\" and \\"Sing\\" I was excited for this album..  But the rest of the songs feel out of place.  It doesn't feel like MCR style.  I do give them credit for the lyrics and artistic value of the songs though..  but some of the songs i just flat out didn't like.  Very different album compared to the last two.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was amazing, I loved the book.  So powerful and it really made me think a different way. LOVE IT
1932100660|5.0|I like the book, I like the research, and I am a vegetarian.<br /><br />However, I think that the obesity epidemic is mostly related not to food, but to other factors. Yes, food is important. However, I can maintain excessive weight on any type of food. I saw people who are strict vegans and still overweight. Amazing.<br /><br />I think that the main reason for this epidemic is the lack of natural selection due to antibiotics and modern medicine. People like me, who are very sensitive and vulnerable, have poor ability to deal with stress and have a compromised immune system. Earlier, before WWII, before the era of antibiotics, we would have little chance to survive just like those poor guys in China. People in poor countries fall prey to malaria, tuberculosis, polio, HBV and other deadly diseases, only the strong survive. I had severe pneumonia when I was 2 years old. If not antibiotics, I would die.<br /><br />Now we can live, but we live as overweight folks who mostly are not aware of their vulnerability, who are stressed out, and we do not differ much from alcoholics since we use food to cope with stresses of life which are growing year by year. Here is the reason for 98% failure rate of any diet.<br /><br />There is no easy solution. Food is addictive. We, the overweight, are not strong and healthy genetically, and this fact is difficult to accept.
B00CS65QGW|3.0|Just a good song to listen to. Nothing super awesome, but you can't hear it without listening to it all the way through.
8866135879|5.0|Moleskine has been a favorite of mine for a long time, and I love this planner. It has plenty of room for all my homework and events. The as tickets are very helpful and it keeps me organized!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Everything I dared hope for and more. A glorious battle, heart-wrenching losses, unexpected twists and turns, relationships that tug at the soul, and a perfect ending.
B008JFUN6E|2.0|Thinking this was going to deliver on same level of the well made District 9, I went ahead and spent my $10 to go see it. Not really impressed.<br /><br />Not to spoil it with details but basically, the Haves(white rich people) live on Elysium and the Have nots(poor Mexicans) live on earth. People on Elysium have it all, top of the line everything, including machines that can heal any ailment a human could have. People on earth basically have nothing. You get the picture. The plot is extremely predictable and shallow. Too many flashbacks.  As another reviewer stated, you can figure out how it will end midway through.  The only thing this movie has going for it is Copley's performance as the antagonist, top notch for sure.<br /><br />Blomkamp should have just made the District 9 sequel instead, which is what most people(myself included) going to see this movie really want anyway.
B003VANOFY|5.0|nice stuff works fine good for games and movies would recommend it to all have fun with this thing and don't break it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this games is the best game in the world it maybe a little slow but that is ok cause this is such a fun game sooo if haven't tired this game before u need too download it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although this book made me depressed ninety percent of the time, it was welcomed. I like the feeling of  getting too wrapped up in characters and having a little piece of you wish they were real; so you wouldn't feel so dumb, for crying every time they were hurt and smiling whenever they felt joy. I'm not saying this book won't disappoint you, because it will, but to me that's what made it so good.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really loved this game and particularly loved the way it would move you around.  I was amazed at how I could do this easily and am looking forward to another room to search for clues.  Please make it soon coming out with another game.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I said it all in the title, only one good song, which I can't remember the name of right now.
B00563K3DA|5.0|Robin Sharma spins a good story. At first I thought the story was true, except the way the two friends were talking to each other sounded like b movie actors. Then I looked at other reviews and saw the whole title which includes the word &#34;fable&#34;. I have it on kindle and never saw that. Still a great story, despite the corniness of the delivery. The messages delivered really help with daily life today.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I read this book while on a tropical vacation and it helped to remind me how very lucky I am. Sometimes we all forget this and need a reminder of something such as The Holocaust to put things back into perspective! I also learned some things about the Holocaust that I was unaware of before reading this book! I LOVED IT!!!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Its Wikipedia. Its awesome. People always say, &#34;anyone can write in the articles, so who knows if its legit.&#34; Well guess what? Anyone can write history books. Its all a set of lies agreed upon anyways. Wikipedia sights sources. Da ding! Just like a history book. Use your brain, and if its not sourced then maybe further investigation is necessary. Or you can just gobble up history books as being 100 percent reliable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is awesome it is vary vary a sifting and moving it genarly good sometimes its delly good lots of fun
0739365681|5.0|The intricate plot was tied together very well.  Never lost in the process.  I'd recommend this to all of the Lee Child readers
B00280LYHS|5.0|The final PJ and the Olympians doesn't disappoint. All of the plot lines are neatly tied up and the cute ending leaves it open for new adventures.
1455807354|4.0|I stumbled through this one and had to pause several times to analyze the material.  It just wasn't up to the level of most of Lee Child's work but it was still entertaining.
033052349X|5.0|David Baldacci consistently delivers page-turning tales with contemporary themes and wonderfully developed characters. Perfect reading for a long flight. Gripping!!!

B005N09L5C|3.0|The headline pretty much says it all.  The movie is not really bad -- it just isn't that good, especially compared to the book.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Good story about a villain whose heart is changed by three little girls he originally intended to use in his evil plot. It's both comical and touching.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very addicting. its great for kids 3 and up great app its free too witch is great
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Wonderful. The series is the best!!! I don't want it to end. I am on the last book. I am looking forward to seeing the movie.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|When this film was released, I was at a busy time in my life that did not include movies. And after years of wanting to see Slumdog Millionaire, I discovered it was already antiquated out of local rentals. Purchasing it from Amazon not only allowed me to watch it but I was so excited, I have been talking about it and shared it with many. The responses are similar: Worth watching again. A touching story of poverty and triumph. Delightful characters.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I still have 0.7.1 and it takes forever to scroll all away Down to the bottom of my world's to connect to my friends
B008KYWMZO|5.0|I bought these for early morning walks out to my chicken coop so that I didn't always arrive at work with wet and squelching sandals.  I love them for that, and have found them so comfortable (and surprisingly NOT ugly for Crocs!!) that I often just keep wearing them as the day goes on.  I ended up walking for several miles in these one day without really planning on it, and they were comfortable and did not leave me with any sore spots on my feet.  Also great for getting to work on a rainy morning without looking ridiculous in a skirt and huge rubber boots.  True to size.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is so great. I can spend time with my Jesus anywhere now without carrying a huge book. !
B009NQZVKG|4.0|It was good until near the end, and then I thought it had gone silly, but I was wrong. The ending actually turned out well with a thoughtful conclusion. Lots of action in this one. I think there were about a hundred-seventeen or so shoot em ups or maybe a few less. The characters are somewhat caricaturistic, but that's okay if you like these characters. The bad guys are really bad too. Nothing like a really good bad guy to wish ill will knowing she will probably get her just deserts--probably more than a pie in the face. Or maybe not.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I absolutely loved seeing the movie and can't wait for the next one to come in november or december. I watched it using amazon prime.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun. I love games like this! I can't wait for more levels! I only had to seek help on one of the levels.
B00E193TM2|3.0|this is a very boring album compare to the last 3 still alright but not with others. sound corny and seemed rushed effort in making good music has be lost with them in the sound of this album. Hoping they come out of there slump on the next one this is one of my favorite groups.
B007HVBW2A|1.0|The movie really went over the top and was extremely distastful in my opinion. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie but was not impressed.
B000SEGTI0|3.0|I had just seen &#34;Blade Runner&#34; and wondered what, if anything,  I was missing.  I ordered the book to find out.<br />The book and the movie have very little in common other than the basic theme of a cop hunting replicants who have gone rogue and the names of the characters..<br />All the humans are hooked on some sort of &#34;feel good&#34; machine and they're your basic zombie walking around<br />with nothing in their heads; no thoughts, no fears, no plans for the future.<br />Were I to write and English paper on this book, I would compare and contrast the living folks who have nothing much going on in their minds but are alive and the robots who are not living but who fear being terminated.<br />Their entire existence is predicated on &#34;passing&#34; for a true human and these machines have been made to ape humans so well that they've developed a survival instinct.  And if that instinct compels them to kill in order to stay &#34;on line&#34;, so be it.<br />I found myself rooting for the replicants who so badly wanted to live while the humans<br />didn't care enough to appreciate such a precious gift.<br />Truly, no likeable human characters in this book and it turns out the only thing I sympathised with was the goat!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The greatest  book on earth!!! I learned so much from it, it was a motivator.  It shows we all have the IT factor, searching deeper is all it takes.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This song is amazing, finally something out of the generic songs on the radio! You won't be disappointed I can't wait for her new album ARTPOP coming out November 11
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I rented this movie but I liked the idea of a sci-fi romance and Jim Sturgess's boyish charm tipped the scale.<br /><br />I'm happy I made the $1 dive to rent this movie because it was spectacular (and I will be buying the DVD)!  It is a visual treat with beautiful CGI landscapes and backdrops.  It's not an extremely complicated sci-fi...just a sweet forbidden romance story in an alternate reality with different rules of gravity.  It's an extremely pretty movie...<br /><br />--SEMI-SPOILER ALERT--<br /><br />and it has a happy ending!  Maybe one that leaves a lot of Transworld loose ends, but one that will make you smile nonetheless.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|After watching the show decided to find out more about Walt, so glad I did.  Thoroughly entertaining!  Johnson is clever creating characters that wish you were able to meet and have a cold beverage with:)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does everything I need, not sure why other calculators don't come with % key in it.  I find it very helpful
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What would happen if an unstoppable plague were to be unleashed on the modern world ?  How would we fight a war against an inhuman enemy that defies all the accepted rules of warfare?  How would the modern world deal with a disaster that is both ?  That is what this book is about.  Instead of being a narrative the book is written as set of fictional interviews by the author soon after the crisis is resolved. The interviews are with mostly fictional characters who survived the crisis  that had first hand knowledge of certain events. The book consists of  interviews with doctors, military and  government officials as they first encountered the crisis and how they dealt with it as it raged out of control and how it was resolved. Although the story is U.S. centric we get a clear picture of whats happening in the rest of the world.  The author does not paint a pretty picture of how the world responds to this crisis. The book shows the Chinese in particularly harsh light. The Chinese government responded with secrecy and suppression, Chinese gangsters profited from the crisis and unwittingly spreading the plague. The Russians responded with the type of brutality not seen since the Roman Empire and the U.S predictably first reacted with denial, then extreme incompetence.  The only countries/governments shown in a favorable light are Israel and Cuba.<br /><br />Although most of the characters in the book are fictional there are some real life characters although they are not named. The American President and Vice President during the crisis are not named but its clear who their identities are.  In a moment of comic relief there is an account of an unlikely sexual liaison between two celebrities whose identity is more subtle, but also recognizable.<br /><br />One minor criticism I have is that I would have preferred somewhat of a more scientific explanation of how this crisis came to be. Maybe there will be a sequel ?
B0001CNRBG|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because it wasn't quite as good as I remembered but still a very good movie, very nostalgic.
B005ISQ7JM|1.0|This pamphlet reads more like a marketing brochure than a technical document. What I expected was a clear explanation of what HTML5 is and an overview of the technologies that are a part of it. This is at best a brief history of the web, again without much technical explanation  and all the wonderful things that will be made possible by HTML 5. There is never an answer to what the title asks; \\"What is HTML5 ?'
B00AWBNNAG|1.0|I can't make heads or tails of it.  I can't even get it to do anything. Where are the instructions?
B000AAJTL6|5.0|Just found out it plays movies too he is just happy as can be thank you He enjoys it thanks
B007N8RULO|5.0|What a great time waster.  I can do it again and again and again.  It is better than the one on my computer.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is good fun. An enjoyable way to past the day. Very challenging but not to hard that you get annoyed with it.
B004478GN8|5.0|Gave this along with some other Lego kits<br />for our grandson's seventh birthday.  He couldn't<br />decide which to do first!
B001QJUX24|5.0|The Searchers is one of, if not the premier Western movies ever made.<br />John Wayne gave an exemplary performance as Ethan Edwards.
B0019NG7HW|5.0|I bought this vinyl and received it on the earliest shipping date possible.<br />The vinyl looked brand new!!! I saw some people said they got the earlier version of this record that is missing 2 songs, like bicycle race. Mine is the newer version. everything was perfect. nicely wrapped as well! :))
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a crazy good app, perfect for anyone who likes horses. Definitely recommend, it's the best horse game I have played.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book seemed to drag on as well as the last. Still good just not as captivating as the first three. Still a huge fan though.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|If you like Sci Fy - any of the also viewed / liked shows - then you're likely to thoroughly enjoy this show.  Fae, lore, dark vs light, sided vs unsided / human....wonderful characters, stories and relationships.  Must watch!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a great show for the whole family. I only with wish  there were more episodes.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was interesting from start to finish - good character development and very entertaining! I am looking forward to more movies like this.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Few books have recovered from a very slow start. This is the case of To Sell is Human. The first two chapters are quite descriptive and fall into what I like to call the \\"Fight harder\\" zone. This zone is the first part of the book that will set the tone to be used but not necessarily  the speed of it.<br /><br />Take a read and feed.
0525948023|5.0|Definitely the best book I've ever read. It can be read over and over, each time providing new insight and guidance. It is life changing....
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is great, the other 3 lord of the rings where great, but this is better in 3d. I would buy the older ones if I could replace them with 3d versions.

1619698196|5.0|I had read the book but it is very nice to play it while I drive. 4 more words required.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|This has the music very close to how it was in the movie. I listen in the car and smile.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is fun. I enjoy all the bells and graphics. You should give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wish that the people who run this game should bring down the prices on buying another horse! It's like 15,000 for 1 horse!
B006Q2LTRO|5.0|I love this book. I read this book after my divorce many years ago and I was transformed after. It helped to understand myself better and to identify the qualities and characteristic of the women that would make me happy. I'm happy to say thanks to this book, I found my soulmate.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love it!<br />It is just the best! I feel just like I am playing uno like normal with people right in front of me!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie is a visual feast with a wonderful message!  I wish more producers and directors could see the value in making truly beautiful movies!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book tells of a journey taken by a man in a coma, and it is not the usual near death experience (NDE) we all have come to know of people seeing the bright light and all of their passed family there to greet them.  This journey is layered and fascinating to go on with the author.  I am amazed he was able to reconstruct his memories in such a lucid way, but I believe what he says here is true -- maybe not believable for everyone, but definitely for many.  A fabulous read.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|This title is worth reading.  I had seen the movie and was interested in reading the book, so I picked it up for my kindle and enjoyed it very much.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Awesome CGI and great story line. The movie kept everyone guessing the finale. This movie kept my attention from beginning to end....I couldn't wait to buy this.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I chose this book because I like Ellen and thought it would be funny.  It is short read and I enjoy that it fits a lot of fun quick stories into one book.  Worth reading if you like Ellen.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, and couldn't wait to read this book; however, I was sorely disappointed when I compared it to his first two novels.  This book started out beautifully and immediately captured my attention, but soon became disjointed as it switched from one story to another, and then another and another. I felt frustrated wondering when and if it was EVER going to get back to the original separation of brother and sister.  It is still well worth reading, but it's not his best.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It's the original series, so I can't really disconnect it from my own early childhood. Some episodes are bad; some are surprisingly forward-thinking. The picture quality is very good.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is great.  I love it.  i play a lot of games and it is one of my favorite games.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|boring at first but give it a chance, gets really good and twisty. acting was superb! I recommend it for a good watch.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great app!  You can even find little hidden towns like the one I live in!  Love the background images you see for different weather!
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|such a great movie! one of my all time favorites! a true classic! loved it and love it more every time I watch it.
1400052181|5.0|This book is a must read,  It's provides a good amount of history concerning the HeLa cells.  It's a very informative and entertaining book.
B000AP04NI|5.0|It's been a long time since I've seen this musical, but when I viewed it, I was very happy. Thanks!
0062197266|5.0|This book is perfect! It's just the right mix of suspense and reality. Just enough to keep me on my seat but it didn't give me nightmares. I appreciate being able to keep reading without worrying whether or not ill be able to sleep that night! This book was perfect.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Give it a chance.  I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  A lot better than I thought it was going to be.  I found myself thinking about it days after we watched it.  Very good.
0810970686|5.0|my son was reluctant to read anything but the jack and annie books. So, while at the book store, we talked him into reading these books. He's 7 years old. We bought the first one and read it in 2 hours. We now are one book 6. He's reading them quickly, I can't keep up with him reading them.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I'm a huge David Grohl fan and this movie illustrates why.  He's a versatile musician and he connects well with people.  The set with Paul McCartney was particularly thrilling .... he set the stage so well.  I could almost feel what it felt like to be a Nirvana band member that grew up on the Beatles recording in the studio they used when they were nobody recording with their childhood idol.  Great music.  Great nostalgia.  Great inspiration.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Seeing the preview of this movie I thought it would be intense and exciting. Slow & drawn out I love Mathew McConaughey but I would not watch this movie again.
0143118757|5.0|I needed to learn about negotiation, so this was a good basic book.  Nothing in the book is revolutionary, but it does provide an honest method for negotiation that should work in most any situation.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|clunky controls limited features. Definitely would be better to just use the camera software that comes with the Kindle instead.
140006922X|5.0|Really interesting perspective into the historical realities of biblical times.  Sometimes however the author makes statements that may be accepted by scholars, but are relatively new to the lay person.  I wish he had an appendix where he suggested some further reading for some of the historical arguments he makes.  Overall, a thought provoking and insightful book.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is the best app ever it is hard long fun exciting slightly repetitive but its the best app on my kindle and i have a ton!!!!!!!!!!!! I loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove this app
B0090KZDSK|2.0|Generally I like Sylvia Day's books, they're fun easy reads and you know what you're going to get.<br />This one felt like it was written by someone else, and it was rushed out to meet a publishing deadline. Nothing memorable about this story. Really disappointing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good game very addicting. Fun. You should buy this game and play and give me gifts my nickname is FABBulousme
B000YAA68W|5.0|There are several reasons I really like this movie.<br /><br />1. People talk about Iran, and other places, but it is so rare for non-Iranians to be able to experience the perspective and lifestyle of an Iranian; this is a unique treat.<br /><br />2. The traditional, illustrated style makes the story more engaging, seamlessly blending surrealism with a sequence of realistic events.<br /><br />3. On a personal note, I have lived in a foreign country for several years, and though I have never been to Iran or spent much time in any of the places portrayed in the film, I really sympathized with her portrayal of ex-pat life, a complex mixture of excitement, confusion and stress.<br /><br />On that note the whole thing has a kind of striking honesty to it, rare in a film. I repeat my headline: \\"a refreshingly unique and personal perspective, artistically done\\". To elaborate, this is a film in which the subject was involved in the creation of the piece, which is unusual, and I think makes it vastly more real than those that are not. I can sense that partially in the fact that, in the developing nation I live in now, there are a lot of people who remind me of the creator, and this film helped me to understand those peoples' perspectives better.
B001EAWME2|3.0|I love the horror movie Genre I'm a huge fan of old and new I like or love most of the scary, horror movies that I have seen, I mean I love movies like Halloween, Leatherface, Jason, Carrie, Night of the creeps, killer clowns from outer space, Fright Night. I love them all but honestly you don't have a scary horror movie collection without this classic horror movie this has an awesome cast Margot Kidder, and Olivia Hussey wich both deliver great performances. This movie is suspenseful and it's a must have, who doesn't like an all girl sorority being that gets obscene phone calls then targeted by a serial killer it's just a recipe for disaster and recipe for people like you and me who love to be on edge and rooting for the victims at all times. Classic Horror movie but most of the time I just call them Scary movies
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This series has struck a chord in me and my husband. After the first show, we were completely hooked so watchers beware!! Once to start watching, you can't stop! Lol
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|Awesome Cast, great movie plot, I love watching this movie with my nephews I love everything about the location, the story, the quality of the actors performances, it's one if those movie that I honestly could watch over and over and wish I could live or experience what was produced in this film I really wished I was a part of this world or film, I mean theirs only a few movies that really make me feel that way as well as feeling so relaxed and filled with some sort of suspense while I'm watching it, I know alot of true fans of the original know that this one isn't on the originals level. I also love the original I'm absolutely 200% A real true fan it s my favorite movie, but I must say I like the remake just as much I know that the remake is different and I know it doesn't come close to how the original makes me feel but what can I say I freakin Liked this movie as well as the Awesome cast which can't be reproduced just like the original
B006JRY2QG|5.0|My husband and I love this show. This is the 3rd time we have watched it over again. I can't wait until the next season starts.
B001E7EONC|5.0|Saw this movie on tv a couple of times and decided it was well worth purchasing.  Amazon did not disappoint, received it fast through the mail.  Highly recommend going to Amazon if you are searching for a movie and highly recommend this one.

B000056HE9|5.0|My mom have been wanting to have this movie for years and years ever since her VHS one got torn in the VHS player. I got it for her birthday and she was absolutely surprised. It was black and white just like she wanted it, in a DVD format, and got it for a great price! It's arrival date was on time and brand new! Amazing service all around!
B00CWVFPGO|1.0|While watching this I felt like I had been transported back in time to the 80s. Except I wasn't watching a good 80s action movie; instead I was watching a bad 80s action movie..............  Bad 80s action movie.
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|Loved this movie as a pre-teen and still love it now. A text book example of how anime USED to be.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|You should have unlimited games. Too, you shouldn't have to do challenges and, also the order of players is annoying.
B007FH9GA6|4.0|Faithful translation of novel. Rooney Mara is excellent. Atmospheric cinematography adds to brooding and sinister mystery. Entire cast is good.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Very different can't wait for the next one!! My imagination runs wild with this book, the pictures are extremely thought out
B00BV2M9LO|1.0|He was once a great writer. This is not one of his bette novels, and isn't even a good novel. This reads like an outline with some dilogue added, and it has some MAJOR continuity issues. Bad from the begining to the end. I will not buy or read any more posthumous novels with his name stuck to it.<br /><br />I so wanted to like this novel too. I'm an entomologist/arachnologist. At least most of the biology is correct, which is rare.
B00BWWS81S|4.0|\\"Invisible Empire/Crescent Moon\\" is KT Tunstall's \\"Nebraska\\": a noble effort to step back from commercial expectations and to follow her muse to places that her previous work seems to have flown over. (The fact that she's performing \\"State Trooper\\" in a number of her live shows would suggest that Springsteen was indeed something of an influence here.) The complaints that there are no \\"Black Horse\\"/\\"Fade Like a Shadow\\" tubthumpers here are reminiscent of, if less enraged than, responses to Bruce's step away from what made him Bruuuuuuuuce -- and equally miss the point.<br /><br />While many of the songs on IE/CM are more introspective than Tunstall's pop-oriented work, they are not that far removed from earlier work like \\"Under the Weather\\" or \\"Funnyman\\" (which she's also performing on tour). And it's equally plausible to imagine those songs being part of the airy, stripped-back sound of this album. Some of the work here -- \\"Invisible Empire,\\" \\"Feel It All,\\" \\"Carried,\\" \\"Chimes\\" -- are among the best tunes she's ever done.<br /><br />Those songs also work well because Howie Gelb's production augments them perfectly. The problems with the album come with Gelb's overtinkering in his efforts to create a sonic space in which Tunstall's voice and guitar stand out. The reverb and slide guitar employed on occasion gives some of the cuts a David-Lynchian feel, which would be fine if this were \\"Inland Empire/Twin Peaks Moon,\\" but that's not what she's doing here. And the decision to bring in a clarinet on the otherwise lovely \\"Crescent Moon\\" turns that song into background music for a PBS cartoon. (Same is true of \\"Honeydew,\\" although that's not as strong a cut otherwise.)<br /><br />Those reservations aside, this is a brave album by a brave artist that has much more to say to longstanding KT Tunstall fans than some comments would indicate. And for those still bemoaning the lack of a \\"woo hoo\\" tune here, just remember that Springsteen followed \\"Nebraska\\" with something called\\"Born in the USA.\\" Anyone bold enough to take the step she does here is bold enough to take a step in another direction entirely.
0765334798|2.0|I don't think I have missed reading any of John Scalzi's books but I should have missed this one.  It never quite gets there and then it really goes down the tube. If you like science fiction read his other books.  They are great.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This was a typical James Bond type movie, and I liked it for the type of movie it is.  Not as good as some of the older ones that I liked with previous stars, but still okay.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was a quick and interesting read.  I'm a follower of Christ and I'm interested in books about Heaven.  Remarkable experience.  One day we will all kneel before God.
B00821OX98|4.0|I enjoy this programme enough to watch it regularly on Amazon, always entertains and is throwing in some clever curve balls.
0440246318|5.0|Classic Lee Child:  Fast-paced, full of suspense, twists and turns.  I'm thrilled when I can figure out the clues--and never disappointed when I'm wrong. Perfect escape reading for this middle school teacher.  One question for Reacher--How do you manage to stay in such great shape year after year when you seem to spend most of  your time riding buses, waiting for the action, and eating in greasy spoons?
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I think this game is great because as it goes a long it gets a little more difficult with each new ball you must create.  You really have to think and also try to figure out what they are thinking to make each ball work out. I would reccomend it if youlike games where you have to think logically and you don't want to be rushed.  There is no timer so it can really be relaxing and rewarding.  I even thing it's good for kids over 10 or so.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|this game is very good  and l realy like it the graphics are very good is well the rest of the game a  little difficult but good
B000JCSPG0|5.0|one of the best i saw a bout space time travel symbols decryption if you love history and space and ports and decryption this your move you want
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I bought this for my niece on her 1st birthday. She decided that was her favorite gift just from the box. She really wanted it opened, but it was not warm day to play in the pool. The first time it was set up she squealed with delight. It was bigger than I expected and there is a lot of activities to do. My sister said a 6 year old guest was also excited with the pool. My husband said why didn't you buy one for our house, it's a cool pool! I may buy a second!
B002OB9KPE|5.0|This album has a truly wonderful feel and sound to it.  The recording is top notch, the musicians are top notch, the writing is very good and overall makes me want to listen to it over and over again.  The CD has been in my player for 2 months and it still is as fresh as it was the first time I heard it! Excellent work!
B00280LYIM|5.0|I would recommend thus book to my friend Samantha. She loves Greek mythology. I loves the book. I am desperate to read the next book
159420229X|5.0|This book is amazing! Its quite the page turner. I find myself reading 10+ pages a night, which for me is good considering I can barely make it past the few pages of other books and get bored of it fast.<br /><br />The narrator really keeps you wanting to know and read more, with plenty of comedy, thought provoking sentences, and getting to know and learn more about our own brains and how they work and how we can improve them. I would highly recommend reading through this book and getting in-touch with wanting to LEARN and retain memories! You can't go wrong for the price.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|Another very good CD from Elaine as per the norm.Great music and vocals. Not a bad song on the entire CD.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fantastic game! Fast paced and great graphics. I would recommend this game to anyone. I have always enjoyed bubble games. Keep up the good work, bring some more;the more the merrier.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Great music and a must for any of John's fans. Some super great line ups of artists and lots of fresh takes on classic Fogerty songs.
1250010403|4.0|I enjoyed the first Archer book in this series and was compelled to read the next installment.<br /><br />Good distraction from the pressures of everyday life.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Great music on this CD, the mix of electronic and disco styles works very well. Anyone that likes Daft Punk should buy this CD.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I got interested in this series after watching the last episodes in this epic collection. I had to own the entire collection. The theme of this movie has made me want to know all the players from beginning to end. Glad I have it to add to my collection. I recommend the entire collection.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Ms. Moriarty kept me hooked from the very beginning. As I was reading, I kept thinking that all the characters stories would tie up in the end, yet I still didn't see it coming. Beautifully written from the POV of three very different characters. I loved that this book was set in Australia with Australian characters, a first for me. I feel like I've known someone very similar to each one of these characters, that's how &#34;down to earth&#34; they are. This read will not be a waste of your time!
B0072OFM28|5.0|I got interested in this series after watching the last episodes in this epic collection. I had to own the entire collection. The theme of this movie has made me want to know all the players from beginning to end. Glad I have it to add to my collection. I recommend the entire collection. Learned that the actor who played Spartacus actually died in real life...a great loss.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I've used this app a few times I love the features and how versital it is.<br />I would recommend it to all.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I got interested in this series after watching the last episodes in this epic collection. I had to own the entire collection.

B00499QUK2|5.0|If your interested in a well verse show, with excellent acting and spot on writing, this is the show for you.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I enjoyed this game and wished it had more levels. It took me about an hour and ahalf to complete the available levels.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|This game would be great if it did not require you to watch full length ads between every hand AND pay REAL money to play when you run out of the tiny bit of tokens they give you (yes, it costs tokens to play this so called free game).
B005XLN97M|5.0|This dollhouse is hidden away for two more months. She hasn't forgotten about it though. I read and watched reviews for this product both on Amazon and Youtube. It seems like a lot of bang for the buck. I also like that it is an open set, so she can kind of play out and around it easily.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, just like the minions. Loved both movies and now I am enjoying the game. For all ages.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|The light only stays on for 10 seconds. It needs to be 30 seconds to 1 minute for my needs.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|This movie had a great ensemble cast.  It was a sweet story but predictable.  It was nicely done but nothing to rave about.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A different kind of story for me...but the sample just drew me right in and I purchased it immediately to keep reading.  Really enjoyed stepping out of the box with this story. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.  It is short book and well worth the read!
B0074MZSWW|3.0|Bought this album based on so many people going crazy for the band.  For what they do, they do it well, however it just didn't send me more soulful than bluesy, more clean than down and dirty.  I have heard people say if you like Jack White you will like this band, not true, I like Jack White in all his iterations but just didn't latch onto this album.  Maybe with more exposure something will snap into place.  I will say part of my issue is that I am very picky when it comes to lead female singers, not to say Ms. Howard is not a gifted singer, I just didn't connect to her style.
0062255657|2.0|The book was not as good as I thought it would be. It came across in the end as a story of child abuse and neglect. It was a child's escapist fantasy.
B000ID37T0|5.0|It turned out to be better than I thought. Before I watched it I thought it had a different story line.
0385535147|5.0|Present for my husband. He likes John Grisham books and this definitely delivers. He hasn't put it down yet. Thanks
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this app it is great to have for someone that is constantly on the go.  I also enjoy the weather feature
1423140605|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter to take on her trip but she finished it before she left. It was that good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Will buy from again!! Great product. Great price! Quick shipping! I love amazon! I will be back. Downton Appy is great!
B00AQL8VU4|2.0|Not there yet.  I ignore the app and just open a web session.  I intend to keep trying the product every few months, as I expect it to improve, but it is not yet up to Amazon's standards.
B008G3N71W|5.0|Erotica is not a genre I know well but I felt as soon as I started reading this fast-paced novel that I was in capable hands. Chloe Thurlow knows her subject and writes with a flow that draws you in and carries you along as her main character, Greta May, who learns that to be a great actress requires discipline - once she accepts this, she is on the way back where she wants to be...in the spotlight. I do not hesitate to recommend this book and will follow this young author's career with great interest.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Paying on Kindle Fire HD. The puzzles are great, BUT the app keeps force closing. Then when I reopen the app, it reverts to where I left off several saves ago! It is so frustrating to have to keep redoing the same darn puzzle all the time!
6304806418|3.0|Did not like the movie like  thought I would.  Very monotonous, not enough music.  Should have saved my money, boo!
B000MRTGW4|5.0|These animals were all as I expected and I am so happy to have them. I also look forward to buying more of them. I am studying art and I got these to work on my sketching. I live with two live cats and they will never sit still long enough for me to do a sketch of them.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|I loved &#34;Holding On To You&#34; and now that I've gotten to listen to the whole album over and over and over again, I just can't stop listening to it!!! It's my favorite album to listen to, especially when driving!! Can't wait to get my hands on their EP and next album (if and when they release one)!!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love the Percy Jackson series. Rick riordan needs to write more Percy Jackson books. I am really into Greek mythology
B004CURZFC|5.0|Did not receive this item as I ordered the following 3D version.  Do not wish to comment on it, but sure I would have loved it.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Kay
B0050PLT8W|5.0|I honestly can't name a single song off of this CD that o don't like. I purchased it only knowing a few songs and now I sing along with every song. Definitely worth the buy!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Anxious to get the correct 3D glasses to watch this properly.  I loved the movie when it was released and will surely love this also.<br /><br />Delivery time was acceptable.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Kayt
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Awesome! I love playing this game. It is exciting and makes you think. Try it you will really have fun!
B006H5120E|5.0|Will enjoy this move when I purchase the proper 3D equipment.  Glasses did not work and have not been able to purchase the correct ones yet.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Kay
B009WUAK2M|1.0|No plot, nothing but cliques and real bad acting. Go ahead, and watch and you will see why it was a Amazon prime free movie.
B000050HTO|3.0|No Desolation Row?????  This is a Dylan classic if there ever was one and its left off.  There has to be better than this.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I watched G.I. Joe as child growing up. The movies sticks to what it was about....defeat Cobra, blow things up, and keep America safe.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Awesome show. I love it. I still think season 1 and 2 were the best but dexter is a 5 star show. His kid playes almost no part so it makes me wonder why he is in it but not a complaint just saying
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|Great movie to watch as a family. Antonio Banderas is wonderful in this movie. He really captured the feline behavior.
B000FC13E0|4.0|Prey was another fantastic book by Michael Crichton!  When I started reading it I wasn't sure what to expect and of course Crichton provides you with excellent background information on his subject.  Once I got into it I could not put it down in wanting to find out what is going to happen next.<br /><br />The cool thing about Crichton's books too is that they are educational too.  All his concepts are based on actual technology that could and I believe will eventually exist.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Great season with a talented cast and amazing writing. Couldn't stop watching, though I wanted more between Margulies and Charles or Noth.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|The charger is solid and well made.It is a bit snug in both the charging outlet,and in the phone,but I didn't have as much trouble fitting it as some others have experienced. Overall,I am satisfied.
B00847KFDS|3.0|I have been a Fogerty fan since I was a teenager, wearing out the vinyl copy of Cosmo's Factory.  That said, and this is hard for me to say,  this effort sometimes falls flat, sometimes really does well.  In the end, a mixed bag.  The positives are that some of the songs are really well-done.  I particularly liked the two new songs, the version of Proud Mary and the song done with Dawes.  The songs done with the country artists (Fogerty is about as country as I care for), Keith Urban, Alan Jackson and Brad Paisley fell way short of what they could have been - felt like they \\"mailed it in\\".  For instance, the version of Hot Rod Heart fell way short of what Fogerty did on his live album (don't know who the guitarist was).  THe other songs are better, although I was disappointed with the Bob Seger collaboration, felt that fell short, also.  Fortunate Son, Born on the Bayou and Someday never Comes were effectively updated.<br /><br />My other complaint is that many of these songs that were re-done were at the end of CCR's run and not the best songs Fogerty every wrote or performed with CCR or as a solo artist.  What about Suzie Q or Down on the Corner?  Or Centerfield?  Or Old Man Down the Road?  The album suffers from poor song selection.<br /><br />Guess I'd say about half pretty good, about half pretty weak but not bad.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Spiderman Spiderman doing whatever a spider can haha I love this game. it took a minute to get in to but now I can't put it down. so treat yourself with this app for 99 cent
B005XZHQKY|4.0|i was very pleased with this box set. some blur every once in a while but no big deal.very possibly could been  tv.. would recommend to others
1451695195|5.0|I must like that book if I ordered three copies.<br />Very enlightening read.<br />I am passing it along to everyone.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I Love this show! It has everything suspense, drama, humor and creativity. I love the cast they work well together.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Dr. D. does a great job explaining to her readers what kind of mindset we have AND that we can change it if we need to! Although it took me a while to get through it, I am glad that I did read it!!!
B004J4WLPU|3.0|This book started out really good, it had me hooked.  Then by mid book I lost interest because it seemed that chapter 7 through 10 was redundant.  I finally just jumped to the last 3 chapters and felt I hadn't lost anything.<br />I had just lost two relative and it just might have been me, but I was ready to live and this book took me into a depression.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|What can I say? The music and voices were great. It carried me back to the different scenes of the motion picture.
B00C70FG2S|5.0|Without fear &#34;Construct&#34; is the most accomplished album of Dark Tranquillity after &#34;Fiction&#34;.<br />There is a mystical atmosphere that grabs the listener from the first to the last track of this album.<br />Mikael Stanne's voice sounds amazing mixing with the rest of the band as another instrument.<br />It's amazing how the guitarists Niklas Sundin and Martin Henriksson merge with Martin Brändström's keyboards to achieve perfect harmonies for each track.<br />Anders Jivarp demonstrates here his trademark technique to play drums and their songwriting talent.<br />But without a doubt, the surprise was the strength shown by Martin Henriksson playing bass providing a perfect rhythmic base with Anders Jivarp.<br />The lyrics are so deep and inspiring that I think was born a new genre: the &#34;Life Metal&#34;.<br />The production of the album is impeccable as the art shown in the US Special Edition.<br />Everything seems to have a minimalist touch but this album contains a sound and unsurpassed quality.<br />My favorite tracks are: The Science Of Noise, What Only You Know, and None Becoming in that order though the whole album is incredibly addictive.<br />Congratulations to Dark Tranquillity for this Masterpiece, by far the best Death Metal band over the world.<br />I highly recommend to all lovers of good music to buy this album ... not regret.<br />Long live to Dark Tranquillity from Argentina!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Ok never really played this as a kid but I think this game is fun. After playing this wish I did. . Sucks you get have to buy coins to continue playing.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Finally a great movie that's not dirty that I can watch with my teenagers  Funny and just a enjoyable movie
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|My first copy of this book was a print copy for LR3, and I have downloaded the e-versions for LR4 and now LR5.  Scott's books are very well written and as software books go they are fairly entertaining.  It's not a tutorial and certainly not something I would read cover to cover in a sitting.  Some of it I read when I have a few minutes and frequently realize &#34;I didn't know I could that in LR!&#34;  Other times I grab it when I do want to do something and it has me stumped, always find the answer (or realize that LR won't do it anyway).  I especially have found it useful for the odd things that an editor may not even think about LR being used for, like book layout and slideshows.  In the past I have used other methods but now with the help of this book I use LR much more than I ever knew it was good for.  The chapter introductions alone make it worth reading, this book is as humorous as Scott is in person.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Great conceptualization. Tom Cruise at his best. Benji comedy quite well done.Dubai's skyscraper has been picturized in a breathtaking manner true to its magnificent stature.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Glad I am not in high school anymore.  I think they have done a great job developing the characters, especially the quirky ones and the mean ones.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've been told I would enjoy this series, and I do.  Was a little bummed that they change Dr. Who in the last episode but I hear the new seasons just get better and better.  I'm looking forward to the journey
B00969PR18|1.0|To many adds could grand kids not enjoy:-( NO MORE GAMES LIKE THIS CAN'T ENJOY TO MANY ADDS POP UP

B0073Q0DZG|5.0|As lovers of birds my wife and I found this quite enjoyable.  One of the few times Jack Black is funny.  Owen Wilson and Steve Martin are always on the mark.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is by far my favorite bingo game out there. Many hours of enjoyment. I just get confused downloading updates.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|If you're an Eagles fan, this is a &#34;must have&#34;! 3 hrs of their history and music, and an insight as to why they still pack the house when they tour. 5 stars!
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Remember, when this album first came out it was the only music that sounded like this. The lead single \\"Bad Romance\\" was so new and different. In a good way that's why everyone loved it! She changed pop!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Pretty fun game. The only bad thing is that it takes a lot of energy to play each individual game.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|No one suspected Lady Gaga to actually go away from the public eye. But after breaking her hip, and canceling the last 20 shows on her extravagant Born This Way Ball Tour. She has returned with fresh new music that shows why she's so popular! \\"Applause\\" hits all the right notes!
B00A81MV3U|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much as I recognized a lot of my own life in it.  My house was plenty crazy but not as bad as the one in the film.  I too found &#34;normalcy&#34; once I got married and got the hell out of the house.<br /><br />The casting was sensational.  Another Robert De Niro triumph.<br /><br />Do not miss this film.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Like many people I was skeptical of an updated setting for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation, but I had no need to worry. It works on every level! Benedict Cumberbatch inhabits Sherlock as if he was born to play the role and Martin Freeman is the perfect foil as John Watson. Stories that fans know and love, such as &#34;Hound of the Baskervilles&#34; have new life and relevance breathed into them. As for Moriarty, Sherlock's legendary nemesis, Andrew Scott chews the scenery with unabashed glee and is never more devious and chilling than in &#34;The Reichenbach Fall,&#34; which is some of the best television I've ever seen. With an ending that had me gasping and screaming &#34;WHAT?&#34; at the screen, I can't say enough good things about the way this series has me in its grip. I believe the term is Sherlocked!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Glad I did not see the movie first, in fact haven't seen it yet. The book gave a glimpse into the life of a family working out how to live with a member with mental illness. It made me look at situations of folks I know with more compassion.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|A pretty good app. Only objection I have is that it insists that you write a review for it. But I run it most nights. I do like being able to mix sounds to create my own mix, but I wish it was easier to find the page that lets you adjust each track ... I know it's in there somewhere because I used it once.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't know what it is about this show, but I love it. The acting is fantastic! The characters become people you know and can cheer for or hope their deception is discovered soon. We are half was through season 2 and looking forward to season 3. We are watching the original British version. Don't know what the difference is.
B002S45V32|2.0|Dull, predictable, and slow.  Nostalgic to watch these young actors before they hit their prime, but otherwise should be skipped.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great app & very quick download and installation.<br />Allows easy access to my mail and contacts, great to see Amazon making it easier for some of us way down under.....thankyouverymuch.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Required viewing before seeing Red 2.  Don't expect an important film nor a deeply signifigant film, just suspend disbelief and have fun!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Don't gat me wrong....this game is great. But the down side is it takes forever and I mean FOREVER to get the updates
B0094K1PW4|4.0|It was entertaining... talented directing.  Some of the kids were better than others. End was a let down, but getting there was time well spent..
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's a great game and I like the fact you can put a picture or an avatar on UNO too the cool with me. I love it!!!
B005LAII80|5.0|Many people will judge this against the Stallone version. This is convenient, as home videos of chinchillas eating pancakes would compare favorably to the Stallone version. Despite that, this installment really is a much better attempt at capturing the way the character and the atmosphere were portrayed in the comics.<br /><br />Dredd is a hardass. He's mean, but it's just because that's his job, and the job is largely all there is to Dredd -- that's his character's strength and weakness. The other characters have mildly more dimension, but not much; this movie is an exercise in &#34;holy crap, that was hardcore.&#34; Many, many bad things happen, both to people who deserve them and people who don't. The city looks horrible, because that's the setting: Dredd's world is horrible, and that's why Judges exist.<br /><br />This is a bleak, violent, post-apocalyptic romp. Grab the popcorn and get ready to enjoy the strict and unforgiving application of The Law, as Dredd sees it.
1856697061|5.0|this book i can really sink my teeth in! stunning and exciting! i marvel at the skill and welcome the challenge. Tomoko is a genius. I've been waiting for a book like this.
0743270754|5.0|Got to hear the author speak at commencement and was pleased to read this book later. Wish we had more willing teams of rivals these days.
0307474259|4.0|The info in this book really made me think about our eating habits. Gary Taubes goes into detail about the way carbs affect you and the insulin response when you eat them, and although I knew the basics of how it works, it was interesting, and a little scary, to see all the different ways your health can be affected by eating the standard American diet. <br /><br />I plan to re-read this in a couple of months to get a more solid grasp on it all
B000BYA4JM|5.0|Funny story starring Madonna & Griffin Dunne.  He's about to be stuck (IMHO) in an ill-fated loveless marriage, when he encounters Nikki... and things start to change for him before he even knows it... or at least before he admits it.  ;-)  Entertaining movie...
B000001ESF|5.0|So let's set the stage. The band has just flopped big-time with the release of Caress of Steel which sold poorly, and a tour that also flopped and nearly ended the band. The record company wanted something more like the first album. The band wanted more prog and longer suites. 2112 is a sort of compromise, although the band went all in with the title track. This was really a do-or-die effort from Rush. If 2112 had failed, the band probably would not have recorded another album.<br /><br />But now we know that 2112 blew the doors open for Rush and propelled them to rock stardom. I was a Rush fan in the '70s and had all of their first three albums when 2112 was released. I bought it right away and instantly realized how special it was. Unfortunately, a bunch of my friends jumped on the bandwagon and bought it too, so I heard it constantly to the point I was almost turned off of Rush. But it's too good to do that, and I kept the faith. I was rewarded with the golden age of Rush through Farewell To Kings, Hemispheres, and Moving Pictures.<br /><br />The 2112 suite takes up all of side one. The story is loosely based on the writings of Ayn Rand, a great influence on Neil Peart at the time. The story is easy to follow through the lyrics, but Peart often resorts to clich&eacute; bordering on the sophomoric. It's one of the things I dislike about his lyrics, but they don't take the shine off the album.<br /><br />Side two are &#34;normal&#34; length rock songs,  there to mollify the record company who were ready to show Rush the door if this album flopped. The songs are at times pedestrian and unmemorable. Passage to Bangkok, which opens with a long, drawn-in toke, is a good opener and Something For Nothing closes the side nicely. The rest in between is not quite there yet.<br /><br />But I give this five stars because it is such a classic, albeit flawed, and deserves it based on its lasting legacy.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I love movies like this, which are a bit dark... and don't necessarily have a happy Hollywood ending every time.  This one takes place up in the great white north (Alaska, I believe), and shows weak men and strong men pitted against nature and wild animals, and focuses on the attempt of both parties to survive.
B000001ESJ|4.0|Now the heat's off thanks to the monstrous success of 2112, a hugely successful world tour, and a best-selling live album. Rush can do whatever they want without the record company harassing them about songs that are too long and needing a hit single. Just go in the studio, boys, and record another hit, whatever. Well, who would have guessed they come up with something even better than 2112. Musically it's definitely a notch or two above 2112. It even has a radio-friendly Closer to the Heart that lands well into the top 100, something that no single release form 2112 could accomplish. But Rush is an album band, man. They write songs about Kubla Khan and a multi-part song about a space voyage that is so long that it has to be continued on the next album!<br /><br />I have a special fondness for Cinderella Man, for some reason. Lyrically it's as personal as Closer to the Heart and it's one of the band's underrated songs. It was released as a single but didn't chart.<br /><br />And its still not even their best album yet.
1781162646|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised ... better than I expected.  First third was excellent, dragged a bit in the middle, and the ending seemed a bit \\"rushed\\".  But I had a hard time putting the book down, and was sad when the story was over.
B000001ES9|3.0|Rush would never release another album like this one. Neal Peart had not yet joined the band. The songs are propelled by Alex Lifeson's gargantuan guitar riffs. There is nothing particularly remarkable about the songs, but they did establish Rush in the US and set the stage for later greatness. Rush still performs songs from this album to this day. But you are not going to find the lyrical depth or instrumental musicianship found on later albums - in fact beginning with the very next one. This is \\"just\\" straight ahead hard rock that features great guitar work and is a great album if you just want to rock out, dude! If you take it for what it is, and not judge it on what came after, you will be satisfied.<br /><br />I first heard this album being played at a local pool and arcade hangout. I enjoyed it so much that I asked the guy at the desk what it was, then literally went next door to the record store and bought it. That began many years of buying each Rush album in succession, up to and including Moving Pictures. For some reason I lost track of Rush and moved on. But I still enjoy listening to those records today. (BTW - Caress of Steel is my favorite!)

B0042J6VUS|1.0|This is ONLY for iPHONE. This company should provide minimum AND maximum measurements of phones that will fit into this product. It will not hold &#34;other cell phones&#34; unless maybe you still own an old school Nokia. My Samsung GS4 doesn't fit into it and neither does my roommate's HTC One X. Super disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters are great, the drama is intriguing, and historically accuracy are only a few of this show's great attributes. My favorite show by far!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The game was fun to play until it wanted to be updated.  Now the game keeps stating that it needs to be updated and it won't open to be played.  Someone please fix this.

0374533571|4.0|This wasn't a \\"feel good\\" book to me. I know so many people are saying that it is, but it just wasn't. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a really good book, or that I didn't enjoy it. I just didn't feel great about it until the end. I guess that was the \\"Silver Lining\\".<br /><br />The book centers on Pat Peoples, who was just released from a neural health facility. He lives with his mother and his father, due to he and his wife Nikki needing \\"time apart\\". He sees a therapist once a week. He works out constantly. He openly cries. He has manic fits of anger. And he believes that his life is a movie produced by God, and that if he lives his wife in a certain way, his life will ultimately result in a happy ending.<br /><br />He also loves The Philadelphia Eagles. All the men in the novel do. It's definitely a way they relate and interact with each other- especially Pat and his father, Patrick. It's actually pretty much the only way they do ever relate to one another.<br />Even his therapist gets in on the Eagles action. As a football fan myself, I found those parts of the book almost as exciting as every other part. I also remember so much of what he is talking about- I'm not an Eagles fan, but I watch a lot of highlights!<br /><br />My favorite character in the entire book is his mother. I just felt for her so deeply throughout the whole book. Her husband doesn't really appreciate her in the way he should. One of her sons seems pretty well adjusted, but the other is in a neural hospital and is coping with his life.<br />I love that she bought Pat all these nice clothes, and a nice home gym set up- that's what a mother does! Her baby is broken down on the inside, so she's trying to help him with his outside.<br /><br />So many people on both Goodreads and Amazon are calling this \\"The Adult Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" and, in a way, I agree. But it's all surface stuff (the \\"crazy\\" narrator, the public crying, the writing (Charlie in letter, Pat in a journal), the big secret, and the unreliable narrator). But The Silver Linings Playbook shows a lot more end growth of the character, and how to deal with the consequences of your choices. I enjoyed Perks, and think I would probably say that was the better book had I read it in high school. But since I recently read it, I have to say this is the one I relate to more.<br /><br />The Book vs. The Movie<br />The first thing I can say about the book vs. the movie is I did not like Patrick, Pat's dad, in the book at all. But I really liked him in the movie. Maybe it's because of the actor that plays him (Robert De Niro), but I felt like he was a much more sympathetic character. In general, the dad was just a completely different person, with a completely different job, and a completely different outlook on Pat and life.<br />The character of Danny was definitely a different species, but had the same basic premise- a guy that was a friend of Pat's in the neural health facility. However, everything past that was different.<br /><br />In the movie, Pat is only away for about 8 months. In the book, it's significantly longer.<br /><br />Pat doesn't seem to have as close a relationship with his brother in the movie as in the book. As a matter of fact, they barely interact in the movie. And going to the Eagles games only happens once, not every home game.<br />But the reason Pat's dad can't go with them is the same.<br /><br />The Hank Baskett / DeShawn Jackson jersey thing REALLY bothered me for some reason. To me, it was a really big part of the book.<br /><br />The whole dance thing (the competition, and the song) was completely different. But the reason behind it was the same.<br /><br />And the end was... well. It's similar enough, but it's not a \\"movie\\" ending.<br /><br />With that said, I still really, really love the movie, and think Jennifer Lawrence deserves all the praise she got from the role. But I think if I was a huge fan of the book before seeing the movie, I probably would have beendisappointed with all the changes.<br />As a big book reader, this frequently comes up, and it's really not a big deal to me anymore. I just thought it would be worth noting some of the differences.<br /><br />The book itself isn't what I would consider a happy book, but it does make you believe in the Silver Lining. I gave the book a 4 star rating on Good Reads, and do recommend it. But if you saw the movie first, or you love the book and haven't seen the movie... prepare yourself for differences.<br /><br />(review also seen on my blog - beautyandthereads.com)

055358202X|4.0|It would be difficult for Martin to top the character-familiar plot corkscrews and karmic resolutions of the third book, \\"A Storm of Swords\\", which was a near-operatic culmination of two books' worth of personal machinations, often grim and rape-fixated actions and bloody conflicts whose survivors who found themselves with the taste of ashes and bitterness in their mouths.<br /><br />I bore this in mind as I read \\"Feast\\".  I'm glad I did, because  while I wasn't as emotionally invested in this fourth Song novel, I enjoyed it a lot.  Getting to know new characters, a few of whom aren't chapter titled by their names, was initially a bit of a chore after my familiarity with the characters in the previous books - but, ultimately, it was worth it, between Martin's fast and furious plotwork and writing, as well as the equally familiar grim and bloody actions of its characters; because of these elements, \\"Feast\\" proved to be a worthwhile sequel to its predecessors.<br /><br />Of course, I missed certain characters - e.g., Tyrion Lannister, aka \\"the Imp\\" - whose stories weren't told in \\"Feast\\", but given the narrative flow of this novel I understand why Martin chose to save their stories for later.<br /><br />This is worth reading if you don't mind being introduced to new characters, and don't expect the easy familiarity of characters from the first three books.  Feast is clearly setting up a new round of love, lust and war, and I look forward to seeing how it plays out.<br /><br />Followed by \\"A Dance with Dragons\\".

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Rarely do I come across a composition that outwardly acknowledges the limb it's gone out on. Hans clearly took a serious risk and approached Man of Steel with fresh eyes from a compositional and technical perspective. Since I'm well aware of his workflow I'm very impressed with the en result. The DTS download was a nice touch. This is a version included with the package that allows you to hear the mix from Hans' sweet spot in his writing room. Another nice touch was the App that shows you the behind the scenes of the making of the sound track. All in all a product well worth the extra cost.<br />Hans my friend, great work!!!

B00005M1Y2|3.0|I was so excited about this movie until I went to watch it. Apparently it wasn't made for the USA. It says its.not zoned for my region. Really disappointed as are my children.
B001IF277K|4.0|Battery arrived looking like it had been used and repacked, there were small dents on the front and back surfaces.  Although the sellers description did not say refurbished and described it as new, it had possibly simply hard a hard life in transport or storage somewhere !?!?<br /><br />That said, it charged and has run without issue since . . . . Service was fast and packing good . . . .
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|This is routinely updated as updates come out and I learn more.<br /><br />I have waited a long time for a small device like this, that supports Android, and syncs over bluetooth that isn't a cumbersome wrist band.<br /><br />The highlights: it is lightweight, small, has a touch sensitive screen, and a good battery life of 2 weeks, that after a few updates, can truly last that long. Recharging is very fast at under an hour. It fits perfect in the coin pocket on jeans.<br /><br />You have to have iOS or Android....I'm okay with that, but it might be a caveat for basic mobile phone or Windows Phone users.<br /><br />The target goals, and values are not customizable. The Healthmate app expects you to reach 150 minutes of exercise per week, 8 hours of sleep per night, 10,000 steps per day, etc... You cannot customize these values, nor can you customize your stride. I don't know how they calculate the stride distance, and consequently the distance walked, but it would be nice to customize it.<br /><br />Some things are more accurate than others...For example, I spent 20 minutes on a treadmill, after syncing, the Pulse only gave me 7 minutes of activity. Riding the bus over two miles, logged 174 steps that weren't taken. Monitoring the values and walking normally tracks steps with a high accuracy. This tiny device actually has an altimeter in it, and along with the accelerometer can fairly accurately track elevation and adjust calories burned accordingly.<br /><br />Sleep: It tracks awake activity, light sleep, and deep sleep...very loosely, and you have to use the included armband. The armband has a slot to expose the light meters the Pulse uses to analyze your pulse. You have to manually set it to sleep mode, which is annoying, but it doesn't have more complex sensors to do it on its own. In sleep mode, it tracks me as sleeping when I'm reading in bed before I sleep. Sometimes when I wake up in the night it doesn't track me as awake when I'm walking around, but it does most of the time. I haven't seen any way to manually enter times that were spent sleeping if you forget to set sleep mode.<br /><br />Syncing: The Pulse is reported to periodically sync on its own over Bluetooth if Bluetooth is left on. I haven't seen that work so far. To get it to sync, I turn Bluetooth on the phone, then I hold the Pulse's button down for 3 seconds and wait between 3-30 seconds and it begins to sync. Any other sequence of those actions or pressing the refresh button in the Healthmate App will cause the sync to not happen.<br /><br />Healthmate is really passive-aggressive: If you sleep more than 8 hours on average, it tells you that you might want to consider setting an alarm earlier. I don't have their blood pressure monitor, but after measuring my pulse regularly, they tell me I am conscious of my pulse, I should also be conscious of my blood pressure and monitor that routinely. Their Product Managers might think such wording is helpful, but their ideals are not my ideals, and trying to generalize how things should be for everyone results in a poorer experience for most. I'm not tracking my weight through their app, but I imagine comments on any weight fluctuation aren't going to make you feel very good about yourself. Healthmate does include integration for several other apps, activity trackers, and other companies devices. Healthmate can take that data and integrate it into its metrics, which is cool.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I purchased it, and as this product has barely come out, I imagine there can be a lot of improvements to it. If you have questions, feel free to ask.most of the time.

0486282112|4.0|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein opens with masterful suspense.  Explorer Robert Walton's embarkation to the Arctics is related through a series of letters to his sister.  Frankenstein quickly establishes itself as an intriguing adventure, romance, gothic horror hybrid.  The opening would prepare us for a tour de force which, although many would disagree, Frankenstein is not.  The plot materializes suspensefully with the ambitious Victor veering into obsession while attending Inglestodt.<br />Eventually, he creates the monster, and quickly reveals himself as an unsympathetic protagonist by responding to his creation with utter loathing.  The abandoned creature is left to fend for himself where he encounters intolerable cruelty and ostracism among people.  Many readers will find difficulty sympathizing with a cruel and irresponsible protagonist in Victor Frankenstein.  Inspired with hatred, the creature enacts remorseless vengeance on his creator and his family, sparing knowone.

B00C5WR6JE|1.0|Got this on double 180 gm vinyl and can say with certainty that it is at least 340 gms of dull, lifeless, meandering slop.<br />Big Sur is one of the most beautiful geographical locations on our planet. It has inspired some amazing art from some truly luminary figures, so I was expecting something from Bill that move like the ocean winds that sweep up the redwood-lined canyons; soar like seabirds swooping down into the choppy surf; gently emerge like purple iceplant blooms, etc....<br />What I got was a bunch of half-baked sounding limp jams that were just barely fluffed up enough to be deemed suitable to record. Bill's a prolific guy-he plays out a lot and takes risks and I realize that they can't all be home runs, but Big Sur? Really?<br />More like King City.

When Spirit of Radio started, the crowd came alive and the 5.1 kicked in all 3 turned around in absolute shock and excitement looking at me.  All we could do was smile along with the tingles of excitement as we watched The Boys from Willowdale play.  I agree that the mix was slightly flat in the opening songs and then got better as the concert went along.  The HD is fantastic and listening in 5.1 is absolutely amazing.  You are immersed in the show.  I bought it for the videos Rush used during the concert...great humor and my boys loved it.  This is the only band I would take my family to see.  Anyways don't hesitate to purchase if you are deciding...

The plotting is unpredictable, exciting and nuanced, and the characters are multi-layered and fascinating. Well written and brilliantly acted, with great action, suspense, and a compelling mystery at the core. Just watch it already!!

B008JFUPK8|5.0|During The Great Depression two young adult's imagined a hero that would allow them to forget the sorrows of the time.  In 1938 Superman was published by Action Comics and has adapted over the next seventy five years.  The character has become one of the most recognizable characters to date.  The character has had several iterations in book and movie form; including a movie which helped propel this American culture icon to new heights in 1978.  This particular adaptation didn't follow a comic, it bent the archetype to the movie.  Which worked well, Christopher Reeve has become so engrained as this icon that in 2006 Brian Singer's remake Superman Returns became a train wreck.<br /><br />You are probably thinking \\"Why am I getting a history lesson on Superman?\\"<br /><br />The reason is simple, many people are only familiar with the adaptation from Richard Donner.  Man Of Steel sought to not only reinvigorate the character but the entire franchise.  Similar to the approach in comics.  They've molded the character into a very real, compassionate character, that is loved by millions.  However, this character has a distinct principal that violates all other characters- he will always be a strong and fast as he needs to be.  Which means this character by nature will always be considered the most powerful character.<br /><br />All of this information is important is it muddled several viewers; it became a \\"you like it\\" or \\"you don't like it.\\"  Which from history doesn't bode well with the audience.  The reason this has become evident is because Man Of Steel tries to take too much and pack it into the film.  An example would be Batman Begins, it created a drama which engrossed viewers in a powerful manner. Unfortunately this didn't bode well for a large amount of audience people who wanted to truly see Superman's power with some originality.  The Amazing Spiderman or Superman the movie, they sought to focus on the relate able nature of the character. The Avengers who was an action spectacle, with earths mightiest heroes created havoc in New York City from an alien invasion.<br /><br />By themselves they are all strong movies as they committed to a style.  Man Of Steel deviated drastically from that approach, it tried to encompass it all.  This had merit and value, which made the movie quite good but not great.  The methodology for telling Kal-El's origin was done uniquely and quickly, which had a very strong flow earlier in the movie.  Some of the modification to the story made it quite odd, especially with Johnathan and Martha Kent.  They are ultimately the ones whom instill the morality of right and wrong for a Godly being.  This lacked severe depth, which ultimately makes the climactic shock at the end extremely difficult to relate or empathize.<br /><br />The next hurdle was a balance of story and action; clearly Zack Snyder chose the Godly aspect. Really focusing on how young and immature Kal-El is in the usage of his powers; they continually wanted to show how he tried to figure out how to beat the villain.  Also they wanted to show how a structure wasn't able to stand against his presence.  Though this was a nice touch, it became excessive.<br /><br />They also really wanted you to relate to the character as an outcast, which did move and capture this nature.  Unfortunately by poor editing or a lack of foresight the movie felt choppy especially for a movie at two hours and thirty five minutes.  Almost like they didn't want too much of one style, but more of a balance between the three.  So it made a potentially great movie and made it okay.<br /><br />Each time I watched it I captured more elements, but it was quickly followed by an imaginative thought about the direction.  Mostly because they chose to be vague rather specific; which made the plot quite opaque when viewing.  You continually created assumptions rather then concrete evidence.  When viewing it and dissecting each aspect it becomes a more full movie, but as a wholeit becomes hard to rate it.  Mostly because it tries too hard to be everything.<br /><br />I would highly recommend the movie, it was enjoyable.  They imagined Superman differently, they did it well but still could be better.  If you are expecting Man Of Steel to be campy, you're mistaken.  It is a darker more serious approach, as I mentioned above is due to them trying to encompass two additional movie elements to the stories tone.  I wouldn't rule the movie out, but go in with an open mind and you might enjoy it.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps.it becomes hard to rate it.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|That Mr. Gaiman wrote such a terrific book. It was great seeing the world and dealing with problems the way a child would perceive them.

140006922X|4.0|The controversial book is an interesting and fast read. Aslan documents so many sources that the notes and bibliography take up almost a third of the pages. I learned from it but remain skeptical about some of Aslan's theories. It is a good reference for those of us who failed to learn ancient languages.
0307887448|5.0|This book was as addicting as leveling up in vanilla World of Warcraft (just a few more pages...well now I should just get to the end of the chapter...oops, did I pass the start of this chapter? just a few more pages then...). The characters are exactly what they should be: braggadocios about their abilities, as fiercely competitive as they are loyal, completely obsessed with their game, and totally insecure in \\"real life\\". If you have ever chatted online with someone, answered to your avatar's name faster than your own, or met an online friend in person, Cline paints all sides of your experience perfectly in this book. Yet, if you have never played a game in your life, you will still love it (just like if you've never been a Hobbit, you still love LoTR). Perfect, endearing, underdog story! Thanks Ernie! /Nerd-out
0743299795|1.0|Here is something that will blow your mind. Go to Wikipedia and you will see that Toyota got all of its philosophy from the originator of material reduction (JIT) and efficiency from:<br /><br />Piggly Wiggly grocery stores. That's right, \\"Piggly Wiggly\\"!!!!<br /><br />If you don't believe me then go to this Wikipedia website-  [...]<br /><br />and read it for yourself. Piggly Wiggly was so successful that they dominated the grocery industry across the nation and the government had to intervene because they were making too much profit (fair and square) and the other grocers could not compete. Read how Toyota came an adopted their entire system and that TPS is really PWS \\"The Piggly Wiggly\\" system.<br /><br />I have said repeatedly that all of these Lean books are crap and a bunch of junk that these people are lining their pockets with. They have done the worst research, study, and experience possible. Again, manufacturing is a science, not cooked up recipes with cookie cutter processes that fixes what ales you.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|To be honest, it took me a while to finish this book. While I'm a total Gideon and Eva fangirl, I found this third installment a little mundane. Nonetheless, that didn't deter me from reading it in its entirety. It was stretched out too much (-1 for repetitiveness), and it didn't conclude as promoted at the beginning of the series (trilogy vs. 5+ more books in series??). I assume this is because of the TV rights Lionsgate obtained (probably for HBO series), which turned this trilogy series into more novels requested by publisher and film adapter. It's fortunate that I do genuinely adore the characters and the storyline enough to rate this fairly.<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br />The encouraging elements that amended my thoughts of this novel were: definitely the marriage of Gideon and Eva in the Tropics, alone (so romantic); Mark finally coughed up the courage to ask Stephen to marry him (so cute the way he blurted it out); the whole tragedy in Eva's childhood involving Nathan, and the reaction of Eva's Dad when he finds out her dark secrets (he so loves her); and most deserving (after all, that's what attracted me to the series in the first place), the incessantly passionate copulation and love Gideon and Eva immerse themselves into time and time again (if only I could live in the Crossfire series for a day, I would die happy *sigh*)! They really are one in being; they survive and thrive on such unbelievably overwhelming passion (I'm such a girl...oh-hum). So, I'm signing off with this being my last of the series (even though there are continuing novels) because in my own incredible fantasy otherworld, Gideon and Eva live happily-ever-after in their marriage. The End.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really loved this movie. The characters were very believable and I was just sad it seemed to end too quickly.

071815780X|5.0|I am a 45 year old woman with a crazy-busy job and because I've never really learned to cook, I had a huge amount of fear and anxiety about cooking.  I was eating canned chili and Lean Cuisines all the time (when I wasn't going out to eat).  I finally got tired of getting grief from my friends about not cooking - and was feeling a bit guilty that various friends had had me over for dinner hundreds of times and I never contributed anything beyond a nice bottle of wine or dessert.<br /><br />I decided to try to learn to cook and a friend who's a very ambitious cook suggested this book.  I have to tell you, it's changed my whole life!  This is a great book for someone with no cooking self-confidence and little experience.  For the past 7 months I've been cooking about 1 recipe each week, and I'm really enjoying it - and my cooking self-confidence is growing fast.  I now bring delicious and healthy meals with me to work, and I honestly feel a lot better physically now that I'm eating much less processed food (and I'm a big processed food lover, so that's really saying something!)<br /><br />The directions are fairly easy to follow, unintimidating, and clear.  The meals turn out delicious, almost without exception.  I'm a picky eater but I've been able to find lots of dishes I would want to eat in this book.<br /><br />A few caveats:  This is a UK-published book so you will need to convert amounts quite frequently.  This is super-easy to do using the internet.  Also because it's a UK-published book, Jamie includes some ingredients that are difficult to find in the US (Puy lentils and English mustard powder, to name a few, though I've been pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to find certain ingredients that I thought were obscure, right in my own small local supermarket).  It's actually been fun trying to find the various ingredients around town.  There are some ingredients listed by their UK names (passata, which is tomato puree; aubergines, which are eggplants - youget the picture) - again, you can clear this up in moments using the internet.  In the UK, they measure ingredients using weight rather than solid measurements a lot of the time, so it helps to get an inexpensive food scale.  Also, if you are a very beginner-level cook, you may not have some of the tools, pans, etc. that you need to make some of these recipes quickly - since December I've acquired a food processor, a cast-iron grill pan, and a big casserole dish.  But these are things every kitchen really needs and they'll last forever, so I've been happy to buy them.<br /><br />Biggest caveat:  I've never been able to make any of these recipes in under 35 minutes, and usually it's a bit more than that (though getting quicker as my skills and anxiety improve).  This is not a big deal to me, since I have sorted slated cooking as my Sunday evening activity so there's not much time pressure, and 35 minutes is still not a very long time to spend to make a delicious meal.  And it probably takes me a bit longer because I'm fundamentally quite inept in the kitchen, so don't let this deter you!<br /><br />Seriously: if you're a non-cook but you want to start, buy this book.  You'll be really happy you did!

0756405890|5.0|I'll admit, I'm only 50 pages into this book. My mind is blown. I've read hundreds of fantasy novels over the years, and honestly, they've started to blend together. This is the most beautifully written book I've seen in years. The author isn't flowery in his descriptions. Instead, he uses a few words to paint a more vivid, poignant picture then most authors could do in a paragraph. I read the intro, blinked, and immediately had to read it again. I can't remember the last time I stopped to savor each and every sentence in a book. He describes a silence as \\"the patient, cut-flower sound of a man waiting to die.\\" and describes a mans eyes like \\"ice at the bottom of a well\\". I'm completely in love with this book. If you love fantasy, love the English language, or just love a great story- read this book. Seriously.
B004F1F32A|5.0|saw it at the theatre, which I rarely do, and liked it enough to pay to watch it stream.  excellent action movie.  highly recommended
147674355X|4.0|I loved this book! It was very entertaining and I loved the authors writing style, found it hard to put down. My favorite things about this book is that it never got boring, there were several different things in the plot going on, and the author didnt skimp on the sex scenes but at the same time it wasnt distasteful. A lot of the times authors are either too vague when describing the scene, leaving the reader wanting to know more, or theyre TOO descriptive and it turns the reader off. Colleen Hoover found the perfect balance between the two. I also loved how she jumped from the past to the present, leaving the big reveal for the end of the book.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|What an abnosome concept for a television show! Beginning with the abnosome doe-eyed Sam Winchester and his absomely handsome brother Dean Winchester, the show follows The X Files-type monster-of-the-week style with writing, directing and cinematography that are, simply put, abnosome.<br /><br />Season 1 of the abnosome show 'Supernatural' gets five stars from me, though it could only be improved by the addition of actor-turned-word connoisseur Misha Collins in later seasons. Rewatching from Season 1, I long for Collin's abnosome hairection, and mysteriously sexy upper lip.

B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|This guide is an awesome account of the remake of the 1932 movie \\"Scarface\\" directed by Howard Hawkes and produced by Howard Hughes, based on the 1929 novel by Maurice Coons writing as Armitage Trail. The 1983 version, starring Al Pacino, was promoted to Universal Studios by Marty Bregman. The first screenplay was written by Brian DePalma and David Rabe which met some dissatisfaction, and thus Sidney Lumet and Oliver Stone were their replacements. Sidney Lumet's idea was to feature Miami as the location and to address drug trafficking which was at an all time high at the time in southern Florida.  This, in itself, came with some concerns by politicians which is a close-up-shot of just how difficult it would be to film it in Miami.  The gangsters, rather than Chicago or New York types, are Latino, the first time ever for a major film. The two movies share the same plot, characters and both are incredibly violent.  Author Stevenson states the 1932 version spewed more bullets, whereas the 1983 version spewed more bloody scenes.  Much research was personally conducted by Oliver Stone with not only law enforcement agencies, but also actual drug runners.  This guide reveals so many hurdles which filmmakers went through to get \\"Scarface\\" on the screen. The 1983 movie was the defining role for Pacino and launched him into a higher level of his career.  The author also points out many faux pas throughout the film which are humorous; watch the movie again and see if you can catch all he points out.  The guide also reveals the movie as a three-act play, giving brief highlights of each act, musical scores, and describing some props/effects. It is apparent the author has in-depth knowledge and research talents to write such a concise and awesome guide. Damian Stevenson is a brilliant writer, a master in his field, and very analytical.  Having never seen the movie, I was inspired to do so.  I bought and downloaded the HD version onto my Kindle Fire.  You'll want to see the movie again after reading this great entertaining guide.again after reading this great entertaining guide.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|Simply put, the book is long, wordy, and seems to go nowhere. Everything ends in obnoxious cliffhangers so there's no sense of closure, just frustration.<br /><br />Some of the characters I was most interested in (i.e. Bran) get almost no mention. I read in an interview where GRRM said that Bran's chapters were some of the hardest to write because of the magical elements... so I guess he fixed that by just not writing any.<br /><br />I wonder how HBO will turn this and book 4 into functioning seasons, because the events related in their combined 2000 pages don't offer much of the breakneck pacing and excitement the show is known for.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Fast read. Inspirational. Well written with many points to contemplate. I will definitely order and read other books by this author.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|There are so many fantastic reviews on here already, I'll simply say I found the prose very flowery and the plot seemed to meander on to nowhere in particular.<br /><br />My favorite chapters were Cersei's by far. Jaime's were the next most compelling for me.<br /><br />I didn't like how there's no sense of closure when the book is over, and wonder how HBO will choose what to use and what to change in future seasons to keep the show moving at the brisk pace of the first three seasons.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Sometimes when you watch episodes of a TV show back-to-back, you pick up on the 'formula' and the writing flaws and then the show becomes unwatchable after about two seasons.  Not so with Downton Abbey, always interesting and I always want to know what's going to happen next.

I suppose its to late now to contact the seller about this issue, plus i don't want to be bothered shipping back a speaker. at lower volumes though it is fine and i have done a lot of mixing with these monitors. you can ajust the bass and tremble plus it has a few diffrent inputs on the back for you to choose from including optical. they held up pretty good besides that odd rattle noise at high volumes. I like these speakers but im not sure if i would risk buying them again or just save more money for better monitors.

B000F0UUIM|5.0|I love how John Ford's classic Western, `The Searchers' is considered by many to be the GREATEST Western of all time, and yet it was completely snubbed by Oscar back in 1956.  Not one nomination, not even for that glorious cinematography.  Not that film should be graded according to their Oscar success, but it is an odd thing to see an English film this heavily regarded completely Oscarless.  When you consider that John Ford was right up Oscar's ally, it becomes all the more confusing.  Sight unseen, it was a weird fact.  Having seen the film, it's all the stranger.<br /><br />This is a great movie!<br /><br />I'm not a giant fan of the Western or of John Wayne, but in all honesty this could very well be the crowning achievement for both the genre and the actor.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a confederate veteran who has a deeply rooted hatred for the Cherokee people who becomes drawn into the search for his young niece who was kidnapped by Comanches.  Tagging along in his search is Martin Pawley, the adopted brother to the kidnapped who just so happens to be half Cherokee and also happens to have a past with Ethan.  The two butt-heads the whole way, mainly because of Ethan's gruff exterior and blind hatred and racism, but eventually things begin to soften and the heart of these men is exposed.<br /><br />The evolution of Ethan, while not always pretty, is a really smart and insightful look at the horrible effect that racism and a calloused heart can have on someone.  The film's climax and the eventual revelation of the kidnapped niece and Ethan's surprising reaction to her is astonishing and really colors in all of the edges to this `at times' mysterious presence.  Wayne's performance is wonderful.  I truly didn't expect anything great from him (mostly because he seemed to regurgitate the same performance over and over) but here he adds so much depth to Ethan and unravels those layers magnificently.  Jeffery Hunter is the film's low point though.  His uneven performance and use of dramatics is hard to stomach at times.  Thankfully, he is swallowed up in the grandeur of the scenes and Wayne's remarkable grounded performance.<br /><br />From a technical angle, this movie is nearly flawless.  It is the story that really makes this so wonderful.  Yes, it has some dated perceptions and is a victim of the `times' as it were, especially in the treatment of the `savages', but the balance act with Ethan's character helps reign in those criticisms, because it loses a `one note' or `one sided' aspect and gains another layer.en performance and use of dramatics is hard to stomach at times.

B006UIUJ2A|4.0|brilliantly structured. At first I thought I was reading a story in front of another story or hiding behind a story which is maybe exactly what I was supposed to feel, but the sense of triumph over a system that was dehumanising and stripped of all individualism was very satisfying. Thank god there was that because the description of life in North Korea was so grim, cruel and depersonalising in the most sinister way.
B00004RFFS|1.0|I'm going to get crucified for this, considering that this film has its legions of devoted fans, but I found this to be one of the worst films I've ever laid my eyes on.  Yes, the production values are astonishing in parts and Kirsten Dunst delivers a remarkable child performance, but outside of those two aspects I found the delivery of what could have been an intriguing and unique story to be so uneven and calculated that it lost all impact and become underwhelming and unbearable.<br /><br />And stupid.<br /><br />Personally, I found this really hard to get into.  I know many fans of the novel, and Rice's contributions to literature in general.  I'm not her target audience, I know that.  I'm not a follower, I've never read her work and the whole vampire craze is lost on me.  That being said, I do enjoy movies of all genres and so for me the themes and subject would not be an issue if the film were constructed well.  Instead, this brooding piece of boredom misses so many golden opportunities and winds up being a nonsensical mess that fails to capitalize on all the potential it has.  The story itself is rather intriguing, but Neil Jordan fails to do anything exciting with the material.  Instead, he cuts back and forth and serves up segments of scenes that are supposed to create a whole but wind up becoming rather lost in this sea of mundane.  The tone of the film is so low-key that it winds up being horribly boring and uneventful, even in the moments of supposed high intensity.<br /><br />Another detractor is the uneven performances.  Brad Pitt plays Louis as if he was sleepwalking through the film, and Tom Cruise is so over the top eccentric that the two feel as if they were in two separate films altogether.  As mismatched as they are, Antonio Bandaras takes the film to a whole new low when he pops up.  A truly ridiculous performance and in fact, his whole segment just feels so soap opera cheap.  At least Kirstin Dunst serves up some savage realness.  It's a tremendous performance trapped in a terrible movie.ous performance trapped in a terrible movie.
0765325950|5.0|An intense and epic conclusion. This is one of the most engaging books I have ever read. The story doesn't let you catch your breath for a single page, you just have to keep reading! I've been waiting for it for a very long time, and must say that I am not disappointed with the end result.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|For a first novel, it was quite well constructed....few non-sequeters in plot, interesting use of humor and quite eloquent language imagery.<br />I liked the building of the plot.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn scores again! His sensitive treatment of his characters and his justified anger at &#34;politics&#34; as a substitute for &#34;statesmanship,&#34; scores a bulls-eye!
B0061HZWTU|5.0|Wonderful film.  Never gets old.  Story line is timeless.  The Aussies know how to make films that reach the heart!
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|If you like Tetris then give it a try.  It is an okay game, but I don't play it like I do Tetris.  Do the endless mode to get the hang of it.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|This book was poorly edited. There are grammatical and punctuation errors throughout. For me, this detracts from even the best book.<br />  The story line is cute but moves awfully fast. I was unable to really connect with any of the characters because of this. It was a free book, so I cannot complain too much, but I would not recommend this book.
B0061S0A64|4.0|I have taken music lessons, but am in now way a musician.  The app appears to have lots of different notes and keys for use.  Can change the tempo.  Worth trying out in my opinion
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|I bought Carl to give as a present to a friend. Well, it was a success! It is a well-made vinyl figure that stands on its own and gives hours and hours of enjoyment if placed on a working area.  My friend has hers next to her monitor, every time she looks at Carl, she tells me she cannot help but smile.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|This works well on my Asus tablet.  It is a solid Sudoku game.  if you are looking for on give this a try.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|This is a novel about two US Marshals investigating an escape from a psychiatric institution for the criminally insane, situated on an island outside Boston. As Teddy and Chuck dig into what has been happening, it becomes clear that Shutter Island hides a bigger secret. A secret that might even put the two officers in danger. And to make it worse, the storm of the century is on its way.<br /><br />I would categorize this novel as a mystery thriller. And I always judge those kind of books by the length in which the author is able to hide the truth from me. I find Dennis Lehane being a master of deceptions. He tells you when he is ready, and when you are told, you do not know if it is the truth. (There are names for people like that)<br />But when the last page is turned, you know you have read something really good. Definitely a story to remember.<br /><br />If possible, read the book before you see the film from 2009. (Starring Leonardo DeCaprio)<br />I think I would have given this book five stars if I had not seen the film first.
B00AKO93JK|3.0|I don't use it much.  It looks like an alright app.  Has some different workouts and illustrations.  It is worth a shot for those who work out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love the book!! You should read all the books before you see the movie the book is so better than the movie
B00C0UHGLO|4.0|If you like checkers, chess, and others &#34;like go&#34; then get this.  Based on claiming territory instead of pieces.  Works well.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This is such a cute little book! I can't wait to collect the whole series! I'll save them for my kids & grandkids!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|any app that is Mahjong already has my vote if it runs right and is fluid.  This is a great app.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|A nice app and it was free!<br />Does what it says, a fairly easy to use interface.<br />Would easily recommend.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|Spent a lot of time in the hospital as of late.  Having some noise in the background help me calm down and sleep.  Great white noise app.  There is a &#34;pro&#34; or extended version once you download the app that adds a bunch to it.  It is free, you just have to give them more access.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful show with a wonderful cast.  It is very realistic and the costumes are amazing.  I recommend this show for anyone interested in historical England.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I can not get it to work. I have tried everything to get it to work and nothing! It makes me want to throw my Kindle
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I am addicted to Match Three Games.  This game actually has a beginning and an end unlike so many Match Three Games that go on forever.  I have played this game over and over again and never get tired of it.  The tutorial is wonderful and there is a &#34;hint&#34; button if you get stuck.  Your biggest challenge is to beat the clock.  It can be done, although the higher levels may take you a few attempts.  Definitely worth the cost.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Developer released an update today 8-17-2013, along with an apology about app not saving.  It now works great and since support did get back to me though update was released a day late, but hey they took care of the problem.<br /> So apology accepted on my part.<br />It is now a great product & fun to use.<br /> A big 5 stars from me now.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|This is a fun little game.  Graphics are great.  Don't use the sound because it drives my husband nuts.  I just wish there was a help link for when you get stuck.  Once you're stuck on a level you are there for ever.  No way to figure out how to solve the level.  Get's very frustrating at least for me.
B00E193TM2|4.0|This one is heavy guys and gals but i love it. The 1st song which was the single released with Rob Halford singing in. It only gets better from there.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is fun and the screen can change if yhu want it to.. my favorite thing is when you put it in hard mode it very hard to complete
B002KVCA1O|5.0|What more could you ask for than a great remastered set on a classic album.  Love this group and love Mick Jager!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|A good disease game to infect the world and kill and destroy it too from the inside out this is an amazing game.
0316056898|5.0|I read this book in 2 days while sitting at the pool on vacation. I laughed out loud! Very, very funny and great to hear the behind-the-scenes take on 30-Rock and SNL first-hand.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|A great exciting movie with alot of action and romance and love too between father mother and others which made an exciting movie anyone should watch.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Received in Excellent order so thank you very much for a brilliant film.  One of the best films I have seen in quite a while
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I got this game because I've played a couple of games like this on my computer and I wasn't disappointed at all. This game is challenging, addictive, the controls are simple and easy to use and the game has never froze, lagged, or crashed for me. This game is great for all ages and is a great way to pass the time. So if you're looking a free and fun game to entertain yourself and/or your kids. This is game is perfect for you!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|But it suffered from unnecessary nudity.  Overall, one of Denzel's weaker movies.  The hype was much higher than the delivery.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|You have to pay $4.99  to get the whole thing. This is simply a teaser, but it's a good teaser.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|This movie is fantastic!! The cast blends together in the most abnosome way! Woody Harrelson's character is cool and laid back which compliments Jesse Eisenberg's more wound up persona (a duo that I personally was happy to see back again after \\"Zombieland\\"). Isla Fisher is a fox and totally nailed the kickass female role,  while Dave Franco totally dominated the suave youngster. Of course Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent were brilliant as well! And lets not forget Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman rounding out this ensamble!! With great plot and twists its a must see!!!
B000I3UMKM|5.0|Best movie ever! I'm in love! I rarely watch movies but this one really caught my soul. I should probably buy it instead of renting it every time, though.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|and this is a good story.  A page turner and kind of a fun walk down memory lane for those of a certain age.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a fan! Once you start watching it you get involved with the characters and, though it's gross,can't wait to see what happens
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This book largely falls into the camp of &#34;preaching to the choir&#34;-- it probably won't win any converts over to atheism. But if you consider yourself an atheist, or an agnostic who leans that way ... you should check out this book. Dawkins can clearly and expertly phrase the objections to religion that you yourself probably already hold, but have trouble expressing.<br /><br />Another plus is that this book (like atheism itself) is not entirely negative. It does venture into positive suggestions of how secular life can easily be moral, beautiful, and inspiring-- more easily than a life dominated by a deity.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Tarantino never fails to impress.  The casting, the script, and the soundtrack all result in an epic film experience.  Waltz and Foxx are pure candy for the soul.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I am not a zombie crazy follower but enjoyed this movie. It had a range of emotions attached to it. Gross, sad, funny, suspenseful, romantic etc. It does have some foul language which I thought was unnecessary.
0385349947|5.0|Don't make the mistake of thinking of this as a piece of feminist literature.  This book addresses the #1 issue with growing corporate America - we are overlooking 50% of our talent pool, Women!  If you are an executive officer, you need to read this book to understand how to make your company fully competitive by developing this critically underused resource.  Many other companies are already on board.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|really enjoy playing this game great for all levels, I play alongside my 6 & 9  year old kiddies and compete for who can find the most hidden gems.  lots of fun.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Not only is Morgan Freeman a tremendous actor, Nelson Mandela is truly an extraordinary human being.  All people of all races should see this movie.<br /><br />I was sort of surprised when I read the DVD box and it said &#34;an Inspiring Sports story.&#34;  Well, it is admittedly about sports in a way, but I think that the truly inspirational part of the whole thing is about how Mandela survived 27 years in prison and came out, still with the ability to see people as people and not by race, and utilize sports as one of the many tools he used to try to unite a post-Apartied Africa.
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|Blake seems to have a complicated understanding of music. The way he presents his musical ideas is groundbreaking. His dreamy, unusual sound is mixed perfectly. Multi-layered and diaphanous. Even though his lyrics are hard to understand, I love Blakes music and look forward to his next CD
1400052181|5.0|I only know of the book's background. Bought it for my granddaughters who simply said it was &#34;good&#34;. It is amazing how many significant details are left out of written history.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|It's a little glitchy, but at least you don't have to use the mobile version- has the all the features of the full desktop version without going to the web for it
B00499QUK2|5.0|Love the actors but the story line could be improved.  Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect as a modern Sherlock Holmes. Martin Freeman is a perfect compliment.  Can't wait for season 3!
B004EPYZT4|5.0|Conan movies have been a favorite of mine for many years.  Jason's interpretation of the iconic character is spot on.  I felt as if the storyline was perpetuated; nothing was destroyed.  The action, the dialogue, the special effects were marvelous.  I was sad when it ended and I am sad that a second movie has not been made.  I have watched the movie several times and will watch it again.  Hopefully someone will get smart and do a second movie.
B008133MDK|5.0|Love the actors but the story line could be improved.  Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect as a modern Sherlock Holmes. Martin Freeman is a perfect compliment.  Can't wait for season 3!
B000A2H812|5.0|Powerful thrashing screaming post-communist Eastern Block Punk. Captures the immediacy of the music. Call it gypsy punk if you must. It sounds like some unknown band of recent immigrants playing downstairs at Sidewalk in the early 90's. Reminds you of the besotted Ukrainian musicians you met while enjoying an egg cream at Ray's newsstand last Saturday at 3:45 a.m. Like a hardcore matinee at CB's on a Sunday afternoon.  If you lived in Loweasida in the 80's and 90's, you probably knew these guys. Captures the energy of those who were born under Stalinism, grew up in the chaos of perestroika, and found anarcho-capitalist freedom in the USA. SALUT!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|You have to think and then re-think before you create your ball because when you finally determine that you have the order of colors correct....you miss one! Frustrating and fun!
B0010V4TZU|2.0|Bland attempt at pluralistic nouveau synth pop with vaguely ska-ish beats. No lyrical skill. If you like Willy Moon, you'll hate this. If you can bear to hear it through (not easy), you find one very long song , I.E., this band is repetitive, they only have one (BLAND) beat. AVOID AT ALL COST.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I use Dropbox for both personal and work purposes. I can just drag files into it and they are available on whatever computer I am logged in to. I also use dropbox for sharing pictures with my family (you know we've all heard, &#34;Can I have a copy of that?&#34;). Well, here you go. It's very easy even for people who aren't computer savvy. The more you tell people about Dropbox the more store space you get, and it's very generous. I recommend.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I truly enjoyed Hosseini's book, which, among many benefits,.offers insight on an entirely different mid-eastern culture. It also provides excellent context for what is currently happening in Afghanistan today. The characters are entirely believable, which a strong commentary on the author's ability to write a book almost entirely about women; their dreams, their lives and the cultural constraints placed on them..
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I can't help but think if Ralph just did his bloody job and picked up a hobby in his off time, a lot of the destruction he wrought while trying to be someone he's not could've been missed.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|So many zombie story's are the same: infestation, run for your life. Some die or keep running. Rinse and repeat. Broken up into numerous 'first hand accounts', a repetitive and sometimes dull genre is kept interesting and globally diverse in its perspective and take on how the world we know ends and is reclaimed. Easy and fun to read, if you like zombies and good short stories that are all connected you'll love it!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|OK, this movie confused my girlfriend - and she's a PhD graduate. Being an engineer, I've seen some loose ends and reverse-engineered and debugged some seriously messed up code, but this almost takes the cake. (Mmmmm, cake) I finally put a good couple theories together by the 1/2 of the movie, and by 2/3 of the movie they were confirmed; but, sweet Jeebus, was this convoluted. Yes, the tech displayed was superb, but some of the acting was a bit cold fish in my opinion.<br /><br />As Colin Ferguson said in Boston's Wilbur Theatre a while back (paraphrasing here) &#34;that's 6-foot crazy in a 5'2&#34; body&#34;
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|There is not too much you can say about this film. The darkness of those days must have been veritably physical. the acting is so real, you truly hate the bad quys and cry for the innocents. Such a dark time in human history, but if you watch Hotel Rawanda you will realize that at horrible as the Holocost in WW2 was, it has been repeated over and over in the history of man. I watched this with my teenaged granddaughters, explaining things as the movie progressed. It was an eye opener and now no one can tell them, 'oh, that never happened'. To comment on the quality of the film, all I can say is those two teenagers sat thru a 3 hour black and white film and were connected to it the entire time. So was I.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very helpful I would not be without it.  It has been a truly first look when I hookip for my mental health fix.  keepup the good work.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I have always loved this app but the latest update just doesnt cut it. Please go back to the last version. I have installed a different app until a new update comes out
0316228532|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this story as much as I did.  I have not read the HP series or seen the movies, there was always so much talk about them, I felt as though I had.<br />Throughout my life I have known all these people, all these couples, the privilaged and the damned.  I have always rooted for the damned and just like life---the story ends.<br />Spot on JK.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I wanted to like it, but after a couple of chapters I quit reading. Nothing grabbed my interest enough to want to continue. I got as far several finding out this man died, how they each had a connection in a different way...I decided it might be one of those books better listened to than read. If I change my mind and pick up the book to try it again and like it, I will get back to you:&#62;)
B005DC68NI|5.0|David Gaughran is the Yoda of e-books! In this guide he covers every detail that you need to know, while including stats on traditional versus self-pub in a very non-biased way. As a publisher of children's books I highly recommend this book and can't wait to read his latest edition.
B00D2ZF24O|1.0|This has got to be the most awful movie I have ever seen filled with bad acting and s***ty one liners. There are plot holes that continue throughout the movie, spotty editing, I mean Jaden's eyes change color every five minutes, and the animals look worse than the aliens from Plan 9 from Outer Space. In a civilization advanced enough to Terra-form an entire planet and create worms holes why would they use swords and knives, why not just incinerate them with lasers or have robots do it. To continue on to my rant why do they need to send a distress signal from the top of a volcano when at the beginning of the movie the pilots are seen clearly sending a distress signal from high up in space. This is a pitiful movie used solely by Will Smith to attempt to up his sons fame, Mission: Failed.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Watched it with our two God daughters, and we all loved it. Full of action, laughs, and has a positive ending.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|Just right for my preteen Disney Fan.  I enjoyed it because the plot was in the spirit of the old TV Disney flicks that starred Kurt Russell.
B00A4SJ61W|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. I have watched it about 7 times now and that's very rare for a movie for me.
B003HFFVEA|5.0|The music videos go well with the music. I recommend putting this on a nice HD TV with some good speakers, turning the lights down, inviting a few friends over and just watch/listen through it in (otherwise) silence from beginning to end. An amazing experience!
0345529057|5.0|Amazing books, incredibly well written!  Would highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of the show or interested in science fiction!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|As usual, George Martin's books are interesting, and the plot varies and is unexpected, but if you do not keep reading constantly, you may lose the contact with the characters and have a problem to follow up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game rocked. The minion you run as does silly actions as you run. And its funny when you lose.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minion Rush is cute and fun. My daughter loves it, and it was free. You can't beat that.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Eleven years later, and I still love this series. Oddly, its themes feel apropo given current events about government spying. About the Blu-ray itself, the many hours of interviews and extras is definitely worth the price. If you have any love or liking for science fiction, I strongly recommend buying it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|There is a new update version 0.7.3 but i cant click update because its not there, its just saying its 0.7.3 but its not showing up for me to click UPDATE D': please fix and make the UPDATE BUTTON even show up :(
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I gave this a five star because I love whitney  houstons voice and all the songs on this cd showed how talented she was. I would recommend this to anyone who loved whitney Houston's voice.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Diana Wynne Jones spins a great tale about the troubles of destiny and the power of having a strong mind. Sophie Hatter is certain that as the eldest of three sisters, her life will be boring and doomed to failure.  Sophie soon finds out how wrong she is when she must join forces with a powerful wizard's fire demon in order to break a curse that has been cast on her. Well written and great fun!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Very talented artist and I love her songs. She has her own style. Some songs are about love and others just make you smile.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I couldn't put this down, Hosseini is one of best story tellers I read.  His third book, like his first two, grips your interest from the beginning to the end.  I was sorry when the book ended.
B00005NP04|5.0|I love her as an entertainer and I would recommend this to anyone who loves true stories about life struggles.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Easy to use, plenty of features, keep going! Arty effects or just a quick way to spice up a photo before posting it,
1609611543|4.0|Sounds like a good plan---will take time to study, learn and change my life eating & cooking methods--will get started in future
B005MLOOJA|5.0|It is a food show, with great characters.  I love the plot line and it never gets boring.  Must see.
B00AG297GK|3.0|As expected it was a raunchy comedy but I manage to sit thru it.. That's about all I have to say about it..
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great beach read, the story developed quickly, read easy and was very intriguing. You must like books that rely heavily on character development.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Funny. Great for ALL AGES! The minions steel the show. Keeps the Kid's attention and the Adults too! Amazon was the cheapest and easiest way to buy. Very Fast shipping!
B004G600A4|5.0|I am not going to give my age, but I--even as an adult--love this movie. The songs are fun and the storyline is one which presents a young woman with spirit and energy. What's not to love.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It held my interest merely because I had to make sure the predictable ending really took place... which it did.  A semi-modern variation on the girl-meets-boy plot, embellished by the rehab slant on things and the dance element.  The love triangle between Bradley Cooper and the two women was played out til the end.  The comedy of the running scenes was great.... literally chasing the guy down the street!  Funny.  Bradley Cooper is SO watchable; he has an innocence that we hope doesn't become jaded; after all he's still a new star.  Jennifer can't remember her last name is on the verge of becoming over-exposed already.  There were too many closeups of her face, no matter how much you like her.
B001QE9WEO|4.0|I used to watch this movie a lot when I was a kid, and loved it! I recently purchased it again, and sadly, it didn't hold up to the test of time as well as I thought it would.<br /><br />Still, the movie is excellent. It has great effects, a well put together plot, and lovable characters. It is a true testament to the way horror films USED to be made. Every monster looks realistic, and goes to show that visuals don't have be all about CG.<br /><br />If you have watch the first &#34;Return of The Living Dead&#34;, but never saw this, I can't recommend it enough. It is scary at times, humorous, and very well done for an 80's horror comedy film. I would not say it is better than the original, but it is a perfect companion to it. After part 2, the series pretty much goes downhill, but we will always have the first ones.<br /><br />Even if you are not a big horror movie fan, this movie is sure to entertain anybody. A really fun movie that belongs in anybody's collection...... Just wish it would turn up on Bluray soon...
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|Can not say enough about this film.  If you are even remotely interested in Shakespeare, theater, or visual directing-- this is a must for the collection.  Highly recommend!
B00B04NJLW|2.0|This is not a movie for everyone. The idea is awesome, 26 directors, 26 different shorts, but the end result is a joke. the movie is 2 hours long, and only about 20 minutes or so is entertaining.<br /><br />It wasn't entirely bad, some of the directors took the project seriously, but most came off as not even trying. If you are looking for a horror movie, skip this. There is nothing scary, and most of the shorts do not involve horror at all. More than half of these shorts are even comedic. This movie is just one big jumbled together mess.<br /><br />I admire the freedom the directors were given to make what they wanted, but in the end, that was the downfall of the film. Too much going on at once, too many different ideas, just too much. This is a hard film to watch, and with the exception of 5-6 of the shorts, the rest were junk.<br /><br />If you want to waste 2 hours, waste it watching something better than this.
0380018179|3.0|I read the Kindle edition which I do not recommend as it sorely lacked an editor- sentences rambled commas were in short supply, periods were missing. Yikes!<br /><br />I found the first third of the book compelling and interesting, with wonderful descriptions of New Zealand and the Australian outback, but the last two thirds of the book really dragged with redundant descriptions and far too many subplots that were not at all necessary or interesting. I've found myself skimming much of the last bits of the novel as it schlepped on and on. If you're looking for really good literature, this isn't it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. It has cool obstacles.  It's so easy to play. Almost all the things that you can bye ln the game can be bought with or G coins or bannanas so you don't really have to pay real money.Hope you like the game. bye
B00BSBXA98|3.0|I was right, you cannot put a Cirque or a compilation of Cirque on film and expect the same thrill as a live show.  This was okay and brought back the memories of the shows we have seen, but don't expect a coherent plot line or surprise ending.  We've rented far worse. At least it was an enjoyable 90 minutes.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was truly amazing. From the moving, amazing, inspirational paragraphs, to the humor and amusement from numerous characters, this book moved me in more ways then one. This book, sucks you in, I could truly not put the book down. I would recommend it to anybody, but mainly teens, or somebody going through a hard time. I am so glad I downloaded this book. I would give it 5/5 stars. Truly astonishing.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Maybe we're too old to get it.  The movie seemed to drag on at times and was very predictable in parts.  The 3-D made it enjoyable.  Not an arm chair clutcher or a tissue grabber, but it filled a Saturday night.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|My wife and I saw &#34;Mama&#34; in the show, and we really enjoyed it. Some people in the theater did not, and somehow found the ending humorous - but we liked it and that's what matters.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|As another reviewer said, this app came with more than I anticipated.  Being a sophomore in high-school, this calculator has helped me  with my homework with its many functions.  This has become my &quot;go-to&quot; app for any mathematical problems.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love the Alien movies, especially Alien and Aliens.  The anthology comes in a cool package...it opens up and reads like a book.  It has lots of extras and the movies include the extended versions.  Definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Alien movies.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I read this in school as a child.  It was edited for 12-14 year olds.  This version with all of the original writiing is so touching and sad.  I am glad this historical documentation of this horrific tragedy lives on to prove that the Holocaust occurred and how horrible it truly was!

B005GFPZYK|5.0|As I read this book, I felt as if Chris was sitting next to me, and telling his story. It's written the way I would expect him to speak to me.
B005ZI2ZUK|5.0|On the side table in my living room I have an art deco lamp given to me by my grandmother, and every time I turn it on I think of her. It was my grandmother who read bedtime stories to me as a child, my mother never did, and I am sure it is her that persuaded me subtly to become a writer myself.<br /><br />Peter Collier with his book of stories, Over The Fence, brought back so many pleasant memories I couldn't help but be drawn into what he describes as a mystery story for children - he poses questions in free verse, a bit like Lao-tsu in the Tao Te Ching, but leaves his young readers to seek answers themselves, a clever way of teaching - as we know from Lao-tsu. Collier has astutely kept his stories in the 10 - 15 minutes length, enough time for a child to concentrate but still feel sleepy enough to close their eyes and dream sweet dreams. Innovative, educational, I feel as if I have had a ride back into my childhood.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This beget &#34;The Magnificent Seven&#34; - the core of the story, bandit oppression of the weak villages, desperate response, hired killers with motivations ranging fro 'it's a job I do' to 'I need to do a good deed', shines through in both.<br />This, the original, shows all the participants' humanity - and lack of it - in depth. Its' length allows focus on the situation, the solution, and the evolving implementation of it together with the effects on the participants.<br />Memorable.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am surprised this book is a best seller and the reason being is the erotica.  However, a few chapters into the book you begin to recognize the repetitive adjectives, the juvenile use of words to describe the characters relationship, or lack thereof and the lack of character development.  There is no plot.  The repetitive use of the words is enough to make you want to burn the book.  So disappointed and wish I read the reviews before buying the book.  It was an impulse buy on the way to the beach we stopped at Target and grabbed it for a beach read.  Total waste of $10.00.  I don't have a Kindle but would love to count the number of times she calls him a control freak.  Ridiculous book.

B00992CF6W|4.0|I adore this game but it needs stuff like dogs and ocelots like the computer version. Also it says it's updated to version 0.7.3, but when I downloaded the update it still said 0.7.1. I think that it needs to be fixed.

B005MLOOJA|4.0|I would have prefer a little less sexual content. There is no need to have so much sex if your story line is good enough.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved this book. I love all of the detail that the author goes into and all the different facets of life during the war that he explores.  It was so interesting to me and it seemed so real!  I've read reviews where people were complaining that there was no plot but thats the point!  it's different people's stories and that's what i liked about it.  All of the different perspectives from all the different people who expereicned different things but over all were dealing with the same thing.  I HIGHLY recommend this book.
0425266060|5.0|This series is not a \\"knock off\\" of the 50 Shades series. Sylvia Day wrote an incredible love story with mystery and characters that come to life.  I can't wait to read what happens next!

B00COCY67A|5.0|With all that we've ever heard about Elvis Presley, one section of his career that is routinely dismissed by a lot of music critics and so-called \\"rock historians\\" is the work he did at Stax in two different sessions that took place in, respectively, July and December 1973.  Those sessions came about in the wake of Elvis having scored a monstrous commercial and critical success with ALOHA FROM HAWAII, as well as his equally monstrous 1972 smash single \\"Burning Love\\"; and it was thought by all concerned, including many of his Memphis Mafia friends, that he could continue with that kind of impact.  Sealing the deal, of course, was that he would once again be recording in his hometown of Memphis.<br /><br />As this 3-CD Deluxe Edition of the Stax Sessions indicates, Elvis was certainly back at home mixing the many different styles of his career--country; blues; rock; R&B; and gospel--the way only he ever could.  But the other thing that cannot be discounted was that the effects of his divorce from Priscilla clearly affected at least some of the repertoire that he chose to record during these sessions.  Certainly he got the most out of the old-school rock and roll numbers, including \\"Raised On Rock\\" (written by Mark James of \\"Suspicious Minds\\" fame) and \\"I've Got A Feeling In My Body\\" (written by Dennis Linde, who wrote \\"Burning Love\\"), although these were shockingly not big hits (\\"Raised On Rock\\" actually missed the Top 40 by a single notch in late 1973).  But there was also a feeling of melancholy and a certain amount of anguish on other tracks, none more so than on the gut-wrenching \\"It's Midnight\\" (though the backing vocal track is kind of overblown), which a lot of people couldn't help but connect to his divorce.  It may also be noted that, given the incredibly changing nature of pop music tastes during the 1970s, it was easier to hear Elvis on adult contemporary and country radio stations, even though only a handful of the songs from these sessions fit the lattermould (\\"Mr. Songman\\"; \\"There's A Honky Tonk Angel\\"; \\"You Asked Me To\\").  Even \\"It's Midnight\\", though it was a #9 country hit at the end of 1974, is not really a \\"country\\" song, per se; nor is even the King's cover of Tony Joe White's \\"I've Got A Thing About You Baby\\", which got to #4 on the country chart in early 1974 (#39 pop).<br /><br />In terms of pop music airplay, however, the Stax sessions weren't a total wash by any stretch, since they did yield three of Elvis' best post-\\"Burning Love\\" hits of the time.  \\"If You Talk In Your Sleep\\", with its horns-and-strings arrangement basically a reflection of the Memphis soul sound of the time and something of a throwback to the American Sessions of 1969 that totally revitalized Elvis' career, reached a very respectable #17 on the Hot 100 in the summer of 1974.  That fall, an old-school cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Promised Land\\" made it to #14, giving Elvis his biggest hit since \\"Burning Love\\"; and early in 1975, the heart-wrenching \\"My Boy\\" hit #20 on the Hot 100, and #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart.  \\"It's Midnight\\", as the B-side of \\"Promised Land\\", was also an Adult Contemporary chart smash; while \\"Mr. Songman\\" ended up as the B-side of the King's 1975 old-school rocker \\"T-R-O-U-B-L-E.\\" (that one having been recorded at RCA's L.A. studios in March 1975).<br /><br />It was well-known, unfortunately, that a variation of the kind of lethargy that had stalled the King's acting and music career in the 1960s had begun to creep in again by 1973, as the result of too much Vegas, and a manager who really thought very little of his client.  This is likely why the Stax Sessions are not thought of in the same breath as the American Sessions, the 1972 Madison Square Garden album, or the ALOHA FROM HAWAII triumph.  Still, with Elvis, one can always find something of value; and this is true of the Stax Sessions, as can be gauged in this monstrous 3-CD collection, which includes the master recordings plus various takes of the songs,all basically produced by the King with his right-hand man Felton Jarvis.  And Elvis, even at a point when his life and career were beginning to slip towards a terribly early end, is still far superior to most anything new one can find in our time.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|With Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman, you've got a winner already in my opinion.  Bruce Willis shows another side of his acting abilities.  Great action film with a little comedy thrown in for good measure.  I highly recommend this one.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Unfortunately, this CPU cooler (Coolermaster Hyper 212+) won't work for my particular application as it simply won't fit into my older Silverstone HTPC case.  That's my fault, I didn't think to check the dimensions carefully enough before purchase...and frankly, it's the first time I've ever run into this problem.  This cooler has some serious height to it, at almost 158mm, or a full 6.2 inches!  Add your motherboard height with standoffs, the CPU receptor and the CPU...and you're pushing close to 6.5\\".  It barely clears my midsize ATX style case for my main machine!  You'll definitely want to check your case's height and if it's close at all, look at the Geminii series instead.  (Remember, you want some extra height for the air to clear from the fan.)<br /><br />Other than that, it looks like a pretty sweet cooler that will keep even the hottest of CPU's cool.  I've seen some confusion out there that it comes with a 92mm fan, but it's fitted with a 120mm fan.  I also dig that it can be configured in a push/pull configuration with two fans...something you might do to get a few extra degrees shaved off.  I've been running Coolermaster CPU coolers/fans for several years and short of a couple minor fan failures, they're pretty good for the price.  I expect failures from any mechanical moving part that runs 24x7, it's just a fact of life and happens even in enterprise grade equipment.<br /><br />I think I'm going to hold onto it, rather than return it, as I'll be doing an upgrade on my primary machine here in a few months and it should fit that application.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|I think this could have been a 4 star book if it had been properly edited. The incorrect tenses and spelling mistakes were really annoying after a while.<br /><br />***Minor spoilers***<br />I found the h annoying at times. I know she'd suffered a lot and had been through a lot but she reacted stupidly to the H in my opinion, when he was being protective. The abusive ex pitching up at the end seemed a little cliched to me too.<br /><br />As a first effort by this author, this book was pretty good.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Fast paced action, liked the female role, capable person, not a wimp.  Liked the references to the stars previous movies, (Arnold, I'll be back :) Bruce Willis.  Guess u have to have a sad part, make it more realistic, but did not want the youngster to die.

B00CVE1SAO|4.0|If you like a good thriller, then this is the book for you. John Puller, David Baldacci's new hero, makes his appearance in this fast paced, entertaining book \\"Zero Day.\\"  Baldacci's \\"Camel Club\\" series is one of the best action, thriller series written; however, \\"Zero Day\\" is not as strong as \\"The Camel Club.\\"  Regardless, David Baldacci is a great story teller who develops complex plots and strong characters. This is true of \\"Zero Day.\\" The plot is fast-moving, enjoyable, and a little unpredictable. Just when the reader thinks they have it figured out, Baldacci takes the story in a new direction with several surprises.<br /><br />Puller is an army Special Agent who is called to investigate a case in the coal fields in West Virginia. A family with military connections is brutally murdered, and Puller, an investigator in the US Army's CID, immediately notes something strange: with the large number of deaths, Puller is sent there on his own, without any form of back-up or technical assistance. So an uneasy tone is immediately set as only vague reasons are given for this. As the story progresses, a web of deceit becomes apparent; the reader begins to realize that there's a lot more to this case.<br /><br />I liked the main character but with a few reservations. First, although characterized well, John Puller is not Oliver Stone, nor is he Jack Reacher, both of whom are better developed.  The main character is an all-American tough guy soldier, but a few times, he seems a bit too \\"robotic\\" in some of his thoughts and actions.  On the other hand, John Puller has a sensitive side which we can see as he helps the motel owner or in his evolving relationship with local detective Samantha \\"Sam\\" Cole, a marvelously developed character.  Additionally, plot wise, there are just a few too many close calls for Puller. A few times, things seemed a bit contrived, even at the ending.  However, the ending has a surprise twist which I certainly did not see coming. Therefore, I was torn between a 5 and a 4 star rating for \\"Zero Day;\\" I ended up giving it \\"4 stars\\" because the above metioned weaknesses. However, Baldacci is still a master of plot, dialogue, and character. Here he did a wonderful job of developing character, local color, and plot without the story dragging. I feel like Will Rogers when I say: I have never read a book by David Baldacci that I didn't like. \\"Zero Day\\" is no exception; I will look forward to seeing where he takes John Puller in his next book:  \\"The Forgotten.\\"
B005DKLPF6|5.0|When you look back over Mastodon's catalog and realized they have put out four concept albums, you had to wonder what they were gonna do next. Well, dare I say it?? They sound like they were having a blast making this one. I mean topics like meth heads selling a certain kind of wood so they can make and purchase meth(Curl of the Burl) Sex in outer space (Stargasm) and of course in true Mastodon form, pain and suffering (The Hunter and the closer, The Sparrow). This release shows Mastodon with the best production to date. Brann Dailor's drumming is off the chain and he may be the best drummer since Neil Peart.  The under dog on this whole album is Bill Keliher, possibly one of the two best guitar players ( the other being Matt Pike) on the planet. But after four well thought-out and serious concept albums, it's nice to these boys let their hair down and write some really awesome music and just flat out play. And in reality looking back at their catalog I think it might have been more of a challenge to write this record over their previous work because it is NOT a concept album. In any case these guys get the best first five album award. Thank god they all went to that High On Fire show in their friend's basement. Kudos fellas. Another fan effing tastic album

B000FC11A6|4.0|At  over one thousand printed pages, this is a very long book.  Long is not necessarily bad. However, the author clearly has an extremely strong background in cryptography.  For crypto buffs it may be fascinating!  For me, there are numbers of pages throughout the book that consist of codes and numbers rambling on for page after page.  So far, I have managed about 500 of the thousand pages (probably 300 pages of good reading) and plan to finish the book a few pages at a time.  I think that it is an excellent story but have some difficulty understaning how all of the codes, etc. got through the editors.  If you are adept at skimming then you may skim over all of the non-essentials and enjoy a good story!
