B00005JPBR|3.0|If you don't want to know what happens in the movie then stop reading this review right now! Ok so I was totally in to the movie until the whole twin brother thing came up. I could even kinda sorta except that but then it got in to the cloning thing too. Clones in 1827?! Are you kidding me!!! So how many times was whats his face killed? What an unbeliable ending. Like I said I was loving it UNTIL the end!
0743298020|2.0|I picked up this book after seeing that it was a \\"love letter to reading\\" with an intriguing plot.  Unfortunately, it just didn't do it for me.  Being a lover of 18th and 19th century lit, I understand the desire to emulate those novels, but in this case it just comes off a little self-conscious.  The plot itself - I have to say I was bored.  I finished the book because it really bothers me not to finish a book, but even the ending found me unsatisfied.  The book is a bit of a mystery, so I won't be too explicit, but for me the solution to it all just didn't hang together.  Why the characters would want to keep secret all that they did, didn't make much sense.<br /><br />But I would say that the biggest flaw of the book is the lack of a 'sympathetic'  or psychologically real character.  Vida Winter is not very pleasant and the narrator feels stuffy and rather false.  A good novel can grab you by having a psychological underpinning that is intriguing and feels true.  This did not.<br /><br />And I never really understand incest.  I know it exists out there, but for me it just never is very compelling.  Oedipus works because he doesn't actually KNOW he's doing his mother.  At least that's what I think.  But maybe I haven't read enough of the great works of incest, who knows.  Of course, incest is a subplot in this novel and I wouldn't say you have to be dissuaded overly from reading the book on that account.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Imagine one of your favorite bands from childhood releasing a new album.  No, not a washed up bunch of \\"has beens\\" trying to recapture their former glory, or an empty shell of a band reflecting new trends in music through their 20 year old style.  Take a band like Def Leppard who were on top of the music world in 1987 with their ultra-classic album \\"Hysteria\\".  Imagine getting a new album of material from THAT time period but previously unreleased!  Well, that is what this cd collection is.  The equivelant of a Beatles or Elvis album recorded in the \\"hey-day\\" but lost to the ages- ROCK of ages that is!   For those Leppard fans who have never heard these tracks it is a literal time machine- a second chance at the past to hear what a 1986, or 1988 Def Leppard album could have been.  For \\"SUPER LEPPARD FANS\\" like myself, who clammered after and cherished these releases as single \\"B\\" sides or foreign imports, it is a chance to have digital quality preserved copies of this music.  Listening to it now takes me back to the exitement of those days- but I am a little jealous of you out there getting to hear these songs for the first time and creating new memories to a lost soundtrack.
0385512058|5.0|Out of work? Stuck in a job you do not like? Stuck in a life you do not like? Then run out and get Keith Ferrazzi's superb \\"Never Eat Alone.\\" Ferrazzi provides practical \\"how tos\\" on expanding one's thinking and, subsequently, one's life, through networking.<br /><br />I have spent countless hours working with professionals and executives in-transition. Many know how to write a resume, call search firms, and prepare for interviews but few know how to network. And networking is THE KEY to finding a fulfilling job and life.<br /><br />With Ferrazzi's book, I now have a resource to recommend.<br /><br />\\"Never Eat Alone\\" is organized into four sections: The Mind Set; The Skill Set; Turning Connections into Compatriots; and Trading Up and Giving Back. Each section is packed with good, proven, common sense advice. People who have succeeded in their careers and life will, if they read this book, endorse what Ferrazzi recommends. It is at the core of success in life.<br /><br />Networking is not a one-shot endeavor, something you do when you are need. Rather it is a way of life, and is based on doing something for others WITHOUT the expectation of getting something in return. Ferrazzi shows us how going the extra mile for others leads to unexpected rewards.
0618551050|5.0|I am a behavioral scientist with a background in physics and mathematics. Like many others, I much admired Smolin's book, and perhaps in another review I will deal with the book directly. Here, I want to apply my understanding of Smolin's argument to a critique of Lubos Motl's review of Smolin's book, which he entitled \\"Another postmodern diatribe against modern physics and scientific method\\". Motl is a very fine string theorist at Harvard, and an interesting person with a great physics blog. I admire him a lot. But, he is wrong in many of his remarks (I cannot evaluate them all, for lack of expertise), and his argument fully supports Smolin's general position on the intellectual social structure of modern physics and the role of \\"groupthink\\" in normal science.<br /><br />Let us begin with the title of Motl's review, \\"Another postmodern diatribe...\\" Anyone who knows me will relate that I cannot stand postmodernism. I despise postmodernism. I have nothing for contempt for postmodernism. If a postmodernist ever supported a book I wrote, as did Evelyn Fox Keller of Smolin's book, I would probably conclude that I was dreaming (a particularly cruel nightmare, I might add). But, neither Keller nor any other postmodernist (assuming she is one---I read one book of hers and could not stand it) is in The Trouble with Physics, nor among the blurbs on the book jacket. Smolin does not have a single postmodern strand in his argument. Not a single one. His basic framework is consistent with Thomas Kuhn's \\"normal science,\\" \\"paradigm,\\" and \\"anomaly\\" framework, and Lord knows, Kuhn could not abide the use of his work by postmodernists. His scientific criterion is basically a combination of Popper (a scientific statement must be refutable, and it must not be accepted until it is tested in a situation where refutation is possible) and Feyerabend (Against Method). Smolin's interpretation of Feyerabend (who has been incorrectly interpreted as postmodern) is in no way postmodern, and highly refreshing and accurate. So much for Motl's title. Not surprisingly, it is all downhill from there.<br /><br />Motl begins his review not by dealing with Smolin's argument, but by an ad hominem attack on Smolin himself. He says, \\"Lee often visits us. We smile at each other and Lee is being politely explained why his newest theories can't really work. Lee says that he understands these arguments. Then he returns to a conference or a journalist and repeats that all of his theories have been perfectly proven, while offering even more unusual theories.\\" Now, Smolin is not beyond describing the idiosyncrasies of his string theorist friends, but only late in the book, after his scientific argument is completed. Motl might learn that ad hominem attacks are treated by intelligent scientists as beyond the pale. Motl is an excellent physicist, but he clearly doesn't know how to make an argument: we already have an indefensible title and an ad hominem first paragraph.<br /><br />Moreover, it is completely false that Smolin claims that \\"all of his theories have been perfectly proven.\\" Does Motl think we are fools, making such an assertion? If it were not for his stature in string theory, I would have stopped reading his review right there.<br /><br />A bit later in his remarks, Motl attempts to deflect the criticism from string theory by asserting that \\"Lee reveals his intense hostility against all of modern physics, not just string theory. He believes that quantum mechanics must be wrong at some fundamental level and many people should try to prove it. He also believes that the attempts to falsify the theory of relativity are among the most important topics to work on.\\" In fact, we know that both quantum mechanics and the general theory are both \\"wrong\\" because they are inconsistent with one another and neither separately covers the explanatory ground covered by the other. Motl concludes that \\"Lee is trying to sell things that could never be bought by the experts because heknows that his lay readers won't be able to tell the difference between a result and a nonsense.\\"  It is true that my personal knowledge of string theory is way out of date. If I get time this summer, perhaps I can come up to snuff, or perhaps it really take the year or more that Smolin suggests is needed. Perhaps it is nonsense. But, the fact is that string theory has moved from asserting that the answer is just around the corner to proliferating sui-generis arguments that substitute for real testable, physical theories. Smolin is asking for more resources to be devoted to those who do not operate in the string theory framework. Nor is he arguing that anyone but physicists should be involved in shifting resources (e.g., departmental positions, research funds). Never does he say that Congress or NSF administrators make such decisions. Motl is once again off target.<br /><br />Motl then claims that \\"Lee proposes a truly radical thesis that it is wrong for mathematics to play a crucial role in theoretical physics.\\" If I didn't already know that Motl is perfectly happy offering drivel to his readers, I would be astonished at this assertion. Nothing in the book says anything of the kind. Smolin says that physics goes through stages in which deep thinking is critical and others where just crunching the math is extremely productive, as in the case of the standard model. Smolin is correct, I believe. His remarks apply very nicely to the behavioral sciences I know well, including Economics, which is the most mathematical of the behavioral sciences.<br /><br />Motl : \\"Smolin... tries to paint the mainstream physics community as a group of evil people.\\" Fact: Smolin says many times that they are, almost to a person, NOT evil people. Rather it is the \\"sociology\\" that produces a \\"groupthink\\" outcome.<br /><br />Motl: \\"he proposes ... that the conclusions [of a paper] must be accepted by everyone if their author is a person of good faith.\\" Fact: Smolin does nothing of the kind. He suggests that highly skilled and well-trained renegades should be supported more than they are.<br /><br />Motl: \\"These and other proposals are clearly meant to transform the scientific community to a dogmatic, non-mathematical, and irrational institution with double standards that is similar to the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages.\\" Fact: all I can do here is roll my eyes in disbelief that anyone could take this as an implication of Smolin's book. Completely absurd!<br /><br />I am sorry for spending so much time dumping on poor Motl, who is doubtless as fine as a physicist as he is deplorable as a meta-physicist (i.e., a person capable of thinking clearly and intelligently about where research energy in physics should devoted at the current time). I hope a better defense of string theory appears (I read a rather silly review in Science or Nature a couple of weeks ago), because I really don't want to have to spend my declining years finding the answer out for myself.because he knows that his lay readers won't be able to tell the difference between a result and a nonsense.\\"  It is true that my personal knowledge of string theory is way out of date.

B000BMSTMS|4.0|Korn, the masters and pioneers of \\"nu-metal\\" as some call it, have been hard at work for 16 years blasting ears, sharing angst, and uniting fans.  This band does NOT know when to stop, and, unlike most bands, this is a good thing.  At a point in time when fans thought that Korn could not decline farther down the rabbit hole, they release this bit of brilliance.  This creates melodies and experiments with sounds using help of The Matrix, and others.  The songs found on this CD are not brutal, heavy, and disasterous, but instead, these are operatic, musical, and insightful.  This is NOT classic Korn, this is the evolution.   <br /> <br />R.I.P. Brian \\"Head\\" Welch <br />You're dead to us now as you walk down your path with Christ.

Songs like Rockaria (The first rock-opera song in Rock History), Telephone Line, Living Thing, Tightrope (one of the best progressive rock song ever), Do Ya (A Move song Classic).

B000H3096A|5.0|This was a real eye-opener for me when I first bought it as an LP back in the mid-60s. I was used to the styles of such modern hard boppers as Art Blakey and Horace Silver, and this was basically nothing like that. The most \\"radical\\" piece is THE OMEN, which is totally free and contains some of the most spirited and adventurous jazz of the 60s. Hutcherson's marimba solo is absolutely compelling, and Joe Chambers's multi-percussion voices are fascinating, culminating in an explosive ending. Herbie Hancock's MAIDEN VOYAGE gets an excellent reading: there are lots of spaces in the theme that allow a great deal of tension to build. HEAD START is the most traditional tune, taken way up tempo, and is reminiscent of SPEAK LOW. ROJO is a Latin piece with an excellent Hancock solo and a powerful Bob Cranshaw bass solo. This has to rank as one of Blue Notes most ambitious albums of the mid-60s, and one of Hutcherson's best. Nice!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is actually the best movie created by Miyazaki.  He is a genius, and always creating something that is one of a kind and extordinary.  Nausicaa is about a girl that can see something within the Earth that no one else can.  She is special, just like this movie is special.  She sees the good in the bugs and good in the deadly forest.  And through patience, scientific anaylsis, and love of adventure she uncovers the unbelievable and shows with love and kindness how great the world can be.  Nausicaa is a movie that any anime or even movie lover should have, and I believe it to be the best that Miyazaki has ever made ^_^
B000H7JCIW|3.0|Unbelievable. This is the third of Liza's Concerts on DVD  that I have seen. And I feel so luky to understand what  made \\"LIZA\\" an ICON, but in the last few years considered  more of a joke. But if you view \\"LIZA WITH A Z\\" and  \\"AZNAVOUR/MINNELLI\\" and now \\"Live from Radio City Music  Hall,\\" which is practically a brand new show will see a top notch performance and production. t I was grateful to see \\"Liza\\" sing  \\"new standards\\" and make a brand new production. \\"Liza\\"  shines on all levels. She is at the top of her game and  the songs are excellent, as is \\"liza's\\" GREAT DANCING.  I've never saw a star who is so humble and it is overwhelming.    From production down to the choreography, to the songs  choosen (and yes you hear \\"New York, New York\\") is a 90  minute of pure greatness! LIZA WE MISS YOU!!!    Now I want to see and buy all other concerts that need  to be put on DVD from \\"Liza.\\" I know there are at least  two out there filmed for cable that needs to be shown.  Because these concerts prove that she had the capabilities  and shined as one of our greatest performers. \\"Barbra  Streisand\\" is great, but she leaves me \\"cold\\" with her  personality. \\"Liza leaves me in \\"tears of happiness\\" for  the willingness to sweat and work as hard as possible.      BUT PLEASE CABLE TELEVISION, give us the \\"FULL CONCERTS\\"  that were filmed some years back. And no editing!!! Which  is what \\"FOX STUDIOS\\" DID with a VHS CONCERT. IF YOU  PUT ThE DVDS OUT with some publicity we will buy them!    A great concert and DVD. WORTH OWNING! And yes, Streisand  move over and share in the glory of being an \\"ICON!\\"    My biggest regret is that she hasn't done many films.  I hope she does at least just one more to show how  dynamic she is.    *Though the review shows a 3 STAR Rating I don't understand  why for I gave this concert a 5 STAR Rating.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I am new to Supernatural, but I rented the season on Netflix and now I'm scrambling to watch the new season, and to purchase the dvds. This is an excellent show, made even better by the relationship between Dean and his brother Samuel which is very heartwarming.<br /><br />This is a series about family, responsibilities and hardship. Sam and Dean are true warriors trying to save humanity from a variety of supernatural scourages (ghosts, demons, evil creatures of all stripe)while searching for their dad. I particularly love the character Dean. Some of his lines are excellent: \\"Dude you fugly...\\" and \\"Your, uh, half-caf, double-vanilla latte is gettin' cold over here, Francis.\\" Sam is great too, but his lines are less memorable because his character doesn't have Dean's snarky sense of humor.<br /><br />There are some episodes that are seriously creepy and may be too intense for young viewers (hence the TV14 rating), episode such as the Pilot, Provenance, and Asylum did make my skin crawl.<br /><br />I think my favorite episodes were Scarecrow, Route 666, Faith, and Devil's trap. I can't wait until my DVD set arrives.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol Flynn, who has always been one of my personal favorite actors all my life, plays a stellar perfomance as the swashbuckling hero, Robin Hood.<br /><br />Each character in the movie is brilliantly acted and the fighting scenes quite believable.<br /><br />You all know the story, so I won't go into detail about it.<br /><br />The second disc contains a lot of information that the average person doesn't know. Such as James Cagney was origianlly picked to star as Robin Hood but had a fight with the bosses and walked off the lot.<br /><br />There's also a short about one of the masters of the bow, Howard Hill. A couple Merrie Melodies cartoons starring Buggs and Daffy. And best of all, a behind the scenes look at the stars who made up the extraordinary cast.<br /><br />For those of us who grew up on such fare, this is a must have. If you're expecting it to be dark and gritty like the version starring Kevin Costner, you will be disappointed.
0307275639|5.0|Sixteen years after his college graduation, sportswriter Mitch Albom finds himself living exactly the kind of life he swore would never trap him. Money and status have become his gods, and work - work that he doesn't even find satisfying - consumes his waking hours. Then, late one evening, he happens to watch \\"Nightline.\\" He sees his favorite professor from his college days on the screen, and that's how he learns that Morrie Schwartz is dying of ALS.<br /><br />Mitch makes time, albeit carved out of yet another business trip, to stop in Massachusetts and visit his old professor. Morrie has already lost the use of his legs, and his teaching career - which he extended far into his 70s - is over at last. Yet the old man's serenity in the face of death, and his joy in the life he's still quite determinedly living, reminds Mitch of exactly why he was once so close to Morrie. Mitch longs to regain what he's lost in the years since then. Morrie, a teacher to the last, wants someone to document his dying process so the lessons he is learning from it can be passed on and benefit others.<br /><br />That's how this book came to be written. Morrie's \\"final thesis\\" is a work of rare wisdom gleaned from the most commonplace of human experiences. As the old professor teaches himself how to die well, he reminds his beloved student - and all of us who read their story - of what it takes to live well first.<br /><br />Recommended in the highest possible terms!
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Is there no better movie out there than Mary Poppins. With stars Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, you are assured of great acting and music. Dick Van Dyke for me is one of the greates actors of all times, especially when you're talking his earlier works like this and 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'. His songs and acting are all fun and exciting.<br /><br />The special effects on this is definitely outdated by our standards but were cutting edge way back when.<br /><br />If you have kids, this will be worth your time. They love the way at the end when the kids take over the castle and put the 'Child Catcher' in the big net. He always disturbed me as a child, just something about the way way his face was made up. He has the same effect on my daughter as the Oompa Loompas of the orignal Wonka movie.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Masquerade! Every face a different shade,<br />Masquerade! Look around - there's another mask behind you!<br /><br />Those two lines from one of my favorite songs in my favorite Broadway musical analogize perfectly the amount of different leads that I've seen in the role of the Phantom.<br /><br />When you've seen the best in a role it is hard to appreciate the next guy as much. Michael Crawford was by far the superior Phantom. He acted the part well, with emotion and an unparalleled vocal performance. Howard McGillin (who can still be seen on Broadway) is also excellent. So Gerard Butler had some very very big shoes to fill...and he filled them well.<br /><br />But Butler's voice was not as powerful (or it did not come through as so in the film version) as Crawford's or even McGillen's. To try to put it in perspective, would you go to see Pavarotti if you knew his understudy would be doing the performance? Seeing Butler in the role will be just fine for anyone who's not experienced Crawford or McGillin, but for me it came across as a very good understudy performance. This is the reason the film gets 4 instead of 5 stars; I am of the opinion that the film producers settled when there was a better leading man option somewhere out there.<br /><br />On the other hand, Emmy Rossum shocked me in the film. She was as amazing as the first time that I heard and saw the part of Christine played live by Sarah Brightman.<br /><br />Ultimately, I enjoyed the film immensely. After seeing the Broadway show more than a half-dozen times, I was quite skeptical that the film version would/could do the production justice. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie version looked great and the sound was absolutely terrific.<br /><br />But like any musical performance on DVD, if you've ever seen the live show you can't come close to comparing the audio experience unless you have a surround sound system and the DVD is offered (like Phantom is) in DTS or Dolby 5.1.  It really makes a giant difference if you have to experience a musical performance in the far inferior standard 2.0 stereo versus 5.1 or better offerings.<br /><br />Not that Phantom (or other musical performances) can't be enjoyed without a surround system. Especially if you've NOT had the opportunity to see the live show to compare it to.<br /><br />So, first I'd recommend coming to New York and seeing the 5-star live performance of Phantom of the Opera on Broadway before it closes. Don't want to make the trip?...Then spend the money on a good surround system instead, and pick up the film version of Phantom for your collection. Don't want to travel? Don't want to upgrade?

B00008NG5V|5.0|This was the third Jack Johnson purchase of mine, and it is my personal favorite.  A common criticism of his work is that all of his tracks sound the same, but out of his first three albums, this one has the most variety.  His guitar style is both soft and catchy at the same time.  \\"Times Like These\\", \\"The Horizon Has Been Defeated\\", \\"Taylor\\", \\"Wasting Time\\", \\"Holes to Heaven\\", and \\"Tomorrow Morning\\" are classic tracks. <br /> <br />Overall, the album is both upbeat and mellow.  If slower music puts you to sleep, this isn't for you.  I could pull up the cliché that this music as great to \\"chill\\" to, but this goes without saying if you've ever heard Jack before.  If you haven't, however, this is a great place to start.
B00011RPB0|4.0|I have seen many reviews about Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation. Some called it fantastic, beautiful, unforgettable, a masterpiece... Others called it boring, lost and a forgettable film. When I saw the film for the first time myself I was thrilled by the feeling it gave me, it grabbed me for sure. But still I could understand both sides: this film touches you or doesn't effect you at all.    The story, written by Sofia Coppola herself (which she won an Academy Award for), is a story that follows two totally different persones. First there is Bob, an actor who comes to Tokyo to film a commercial for a brand of wiskey. Secondly there is Charlotte, the wife of a workaholic who just travelled along with her husband. Now these two characters both have their own problems fitting in the gigantic city's way of life and basically feel lost. When they meet each other on a night at the local hotel bar, a friendship develops and they decide to explore Tokyo together.     Now this story leaves you either cold or touches you deep inside.   The way the story is filmed is simple but very effective. The camerawork is fantastic and the locations are wonderful. Tokyo is a colourful background that gives the film certain lighting and most of all: atmosphere. This element makes the film extremely powerful. It is like Coppola said herself: she wants you to feel like you have been in Tokyo after watching the film. The atmosphere definitely makes it feel like that. It makes you feel like you are right there walking  next to the characters which is a very effective way to tell a story. Now the people who disliked the film probably had problems keeping their attention with the film because they couldn't feel that atmosphere or simply disliked it because there basically doesn't happen very much.     The actors, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson, both give fantastic performances. Bill Murray is absolutely funny and does a great job portraying his character. You see exactly how he feels about something without him saying anything: the expressions on his face say it all.   Scarlett Johanson also does a great job and brings, together with Murray, the film to life. The chemistry is perfect between the two which gives fantastic scenes.       Lost in translation is a film without any action, without tense situations, without special effects: it simply shows a week of two people their lives who try to escape boredom in a place where there is difficulty to understand each other. If you are looking for a film with explosions, fights, thrills etc, you have to look some place else then Lost in Translation. But do you love dramas, atmospheric films with some humour sprayed on top of it: Lost in Translation is a film for you to see. After watching it for a second time you will see that there is so much you didn't see the first time while watching the film. It definitely grows on you.    Sofia Coppola has proved that you don't need a lot to make a great film. With simple but very effective storytelling she has made an absolutely delicious atmospheric film that is a must-see for sure.  One of the best atmospheric films I have ever seen.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|Watching them perform Summer Breeze on Jimmy Kimmel convinced me to get this album. Pretty amazing with all the people on this album as well, I really like Bring it on Home with Paul McCartney. <br />  <br />Two days after buying the regular version I found the surround sound version at monster music. It's a 2 disc set with a dvd disc so you can hear it on your home system. Breezin' and God Bless the Child are mind boggling in surround!  <br /> <br />If anyone knows about the Tony Bennett version in surround, please let me know.

B000FDFVZ6|5.0|This book was recommended by my mother. I've never been close to someone young who died, but it doesn't matter. If you were close to anyone who is now deceased this book will open you up.  <br /> <br />I've cried during books before but with this book, I had no idea why I was sobbing. Was it for the characters, myself, my dead grandmother, my young son I couldn't imagine leaving? I just was overwrought with emotion it came out in tears more than once. <br /> <br />This book gives us another perspective to death. How it affects the dead will be unknown to the living, but to read how Sebold precisely described each character left behind by the victim...it was exact, it was hard, it was simple. Death affects the living in ways we cannot change. <br /> <br />I read this book in 2 days, I couldn't stop myself, I highly recommend it.
B00068CVJ4|5.0|Released to near unanimous critical acclaim, _Relationship Of Command_is a shocking, tightly constructed, highly accessible album which careers between genres, bristles with experimental qualities and shines with delectable, bright melodies.<br /><br />But on first listening, this CD may soundlike a serious of random explosions set to a completely off the wall drum track with some guy punctuating it all with gibberish lines of screaming and energetic shouting. And yet, the energy is the key: this must be the most energetic, frantic album _ever_. At heart it fuses punk sensibilities (fast, riotous songs, a destructive and uncompromising musical aesthetic) with ideas more common to experimental rock (unpredictable song structures, grandstanding eclecticism, instrumental virtuosity), and importantly, it combines these disparate elements seamlessly. Indeed, I've never heard any other album that sounds quite, or anything like this. The band that splintered off from this, The Mars Volta, share some common ideals (and members), but where TMV will throw some ideas together and make (force?) a 30 minute epuc out of them, ATDI will shoehorn _all_ these ideas, maybe even a full albums worth, into one 4 minute song! And what songs they are: 'Arc-Arsenal' literally explodes into life out of nowhere, with gorgeous, melodic guitar lines underpinning a punk infused anthem, with unpredictable twists all over the place. 'Invalid Litter Dept' is some sort of space age, epic harcore anthem, with completely insane lyrics and soaring, epic melodies. 'Enfilade' kicks off with a genuinely creepy spoken intro (hear to believe) then flys off the handle with static and looped beats, and a truly devastating chorus section. 'Catacombs', possibly the one song in my collection that truly can only be described as 'angular', is an impossible fusion of atonal guitars and wailing, schizophrenic vocals. Avant-rock-progressive-punk anyone? Throughout the album, the vocals rarely stray from deranged screaming and random interjections, but the instrumental play - fluid guitar melodies, meaty power chords, utterly _insane_ drumming and little touches of so much else (the production is a smooth, accessible marvel) never fail to reatin my interest.<br /><br />After six years with this CD, and having discovered countless bands and albums since, it surprises me how ell this album stands up in my estimation. Such a high energy explosion of viruosity and anger has been taken to extreme limits by The Dillinger Escape Plan, but ATDI created something here which I doubt will ever be repeated or topped. A truly remarkable album, this is a stunning work, brimming with vision and invention, and with the chops, utterly stellar songwriting and plain old courage to make it work.g and random interjections, but the instrumental play - fluid guitar melodies, meaty power chords, utterly _insane_ drumming and little touches of so much else (the production is a smooth, accessible marvel) never fail to reatin my interest. <br />After six years with this CD, and having discovered countless bands and albums since, it surprises me how ell this album stands up in my estimation.

B000J4QWMC|3.0|Those of you who pine for such \\"classic\\" TV fare as the original Miami Vice will be doomed to disappointment. The only thing this movie takes from the TV show is the title and the names of the 2 lead characters. Otherwise, one might say it was \\"inspired\\" by the TV show in the same way that other movies are \\"inspired\\" by true events. Similarly, if you're looking for something resembling realism, look elsewhere. The budget for the film exceeded the annual budget for the entire Miami police department. However, taken on its own at face value, it's a lot of fun. Lots of bangs for your bucks. tons of atmosphere, pretty girls, etc. It's not Jane Austin nor intended to be taken as high art. As for the arguments in the other reviews over whether Jamie and Colin's guns are bigger than Don and Thomas', well see it and decide for yourself. The movie is certainly diverting enough for the time it takes to watch it, even if it will never make anyone's top 100 list.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I loved the graphic novel, and now I can share this powerful, dark and insightful story with all my friends and relatives who don't read comic books. I think that Hugo Weaving projected the essence of V brilliantly, and I applaud the bravery of the director and producers for keeping the mask on, as it was meant to be. This movie speaks to our society about current issues, while remaining a timeless paean against tyranny and oppression.
B0006HB84Y|5.0|I haven't been this giddy about a singer since I was a young teenager!  His voice is absolutely amazing.  There are not many people that I would pay big money to go see, but Josh Groban sure is one of them.  There is only ONE Josh Groban.  He cannot be immitated or mimmicked.
0385512058|5.0|I'll be honest, even though I chose this book myself I was very skeptical when I first approached it - there is something in the title that challenged my status quo. I am introvert and our society tends to value extraverted nature; I was afraid that this book would repeat this extraversion mantra all over again, and I couldn't have been more wrong, what I found was volumes of invaluable advice!<br /><br />Keith Ferrazzi is most definitely an extrovert of the most extreme kind, but his philosophy is invaluable to both camps - he argues for building relationships, not contacts. It is not a quid pro quo process, nor a one way street, it's going out of your way to expand your own horizons and to appreciate other people - relationships are about what you give. Charm, as he points out, is simply being yourself. You need to have a dream, you need to be audacious at times, you need to add value to everything you do, you do need to position yourself and have a unique point of view. In the end, what else could we wish for if not having a job we love with people who know us for who we really are - if that is what networking is all about, then count me in!<br /><br />Not even two weeks after I've read this book, I found myself applying these principles in my own life, and guess what, it works! It's a great book, I think everyone will take a different lesson from it, and I would give it six stars if I could.

B00005JPAM|4.0|Helen Mirren's work has always been superlative and I have always enjoyed the tough, determined and tempestuous Jane Tennyson in her Prime Suspect series. She has acted a very broad range being light,funny and flirtatious in some parts and stoic and reserved in others. <br /> \\"The Queen\\" is not one of those pick you up and whip you around emotional movies. It is done in the same way that the queen is, stoic, determined and with little display of emotion. Although you get the very strong sense that she does have very deep emotions and what really matters to her. Helen Mirren coming from the British Theatre actually knows how to act and portray those emotions. American actors should do the same. We rely on gizmos,computers and explosions. One exeption would be Clint Eastwood in some of his \\"off\\" movies like Bridges of Madison County and Unforgiven (although popular). \\"The Queen\\" isn't gripping, but it is illuminating. The queen as portayed in this movie was part of \\"The Great Generation\\" who stoicly, quietly and with great determination and faith in God endured the terrible bombings in WWII and the horrific loss of life in the trenches of WWI and the hedgerows and freezing winters of WWII. We should remember this.  And Helen did a masterful job.
B000059TEP|4.0|A romance in which the major charater is not involved in the love affair. For all of the beauty of Demi's tears and the paothos of a doomed love, whoopi is the glue that holds the picture together. All of the other actors are better at their craft than the principals in the romance. However, whatever its faults, it is intertaining.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|On \\"Continuum\\" John Mayer picks up his guitar to hurl it at Goliaths of Motown, blues and rock. Jimi Hendrix. Otis Redding. Stevie Ray Vaughn. Eric Clapton. Even a little Jackson Browne. <br /> <br />That he nails most of those targets, creating one of the better highway-driving CDs in recent memory, speaks to just how smooth Mayer's become. \\"Continuum\\" is one warm cocoa of easy listening, lovely not for its passion, but its calm, confident precision. His sound isn't exactly different. But it's deeper. Mayer used to be on par with an evening of Duncan Sheik. Now he's an artist. <br /> <br />Oh, Mayer's still baring his soul with lyrics too precious and cumbersome for the esctatic movements of his electric guitar. He's still busting out the falsetto voice three too many times. But like \\"Try!\\" - the live album he recorded as part of the John Mayer Trio - \\"Continuum\\" is more focused on layering tight, catchy choruses over Mayer's guitar. If that sounds like Carlos Santana, it isn't. Mayer isn't showing off or freaking out but underlining the essential sunniness of his writing and singing with a little electric pain. And it works. <br /> <br />\\"Waiting On the World To Change\\" is the sublime first single, and a marker of Mayer's growth. As a protest song, it makes its point in three minutes, and features one devil of a commentary on television more truthful than any inspired Green Day or Dixie Chicks rant.  <br /> <br />Mayer's cover of Hendix's \\"Bold As Love\\" captures the late rocker's drug-addled orignality. \\"Stop This Train\\" is a throwback to the \\"Room For Squares\\" album, specifally \\"3x5.\\" \\"I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)\\" is a grown-up, less gooey version of \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland.\\" \\"Vultures\\" and \\"Gravity\\" are two of the more defiant tracks, and were part of the \\"Try!\\" album.    <br /> <br />What's missing? A definitive wowser. A classic. But Mayer clearly used \\"Continuum\\" to work on turning \\"cute\\" into \\"cool.\\" On the next album, if the metamorphisis is complete, watch out
0525476881|4.0|Let me just say that this book was a winner from start to finish -- even without the theories and mathgrams Colin was obsessed with. Read other reviews for the plot line, I never retell that in a review because when I read a review, I want the bottome line: do I spend hard earned money on a book and will it satisfy that expenditure?<br /><br />AAOK will. The characters are alive, unique and jump off the page and into your head. They stay there, bugging you until you finish their story.<br /><br />That said, I was completely lost in the math and skimmed every line and detail of that. Someone with a brain adept at things mathematical will no doubt enjoy those entries. For me, it was lilke trying to read Chinese.<br /><br />John Green's voice was great, the writing was clear and concise, and I kept wondering how autobiographical AAOK was????
B000G759LW|3.0|\\"Back To Basics\\" is a gimmicky, derivative, boring, random collection of pop music until the second disc of this double CD, when Christina Aguilera teams with producer Linda Perry to record her best work. Ever. Does it rip off the anger and drama of Fiona Apple? Yep. But it's a start. <br /> <br />You've already heard the best track off the first disc in \\"Ain't No Other Man.\\" The other 11 tracks are entirely forgettable. Use the disc as a coaster.  <br /> <br />But after a circus-music intro, the second disc delivers a chaotic but passionate nine songs.  An orchestra accompanies several tracks, including \\"Welcome,\\" an angry rant about the emotional scars of teen stardom.  \\"Candyman\\" is a raunchy, playful riff on 1950s hit \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.\\" \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" and \\"I Got Trouble\\" are bluesy lounge tunes. \\"The Right Man\\" drips with absent-daddy melodrama and \\"Mercy On Me\\" is a low-rent version of Apple's \\"Criminal.\\"  <br /> <br />And then...\\"Save Me From Myself.\\" Tucked near the very end, here is Aguilera, at her highest octive, with a sweet, mournful ballad about her new husband, so pure you could rock a baby to it. It's eerie how effective this track is: When Aguilera's voice trails into a mock cry, it should seem shameless, but her vocal command, and the background violins, fold it into the mood of the song.  <br /> <br />It's a new side to the singer: Control. For once Aguilera doesn't seem impressed with her own voice. She's content to channel it, breathlessly, into music beyond her sexualized image
0671027387|5.0|As an early review put it, this book is \\"Unputdownable\\". Before picking up this book, pickup the laundry, pickup the kids from school, but don't pickup this book... unless you have the time to finish it. The pace at which the story unwinds would smoke most sportcars in a quarter mile, then it gets FASTER. Wonderful read. Thanks Dan Brown!
B0002STNQ2|5.0|As an Aritificial Intelligence major, I spent my last year studying swarm intelligence which Crichton obviously spent time studying as well. He nails it. But not only does he get the science right, he doesn't make learning swarm intelligence as boring as the text books. We should make it part of the curriculum. I got bored for 20 pages when he rants about the scientific details of swarms, but other than those few pages, the book moves along with interesting characters and great dialogue. Infidelity, family pressure, schizophrenia, nano-bugs, and government scandals...what more could you ask for in a cheap paperback? It's an easy read and won't bog you down with big words and complex sentence structure, exactly what you need to relax and enjoy a well-written story.
6305949980|5.0|NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is one of the best Halloween themed films ever made.  The characters and sets are imaginative, well thought out and fully realized especially for fantasy animation.  Danny Elfman's songs are hit show tune  hummable as well as having clever lyrics that add depth and move the plot forward.  Everything in the movie is amazingly and completely detailed making the DVD a joy to watch over and over again.  And of course it is hilariously funny.  It is probably not a great choice for the very young or for anyone easily offended by the unique and unusual but NIGHTMARE is a fantastic Halloween (or any time) choice for everyone else.
0684800713|5.0|Wow, having not read a single Hemingway novel (I put him in the old and boring category), I read this one and was blown away. Nothing super-spectacular, just well-written characters that make you read on and on without caring about laundry or dinner or cleaning the house. I read for hours and didn't want to stop other than to sleep and then start again. Witty writing that made me laugh out loud, great detailed descriptions of foreign countries, and unbelievable emotion evoked from a few characters that you've met in some form during your life. I see why he is one of the best. And at a shade over 100 pages, you can knock it out with a few glasses of wine.
6304711921|3.0|The animation was great and the plot was pretty good, although it was too similiar to \\"How The Grinch Stole Christmas.\\" However, this movie was boring at times and I couldn't wait for it to be over with. The major downfall of this movie was the music. It was as if one extremely long and boring song was being sung throughout. Even the Boogie Man had no boogie.
B000FGFSPG|5.0|I was wondering if this version of the nightwish - end of an era is the cd/dvd version or is this just the cd and not the dvd?.....Also...If it comes with the dvd is it the pal version or is it the NTSC version and can it be played in dvd players in the united states?....thanks
B000096I9G|5.0|This DVD set is a great collection for any Cure fan, including those who are just learning about the band. All three albums are fantastic, and as one of the reviewers mentioned, the sound quality is excellent and is arguably better than the originals, even when I am using my \\"1999 bottom-of-the line\\" speakers that I bought as a student.  <br /> <br />It is interesting how well all these albums have stood the test of time, although the Bloodflowers isn't that old, I suppose. I highly recommend this DVD.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I am prepared to review Corinne Bailey Rae's album as a person who one just found out about her a few months back and two as a person who only wants to hear good music and a perfect album. Corinne is an artist and a good one at that, there's no denying that. I think any artist who actually writes and sings their songs is one to be praised because music is music, doesn't matter who you are or where you're from good music is good music. She does a great job at setting a certain mood for this album and she keeps you in a calm mood for every song. You can understand what she's saying and how she feels about the subjects she chose.<br /><br />The album revolves mostly around love and not just for her boyfriend but for her family and life as well. She pieces her words perfectly and she never goes off the albums mood setting. Some of my friends and other reviewers complain about the lack of a hit song which is not true because \\"Like a Star\\" is an amazing song that to me is classic and if she were to release \\"I'd Like To\\" I think it would make a perfect video and hit song. Saying she doesn't have a hit meaning she doesn't have anything commercial to attract more people I don't think you'll find that here. My only problem with this album is that she could've put more mild songs on without breaking the mood setting. More songs like \\"I'd Like To\\" would probably benefit more than she thought because there is a possibility of this album getting a bit too calm. Overall I think this is an album to set a standard for the future of female singers because this girl is truly something of another kind.
1400079276|3.0|'Kafka on the Shore' is a return to surrealism for the often brilliant Haruki Murakami.  However unlike his masterpiece 'The Wind-up Bird Chronicle' this book seems to an overcooked, gratuitously bizarre mishmash of spirtualism, sexuality (and pedophilia), and violence.  Although I suppose the disjointed story, which would be difficult to explain (..and so I won't bother :-)), comes together in the end I regret saying that 'Kafka on the Shore' was not one of Murakami's better efforts.    However the book isn't a total loss.  There are interesting vignettes sprinkled throughout.  And although I found the translation strewn with too many Americanisms I did enjoy the prose and characterizations.  So while 'Kafka on the Shore' is a disappointment it is not a *bad* read.      Bottom line: Haruki Murakami has seemingly lost his way with this book.  Best left for his hardcore fans only.
0141439580|4.0|I really enjoyed this a lot. It's not quite as good as Pride and Prejudice, but it is better than Sense and Sensibility. It still has a lot of things to say that are still very much pertinent to modern times. Austen's longest work is an entertaining romp that shows what happens when one young girl gets too involved in the affections of (and between) others. Although overlong, it's still a really, really entertaining read.
B000000OQF|5.0|Unless you were born after 1980 you likely already know that this is one of the best rock records of all time!

0743487583|5.0|Every time Frankenstein is mentioned, I'd always picture the huge green guy in the movies. When my brother-in-law introduced and encouraged me to read the book, I thought that it wasn't going to be worth the time after I saw the poorly done movies. My brother-in-law said it was one of the best books he's ever read. I told him that I'll try to find the time to read it. It has been six years and I've never touched the book. One day when I was assigned to read a pleasure book for my English class, I randomly chose whichever book that was lying around my apartment. The book was Frankenstein and I'll say that I'm glad I picked it up.<br /><br />The first thing that caused me to be sucked into Mary Shelley's novel is the style of writing. Frankenstein's narrative is in first person point of view.  In the first part of Frankenstein, Walton, the ship captain who rescued Frankenstein, was the speaker. The narrator shifted to Frankenstein who told for the rest of the story. In other words, it was like telling a story in the story which Shelley did a great job at. In addition, I was amazed by the author's choice of words. Her vocabulary is fairly high which caused me to search in my dictionary every now and then.<br /><br />  The greatest part about Frankenstein is the depth and analysis of the monster which Frankenstein created. Victor Frankenstein discovered the science to infuse life onto the unanimated and thus created the monster. The monster is powerful in strength and huge in size but his mind is that of a newborn. Abandoned by his own creator, the monster learned about his surroundings by himself. He learned the seasons and how to create fire. All this was done by observation. Also by observation, he noticed love and companionship are essential for life. But it was men who taught him to revenge and evil.<br /><br />  Frankenstein an awesome book and I recommend it to anyone. There are a lot of themes that are covered in this book. After finishing the book, it gave me a deeper outlook on life. That is, don't judge a book by its cover.ook on life. That is, don't judge a book by its cover.  <br />
B000GCFO0I|2.0|Going into this movie I was expecting an edge of your seat thriller from my experience with the game, to my disappointment I found myself nodding off from boredom after 30 minutes. This movie could have been far more interesting and entertaining by foregoing the two realities which I don't remember being in the game. The ending also turned me off completely, it was one of those ungratifying ones that leave you feeling like you wasted two hours. The story was interesting at points but it took far to long to develop the plot almost felt like it was trying to fill time to make it longer. Rent it first for you may regret doing that.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|In a way, I wasn't looking forward to watching this movie, because of all the hype surrounding it.  And yet, it really delivered the goods.  The script was fantastic, and the actors were as well.  I suspect that most of them, who are by and large unknowns, will not be unknowns by this time next year.  \\"Brick\\" delivers a classic film noir set in a different locale than the hardboiled dramas of mid-century past, without becoming too cutesy or precious about it.<br /><br />\\"Brick\\" owes more than a little to \\"Twin Peaks,\\" including the first scene of the movie (which will seem more than a little familiar to TP fans) and its overall atmosphere.  \\"Brick\\" also tips its hat to \\"Blade Runner,\\" another film noir reimagined in a different genre, with some Vangelis-ish music near the beginning that will remind you of the Rachel/Deckard scenes in that movie.  Nevertheless, this is a really original movie that will appeal to anyone who likes a good story and a well-made film.<br /><br />And yes, that is the woman who plays Claire in \\"Lost.\\"
B00009W0U4|4.0|This hype surrounding this movie was justified.  The two major scenes were as graphic as advertised.  So, if you have a weak stomach I would advise that you not purchase this flick.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone who is unphased by graphic violence in cinema.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Yes. First of all, this album deserves your time simply because it is Tool, and Tool is the epitomy of incredibility and perfection when it comes to music. They are simply the best. <br /> <br />This album also deserves time to grow on you. Very few people liked this album when they first listened to it. I know I didn't. I thought, \\"there are too many filler tracks.\\" Then I listened to everything several more times and I realized, as I did with Lateralus, that this is pure genius. In fact, the epic that is Rosetta Stoned used to be a bunch of jumble to me. After forcing myself to listen to it 20 or 30 times, it became my favorite song on the album...everything about it is amazing. I could go off about the complex arrangements, the emotional melodies, the crazy time signatures, Maynard's incredible vocals, Danny's drumming, and a number of other things...but I will refrain.  <br /> <br />I think everybody made a mistake when going to buy this album...that mistake was that they expected it to be better than Lateralus. But the fact is, it doesn't get any better than Lateralus. Laterlaus was so perfect, that Tool could only hope to make something equally as good, just different. They succeeded. 10,000 Days does not flow as a unit...it is not meant to. It is a mosaic of memories from the lives and careers of Tool, and we all know that is not the most soothing topic, because they have certainly had their difficulties. Each song voices different thoughts and opinions of the band. Vicarious, Jambi, 10,000 Days/Wings for Marie, The Pot, Rosetta Stoned, Intension, Right in Two...these songs are all emotional journies. They don't have to add up to a greater whole. The length of these songs is a good thing...it just means more time for the feeling to evolve, and more time for Tool to work their magic. So in that sense, 10,000 Days is better than Lateralus on a more abstract level. <br /> <br />This album requires patience, dedication, and understanding to truly appreciate. Thatis why I waited 8 months after its release to write this review. And I would wager many of the people who did not give this album 5 stars earlier in the year would really like to go back and change their reviews. 10,000 Days is just a different kind of perfection from Tool. Close your eyes when you listen to this album. Let go of all premonitions you might have, and just ;et the music work on you. You will find that it reaches the human soul on a very deep level, and you won't regret the time you give to it. <br /> <br />
0060736267|5.0|\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" is named as one of the Century's Best Books by the New York Public Library for a reason. Originally published some 60 years ago, even to jaded readers of modern contemporary fiction, it remains highly readable. Every word.<br /><br />This was my mother's favorite book. I remember watching the movie with her when I was a child and for these two reasons, reading was slow. I couldn't help but reflect on the story as if they were MY memories rather than the main character's, a young girl named \\"Francie,\\" growing up in poverty in the early twentieth century. It reads like a series of both heartbreaking and entertaining anecdotes about life among first and second-generation immigrants in Brooklyn, New York. And while you can sense the starvation and the continual worry over making ends meet, through the eyes of the children, Francie and her brother, Neely, and also through their Aunt \\"Sissy,\\" who absolutely takes a bite out of life, it's difficult to feel sorry for them. They are prideful and make the most of all that they have. There's a scene where the children manage to stay standing as the tree vendor chucks a giant Christmas tree at them on Christmas Eve, which I will never forget. What will also stay with me are the feelings Francie discovers while growing up, about the different kinds of love she had for her family.<br /><br />I savored each page and didn't want it to end. For all the days I read, it was like spending time with my mom.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens is the author of [[ASIN:1932172300 It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club]].

On Tapestry Carole kept the songs for herself, and let her beautiful, unique voice interpret them.  Carole chose wisely here, and each song flows with a natural vibe.<br /><br />So Far Away, It's Too Late, You've Got A Friend, and Tapestry are my personal favorites, and in many ways these songs delt with the changes society was experiencing in the early 70's coupled with a yearning for comfort and security.  In particular, So Far Away delt with the mobile society we were becoming, and have continued to become.<br /><br />Where You Lead, and Will You Love Me Tomorrow were completly updated by Ms. King, and Way Over Yonder and the song she wrote for Aretha Franklin, Natural Women,  showed that her versatility was not limited to her songwriting.

B000HA4WT8|4.0|It really doesn't matter too much that almost every scene in this film is so far beyond believable, for this is not a movie that's designed to make sense...it's designed to keep the audience in its seats, and in that sense this movie soars.  Like the two films that proceeded it, `The Fast and the Furious - Tokyo Drift' is a high octane rollercoaster ride littered with fast cars and fast women, and for its target audience (teenage boys) it hits every mark just right.  Now I am a huge fan of the first film, and a minor fan of the second.  I had absolutely no expectations for this film (I thought that the previews looked lame, and no one from either of the previous films was making an appearance, well, Vin is in the last 30 seconds but that doesn't count) so when I watched it I was increasingly impressed with how much I was enjoying myself. <br /> <br />I'll point out first off that I was much relieved to see that Zachery Ty Bryan was only in the first few minutes of the film and that his character was not explored throughout the film...I can't stand him.  That aside, Lucus Black (Friday Night Lights & Jarhead) does a great job here as Sean.  Lucus is a much better actor than the overrated Paul Walker (sure, he's got great abs but his acting ability is below B-Grade) and actually made his character interesting.  Sung Kang was also very good as Han and Brian Tee was believable in all his irritating bad-boyness as DK.  Bow Wow takes the place of Ludacris and Ja Rule before him as the rapper-guy side kick, and he does an alright job, but he just doesn't really fit here (Luda was by far the best of the three).  Nathalie Kelly plays Neela, the girl Sean is fighting for, and she is amply hot enough to vie for attention. <br /> <br />Sure the plot of weak and the relationships are unbelievable, I mean who can honestly say that they feel a kingpin to the Japanese/Chinese/Oriental (whatever it was) Mafia is going to agree to have his nephew and some stranger race to squash their beef?  But, like I said, it doesn't have to make sense, it doesn't have to be believable.  `The Fast and the Furious' franchise have done quite well for themselves giving the growing young boys of the world exactly what they want, sleek fast cars coupled with hot young tail.
B00021R7CG|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when it originally aired . Good acting, good special effects (for its time, that is)It's amazing how this situation could actually occur during our present world situation. There has been incidences of \\"compromised\\" nuclear materials. Now Iran and North Korea among others are rapidly becoming nuclear-active. They say that movies are a reflection of real life. Who knew they could be prolific as well. Enjoy. My favorite saying from the movie...\\"Them ain't bogies, thems bandits!\\"...Powers Boothe
0143036556|2.0|I bought this book thinking that the author would have something enlightening to say about our society. Instead, what I found was an introductory chapter filled with self-promotion (he describes all the books he's written, the journals where his articles have been printed, how many degrees he has, etc.) and a defensive attitude that this book will be objective - that he (the author) is neither environmentalist nor \\"non-environmentalist\\". Yet how can claim he is sitting on the fence when one of his book's premises is that the collapse of societies can be partially attributed to  climate change? In order to assuage the criticisms of \\"non-environmentalists\\" he is  essentially denying his initial bias. Secondly, as a whole, the book itself presents little that is not already published in greater detail in works by other authors. Diamond has chosen to rehash typical examples (e.g. Easter Island, abandoned Viking settlements, etc.) for failed societies caused by mis-management of land and resources. If the reader is looking for something that is not already well documented elsewhere, then this book will be a disappointment. If we compare this book to works of somewhat outlandish theses (e.g. Gavin Menzies, Erich von Daniken), at least those revolutionary ideas, while seemingly unthinkable, are an entertaining read. Diamond's narrative is dry and uninspired.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Not all that realistic, but I enjoyed it.  I love Bruce Willis in this movie, he plays the part of a tough Oil Rig guy/loving overprotective dad.  I don't want to give away any more details than I have to, but there's quite a bit of comedy in this movie, a lot of action, and drama as well, so there's a little bit of everything.  In addition to this movie, I reccomend the Abyss, which is my fav' movie of all time.
0743289412|4.0|Lisey's Story does what it should: it keeps a reader interested, and it entertains. Overall it's a good book, if marginally more \\"sensitive\\" than most male readers will like or possibly tolerate, and it adds immeasurably to the gravitas of Stephen King's career. I love when King writes something like this, because it gives his fans one more rock to throw back at those (snobs) who condemn King as some sort of horror writing hack. Not since King released Bag of Bones back in the late 1990's has he tapped into this sort of storytelling, and even then the comparison only goes so far, since Bag of Bones, also a touching love story, did contain supernatural and horror elements, and Lisey's Story, for all its real life evil, mostly does not. Lisey's Story concerns a middle-aged woman named Lisey DeBusher Landon, who is the widow of a celebrated writer named Scott Landon, who died two years before the main section of the novel takes place. While Scott Landon, a man who endured a nightmare of abuse in childhood, and was later shot and nearly killed by a demented stalker, was beyond any doubt in love with his wife, throughout his lifetime he would at times \\"vanish\\" into a sort of inner universe all his own, a place removed from the world's stress and pain, and Landon termed this imaginary vista \\"Boo'ya Moon\\".  The couple actually had a sort of imaginary language shared by only the two of them (and if there is a glaring weakness in this novel it's the fact that after a chapter or two this private language does grow wearying) and the suddenness of Scott's death from a virulent strain of infection leaves his soul mate Lisey facing a starkly empty existence. She begins the process of reading and compiling Scott's papers and finds that through his writings in a way he is still with her, speaking to her in the form of revelations and mysteriously odd passages he wrote and which remain behind. Lisey's grief is interrupted by a number of outside forces, however, the most menacing being a disturbing threat that is aimed her way, promising that she will be brutally attacked unless she passes all of her late husband's papers on to a certain villainous professor. Lisey's Story is heavy on flashbacks, lacks subtlety in a few places, and might have been better at under five-hundred pages, instead of nearly six. It's not a great book, and it's not going to endear King to the literary set---which one of these days is going to collectively drown in a rainstorm---but despite all that, I found it drew my interest and told a good story, and further that upon its completion it left a behind nice sense of satisfaction, as a novel should.

B000HCO8IQ|4.0|I had the pleasure of seeing the Scissor Sisters perform at the Warfield Theater last month in San Francisco, and as expected, they put on a terrifically entertaining show mixing kitsch-centric glam and disco-driven beats. You can leave your boogie shoes on while listening to their damnably catchy sophomore effort. The five-person band kicks off the disc with the double-clap bop of their radio hit, \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\", which sounds very much like a sly response to Leo Sayer's 1976 hit, \\"You Make Me Feel Like Dancin'\\", complete with Giorgio Moroder-style disco riffs and co-writer (and obvious inspiration) Elton John pounding the keys. The gender-bending romp, \\"She's My Man\\", is almost as dance happy.<br /><br />Even though the lyrics speak of committing suicide, \\"I Can't Decide\\" seems to reflect Elton's Honky Chateau phase with a bit of Edison Lighthouse's \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\\" thrown in for good measure. Other fun, derivative tracks include \\"Oooh\\" with Bee Gees-inspired falsetto voices, the Ziggy Stardust stylings of a \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\", and an intro to \\"Lights\\" that sounds like Lipps Inc. reborn. The band drives harder on \\"Paul McCartney\\", which doesn't sound much like the former Beatle/Wing; and \\"Kiss You Off\\" with a deceptively calm chorale opening segueing into a song that sounds like a hybrid of Blondie's \\"Call Me\\" and Pat Benatar's power chord hits.<br /><br />There appears to be a greater percentage of slower tracks this time around, and fortunately, they make for nice respites - the short, aptly named period piece, \\"Intermission\\"; the more conventional-sounding love song, \\"Might Tell You Tonight\\"; and the melodramatic \\"The Other Side\\", which bears a striking resemblance to Al Stewart's \\"Year of the Cat\\" with a saxophone solo and even a sampling of late-period Judy Garland speaking at the close. The disc ends on a rather magnanimous note with the \\"We Are the World\\" sentiments of \\"Everybody Wants the Same Thing\\".  If \\"Ta Dah!\\" lacks the nostalgic surprise of the band's debut disc, this one compensates by adding dimension to their trademark buoyant sound.lgic surprise of the band's debut disc, this one compensates by adding dimension to their trademark buoyant sound.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Meatloaf has said that he planned a trilogy of Bat out of Hell after the first one became popular. I have the CD and it rocks!! Some songs are metal and others are the traditional Meatloaf sounding songs.<br /><br />A song that may confuse some people will be that he does a cover of \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\". People are going to say, isn't that a Celine Dion song? The truth is that it was written by Jim Steinman, the man who wrote Meatloaf's biggest hits. It was going to be on Bat out of Hell 2, but they decided to save it for the third album.<br /><br />There are some really good tracks on this album, but I think that my favorite song is \\"Alive\\". Overall, I think that this album was worth the long wait and most fans should be pleased. Like I said, some songs may not seem Meatloaf, but it does have a touch. They aren't completely out of place and it all comes together in the end and makes one fun album that you will play a lot.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell III The Monster Is Loose is awesome.  Of course, I expected nothing less from the best performer ever!  I have had October 31 marked on my calendar since I first heard about this album on the American Idol  final last spring.  It was sooo worth the wait.  Meat Loaf sounds great and every song on the album is suited for his one-of-a-kind voice!  This album is a must for all Meat Loaf fans.  For you youngsters who don't know who Meat Loaf is, this is your chance to be introduced to an absolute legend!
B00005JPAD|4.0|Wow!  I had forgotten how fun a movie can be.  This is Scorsese's best since Goodfellas.  There, I said it.  And it's true.  It's a guy's flick that the ladies can enjoy, namely because of Matt Damon and Leo DiCaprio.  The performances are great all around - Alec Baldwin, Nicholson and Wahlberg deserve much props.  The dialogue is macho, hilarious, smart, filthy.  The storyline twists and turns.  Good cops, bad cops, undercover cops, gangsters and thieves.  Oh, my!  The film takes the whole cop movie genre to all new heights.  Forget all the CSI and NYPD Blue piffle - it's boring; we've seen it all before.  The Departed!  If you've forgotten how fun an experience at the movies can be, run out and see The Departed.  Nuff said.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|6 hours of hedonistic KISS on video for around 20 bucks? You can't go wrong. For the die-hards - yes, there are a few Pro Shot videos that they left out of the two-disc set (Houston 8/13/76, Anaheim 8/20/76 and Houston 9/1/77) - but the footage that is on here (and boy is this thing jam packed) is for the most part super. <br /> <br />I've been collecting KISS video for over 25 years, and I have gone through many different versions and varying quality copies of the footage on this set, and here is my take: <br /> <br />2/17/94 Long Beach: Old 8mm slient footage of the song \\"Acrobat\\". Quality is about the same as the footage that has been in bootleg trading circles for the last few years. This is only a portion of the source tape. The silent footage has had an audio track from 4/17/74 Memphis dubbed in. <br /> <br />4/29/74 Mike Douglas Show: Outstanding quality of the Gene Simmons interview and \\"Firehouse\\", probably culled from the shows' master reels. My question is why was some of the interview portion cut out? Only 1 minute folks. They could have kept the \\"kissing contest\\" in. <br /> <br />1/31/75 San Francisco: Outstanding quality of the entire show (minus the ending which does not exist). The copies that have been circulating in bootleg trading trading circles are generally excellent, and they have some slow-motion video spliced over the damaged parts of the tape. This release looks untouched (and thats a good thing!), with a few warts left in. Superb audio. Only complaint is that the first 30 seconds of the video are cut out. We don't miss any music, but why not just let the reel go from the beginning? <br /> <br />4/1/75 Midnight Special: Great performances of \\"She\\" and \\"Black Diamond\\", but the quality could be better. I've seen cleaner copies on bootleg. <br /> <br />1975 Promo Clips: Perfect quality of the promotional videos \\"C'Mon And Love Me\\" and \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\". Sounds like the remastered audio of the studio tracks from Dressed to Kill have beenused. <br /> <br />10/75 Cadillac, MI: Great stuff. This footage has existed in bootleg circles for years and is generally decent, but this is hands down better. And the brief live footage from the Cadillac concert is a welcome site! <br /> <br />1/26/76 Detroit: Performance wise, as good as it gets. Entire show. The audio sounds great, and the video quality is very clean. There are a few glitches, but they are presumably on the master tape. Only complaint is that the first 45 seconds and the last 10 seconds of the video are cut out. We don't miss any music, but why not just let the reel go from end to end? <br /> <br />8/21/76 'So It Goes TV': Great quality, nice documentary piece. Better than all circulating versions in trading circles. <br /> <br />10/29/76 Paul Lynde Halloween Special: Decent quality, but two songs are missing (\\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"Beth\\") from the broadcast, and they do exist. Where are they? Only 6 minutes folks. They could have kept the songs in. <br /> <br />4/2/77 Tokyo: Full concert. Very nice. This one cleaned up well. <br /> <br />5/28/77 Don Kirschner's Rock: Great quality of the lip-synched performances of \\"I Want You\\", \\"Love 'Em, Leave 'Em\\" and \\"Hard Luck Woman\\". <br /> <br />9/2/77 Houston: Over the years, this probably has been the widest circulated Kiss concert video in trading circles. A few songs taken from this perfomance have already been officially released on Kiss Exposed. Many of the bootlegs in circulation have been lightened; this copy looks like it has been left as it was filmed be the in-house crew at the Summit. It's a bit dark at times, but generally fantastic. Only complaint is that the first 60 seconds and the last 3 complilation minutes of the video are cut out. We don't miss any music, but why not just let the reel go from end to end? Also, if you have this show on bootleg, the master tape has still shots from the performance in between the songs. On this release, the choice was made to forgo the still shots and fade to black in between the songs. <br /> <br />Bonus discs: 1/25/76 Detroit is complete (no encores - they don't exist on tape) and is available at Best Buy. The 12/20/77 Landover is close to complete (12 songs) and is available at Wal Mart. The 2/18/77 New York is only half the show, and is available at most music retailers. Why the hack job on the 2/18/77 is beyond me. I bought the set with 1/25/76 bonus disc, and the quality is very good. But the bonus disc has no menus or chapter points/song points. <br /> <br />Can anyone corroborate if their bonus disc(s) have menus and chapter points? <br /> <br />Geez folks, they could have taken the hour required to make menus and chapter points on the bonus discs!
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Taylor Swift is the best musical artist to come out in a very long time.  Her voice is magical.  Her songs are so very sincere.  The music behind her voice is very crisp and clean.  I already have 5 of these CD's and am going to buy 2 more.  There is one in every CD player we own.  You will not be able to get enough of these songs.  This CD gets better each time you listen to it.  It's a very refreshing change from anything else out there.  I sure hope we'll be hearing much more from Taylor Swift.  She's incredible.  Thank you, Taylor.  Thank you for sharing your life, your voice and your songs with us.  We've been waiting for someone like you for a very long time.

B000GYI32M|3.0|I'm a 23 year old male and I love the O.C. I try to never miss a week of the show and I try to keep up with all of the main characters. I loved the first season of this show. Creator Josh Schwartz made a show that was honest, geniune, comedic and dramatic all at the same time. Ryan, Seth, Summer and Marissa were the type of people you saw in high school: clingy, quirky and ever so lost and confused going through the high school life. Sandy and Kirstin have more of the typical marriage I am used to seeing: it's not perfect, but deep down they still love each other like crazy and will always be there for each other. They also are good parents to Ryan and Seth. This show was just a great show. It did a good job of getting rid of main characters that were unnecessary (Luke) and ending characters that ran a good time with the show (Caleb Nichol, Jimmy Cooper). <br /> <br />The third season of the O.C. is not on the same level as season two and definitely not on the same level as one. Creator Schwartz took a break from being the head-runner for the show, and you can definitely see that in the quality of writing. The beginning episodes are just irritating. The characters of Charlotte (Jeri Ryan, normally I love her work, but didn't feel her in this role), Dean Haus (Eric Marbus, who is doing an awesome job on \\"Ugly Betty\\".), and Taylor Townsend were all annoying and took too much focus off of the main characters. Luckily, Charlotte and the Dean were dropped, but Taylor remained. Though she eventually went from a nemisis to a friend, I still had trouble accepting her in a recurring role. Marissa once again was the center of all that was dramatic in the O.C. She first was kicked out of school, then befriended a surfer named Johnny, who has a crush on her yet is friends with Ryan, Johnny dies in an accident, Marissa then hooks up with Johnny's rival Volcheck, by far and away the worst character of this season. Volcheck pushes every single button on Ryan, causing much grief inhis life.  Marissa then must deal with her sister Catlin returning to the O.C. She is by far and away the character with the most conflicts and drama during the season. <br /> <br />However, that doesn't mean the others go unnoticed. Kirstin deals with staying sober and starting a new career with Julie. Sandy takes over the Newport Group and almost becomes the man he despises, Caleb Nichol. Seth runs into problems with telling the truth and being straightforward with others. Summer worries about Seth and their relationship with the future of college. Julie goes from the rich house to the trailer park before embarking on a new relationship. Jimmy Cooper makes a return before departing once again. Ryan tries to move on from Marissa and focus on college, but always seems to be there to clean up her mess and take care of her as usual. The ending on the season finale is one of the most shocking in recent television history. <br /> <br />The overabundance of annoying characters, plus the underwritten stories for characters like Seth, Ryan and Summer bothered me a bit. However, season 4 could be better. Schwartz is said to be back as the head-runner for the show, and Catlin Cooper becomes a main part of the cast. It'll hopefully help the O.C. bounce back after a dud-like third season.

6305897786|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Depp does a great job in these \\"normal\\" man roles and this is no exception.  Intriguing look in to the rare book collecting world which made the first part of the movie very enjoyable.  The second part of the movie was less enjoyable for me because it was becoming predictable and had nothing to do with reading the book.    The movie is loosely based on the book \\"The Club Dumas\\".  If this movie does anything right it is exposing people to what I feel is one of the best books I have ever read.  If you decide to read \\"The Club Dumas\\" you will know what I mean when I say \\"loosely based\\".
0553212443|4.0|\\"Every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips, should be boiled with his  <br />own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart!\\" <br /> <br />Next to the birth of Jesus, this has to be the most popular Christmas story.  It has been adapted into so many variations (my favorite is \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol.\\").  However, the story still remains fresh and a pleasure to read. <br /> <br />A short novel, this is still classic Dickens.  His characters have depth and even insignificant characters are given a human quality.  Of course, the curmudgeon Scrooge and his transformation is the focus of the novel, and Dickens delivers an enthralling, somewhat eerie story as the wraiths (spirits) of Christmas attempt to instill a human warmth in Scrooge's cold heart. <br /> <br />There is nothing new or earth-shattering in the novel.  Almost all the adaptations have more or less adapted the text of Dickens novel.  There are a few extra places and people that are visited that don't appear the movie adaptations.  However, overall it is the same story that you know and love, and a great way to get into the Christmas spirit.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|<br />Pop, blues, soul, classic 1970s R&B - all these things are brought to bear in the music of Corinne Bailey Rae, not to mention forming an indie band called Helen when she was 16 and being a big Led Zeppelin fan in her formative years. <br />Rae, 26, has a rich variety of experience making music, including sanctifying Primal Scream songs for her church choir, and this album sounds incredibly assured for a debut.  <br /> <br />The key track is 'Enchantment', which is utterly bewitching with scratchy backbeat samples and sprinklings of lush keyboards the perfect setting for a voice which simply melts in the ears. It brings summer warmth to a dreich February day, oozing the same languid loving as the single 'Put Your Records On'.  <br /> <br />Comparisons with Norah Jones are lazy and easily made, but this girl is much more about pop chutzpah than slick jazz sophistication. <br /> <br />'Choux Pastry Heart' is not as flaky an idea as you might suppose, gliding through love gone wrong territory with the tastiest coating on that bitter pill to be heard in a long time. <br /> <br />For now, it seems Bailey Rae is required - or has chosen - to stick firmly to the middle ground: songs like 'Breathless' and 'Enchantment' are so inoffensive you wonder quite how those comparisons to a hard-living icon such as Holiday could come about. <br /> <br />But one song, the truly enchanting 'Like a Star', left an impression that her true sound - the music she would love to make if not for the interference of producers or chart-worriers - is, if not gritty or grimy, then at least heart-baringly honest. Real soul, in other words. <br /> <br />A glowing introduction to a significant talent. <br /> <br />
0743289412|5.0|King returns to his best form in this extraordinary book. This is a return to the brilliant, edgy writing of Hearts in Atlantis, combined with the subtle suggestive shadowy fear of Black House, Desperation, Insomnia.<br /><br />King has his pacing down cold, his characters fully developed, and this book brings back the wonder of King at the top of his form; going well beyond the \\"genre,\\" grabbing you by the lapel (or by the throat) and not letting you go until he's quite done with you.<br /><br />King's range (from the Dark Tower series, to Pet Sematary, to Shawshank) has always been remarkable; and there is a certain condescension among some that prevents praising the extraordinary quality of his writing (he's just too popular to be all that good) but I would argue that he is among our best writers, and to overlook his work is to miss out on American Literature just as surly as it would have been to turn up your nose (as many did) at Melville or Mailer.<br /><br />In any case, this is a hell of a story, and highly recommended.
0446528056|5.0|Wow. I had become quite bored with Sparks' latest novels, feeling they were cookie-cutter romance novels, but this book is a return to his old writing style.

Well done, well written, and just fabulous.
0783240503|2.0|I wanted SOOOO much to like this film.  I think this is one of Webber's most memorable work with powerful, emotional melodies that grab at you and won't let go.  As some other reviewers stated, it's the kind of music that burns into your brain and no matter how many times you hear it, it still impacts your emotions.  And yes, the collaboration between Webber and Rice is perfect -- great melodies....some lilting, some deeply poinent, some jovial --- combined that with lyrics that are intellegent, witty and simply as clever as any Cole Porter ever penned.  And yes, we can find many many musical aficanados who will swear that JOSEPH is the best of all of ALW's prolific compositions. <br /> <br />That being said, how is it that we get THIS as the movie extrapolation?  How is it that THIS winds up as the lackluster record that future generations will have of this beloved work?  JOSEPH deserves MUCH better than this.  We have PHANTOM OF THE OPERA; we have JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR; we have EVITA (flawed as it is).  But what do we have for JOSEPH?  Some thrown-together, almost amateurish, direct-to-video instead of a real movie designed specifically for the screen.  Now I am not knocking the performances, but JOSEPH needed the SUPERSTAR treatment, not a filmed (er, VIDEO-ed) taping of the stage show.  Now mind you, taking a stage production and converting it to the screen is by no means an easy task, especially with a musical, but it has been done very successfully before and specifically with Webber's other works (look, SUPERSTAR and OPERA).  In the hands of a Norman Jewison or a Schumacher, one could only DREAM of what a magnificent film this could have been. <br /> <br />Alas, what we got is this high-schoolish looking production which, as far as I know, has never even had a theatrical release in the USA.  So I guess if you are content with watching this kind of thing on your tv set, all well and good, but after personally hoping for years that JOSEPH would eventually morph into a major, worthy motion picture production the quality of Jewison's SUPERSTAR, to be handed this instead....well, let's just say it's a big disappointment....the light is dimming and this dream is too.    <br /> <br />Then one can still say, this IS JOSEPH, and even Donny Osmond can't completely ruin it.  And if it's all we got, then I guess it is what it is and I certainly wouldn't advise anyone NOT to see it, just don't expect to be wowed....except, of course, by the music and lyrics which will ALWAYS knock one's socks off.
033034837X|5.0|I am a late bloomer where Ken Follett is concerned.  Started with his first, the Modigliani Scandal, wasn't too impressed, and then read this one.  I couldn't put it down.  Maybe it is because my background is in science and medicine, but I think this is an absolute must read for anyone who loves to have the supense reach out and grab you by the throat and not let you go until the last page.  Then again, I always love it when the big BAD gets done in by the plucky underdog!  I guess I will be plowing through Mr. Follett's other suspense novels now.
B000093OUA|5.0|If you have only one Gary Moore CD, it should be this one.  It is all blues, but his rock/Hendrix influences explode all over the tracks.  The solo guitar work is phenomenal - soaring, lyrical, and moving.  I was especially impressed by the tightness of the rhythm section, a foundation without which the vocals and solo work might have much less effective and anchored.  I would have liked a little more solo Hammond organ, but what was there was incredible.  All in all, this is a CD you can listen to over and over and find something new to appreciate at each sitting.
0743544676|5.0|I listened to this while driving for several hours and it made the drive enjoyable.   <br /> <br />I am a guy and I can tell you that guys can be just as susceptible to deluding themselves and continuing idiotic relationships as any women who may be drawn to this audio book.  And as a guy I got a lot out of it. <br /> <br />He (or she) is just not that into you is the point of the book, so why get it?  The answer is so that you can understand at a much deeper level and with more clarity what is going on.  The book exposes the garbage you may be telling yourself when you come up with reasons (make excuses for) behavior that you would normally know was absurd, but you are identifying with the other person to the point that you have lost perspective.  The book doesn't make that point about identifying with the other person, but that seems to be what is happening.  But if the book were to put it in terms of identifying with the other person who is doing you wrong, it would have said \\"You are identifying with them and letting them get away with mistreating and disrespecting you and ignoring your needs and they are clearly not identifying with you at all\\" <br /> <br />The book looks at reasons we give ourselves that allows us to accept that which is wrong for us to accept.  Though these reasons do not feel like excuses to us, the book bluntly looks at a huge number of excuses and deconstructs them and renders them in the form where they are invalid and what is happening is wrong.  <br /> <br />This book is figuratively about not accepting crumbs instead of a meal and recognizing that crumbs are crumbs. A person who is often too busy to be attentive and available to you is just not that into you.  If a person was really into you they would make space in their lives for you and you wouldn't be drawn to the title of this book to sort things out. <br /> <br />The excuses the book addresses come in two flavors: excuses the other person gives us as to why we are an afterthoughtrather than having a central position in their lives and thinking; and, excuses we make to ourselves as to why it is okay we are an afterthought rather than central in their lives. <br /> <br />One thing the book does is continually contrast the way someone who just isn't that into you behaves with the way someone who was really into you would act. <br /> <br />This audio book is very useful as it offers a powerful model of better thought patterns for anyone who is drawn to the book based on the title.   <br /> <br />If you are drawn to the title of this book you absolutely positively should get this book.
1932100660|5.0|I understand that while certain industries may feel threatened by this book by Dr. Campbell, for my health and the health of my family, I am very glad that he wrote The China Study and shared his experiences with us.  It essentially confirmed what I already was coming to understand about nutrition and the foods we eat (that are many times processed, manufactured, advertised, and sold), but now the confirmation was backed by extensive research that was in depth yet written in a way that many people can understand. <br />   I found The China Study to be not only informative but respectful in a sort of \\"Here's the research, what we found, what others have found...so you decide.\\" <br />   It's good to see a high level research scientist such as Dr. Campbell speaking truths AND reaching a broad audience, because there certainly has been far too much of the \\"other\\" - an in huge abundance - for far too long (and look where we are now, health-wise, as a country?  Or shall I say \\"disease-wise\\"?) <br /> <br />Mike McKenna, Johnsburg, IL
B000FQ4M58|5.0|This album is pure genius.  Steinman may not have had his hands in this project directly, but his presence and power are felt all over it.  I am not in love with Child's compositions, but his production is flawless (as always).  Meat's voice hasn't been this good since the original Bat.   <br /> <br />Tracks to take note of: <br /> <br />\\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" - FAR better than the crap Celine put out! <br /> <br />\\"Bad For Good\\" - Brian May adds something to this that nobody else could <br /> <br />\\"In The Land Of The Pig, The Butcher Is King\\" - WOW! SICK!  Definitely one of Steinman's best and I'm glad it showed up here!  I cannot imagine this Steinman great going to another vocalist. <br /> <br />I must admit, that the title song \\"The Monster Is Loose\\" is a great piece.  It is definitely the best Ive ever heard from Child. <br /> <br />This album lives up to the hype and definietly deserves to wear the name \\"Bat Out Of Hell!\\" <br />
0307341542|4.0|I do not read mysteries or thrillers as a rule (Rule:  They are a waste of time).  Something drew me into this book, though, and I am glad I read it.  For a bit at the beginning, I wasn't sure I wanted to keep going, but I suggest that the faint-of-heart trust the writing and read on.  This is a real page-turner (in the best sense of that shopworn description).  Another novel, soon, please!
B000IMUYJM|4.0|In the 70's, nobody wanted to see THE SOUND OF MUSIC or WEST SIDE STORY anymore. They wanted to see JAWS, more films like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, cheap and potent violence like THE HILLS HAVE EYES, THE TEXAS CHEINSAW MASSACRE and THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT... and DEATH WISH...<br /><br />Those were the times...<br /><br />BLACK CHRISTMAS was one of those films that helped drive the audience towards that new genre that was just emerging: cheap, violent, nasty, urban terror where mass murderers would go bolder and bolder until the 80's came bringing those countless sequels. (laughs)<br /><br />It's time for Christmas and all the girls at the sorority make plans for the holiday... except Jessica who is left behind with her own problems (she is thinking about an abortion and fighting her boyfriend who is againt is). Suddenly, strange anonymous phone calls are beginning to put them on edge. When Clare disappears, they contact the police, who don't express much concern. A girl if found dead in the park. They set up a wiretap to the sorority house and Jessica agrees to play the part...<br /><br />...but the killer has been inside the house all this time doing what he does best. Kill.<br /><br />Obviously this film is quite an interesting entry in the 70's typical slasher movie. And a very good one. And it is sad that nobody today even remembers about all the stir it caused back then.<br /><br />It is not as violent as today's slashers and... if we think about it... none of those 70's films are. But thirty years after... they still got the goods and many of us cann still feel the \\"magic\\" those audiences felt back then.<br /><br />BLACK CHRISTMAS is a good example and should be given a look.<br /><br />Those who were alive back then (even the younger ones like me who weren't allowed to see them) and caught most of these films when they were fresh will agree with me... there's something about those films that is missing today... a flavour, perhaps... I don't know...  :Pknow...  :P
0743298020|5.0|And while I'm no Harriet Klausner, I tend to read 2-3 books a week. <br /> <br />After seeing some of the advance marketing, I took this book out of the library on one-week loan.  Well, there was no way to finish it in a week for me, so lush was the writing that I found myself savoring and not skimming through it.  And then for the first time... I found it hard to return a book to the library.  I didnt want to part with it. <br /> <br />Setterfields prose is engrossing, loving and hypnotic.  It is one of those books where someone will ask you \\"What's it about?\\" and you will pause and say, \\"Um...two women.  One a dying writing and one her biographer and the hidden life the writer has lead. But really, there is so much more.  You've just got to read it.\\" <br /> <br />Margaret (our narrator) and Vida - two women so different yet so similar in their quest for personal identity and for the value of story (both fiction and non-fiction) to the individual.  It is hard to know as you are reading who's story you are more caught up in. <br /> <br />And then, just when I thought it was \\"simply\\" one of those wonderful character books (you know, the ones where you are just completely pulled into the life of the characters that the plot really doesnt matter just so you can stay with the people) -- a true gothic mystery appeared and kept me up for hours so I could finish it. <br /> <br />Now I have to buy my own copy.   <br />And copies for my friends who love to devour a good book.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I have followed Meat for a long time, and I even met him once and partied with him in Dallas. He is a rocker and dedicated to having a fun stage show, and giving his all to his fans.

Any selfrespecting Meat Loaf Fan had better run out and get this one. With the people he has working with him on this can you doubt what I am saying. Great CD 5 stars isnt enouth :)<br /><br />J.

B000002LVB|4.0|The Velvet Underground followed up their mellow third record with the more rocking Loaded. Doug Yule, who first appeared on the  previous release, sang lead on four tracks. Drummer Moe Tucker was pregnant and unable to play, so Doug's brother Billy sat in on drums. John Cale had departed after the Velvet's second album. Finally, Lou Reed left the band shortly before Loaded's release, and said that it had not been mastered to his satisfaction. Obviously, this was a different kind of Velvet Underground record.<br /><br />The same two songs are always the first to be mentioned in every review of the Velvets' last album. \\"Sweet Jane\\" is rightfully one of the band's best-known numbers, as it is a jubilant pop song with sturdy guitar riffs and self-assured vocals by Lou Reed. It is also a tune about the joy of domestic bliss, which wasn't exactly Reed's signature topic. The other well-known track on Loaded is \\"Rock And Roll\\". Now, I hate to expose the naked emperor, but this is not that great of a song. It is very pedestrian, not very inspired, and frankly quite trite.  Their is no reason for it to be praised as one of the songs that best displays Reed's songwriting talent, especially when there are several other songs on this album that more rightly qualify. Among these are the Mamas and Papas-esque \\"Who Loves the Sun?\\", which opens the record. Initially, this may strike the listener as the type of song that represents everything that the Velvets were against on their first two albums. But let us not forget that the first track on their debut was the hazzy, sunny pop song \\"Sunday Morning\\". (And as I said in another review, the opening track of their eponymous third album - \\"Candy Says\\" - must have been quite a shock to first-time listeners as well.)  In general, Reed eschews songs of sex and drugs for more down-to-earth subjects. The lyrics are more pensive if not profoundly philosophical, such as on the eloquent \\"New Age\\" (which contains the cringe-inducing rhyme of \\"Mitchum\\" and \\"catch him\\"), the tuneful \\"I Found A Reason\\", and the closing track \\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin'\\". \\"Cool It Down\\" has an old-fashioned quality to it, and is another highlight on Loaded. However, although \\"Head Held High\\" and \\"Train Round the Bend\\" recall some of the manic moments of the band's first two records, they are lyrically repetitive and uninteresting, as is \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\".<br /><br />These soft spots are not enough to drag the album down too much, but like the ones on The Velvet Undergroud, they are enough to lose it a few points. The fact that their last two albums were different does not by itself cause them to be the slightly lesser records that they are. Rather, it is the fact that Lou Reed - who was the lone leader of the band now - simply sounds uninspired some (but certainly not all) of the time. But please don't let me be misunderstood - the positive is absolutely worth accentuating on Loaded. Lou Reed's pop songs were among the best he's ever written, and his thoughtful side shone brightly in tracks that were of slower tempo but impenetrable vitality. While more accessible in the conventional sense, it is not the place to begin a Velvet Underground collection. It is still best to start with The Velvet Underground & Nico or The Best of the Velvet Underground: Words and Music of Lou Reed. (Loaded was the second of VU's studio albums that I heard.) It's too bad that the original release does not include the full-length version of \\"Sweet Jane\\", which can be only found on the Fully Loaded edition or the box set. Although I wouldn't recommend buying Fully Loaded just to have that version of the song, it does have some first-rate stuff like \\"Ride Into the Sun\\", \\"Ocean\\", and \\"I'm Sticking With You\\", the latter two of which can also be found on the very worthwhile collection simply titled VU. (And you can't really go wrong with the box set, if you are willing to take that plunge. It contains what is probably the bravest and most influential body ofwork in American rock.)<br /><br />To many fans of popular music, the end of an era occurred in April 1970, when The Beatles broke up. To fans of alternative rock, an era ended a few months later, when Lou Reed left The Velvet Underground. Loaded was the last of their proper albums, and to some, the least. But if this is the weakest link, then The Velvet Underground's chain will remain forever unbroken.work in American rock.)<br /><br />To many fans of popular music, the end of an era occurred in April 1970, when The Beatles broke up.

B00002RAOU|5.0|Bava plays a Hitchcock like trick at the beginning of BAY OF BLOOD, using Isa Miranda precisely as Hitchcock used Janet Leigh in the first reels of PSYCHO.  Surely once you had secured the services of one of the greatest international stars of all time, you weren't going to kill her off--and so quickly!  But that is precisely Bava's strategy, and that's precisely what he does.  The gesture of this shock effect is largely lost to contemporary audiences who don't remember Isa Miranda properly, but she was still a potent force in 1971 when BAY OF BLOOD (also known as TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE) was produced.  When you kill off your biggest star within the first fifteen minutes of the movie, in an especially brutal way, you are signalling your audience that all bets are off, no one is safe, and check your preconceptions about cinema and narrative structure at the door.<br /><br />A shame in a way, because the movie sure could use a lot more of Miranda, though talented actors pop up every ten minutes or so like ducks in a shooting gallery.  Isa Miranda was the great international sensation of Mussolini's Italy; even MGM got wind of her and imported her a la Garbo for a few unsuccessful American films right before the outbreak of World War II put a kibosh to her career in the States.  Back in Italy she continued in her reign as a sort of Dolores Del Rio slash Naximva tragedy Queen, with huge dollops of sex thrown in for mass appeal.  Thus in LA RONDE (1950) Max Ophuls saves her perhaps the most delectable sequence of all, larding her into a sex sandwich between boyish Gerard Philipe (the Ryan Philippe of his day!) and stalwart Jean-Louis Barrault from CHILDREN OF PARADISE.  David Lean made her the earthy manageress of the Pensione spinstery Katharine Hepburn stays at in Venice in SUMMER MADNESS (aka SUMMERTIME, 1955), using her magnificent, somewhat ravaged sensuality as a contrapuntal force, much as plain Deborah Kerr is confronted by wild Ava Gardner in John Huston's later film of NIGHT OF THE IGUANA.  In BAY OF BLOOD, which begins with Miranda's countess rolling her wheelchair moodily past window after curtained window in her chateau over the bay, a mood of desolate and painful memory is instantly set up.  It's as if she's thinking of all the \\"white telephone\\" movies she's ever played in, and rueing the day when her great beauty came to an end.  Bava's photography is always topnotch, but in the opening sequence of BAY OF BLOOD he puts it to memorial use; the color shimmers, the light radiates off of Miranda's hair, eyes, profile, and the wheels creak in protest as she forces them across the long gallery for one last look at her bay.ater film of NIGHT OF THE IGUANA.

B000FQ4M58|5.0|I'm a second generation Meatloaf fan, and when I heard that this album was coming out, I looked forward to it with much anticipation. I am pleased to report that I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The title track, The Monster is Loose, pulls you in nicely, and lets you know what you're in for.<br /><br />It's All Coming Back to Me is a powerful duet with Marion Raven, and the song sounds superior to the original version done by Celine Dion.<br /><br />Bad For Good combines Meatloaf's tremendous and powerful voice with the unique and unmistakeable guitar stylings of Brian May, and it's a match made in Heaven.<br /><br />In the Land of the Pig, The Butcher is King is a powerful song that sounds very much in place on this collection, and sounds like it would have been right at home with any of the Bat Out of Hell trilogy.<br /><br />Monstro, though short, certainly is a dark, haunting inspiration.<br /><br />Alive and If God Could Talk fit together perfectly, and are classic Meatloaf in their tone and execution.<br /><br />What About Love is another stunning duet, this time with Patti Russo, and it is certainly reminiscent of the previous two albums, especially the earlier song, I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That).<br /><br />Seize the Night is easily the longest track on the album, and it has an operatic feel to it. It's magnificent in its scope, and the music and singing evoke a great deal of powerful emotions in the listener.<br /><br />The Future Ain't What it Used to be is a powerful duet with Jennifer Hudson, and it is perfectly at home on this album.<br /><br />All in all, a spectacular album, and just what Meatloaf fans have come to expect.

YOU CAN, REALLY. <br /> <br />
0345440900|4.0|I have deliberately waited until reviewing this book, as I am a bit ambivalent about it. I first read the book while pregnant, and loved it. The book is filled with common sense advice and I still love  the basic premise of the book, which is learning to listen to your baby. As we were expecting our first child, I also knew we would need a good guide book and this was the best I had found. The only thing I had complaints about was the extremely simplistic way the book was written. Everything was overclarified. <br /> <br />When our son was born, the book was invaluable and we spent hours reading it, trouble shooting, searching for answers. The book suddenly wasn't at all simplistic, quite the contrary, it seemed complicated and differentiated. Here is what our family has gotten from the book: <br /> <br /> - clear guidelines for what to expect and how to make every day life work <br /> - help in learning to understand our son's attempts to communicate <br /> - breastfeeding has worked brilliantly because I have been rested, fed, always had water at my bedside table and had my own time to clear my head. (I am also an avid reader of La Leche League material, but Tracy's information has worked better for us than feeding on demand) <br /> - the structure has helped our whole family cope with the moments when nothing works (which abound when you are tired and unsure of what to do next) <br /> <br />There have been problems too, which is why I am ambivalent to the book. The problems are the following: <br /> <br /> - in the book Tracy says the Baby should be awake 1,5 hours, then sleep 1,5 hours. This still doesn't work every time. <br /> <br /> - the term 'accidental parenting' is guilt inducing and hits hard every time something 'fails' to work. <br /> <br /> - as I am somewhat of a perfectionist, the book's approach has at times created more stress than it has alleviated when things haven't worked as Tracy write they should. <br /> <br />The situation right now in ourfamily is that our three month old is on the structure and mostly stays on it and our hard work is finally starting to pay off. He is happy and robust, health care personnel often exclaim on how social and happy he is. Also he is still breastfeeding full time (the book's advice have in no way harmed that). Our son also sleeps full nights, which is a blessing, all due to the advice in The Baby Whisperer. <br /> <br />All in all, this book is a long term job and definitely worth the effort. It is important, though, not to take it literally but to implement it to fit your own situation. Small fluctuations from the structure do not matter. With this in mind I do highly recommend this book. All first time parents, be gentle with yourselves (other parents too:) <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005OAIE|5.0|I'm writing this review of \\"Squares\\" about five years after it came out, but I feel compelled to do so because it was so important.  The first time I ever heard or saw John Mayer, he was doing (I think) \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" on The Late Show with David Letterman and plugging \\"Squares.\\"  I loved him instantly but didn't write his name down, then for a few days I kept telling my husband, \\"I saw this guy on Letterman, I loved him but I don't know who he is... the next time you go to Strawberries, look for a CD with squares all over the front of it.\\"  My hubbie looked at me askance and said, \\"uh, okay, squares...\\" and went off to fertilize the lawn.  Later, he discovered John without my help, and came home with the CD... and I screamed, \\"that's the CD with the squares on it that I wanted!!!\\"  We both proceeded to fall in love with John's music (soon afterwards we went out and got \\"Inside Wants Out,\\" loved it too).  Although so many people think that this CD is just pop music, and insignificant... and John himself has tried to shed the image he established with this CD... it still remains a fact of life that this is the music that made us stand up and notice John for the first time.  The fact that he's blossomed into other arenas is icing on the cake... but Squares will go down in history with other albums like it... Joni Mitchell's \\"Court and Spark\\" comes to mind... which served as a springboard to a long and impressive musical career.  I look forward to \\"growing old together\\" with John... as he says on \\"Any Given Thursday,\\" \\"THAT MIGHT BE FUN.\\"  I so look forward to seeing John again on Letterman every Thanksgiving... coming up soon!

B0000667LK|4.0|Being a fan since 1981 I gave up after '86-'88 when it all started sounding the same to me. And the last CD I REALLY liked was Powerslave (actually album at the time!!). But a friend has this and I must say I liked it a lot and several new songs immediately caught my ear!!! And when I found that \\"Bloodbrothers\\" and \\"Dream of Mirrors\\" were off the same CD I went and bought \\"Brave New World\\" and really enjoyed it. It reminds me of the classic era and I really don't understand the fans underrating this CD. Oh well.<br /><br />It also has a pretty good representation of older material though I have several better versions of my all time Favorite - \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\". The band is in top form and it's VERY refreshing to hear that one of THE great voices in metal hasn't diminished with age like so many others!! Bruce must have a secret that Coverdale, Gillan, etc, etc don't know about!!!<br /><br />But, as you can guess from the title of this review, I won't be truly happy until they pull their heads out and release the classic \\"Live After Death\\" on 5.1 DVD; I have just about worn out the VHS!!! Bruce, Steve, Dave...guys.....come on...please!!!<br /><br />An edit - as I'm sure all Maiden fans know by now - Live After Death is FINALLY out!! Ya-hoooooo!!!! Took long enough though!
B000000H57|5.0|Ah yes, Halloween is here again, and what better way to celebrate it than with an album like \\"October Rust\\"?  It has become somewhat of a tradition for me to listen to this album every Halloween (but not only on Halloween, of course), and one listen should tell you why.<br /><br />Taking the sludgy metal of Black Sabbath and the gothy atmospherics of the Cure, Type O Negative have crafted a distinctive style of doomy goodness that will fulfill all of your vampiric needs.  Frontman Pete Steele's booming vocals drive these tracks perfectly, melding beautifully with the thick layers of guitars and keys.  Songs like \\"Love You to Death\\", \\"Wolf Moon\\", and \\"Red Water\\" draw you in with their dark, enveloping melodies, with Pete's unique vocals underscoring them like no other vocalist could.  But, all of the above are nearly a ray of sunshine compared to the closing track, the huge, epic \\"Haunted\\".  This song crawls at a snail's pace for its 10-minute length, like some sinister creature emerging from the depths, and likewise Pete's vocals reach their peak of haunting evilness.  The line \\"Oh, how I hate the morning light\\" is sung in such an impossibly low octave, you'd swear this fellow cannot be human.  Purely awesome.<br /><br />However, this album isn't all sludgy doom.  There's plenty of diversity here, while keeping with the dark, sinister feel.  \\"Die with Me\\" is more wistful and plaintive, while \\"Be My Druidess\\" has a vaguely Cure-like feel.  The band also lighten things up a bit with the wacky pop tune \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\", and a fun cover of Neil Young's \\"Cinammon Girl\\".<br /><br />Simply put, a Halloween without Type O is not complete.  When you party with the ghosts and ghouls tonight, don't forget to put this on.
B000G759LW|5.0|Initially, I wasn't a fan of Aguilera, whilst talented, it seemed she flaunted her vocal gift. Often using it like a pillow to smother you with vocal bombast. Again, I wasn't a fan, so my opinion may be off.<br /><br />But Aguilera did have a trait that was endearing enough, one that brings her closer to Madonna than Britney per se: fearlesness. This fearlessness, this ability to tap into the pop mystique of constant & successful reinvention. Unexplained & uninhibited.<br /><br />It is here, on \\"Back to Basics\\", her ambitious double record, that this talent of reinvention comes to fruition, not only that, she progesses as well.<br /><br />\\"Back to Basics\\" is as the title states, music that is meant to take one back to the jazz, blues, & true vocal stylings of the 1920's, 1930's, & 1940's respectively. And while Aguilera manages to use samples from that era well, drop names such as Lena Horne, B.B. King, et al., & even evoke (beautifully) through image this halycon era, really only a few cuts really seemed steeped in this sound. \\"Hurt\\", \\"Candyman\\", \\"I Got Trouble\\", & \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" all find Aguilera truly channeling the theme of the times that she wanted.<br /><br />The rest of the record meets this feel with modern flairs, & does it well. Aguilera is assisted in production by DJ Premier, Linda Perry, Kwame to name a few, set-up these pop perfect soundscapes, but Aguilera writes words & pushes her own voice to new heights.<br /><br />Cuts such as \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", \\"Still Dirrty\\", \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" are finger popping good. They also find Aguilera using her voice well, but not just wailing. She has learned nuance & texture, as evidenced on the aching \\"Understand\\" & inspiring \\"On Our Way\\".<br /><br />One should applaud this young woman for trying something daring, if not totally original, but doing it on her terms, her way. This attitude will get Aguilera far, because as with most great artists, sometimes the only way your work can flow is if you do it for you, & hope others come along for the ride.<br /><br />Though, as evidenced by this newly won over fan, this ride should have many wanting to experience it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.u do it for you, & hope others come along for the ride. <br /> <br />Though, as evidenced by this newly won over fan, this ride should have many wanting to experience it. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br /> <br />
B000002NAK|5.0|Firstly, this recording of Evita was very well made. Most everything from the movie is here, except some orchestral sections (like the end credits). The orchestral arrangments are quite good throughout, with more modern arrangments that make the score sound more relevant to modern audiences.  <br /> <br />Vocally, Madonna is alright, but the best part of her performance is her acting, not her voice, and is best experienced watching the movie. If you're looking for a definitive and powerful vocal Evita, look elsewhere. Now, I'm not really a fan of Madonna, but she performed very nicely on this recording. While I've not seen previous Evita productions (I'm only 25), I've heard some recordings, and while Patti LuPone's voice IS better, I personally prefer Madonna's interpretation, even though her vocals are a little weak. <br /> <br />Other performances are very good too, including Jonathan Pryce's Peron and Antonio Banderas' surprisingly good Che. His accent adds a certain authenticity to the role I enjoyed.   <br /> <br />I discovered Evita through the movie, so I didn't have previous performances etched in my head to comare this to, so I was quite impressed with this recording. In the end, this recording did precisely what it intended to, brought an amazing work of theater into the modern age to be enjoyed by a new generation.
B000EOTTV8|5.0|I saw Transamerica months ago and I still think about it.  There are many reasons, most obviously Felicity Huffman's portrayal of Bree, a man determined to become a woman, trying to close the door on his past, just as it unexpectedly reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost child.  But Transamerica also brings a funny, poignant, and at times visually beautiful road trip across the United States, in an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles, let alone 3000.  It brings unexpected and uncertain romance.  It brings out humanity in all its characters (save one minor one), including Bree's bitter mother.  Finally, it -- plot spoiler here -- concludes with tentative reconciliation, acceptance, and an uncertain but potentially hopeful future.  Transamerica is not loud, not big budget, not spectacular, but there are few movies near as good as it.
0553573403|1.0|I would classify this book as a palace soap opera, not as fantasy. There are tons of sex, violence, gossip, palace intrigue, backstabbing, etc. But almost no fantasy! There's a glimpse of strange creatures outside the walls of the story's world. But the rest of the book is just about people lying, cheating, gossipping, killing and raping. After rambling for most of the book, a climactic battle seems to be looming. Then, just when you think something exciting might happen, you turn the page and find that the author has skipped the battle! You find the losers sitting around after the battle discussing, in hindsight, how they lost. Unbelievable.<br /><br />I bought this book on the recommendation of the salesperson at the bookstore. Do they get a commission for pushing certain books? It was the worst fantasy I have ever read.<br /><br />It seems like George Martin had a checklist of things that had to go in the story to make it marketable. His world did not feel believable or fantastic. I could sense a target audience he was trying to please, rather than a gripping story he was passionate about.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I spent a few hours today between Circuit City, Best Buy, and Wal Mart.  This is the truth and do it.  Go to CC first, but it for $15.99.  Take the flyer to Best Buy and price match it.  Then go to Wal Mart and price match it as well.  You will get each bonus disc.  I just wonder....are there any other stores that have a bonus disc ???  Please respond if so.  The VH1 Classic special is awesome with Mr Trunk...be sure to see it.
B0009MAO46|5.0|What can I say my husband even loves this movie.
B000H30B2C|2.0|After seeing this movie (and while seeing this movie), the one thought that kept coming to mind was:    \\"If every scene had been chopped by 2/3 it would have been a pretty good movie.\\"    The best example of this would have to be the Kong vs T-Rex trifecta.  Disregarding how all the animals in question managed to come out of each individual attack unscathed until the final death came (no broken bones, no cuts, etc) and disregarding how Kong manages not to hurt or kill the female lead while protecting her (I know _I_ always grip a bit too hard when trying to grab something that's falling) and how she managed to come out uninjured with everything going on around her... the scene was just too long and repetitive.  The final Empire State building scene took too long also, especially the final 'slide off the building'.    I've seen a repeated claim of disbelief that some people found the movie boring.  Yep, there's enough action for three movies.  I won't deny that.  But action for the sake of action, with no suspense, is boring to me.  Suspense for me requires a couple of things: realism within the film, and emotional connection (good or bad) to the characters.     The first part, realism within the film, is often referred to as suspension of disbelief.  Now, some people keep saying \\"King Kong is a FANTASY movie\\" and believe that that suffices.  They might say that the scenes in Star Wars are far more unbelievable, especially people jumping from catwalk to catwalk, sometimes with great elevation changes, yadda... But Star Wars IS a fantasy movie, and it has an explanation WITHIN THE FILM, 'the Force' and the fact that the characters in these amazing light saber duels are trained in it, allowing them to defy gravity, block shots from laser pistols, etc.  Yes, the Force doesn't exist in our world, but if you accept that it does in Star Wars, the movies are relatively consistent with this premise.      So what do we have in King Kong, which other than a giant Ape, seems tobe based in the 'real world'.  Overweight cameramen carrying a heavy piece of equipment, running underneath of dinosaurs, avoiding dinosaurs, rocks, etc, all tumbling past him, for 10-15 minutes.  Oh yeah, and a heap of other ordinary folks all doing the same.  We have a beast that can be killed by bullets (albeit LOTS of them from planes), completely unaffected by a T-Rex's jaws clamped on his arm, something that should have at least severed some nerves and certainly should have had the arm bloody.  We have a beast apparently able to keep his attention on three dinosaurs and the absolute best place to hold the blonde to keep her from being injured, never mind that any one of umpteen gyrations he makes should probably have snapped her neck.  I'm sorry, but completely inconsistent action (in this case inconsistent with a relatively close to 'real world' - as far as we're told, there's no 'Force' to allow all of  the absurdities that occur) for the sake of action is just... boring.    There WERE moments that made me remember this was the same director that created such a visual masterpiece in Lord of the Rings, such as the first imagery of Kong after his capture having exactly the right impact: the unthinking masses thinking he looked so amazing while the viewer is struck by how pathetic he looks compared to when he was free.     I think the true problem is, Peter Jackson is perfectly suited to creating epic films and perhaps is unable to _not_ film every scene as if it's a potentially world shattering moment.  Lord of the Rings was an epic story, and as such benefited from this kind of attention.  King Kong is not an epic story, and as such, for me at least, simply didn't work when Jackson tried to turn it into one.    (And heading off any comments about my attention span, I love slower paced movies, like \\"Unbreakable\\", \\"Lord of the Rings\\", \\"Contact\\".)
B00005JNX0|5.0|My youngest son wathced this movie twice everyday for (it seems like) three weeks.
B00005JPBJ|4.0|WARNING: This opinionated review contains some spoilers from \\"Saw\\" and \\"Saw II.\\"  This review is intended for people who have actually seen the first two movies, and if you haven't, you should be...unless you're the squeamish type.<br /><br />This is Del Keyes, saying \\"This is not a stand-alone film.\\"<br /><br />- REVIEW<br /><br />\\"Saw III\\" marks the final chapter of the series, and by that, I mean the final chapter with James Wan, Leigh Whannell, and Darren Bousman involved with the franchise (Lionsgate does not want the profitable series to end just yet). Because of that acknowledgement, this will be the last time I'm going to blatantly exploit the use of the word \\"saw\\", so here it goes.  The \\"Saw\\" series is a sight to see: it saw the attention it deserves, and it provides many curious horror fans something different to see.  It slices, it dices, and it cuts through the meat and bones, among a whole bunch of cheesy saw-related puns I can't even think of.<br /><br />In all seriousness, the third outing is a surprising improvement over the previous installment, which I personally felt like it was on auto-pilot for the whole movie, keeping it on a steady pace with little outrageous moments.  It is nothing like that in this sequel, as it moves away the sporadic law-enforcement scenarios, and centers on what's truly important in the series: Jigsaw and his games.  This time, the movie goes behind-the-scenes into the business of his sadistic games.<br /><br />The sequel acts as a direct continuation of \\"Saw II\\" as the movie starts off with Marky Mark's brother stuck in a bad predicament thanks to the Jigsaw.  Meanwhile, Dina Meyer's character tries to find him in a series of leads made by Jigsaw's victims.  The continuation was all simply to tie up loose-ends (in a \\"Saw\\" manner) just so the movie can move along with the confrontation of Jigsaw and his accomplice, Amanda.  That's right: the victim of the first two films is The Jigsaw's partner-in-crime/divine intervention.<br /><br />A nurse named Lynn is captured by the hands of the duo, because The Jigsaw is not exactly at the top of his game, thanks to the malignant tumor in his noggin.  In this new game, the nurse must forcibly save the life of the husky-voiced maniac in order to save her own, while another (and Jigsaw's last) game takes place for a different victim following a three-step program to bitter torment.  The centered victim of the game is a father sworn for vengeance, and he'll come across paths and choices that will make him question his own principles, and ultimately decide if he achieves the one thing the Jigsaw tries to give to the victims: redemption...along with permanent physical and mental scars.<br /><br />The sequel furthers the backstory approach of \\"Saw II\\" as it sheds (or shreds) some more light into Jigsaw's history, but it also explains the relationship between him and Amanda.  Amanda is viewed as a compassionate person who is solely devoted to the killer who she sees as a father figure, so her feelings entices him, yet dreads him at the same time.  Without giving too much away, Amanda is a very interesting character for this sequel.  Their relationship goes further as the movie shows how some of their infamous games were set up, which the flashbacks ties up a few loose-ends of the series; although, it still doesn't explain about the shock treatments from the first movie.  To extend open wounds to the story, Leigh Whannell makes a cameo appearance to explain how his character, Adam, got killed.  The only thing that baffles me about the backstory is when it gets into the intimate life of Jigsaw back when he was known as John: it only last for a couple of seconds and it was never explained as if it's an afterthought for some progression with the nurse.  Although the sequel didn't completely recovered the rough spots of the canon, at least with it solidifies the connection of the whole Jigsaw business.<br /><br />Story aside, will there be more blood inthe games in \\"Saw III\\"?  There will be more blood, alright; there will also be more chains, more broken limbs, more screaming, more begging, more spastic camera movements, basically almost every gruesome thing to please the inner sadist.  Although the games are not quite the focus this time around, there are plenty of them, and most of them are twisted and inventive, just how Wan/Whannell/Bousman likes it.  Some will gross you out, and few will shock you, especially the torture device I like to call \\"The Twist.\\"  Watching the scene with that device makes me think it could've been much more graphic, but that's where uncut DVDs are for.<br /><br />\\"Saw III\\" brought back the things I like from the original, the claustrophobic scenery, the tough-to-decide nature of the games, and the morbid philosophies of Jigsaw's intentions.  The sequel brings the pieces together, leading to one impressive climax.  To me, this is a satisfying closure to the series.alright; there will also be more chains, more broken limbs, more screaming, more begging, more spastic camera movements, basically almost every gruesome thing to please the inner sadist.

B00005JP87|5.0|I must say that this is one of the best movies I have seem in a long time!  I love the chief of police. He was brillant. All of the actors were at their best.  The plot was so suspenseful.  The turn of the century costumes and clothes were great!  I really enjoyed this movie.  Worth the money folks!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I have been searching online for good bootleg copies of any 90210 episodes because the reruns had stopped and I needed my 90210 fix worse then Colin needed his coke fixes when he was with Kelly! <br />I'm SO excited they finally came to their senses and are releasing them!
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|There is a lot of emotion in this album. You real get to see into the minds of someone in a lot of pain. In his last album he dealt a lot with demons and anti-war, and it seems to be a continuing trend, but on a lot more mature level. MCR is really trying to prove they are more than just another punk/pop emo band, they have substance. Breaking the mold, they really seem to successfully shake that stereotype.<br /><br />Very emotionally inept, the first track, \\"The End,\\" it takes place at a funeral, where the narrator reveals how he wants to not end up like the person who died, and either wants to be saved or end it now. The next track, \\"Dead!,\\" it continues the backwards cycle of the album, starting with the end, and going in reverse order. Later on, or should I say earlier, it appears someone he loved greatly that broke his heart had cancer, and now he is saying how this person's, probably female, most painful thing they did was start dying during the operation, and not able to hear him. This track is very important because you get the impression that he was never really mad at her, but that he loved her so much that he deserved better than to see her like this. He is so passionate that he questions life, and thinks of it as a joke from God, and that heaven is a place for the wicked.<br /><br />In the next track, we find out more about the situation. \\"This is How I Disappear\\" is about how he regrets what he did, and wishes that he never hurt the person he loved. This gives you the assumption that in the previous track, that he blames himself for her death. The emotion in this song is really great. He wants to be let go, so he can do no more harm, but is in the debacle that he can not leave her.<br /><br />In \\"The Shaprest Lives\\" he goes on to reveal his alcohol and drug problem and how he can break the habit, and doesn't want her to get caught in it. He is creating his own pain and downward spiral, but just like in his last cd with \\"Ghost of You,\\" he is constantly haunted by the demons of addiction.<br /><br />\\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" I think is symbolic for rehab. In the song, his father showed him the door, but based on the other songs, it seems like he decided to not go, and it totally destroyed his life. The first single from the album, it is very powerful and remeniscent of \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" by Green Day, but without the commercial success.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Love You\\" is about how he is trying to justify why he doesn't deserve the girl. Him in his drunked state is very abusive and uncontrollable, and doesn't want to pull her into his darkness. He wants her to leave while she can, and uses this to push her away, when in reality, he needs her the most.<br /><br />I really didn't know what to make out of \\"House of Wolves.\\" My assumption would be that he's burying himself, and wants the angel of death to take him away for his bad sins. He repeats how he's going to burn in hell and wants to be taken to his grave to being his flaming afterlife.<br /><br />\\"Cancer\\" is probably one of the saddest songs I've ever heard. Very reminscent of \\"Hurt\\" by Nine Inch Nails, the song is describing how the most pain from his cancer is counting down the days until he leaves her. He's abandoned all hope at life, knows that he'll never get to do accomplish anything he ever wanted in life, and will end in a lot of pain before he could spend a lifetime with his girl.<br /><br />\\"Mama\\" is a very different pace for the album. It gives the assumption that he resents his mother for disowning him for being somehow involved in the war, and how if he was a girl, that the mother wouldn't have to disown her child. This song is very lyrically and musically different. Not one of my favorites.<br /><br />\\"Sleep\\" continues a theme of the people he loves not being able to let him go. He wants to just be given his final kiss and put to sleep to begin his enternal slumber. \\"Teenagers\\" is about how in the birth of your adulthood, people will begin trying to control you, make you a certain way. The song seems to get a lot of influence from Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall,\\" and Pink's struggle through life and inability to conform. \\"Disenchanted\\" is about how he is sick of being picked on and teased, called names.<br /><br />From this point in the album, the dots start connecting. You start to realize how his hellacious young adulthood was unbarable, and caused him to pick up habits that hurt him so much the ones he loved were harmed. The last track, \\"Famous Last Words\\" implies they were the last thoughts he had before the incident causing \\"The End.\\" This tracks makes the album come full circle, starting from the end, going to the beginning, and ending up back towards the end.<br /><br />Lyrically, I am beginning to see a step up in MCR, but musically, they still have a while to go. They are still in their young phase, their punk/pop phase, but with a more adult mindset. I really look forward to their next album and see how they will continue to evolve. A great album, but I think the best is just yet to come.od, people will begin trying to control you, make you a certain way.

0805076476|5.0|This book is poetry. I can't add much more than what has already been said, in terms of message or analysis. What I do know, however, is that this is one of the most important books of our generation. One day, it will be taught in high school English classes, going Scarlet Letter, Huckleberry Finn, Gatsby, Catcher in the Rye, Fahrenheit 451, and then Fight Club. I'm not sure if there is a higher compliment that can be given. The significance of the book's message should not be dismissed.<br /><br />And even if it is, Palahnuik's literary style cannot be. It is unmistakable. It is fluid. It is transcending. His use of chorus lines make the book such a quick read that you'll finish it in a day. You'll find yourself repeating them in your head six months after you've read the book, long after you've forgotten the petty details. I think that's what makes the book so special. We are all 'Jack's inflamed sense of rejection' and it's been too long since anyone really put that into words.<br /><br />Anyways, this book is pretty damn special and everyone ought to read it.

I can't get in to how I know this, you'll just have to trust me. I might even be putting myself in jeopardy by revealing this. Hold on a second while I get the door, there's someone banging loudly and shouting my name. Man, sounds like there's a whole squardon of them. LOL. Be right back ...
B0000C8AW2|5.0|I bought this album when it came out in 1978, the summer before my senior year in high school, and listened to it over and over and over and over again. I recently picked up the CD, not having listened to the album for about 25 years. Wow. With the perspective of all those years and album-listening behind me, it sounds better than ever. And I'm not just talking about the remastered CD. People can nitpick all they want, but Dylan's voice sounds great and the songs are fantastic. OK, this isn't one of those super technical reviews, it's just a fan who's thrilled at rediscovering a great album. I loved it at 17 and really, really love it at 45. Rock on Bob!
B000000W5F|4.0|The most amazing aspect of this album was that it was a very strong release coming from a band that had been around almost 20 years.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s with \\"Some Girls\\", even that album was considered pretty good for such an old band. \\"Emotional Rescue\\" was a misfire and this band was written off for good.<br /><br />They ROAR into the 1980's with this album that was not only high qulaity for the Stones but the songs were bona fide contemporary radio and MTV staples.<br /><br />\\"Start me Up\\", \\"Hang Fire\\" Little T & A\\" and \\"Waiting on a friend \\" are the standouts.<br /><br />They never came close again. It was all downhill from here.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|Let's face it: John Mayer is just cool.  Old school cool.  Though Heavier Things is still by favorite CD by him Continuum is still a gold standard that most artist can only dream of.  Waiting for the world to change is my far the strongest song not only lyrically but commerically while Bold as love did absolutely nothing for me.  Still this a good mellow CD by an artistic that blur the color lines.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|A wonderful comedy, its not very scary, but thats not the point of this movie is it? I really like the jaguar in it caus i have one just like it
B000AU9UYM|4.0|This is Batman in contemporary turn of the 21st century, not the Batman serial of the 1930s, the campy (but charming) Batman TV show of the 1960s or the more recent Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher abominations that can't be placed in any specific time setting.  You will not see Tim Burton's Halloweenesque macabre eccentricities or Joel Schumacher mindlessly colourful spectacles.  What you will see are Christopher Nolan's psychological (and if somewhat ponderous) analyses into the nature of guilt and fear.  Nolan's Batman is Batman for mature people who want to see a humanized Batman suffering from guilt and fear and venting anger and fear against a corrupt Gotham City.  This movie is really about Bruce Wayne as much as Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies are really about Peter Parker.  By focusing on the emotional man behind the costume rather the cold costume and lifeless gadgets, Nolan has made a realistic superhero film whereas Tim Burton (who has his cult following) merely redid his Halloweenesque \\"Beetlejuice\\" and \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" films with a bat costume.  Whereas Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne is a cold and distant robot with a small body frame, Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is way better by bringing more physical stature and bringing more drama with his emotional suffering.  Like the much-lauded Spider-Man and X-Men films, the pain is psychological, the conflict is internal, and display of physical violence is not the point.  Yet, I take 1 star off because Katie Holmes is the movie's weak link and because Michael Cain's Alfred is a bit too proletarian compared to Michael Gough's Alfred.  Further, why does a villian with an Arabic name speak Japanese in a Himalayan fortress and why do we have to see another runaway train scene after one was already done in Spider-Man 2?
B0009R1T7M|5.0|The first time I heard the CD I thought: \\"If I wanted to buy Rent: The Musical, I would have bought Rent...\\"  This sentiment stuck around for some time but every once in a while I would play the album while reading or working on something else.  Today I did something I haven't done with this album before.  I listened to the whole album, uninterrupted, and focused my whole attention on it.  The album comes into focus like leaves on a crisp fall day when you give it proper attention.  In the span of a few hours I have come to understand the hype about Illinoise -- this album perfectly captures something essential in each song.  Some of the songs, like John Wayne Gacy Jr. feel isolated and exquisitely beautiful in and of themselves.  Other songs, like They Are Night Zombies move along, blunderingly and impassioned, only to be resurrected by an energetic high school choir sound.  Sufjan Stevens is as intellectually whimisical and earnestly sarcastic as he is downright brilliant.  My only advice is to listen to the entire album a few times before putting it away.
0743298020|2.0|A dark dank disappointment and so confusing.  The author never tells us exactly what year it is but it feels like the late 1800's.  It can't be however because they do have automobiles.  They apparently don't have TV's or cell phones, or even telephones because they only seem to communicate by letter, but there is reference to a \\"computing machine\\".  The main character obviously has no access to a PC or a Xerox machine because she laboriously copies everything down by hand. The book is as dysfunctinal as it's characters and the story falls fall short of the hype.
B000H7JD4K|2.0|Is it extremely necessary to put 7-8 minutes songs?? <br />It's kind of boring sometimes, is like another reviewer said here, a single song just with blanks within. This album could be called easily Dance of death II, why once again the word death on the album title, epic songs are good, but 1 or 2, not 10, bad bad bad, I'd rather listen to the old Maiden (killers, number of the beast, etc.)
0671027344|4.0|this is one of my favorite books.  from the first chapter i was in love with Charlie [the main character] and although it does deal with some sketchy material, the book was relevant to my teenage life [as a 16 yr old]
B000BTJDGM|4.0|OK, this movie isn't a masterpiece.  That being said: <br /> <br />The Exorcism of Emily Rose is the best movie I've seen about the differing world views about the demonic.  <br /> <br />By setting the story in a courtroom, the directors are able to give equal weight to the traditional church view of the demonic and also the scientific world view.  <br /> <br />If you watch horror film to scare yourself, this may not be the one. There are some fairly scary scenes but that's doesn't seem to be the point.  <br /> <br />The movie accepts that demon-possession is reality for some people -- but that there are at least two radically different ways to look at this reality. <br /> <br />I've never seen a better film (or book, for that matter) which shows how well-meaning people can experience the same phenomenon yet interpret it completely differently.  <br /> <br />I deducted a star (or maybe two) because some of the acting struck me as a little flat and there were a couple of other flaws in the film making. Not bad, but this isn't a five star movie. Worth watching? Certainly yes.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Not much to add to the previous reviews regarding how fantastic this package is.  Having owned all of these previously on the infamous \\"KISSVISION\\" remastered bootleg series, I can honestly say that the biggest difference I notice is the audio.  MUCH better than the circulated boots.<br /><br />Which bonus disc is best?  Well, if you're a die-hard, you will no doubt want all three.  For all others, however, the decision boils down to era and video quality.  All three of these discs are from different touring eras (i.e Alive (Cobo Hall), Destroyer/RNR Over (Garden Show), and Love Gun (Largo).  It is intuitive to think that the picture quality is progressively better as the tours progress (and it is).  So which one to pick?<br /><br />My personal favorite is the Cobo Hall show (Best Buy Exclusive).  I enjoy this vintage era and this particular show was edited with split screen fade-ins from time to time to keep the visual interesting to the viewer.  A little different flavor than the other night available on the master disc.  Additionally, the music is tighter in this era.  KISS became much sloppier both instrumentally and vocally as the money rolled-in and the songs grew in complexity (ala Destroyer era tunes).  One need only to view the two-disc set to note this.<br /><br />Having said that, you certainly can't go wrong with any of these bonus discs, although I will point out that the Garden show is the shortest of the three clocking in at around 27 minutes.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B000068IEU|2.0|Two problems. <br /> <br />First problem.  Let's say you're the typical kidnapper-rapist-killer.  For fun and out of postmodern boredom, you kidnap two girls off the street in New York City.  What are the odds that your randomly-chosen getaway and killing spot is going to be exactly where one of the girls lives, 60 or 70 miles away?  One in ten million?  Twenty million?  <br /> <br />Second problem.  The movie, even with a run time of an otherwise-short 84 minutes, doesn't have enough action or development to fill the void.  In short, it's boring, and in several scenes where Craven seems more interested in the bucolic Wechester County scenery than moving the plot along, I found myself reaching for the fast-forward.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This guy is GREAT.  His talent is awesome.  Musician, composer, writer, unsurpassed timing, voice of velvet and clarity.  Saw him for the first time on Eric Clapton's Crossroads Festival DVD, both performing and speaking.  Have had \\"Continuum\\" for approximately 24 hours.  Have played it almost continuously.  All his songs are good, but my favorite is \\"Stop This Train\\", along with \\"I Don't Trust Myself With Loving You\\", \\"Vultures\\", \\"Dreaming With a Broken Heart\\", \\"In Repair\\" and the ultimate finale \\"I'm Gonna Find Another You\\".  There are shades of Paul Simon, Ray Charles, the Beatles, and great blues artists Eric Clapton and B. B. King, but most of all there is John Mayer and his undeniable genius -- a one-of-a-kind artist who stands alone.  Earlier I had purchased Herbie Hancock's \\"Possibilities\\" just for John's rendition of \\"Stitched\\".  The beauty of it, besides the catchiness of the lyrics and beat, was that John's voice was audible.  And for me, one of the beauties of \\"Continuum\\" is that his voice and lyrics are again audible.  The subtleties in his voice are fascinating.  To me, this is an awesome CD.  My recomendation is Buy it!

B000FQ4M58|4.0|It's all coming back to me now - it's been nearly thirty years since Bat Out of Hell, and thirteen years since Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell, but Meat Loaf's unique vocals and style remain the same after all this time.<br /><br />Despite an initial falling out with Jim Steinman, the two were able to reach a compromise, and seven songs on the album were in fact written by Steinman (albeit for other projects). Another song was written by Diane Warren, the rest by Desmond Child, with a little help from Nikki Sixx, John \\"5\\" Lowery, James Michael and others.<br /><br />For the first single, Meat Loaf reaches back into the past and resurrects \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" featuring Marion Raven, but the ones that got to me were \\"Alive\\"; \\"Bad For Good\\" with the unmistakable guitar of Brian May of Queen; the seven minute extravaganza of the title track; \\"Cry Over Me\\" written by Diane Warren; the operatic \\"In the Land of the Pig, The Butcher is King\\" with its little \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" bit; \\"If God Could Talk\\"; \\"What About Love\\" featuring Patti Russo, and \\"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be\\" with Jennifer Hudson of American Idol fame.<br /><br />It's vintage Meat Loaf, and you shouldn't miss the opportunity to complete the trilogy - make it Meat Loaf on the menu tonight.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 31, 2006
0441172717|5.0|I'll keep this review brief, as to be honest, I'm not sure that there's much to say that hasn't already been said (and said much more eloquently) by other reviewers. First published in the 1960s, Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" and its consequent sequels are the science-fiction equivalent to fantasy's \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Dense, detailed and complicated, \\"Dune\\" cannot be read just once in order to fully appreciate the immense time and effort that went into its creation.<br /><br />Best (but over-simply) described as a story of political intrigue and power, \\"Dune\\" takes place predominantly on the planet Arrakis, where immense sandworms traverse the endless deserts and cultivate the substance known as spice, the most precious commodity in the universe. Governance of this planet has recently passed from the Harkonnen to the Atreides household, and Duke Leto Atreides and his family is preparing for the upheaval in their lives. His young son Paul, the product of the Duke and his beloved concubine Jessica, is greeted with particular interest on arrival in Arrakis, believed to be a subject of prophecy by the native Fremen people.<br /><br />But the Harkonnen household will not so easily give up their hold over Arrakis and the spice, and have taken measures to ensure the death of the new royal family. Thrown in amongst the fierce Fremen people, Paul creates a new identity for himself as messiah and ruler, the only one who can  restore the planet to its rightful inhabitants. Of course, that's easier said than done and the effort takes place over a great number of years, filled with intrigue, betrayal, love, allies, enemies, war, marriage and political manoeuvring. It is intensely complicated, with many futuristic customs and ideologies that are never fully explained, effectively throwing the reader into a brand new world in which they must sink or swim. Many will find this exhilarating, others will be immensely confused, despite the presence of Appendixes and a Glossary of terms used.<br /><br />Herbert's great novel is unique because, despite the fact that it is science-fiction, it still has plenty of room for religious belief and practice, which in fact makes up the most intriguing part of the novel. The Bene Gesserit order was (for me) immensely fascinating, what with its elaborate scheming and genetic planning. Their unique fighting abilities, their prescience, their sheer calculated guile - it all makes for one of the most interesting and imaginative components of the story.<br /><br />The narrative is primarily centred on intrigue and movement as opposed to any descriptive passages on either character or setting, making it a rather difficult read at times. In fact, the narrative technique of the novel is utterly unique given that it is so intimate in detail despite the fact that the story is so epic in scope; you never get any `eye-of-God' passages, all events are strictly presented through the experiences of the character involved. A story that is told almost entirely through internal soliloquies and dialogue between characters - that's a rare thing, and it is a testimony to Herbert's skill that he got away with it. I must admit though, that at times I felt a little claustrophobic in terms of the intimacy of the writing. I know it is considered hubris by many to criticise such a work, but a little more \\"breathing room\\" amongst the density of the plot and ideologies would have been much appreciated.<br /><br />But in a way my complaints are irrelevant, as \\"Dune\\" should be read in any case. A milestone in the tradition of science-fiction as well as a fascinating read in its own right (both through technique and story), \\"Dune\\" is one of those modern classics that has to be read and appreciated before you die.rms used.  <br /> <br />Herbert's great novel is unique because, despite the fact that it is science-fiction, it still has plenty of room for religious belief and practice, which in fact makes up the most intriguing part of the novel.

630542828X|5.0|Substantive: possessing substance; having practical importance, value, or effect: substantive issues under discussion. <br /> <br />It is rare for movies to have a story line based on a character, that not only experiences personal growth, but does so in heroic fashion. Travolta plays Schlichtmann, a typical bottom line lawyer type, who evolves into a man willing to stand on principle. As rare as such people are in real life, they seem just as rare in the movies. For those who seek more then just a temporary distraction, that most movies provide via action or special effects, this movie provides a story line with real depth.   <br /> <br />A Civil Action is filled with big name actors, who all put in great performances. This is, a rare, exceptional movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Sergio Leone's epic Western \\"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly\\" is the cure for modern film and television.  Some folks (like my wife) are engrossed in the current avalanche of 44-minute episodes with 600-page scripts of endless chattering and gossiping.  When I walk through the room and catch 10 seconds of girly banter and counter-banter, just before I want to kill myself I thank goodness for this movie--which is the exact opposite. <br /> <br />I won't re-tread the territory of other reviewers who enjoy this movie as much as I do, but let me say this:  In the current age of short attention spans and film and television that drench our senses with veritable blizzards of chit-chat, color and noise, Leone is the cure.   <br /> <br />Don't expect this movie to blow you away with great action.  You have to drink it in slowly... as if the movie itself were one of Eastwood's cigars.  The deliberate pace, subtle visual style and operatic score make this movie the clean, satisfying deep breath that you need after a hectic day at the office (or wherever you may be returning from).  How else can I say it, except maybe: <br /> <br />If you HATED 'Batman and Robin's' silly vomiting of color and noise, you will LOVE 'The Good, the Bad & the Ugly. <br /> <br />Please, you owe it to yourself to spend a long quiet evening with this film.  The acting, dialogue, pacing, score, and direction (did you know that Quentin Tarantino calls this the best-directed film ever?) are flawless.  You will feel better, and be a better person for seeing it.
B0002KVULG|3.0|Strengths: <br /> <br />Frank Langella, who really made the movie. He was extremely charismatic and had the looks for the type of character that was intended. Kate Nelligan, who is truly believable as an unleashed victorian woman. The score by John Williams is very entertaining, EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T BUY THE SOUNDTRACK FOR LESS THAN $80.00!! <br /> <br />Weaknesses:  <br /> <br />Just about everything else, from the very silly Renfield, to the cringe-worthy script. It even had a laser show love scene that was kind of a gothic take on the truly evil Superman/Lois Lane romantic flying sequence, and every bit as painful. Then there's the costume design for Dracula that suffered the ancestry of the vampire as gothic paperback foreign sophisticate ala Bela, which like Dracula...will never seem to die. Please, enough with the black cape and the red lining! Jonathan Harker was played as very whiny and petulant, like a morose, jilted lover...and the character never even got the benefit of the Castle Dracula scenes at the beginning of the book! <br /> <br />If you want to see the best version of Dracula, see Count Dracula, made in the same year by the BBC with Louis Jourdan. Definitely creepier, definitely less cliches, and definitely closer to the spirit of the book. It was made, I'm sure, with far less money than the hollywood production and outclasses it in every respect. Of course, you can't get the US version on DVD yet! <br /> <br />without Frank and Kate, it would have been 2 stars.
B00006DEF9|5.0|This is my MOST favorite movie of all the movies in the universe. You can not watch this movie and retain a bad mood. The music is awesome, the jokes are hilarious, the plot makes you feel good, the costumes are nice and bright. It makes you happy, even against your will.
B000HD1AEA|5.0|...this really is worth buying even if you already own the original Mirrorball. There are enough songs on here that aren't on the earlier release, including a far more generous selection from her first two albums (Vox, Into the Fire, I Will Not Forget You in addition to Path of Thorns), to make it worth the price. The album as a whole also has a much better sound - it's less produced and actually sounds live, unlike parts of its very polished predecessor. It does bug me that they didn't just release the complete concert in the first place though.
4789004546|5.0|There is a bit of a myth about Japanese grammar--that it is too complicated, too alien for the non-native speaker to ever really master.  This is a myth that many Japanese perpetuate themselves, seen in unflattering characterizations of non-native speakers, or in the (unhelpful) praise lavished upon anyone who can speak Japanese to any degree, no matter how ungrammatical it may be.  This is a myth that is also unfortunately and unintentionally perpetuated by guides like Jorden's \\"Japanese the Spoken Language\\" that do the learner a disservice by explaining grammatical points in a language better suited for a linguist than a language learner.  For people like you and me, who want to surpass these low expectations and confusing explanations and start on the road to true fluency, \\"A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar\\" is an essential companion.<br /><br />Let's face it--from the perspective of a native English speaker, mastering Japanese grammar is difficult.  Very difficult.  Don't trust anyone who says otherwise!  Much is made of the difficult writing system, but mastering grammar is perhaps even more difficult and essential to smooth communication.  Sure, learning the difference between \\"wa\\" and \\"ga\\" is not as sexy as learning how to write \\"love\\" or \\"raccoon dog\\" in kanji, but it's many times more useful on a daily basis.  By providing easy-to-understand explanations as well as examples of both good and bad usage, the student is given a better understanding of basic (but still difficult-to-master) grammatical points.  This dictionary does an especially good job of contrasting similar constructs that give beginning-to-intermediate (and even many advanced) students trouble (wa/ga, aida/uchi, ageru/kureru, hazu/beki, ni/de etc.)<br /><br />Although I don't think it's possible to gain complete comfort and mastery of Japanese without living in Japan, or at the very least, interacting with Japanese people on a regular basis, this book is the perfect guide for explaining the nuances that a beginner might not notice, and an intermediate student might be aware of but not fully understand.  This includes the deceptive \\"similar constructs\\" I mentioned before, words that are not easy to translate into English (sekkaku, darou come to mind), and other issues such as auxiliary verbs and onomatopoetic \\"sound words\\".  Whether you're learning Japanese in school, living abroad in Japan, or even just studying on your own, \\"A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar\\" is an indispensable companion for your studies.<br /><br />One last comment--there are a few reviews that have comments along the lines of \\"yes, but the Japanese don't really talk like this\\" to which I say, \\"You're missing the point.\\"  That's a bit like arguing against learning multiplication tables because in the \\"real world\\" there are calculators.  Sure it would be nice to go directly from \\"Sir, please give me that pen\\" to \\"Hey man, can ya grab that pen for me?\\" but language learning isn't that easy.  If you understand the fundamentals of grammar, you will understand Japanese of all formalities, dialects, and other variations and transmutations.  It is much easier to learn the shortcuts once you have a strong foundation because you are in a position to understand the nuances and principles involved.  In other words, you know and understand what exactly is being \\"shortcutted\\".  If you only learn the shortcuts, you will have a hard time generalizing your knowledge for usage out of a narrow, specific context.  Worse, you might not even realize that you are even making a grammatical or etiquette mistake by misapplying knowledge from one context to another.  The worst thing a language learner can do is to try to take shortcuts to \\"speed up\\" his or her progress without taking the time to build up a steady base.  This dictionary provides that strong foundation that is needed for the serious Japanese language learner.<br /><br />6/24/09 addendum: I've seen a small handful of reviews that insinuate that a strong knowledge of grammar is only important for reading & writing Japanese, and perhaps only for reading & writing formal Japanese at that.  This couldn't be more untrue, and this gets to the idea that there are no shortcuts to language learning, even if you're just interested in \\"conversational Japanese\\".  For any language, the spoken language and the written language are not the same, and formal and colloquial language differ as well.  But they all rely on the same principles of grammar, even though they might be applied in different ways.  You might be speaking casually with your friends, but greeting them with \\"Up what is?\\" instead of \\"What's up?\\" is still wrong (unless you're Yoda).  All because of grammar.grammar is only important for reading & writing Japanese, and perhaps only for reading & writing formal Japanese at that.

B000H0MKGK|1.0|Been playing guitar and listening to music for a long, long time. Maybe being 37, this type of MOR-pop just isn't for me. Supposedly Meyer is a good guitar player, as it is mentioned in these reviews - Meyer's pop is so sterile and the lyrics so cliche, slapping some little blues riffs over it seems like a moot point. The lyrics border on cringe-inducing, with many laugh-out-loud moments. The \\"Gravity\\" song is probably the silliest - ironic as the songs themselves have none. No weight, feather-lite McPop for people who are more into Meyer's innocent face and wavy locks. Not being able to stand McFluff like Jack Johnson or Dave Mathews, I'm not one to appreciate this type of MOR pop. Heavyweight songwriters have depth and soul. The worst Elliott Smith song completely trounces the McLiteness of Mayer. This stuff is clean and safe, very harmless stuff - could be worse. But taking a Hendrix song, removing all the soul and feeling and wrapping it in shrink-wrap is an insult to Jimi and simply a very, questionable decision. Leave the classic artists alone, please - let today's kids hear the real deal. I do find the videos a bit more comical than the music itself, the look on his face as is playing McMuzac-lite is difficult or requires soul is too much for this man to take. You want soul; listen to Al Green, acoustic music - drop the Jack Johnson's and get some Nick Drake - blues? How about from a real bluesman? Blues shouldn't be drenched in saccharine. Solomine Burke makes this drivel sound like the sugar-coated pop it is. Music's been going downhill for a while. The 80s were a hard time on the arts in general. The Age of Recylcing has had little to offer our younger generations. Where do we go from here? No where but up, one must hope. At the end of this review, one may check the \\"I am over the age of 13\\" box - I imagine many of the reviewers for Meyer's pop won't because they aren't.

B0000T70K4|3.0|Eric Packer, the main character in Don DeLillo's novel Cosmopolis, has a penthouse apartment that cost $104 Million.  To Eric the square footage of his apartment, its location, view, and gadgets are incidental.  What matters is how much it cost.  The price, justifies itself.<br /><br />Is it possible to enjoy a novel with a central character that is an unlikable, pretentious, self absorbed sociopath?<br /><br />Perhaps... but in this case I found I had mixed feelings about the novel.  I was impressed by DeLillo's writing (the first of his novels I've read) but it was difficult to care about Eric and his downward spiral.<br /><br />Cosmopolis tells a day in the life of Eric Packer, a Wall Street warrior with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Eric spends the day in his cork lined limo going across town to get a haircut, while his financial empire crashes around him.  Along the way he has a number of sexual encounters, including a romp with a sexy young bodyguard. At one point in the novel he insists that she zap him with her stun gun at its highest setting.<br /><br />Eric is so detached and desensitized that he craves extreme experiences just to feel something.  He can stop his financial ruin at anytime but is so competitive and unwilling to compromise that he chooses to make his financial loss as extreme as possible.  Not only does he refuse to cut his own losses, he raids his wife's private accounts to ensure that she too is bankrupted.  Not ruining them both completely would be the equivalent of getting zapped with the stun gun at a lower setting.<br /><br />Eric may be a poor excuse for a human being, but thanks to DeLillo's exquisite prose, his journey across town is a reasonably compelling read.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Are you getting bored with the same ol' skateboard,teeny-bopper music that today's young generation is listening to in their i-pods today? Alas....there is a band that brings 21st century music with a bit of 60's and 70's classic rock,80's alternative (minus the synthesizers),and 90's grunge all rolled up into one. The Raconteurs,the side project of White Stripes front man Jack White,have arrived with Broken Boy Soldiers,which has to be the best rock album of the year. Their tracks will remind you of such acts as The Beatles,Zeppelin,Smashing Pumpkins,and Alice in Chains yet still sounding so original. It is one cd worth adding to your collection. If you only like 1 or 2 songs off a cd,get an I-pod. If you like a cd with 10 of the hardest-kicking songs,get Broken Boy Soldiers from The Raconteurs. ROCK ON!!!!
B000F39M9W|5.0|From first glance, this disc seems aimed at Splash, big time.  It showcases the new Los Angeles Disney Hall, of course.  Super audio surround sound helps, but the rest of the masterings don't sound bad either.  If you want another Technicolor disc to display what your system can do, this one surely goes on the list. <br /> <br />The music is so deeply indebted to orchestral brilliance that if Rimsky-Korsakov were still alive he should get a share of the royalties.  Along with the three featured composers, Mussorgsky, Bartok, and Stravinsky. <br /> <br />Our evenings' concert starts off with something of a rarity.  Most people have heard the Rimsky-Korsakov version of Mussorgsky's Night on Bare Mountain, via the soundtrack to Disney's Fantasia if not otherwise.  But here we get the original.  It doesn't immediately go for broke, and at first may seem like it is meandering a bit on first comparison with the concentrated Rimsky edition.  But repeated hearings reveal that Mussorgsky knew well enough what he was doing that his original version can stand well on its own two or two hundred feet.  We are attending a Satanic Sabbath on Halloween, after all, and years before Hollywood dreamed it up, Mussorgsky was writing such vivid stuff that he can be said to have pioneered cinematic music, long before cinema was a household item spinning away in our DVD players.  Nor does Mussorgsky's original orchestration suffer all that much in comparison to the flashier Rimsky costuming.  This original has a leaner, meaner sound - and paints its dramatic and demonic scenes in a different instrumental palette - all to the good.  Probably nobody wants to give up the Rimsky/Fantasia version by now - so many Halloweens have come and gone; but this one enriches us musically, too.  Vive la difference. <br /> <br />Then we get the Bartok suite from the Miraculous Mandarin ballet.  It has plenty of fire and color in its own right.  But this stunning recorded incarnation makes this oft-seemingthorny and relentless music seem unusually sensual in its sheer drive and brutality. <br /> <br />By this point in the disc program, a listener is probably wishing two things.  First, when is this team going to get the Mussorgsky-Ravel Pictures on a super audio surround sound disc?  Second - why didn't we get the whole Miraculous Mandarin?  If there was ever a recorded argument for having the whole ballet, this team would surely be headlining. <br /> <br />The third program item is Stravinsky's Le Sacre. <br /> <br />Even before the first low ostinatos have been set obsessively spinning in the dark, you expect it to be both demonstration-quality in its surround channel sonics, and brilliant-sensuous in its precedent-shattering musical force.  This ballet caused a riot in the Paris audience while dear old Papa Monteux led the pit orchestra of the Diaghilev Ballet Russe.  If it all seems so long ago that we can now take it for granted, this recording may shake enough dust off things to let us listeners have another glimpse of its primal and revolutionary impudence.  One immediately starts wishing for these same folks to give us some fierce, gnarly Carl Ruggles, and probably Varese' Ameriques for good measure.  And maybe some Olivier Messiaen?  (Give Turangalila this sort of care and you will have a top ten cross-over release on the rock charts.) <br /> <br />Now my fav shelf has been home to some excellent recordings of Le Sacre.  Starting with an old Eugene Goossens-LSO disc that couples Le Sacre with Rachmaninov's Symphonic Dances.  Goossens leads the LSO at just a tad slower and more dogged tempo that brings out the brute muscularities in what is after all supposed to be a primal, ancient rite of spring.  Among the others I also cherish a Michael Tilson Thomas-Boston Symphony outing that shows off Boston at its higher end, sonically and as one of the world's greatest virtuoso orchestras.  Throw in the oddly hair-raising King of the Stars cantata, and you really have one helluva stereo CD. <br /> <br />Well this one belongs, too.  Thanks to the impressive hall acoustics, captured in something like what surround sound superaudio has long promised to be, you simply get everything Stravinsky wrote into this abundant score.  The bottom end is palpable without obscuring anything in the middle or high frequencies.  The woodwinds and brass have tints and glitter and sheen, without losing tonal depth and allure to the silvery edges.  While there is plenty of pounding, stamping force in this performance; you also get plenty of color and perfume and sweat-shined embodiment.  Top all of that excellence off with a subtle sense of ease, of sheer poise never out of balance - like the Boulez Le Sacre recordings - and you can bet this one will be a standard for years to come as our superaudio surround era takes off. <br /> <br />Match this recording up, then, with the equally superb SACD issue of Sir Charles Mackerras leading the LSO in Petrouchka, and you are well on your way to having a complete set of the early Stravinsky ballets that will be difficult to surpass in high resolution sound. <br /> <br />Wow.  Can it get better than this?  Will this team - DGG plus the engineers, plus the conductor and band, plus the new hall - find occasion to scale even higher heights?  Stay tuned.  And get this one.  It is short-listed for a Grammy finalist, just wait and see. <br /> <br />Five stars.  Soopa sound.  Amazing, sexy, hair-raising performance.  Oh yes.
0440419514|5.0|I bought these books to read nightly with my 10 year old son, but ended up reading straight through them by myself over a few days, impatient to get to the end.  Pullman has brought together all the important elements  that parents think of discussing with their children, but sometimes never get around to...or can't find the words for.  And he encases all these concepts in such a rich and engrossing tapestry that it's a joy to re-read it now with my son.  In this age when our society lacks rituals for children to transition into adulthood, these books provide a tool parents can use to ease the process.
0195067142|5.0|In 1943, the young Eugene Sledge flunked out of a Marine officer training course.  He and the other washouts in his training cohort were then assigned to become privates.  After training, he became a mortarman in a line infantry company in the Marine 1st Division, joining his unit just prior to 2 of the most brutal engagements experienced by American soldiers in WWII; the invasions of Peleliu and Okinawa.  By great good fortune, he survived unscathed when his company suffered the equivalent of 150% casulties over the 2 campaigns.  Written originally for his family, this is an artless and direct accounting of Sledge's combat experiences. Sledge's account describes scenes of true horror alleviated only by the comradeship he found in his unit.  As a description of how combat can bring out the best and worst in humanity, this plainly written book is unmatched.
0543896862|5.0|The book Treasure Island was a great read and shall be ever pressed into my memories of adventure. The book starts when Jim Hawkings has found a map that leads to an island full of treasure. As he sails on a ship with his faithful companions, they are ambushed at the sight of land by Long John Silver and his crew of pirates. Fortunately, they escape from the band of thieves and set out traps on the island. After they discover the treasure, Jim and his friends secretly strike a bargain with Silver.  The bargain allows them to sail home where Long John can have a fair trial instead of being immediately hung in the gallows. This is a fantastic read for pirate lovers and adventure seekers. Nothing can go wrong with this classic book.
B000000OPW|5.0|This is a great record but I really just wanted to comment on a misunderstanding that a few reviewers have made. There seem to be a few people who think the song Candyman is about someone seeking to sell drugs to children but that is incorrect, rather it is about pedophiles/ child molestation. I believe that Siouxsie may have experienced something of the sort when she was young but I could be mistaken. It's really a very chilling song and once you understand what the song is about it can sound quite disturbing, but that's what good music does, it makes you feel.     A few people posted reviews that led me to believe that they interpreted the song incorrectly and thus didn't really understand what the song is about so I felt I might clear that up. It's really a great song, I understand that the Banshees are known for creating moody, dark imagery with some of thier music but this particular song is dark and \\"scary\\" in a different way. It isn't for thrills but rather a serious warning against, in this case, people who take \\"kidnap\\" children by masquerading as a kind person or baiting them with candy, hence the title Candyman. Have fun.
B0009XFMWE|5.0|Although the 2006 Legacy release with its great bonus cuts is essential, the RCA Victor Europe  (\\"RVE\\" ) CD  (black CD) also meets a need in terms of sound.

This is sometimes a big advantage compared to the RVE version where the lead vocal often sounds too trebly and recessed (eg Charlie's Girl). But .....<br /><br />while the Legacy edition has a punchier overall sound it ironically has less dynamic nuance with crescendos that build less subtly and therefore less dramatically.<br /><br />\\"Kicks\\" is a good example of the sonic differences with the RVE cd having a  far superior version - as well as less subtle dynamics the Legacy version also lacks enormous amounts of sonic information in the upper frequencies and bass.  There is deep ominous sounding bass guitar running all through \\"Kicks\\" but in the Legacy edition it's pretty much absent.<br /><br />In general on the RVE CD the bass guitar sounds naturally deep  and nuanced whereas on most of the Legacy release it ALSO lacks in upper frequenies (the audible harmonics being an important part of a bass guitar's frequency profile) so bass guitar lines sound extremely muddy..<br /><br />So overall the RVE cd retains most of the subtleties of the original vinyl release and bass guitar sounds remain intact.  (Plus it looks like a mini vinyl LP, the really cool part being that the playing surface is black too!)<br /><br />[EDIT: Amazon has stuffed up again!  This review  also appears amongst those of  the Legacy version - it  applies to the black CD released by RCA Victor Europe.]

B00005JPAJ|4.0|BABEL's aggregate is less than each of its three component parts.<br /><br />While on a marriage-healing trip to Morocco, Susan (Cate Blanchett) is seriously wounded by a bullet coming through the window of their tourist bus out in the middle of nowhere. Husband Richard (Brad Pitt) is visibly agitated.<br /><br />In San Diego, Amelia (Adraina Barraza), the Latino nanny to two young, blonde, and blatantly WASPish children, Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble), takes her charges on an unauthorized hop across the border into Mexico so she can attend her son's wedding; Amelia has been temporarily left alone to watch the kids, and she can't find anyone to care for them in her absence. The three are driven by Amelia's irresponsible nephew Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal).<br /><br />In Japan, Chieko ( Rinko Kikuchi), a pretty, deaf-mute, teenage girl, is suffering a severe lack of self-esteem. Her mother recently committed suicide by gunshot. The police want to interview her father, and Chieko assumes the two events are related. As her father is gone most of the day and evening, Chieko lives virtually alone in an upscale Tokyo high-rise. Apparently equating her self-worth with her sexual allure, the girl has been unable to attract a male to relieve her of her virginity despite the most forward (and clumsy) attempts at seduction, and she's approaching a crisis of despair.<br /><br />Though not immediately apparent to the viewer, the three subplots of BABEL are related. Each is superbly acted; there's the potential for Oscar nods for Pitt, Barraza, and Kikuchi (who, in real life, is neither hearing nor speech impaired). Each subplot, on its own and expanded somewhat, could have powerfully served as illustration of the theme, which is that tragic situations can evolve from bad choices exacerbated by an inability to communicate. However, in the case of this otherwise excellent film, the three subplots strung together result in a production that's too long; I'm deducting a star. Perhaps the director should have considered three separate releases, much as Krzysztof Kieslowski did with his Colors Trilogy (RED, WHITE and BLUE).<br /><br />At times, especially in Morocco, BABEL achieves a cinema verite grittiness reminiscent of the recent contemporary Western starring Tommy Lee Jones, THE THREE BURIALS OF MELQUIADES ESTRADA. It's not an easy film to watch, but it is among the best of the year.hould have considered three separate releases, much as Krzysztof Kieslowski did with his Colors Trilogy (RED, WHITE and BLUE).

B000005GYI|5.0|This is one of my desert island discs along with Milton's \\"Courage\\".  People coming from the jazz realm may want to start with that album or perhaps his collaboration with Wayne Shorter.  People coming from the rock realm should start here.  The beauty and depth of this album is amazing.  The many Brazilian influences along with those from the most progressive pop/rock Americans/Brits joined together with the talent and attitudes of the musicians make for an undeniable classic.  Track 11 could have come forth from my psyche if I had the talent to create such a thing.  That's why musicians are to be cherished because they (at their best) are expressing those things in this better language.  I certainly cherish Nascimento, Borges, and the rest involved with this masterpiece.

0425200450|5.0|My first Agatha Christie book, and it was AWESOME.  I would never have figured it out on my own!  I zipped right through Murder on the Orient Express,marveling at the clever twists of plot and the ingenuity it must have taken to write such a mystery.

071484232X|5.0|This is the most complete book on Waterhouse I've come across yet.  When researching this artist, I was surprised to find that there were very few books written just about Waterhouse.  Without this book, it would have been very hard to research him at all.<br /><br />The book is laid out beautifully so that even if you never read the whole thing, you can enjoy it.  The paintings are displayed in full color and many of them cover a whole page.  Sketches and other art by Waterhouse's contemporaries as well as art that he was inspired by are also included.<br /><br />The book is laid out like an illustrated biography.  Starting from birth to death, Trippi shows Waterhouse's life by his paintings and sketches since very few written documents of his life survive.  Each chapter shows an era in his life and how he changed over the years by style and technique.  Trippi explains much of the background of the paintings and mentions artwork still missing as well as other mysteries of Waterhouse's life.  This is skillfully told including all the elements you want when getting to know an artist; his life, color pictures, inspirations, contemporaries, techniques and more.<br /><br />I loved reading through this and at the end felt a heightened respect for the artist.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know more about Waterhouse.
0618680004|5.0|I suppose it was preaching to the choir for me, as I've been an atheist for years. Still though, I enjoyed reading every single page (as with most books written by Dawkins).

B00005JPBJ|3.0|Ever since my first viewing of \\"Saw,\\" I, like most people, was intrigued and had my faith in modern horror reaffirmed. \\"Saw\\" emerged in a sea of tamed down, boring and pointless PG-13 movies and has become a modern classic, easily the most noteworthy horror movie to come out since the turn of the century. So, it wasn't surprising that \\"Saw II\\" was greenlit. Could they keep up the same level of integrity? Or would this franchise sink fast like so many others had before? Luckily, it was a smash. \\"Saw II,\\" while a different film from the first, was just as engrossing and disturbing as it's predecessor. And naturally, a year later, comes \\"Saw III.\\" Before I get into my review, let me just say you can expect a \\"Saw IV\\" to hit theaters this time next year.<br /><br />I have to come right out and say that I left the theater rather disappointed with \\"Saw III.\\" Now, it's not that movie was bad, or that it was a typical, problem-ridden sequel like most of it's kind. The first problem? The movie is way, way too short. Everytime a good idea comes along, it seems like it is rushed out of the way to meet the 90-minute mark. Crucial character development and screentime is so compacted and condensed that it nearly destroys the film completely. What could have been a beautiful and epic story about revenge and redemption really just boils down to gratuitous violence by the end.<br /><br />Maybe I had expectations that went way too high. I mean, the first two set a standard, but perhaps it was my mistake to assume that director Darren Lynn Bousman and co-creators James Wan and Leigh Wannell are invincible. As shown by this troubled film, they are not. Now, these are hugely talented guys, make no mistake. To establish such a reputation this early in their careers is extraordinary and should be respected. However, one can't help but wonder if their film suffered due to studio pressure. Like I said, the first two set a standard. Perhaps they weren't sure which audience they were supposed to be focusing on: The one that likes to just be shocked, or the one that likes to be shocked and have their minds tickled.<br /><br />What is good about \\"Saw III,\\" however, is that it really has/had massive potential to do more. Do I hear \\"Director's Cut?\\" God, I hope so. The traps this time are of a different breed (check out the \\"Pig Grinder\\") but also embed themselves into your consciousness perhaps more effectively than before. The overall story is solid and at times, truly touching. I can't say that all the plot-twists weren't predictable, and I can't say all the performances were on-key, but there is definitely a good movie here. It's just smothered. \\"Saw III\\" is simply hurt by being too brief. Trying to accomplish so much in so little time should never, ever be attempted ever again.posed to be focusing on: The one that likes to just be shocked, or the one that likes to be shocked and have their minds tickled. <br /> <br />What is good about \\"Saw III,\\" however, is that it really has/had massive potential to do more.

0618680004|4.0|Dawkins is both sarcastic and ruthless while demolishing the concept of the creationist God. He mainly targets Christianity in his book. I doubt if any theist or even a fence sitter can get past the first chapter. <br />Dawkin is dry and at times irritating when he takes on the task of demolishing the God's intellectual property. Yet, when he talks about science he is marvellous and fascinating.  <br />For example in page 138 and 136 when he talks about origin and evolution, I not only got goosebumps but also had a near religious ecstasy feeling. He lucidly explains the scientific position on the origin of life. <br />I strongly recommend all young adults and teenagers to read this book.

0743289412|2.0|This is a progressive review - The first section was composed after reading 200 pages, the next section after 300, then a further update about 3/4 of the way through and, I hope, a final entry when I finish. I know this seems weird - I've never done a partial review before, but I guarantee that the vast majority of readers familiar with King are going to have some problems with this book... hence the journal of one long-time fan's experience...    FIRST ENCOUNTER:To get the facts straight upfront - I'm 200 odd pages into Steve's latest. If I get through it I'll edit/update the review, but in case there are readers who are debating whether or not to plunk down big bucks for the hardcover, I thought there might be some value in a partial review.  There are two huge issues that arise almost from the beginning - First, and least important (which is not to say that it's not important. It's real important, just not as important as the other issue.)Steve has invented some kind of unbelievably annoying private language for his main characters. This becomes much, much more than a stylistic tic because King spills it all over every page until you're ready to throw the book out the window if the main character says \\"smucking\\" or \\"Bool\\" one more time... and then she says it over and over and over again. This may, alone, ruin the book for you.  Secondly, King, who, if nothing else, has always had the cleanest and clearest narrative sense of any author of his lifetime, has decided to go all artsy to the point that, 200 pages in, there is the barest hint of where the story is going.  UPDATE: After another 100 pages the basis for the plot finally seems to have emerged - the widow of a famous writer is being stalked/tortured by a psychopath because she's not in any hurry to donate his unpublished work to a university.(Cue laugh track) The psychopath seems to be a direct crib from the movie version of \\"Secret Garden.\\" There is a lot of clumsy foreshadowing of a Rose Madder type alternate universe. The torrent of unsmuckingly awful private language continues unabated. (See how annoying that line was. Now magnify it by 4700 repetitions.)I know King deals in the realm of the fantastic, but this story, like \\"Bag of Bones\\" and \\"Rose Madder\\" sets the real world against the fantasy world and the fantasy world succeeds to the degree that we believe in the characters and events protrayed in the real world. \\"Rose Madder's\\" battered wife and \\"Bag of Bones'\\" grieving widower were beautifully developed. They felt real. Lisey doesn't. And the sheer idiocy of the plot premise - that there would actually be a stalker who felt that a writer's unpublished work was some sort of Holy Grail - is more evidence that Steve has thought himself into being the King of a land whose grandiosity exists only in his own mind.This guy used to write great stories.  SECOND UPDATE - about 125 pages from the end.In an amazing comeback,the plot finally kicked in, the private language either died down or I got used to it enough that it stopped being such an irritant, and I'm racing toward the finish. I still don't buy the stalker plot, but the set-pieces involving the dead writer's brother (one of the scariest, most emotional scenes King's ever written), Lisey's visits to the fantasy land, and the development of her relationship with her sister are just beautifully done and I'm finally fully invested in the story. Should I have trusted Steve from the beginning, after 25 faithful years and how many dozen novels? Maybe... probably. I still think the private language issue was the killer. It's indescribably awful and should have been heavily edited. Raised the rating to three stars at this point with the end in sight.  CONCLUSION - I finished the book, which is more than I thought would happen after the first 200 pages, so I guess that's a positive. Lisey ends with a satisfying, if predictable, conclusion and a lovely, if predictable, coda that ties up the final plot threads. Ultimately, if you've read \\"Rose Madder\\" you've been here before with a more believable and sympathetic protagonist. Lisey is pretty much a mash-up of Rose and Bag of Bones with a teeth-grinding technique which, I suppose, King thought would distract us from how familiar the story was. Enough with the tortured famous writers, already, but we've been saying that since Misery, haven't we? All I know is that I put down Lisey and immediately picked up T.C. Boyle's latest, \\"Talk Talk\\" and it was like stepping from winter into spring.

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins is as articulate as ever in his new book, and I am very glad he has finally complied his views on religion in a book that should be easily accessible to most educated, open-minded individuals. <br /> <br />I am almost certain that it will change the minds of people who have extremely contemporary views of Christianity. People, who, (like I was) believe  simultaneously that hell really is a philosophical proposition and that it is really seperation from 'God'. That every race on earth has their own Messiah. The ones who think marriage is a stupid criteria by which consenting adults should determine their sexual behaviour with... who perhaps believe in Einstien's 'God. But yet are simultaneously being brain washed by countless Sundays at Church, under family obligation, to undergo blatant brain washing that is so easy to absorb because of it's ridiculous simplicity and psuedo science.  <br /> <br />I was from a church with elders that believed in the Water Vapour theory, the rights of the Jews to the Land of Isreal, that the Jews were persecuted because they have not accepted Christ, but are also some of the most intelligent, successful figures in human history because they are the children of Abraham. And other such nonsense. This church by the way has a congregation of 50 000 people, and it is located in Singapore, which is a country of 4 Million.    <br /> <br />I wish someone had given me Dawkins's books earlier on. For the confused Christian individual, this would be a good starting point. I never believed in the morality of the bible, but the question for me has always been 1) did an Intelligent Designer exist 2) Does religion work -does Jesus, or Allah, or Vishnu etc. answer prayers 3) is the Ascension a real event (I was indoctrinated from birth) <br /> <br />In the first couple of chapters, Dawkins tells you why these beliefs are rubbish. Arguments like Pascal's Matrix and the 747 miracle -that you could throw metal around and it will turn into a Boeing 747, the creationist/I-Dist favourite argument against evolution - are discredited. Funnily, I cannot imagine why these two arguments held such power over me for a long time, but until their fallacy had been eloquently put to words, and coherently explained, it was alot simpler to take them as fact. Reading good literature will always reveal to you something you never thought of before, or only felt but could never realize coherently. Ideas are different when they are written down to be read. And they are almost always better expressed written down than in brief conversation.  <br /> <br />I feel a slight resentment to all my atheist friends who thought it was charming that I was a 'good christian girl' and never introduced me to literature that would broaden my mind or argued with me about my faith. Most liberal Christians who love a good debate would love to be introduced to this book - and any Christian that's read the Da Vinci Code or any of Umberto Eco's novels and gone, \\"yeah, that sounds far fetched, but I don't believe that the Bible is all that accurate anyway... much less the absolute word of God. I just believe in salvation\\" will probably be open to Dawkin's arguments and will probbaly understand and perhaps even recognize, the pain in the 'testimonies' by people like Julia Sweeney. <br /> <br />I also like the brief chapter on the relative harms of the sexual molestation of children and the mental abuse through religion. The whole obedience for obdience sake is something that all parents should be asked to question.  <br /> <br />All round a great book, not a very difficult read, and written with wit, humour, and lots of compassion.  <br /> <br />To the atheist that say, 'Christians will never read it, and even if they do, it will have no effect', I really, really beg to differ. Of course faith can be swayed, it's based, at the end of the day, on how we feel about God's goodness. And everyone at some point in time questions how real these feelings are.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|The beginning of this movie confused me, which I suppose was the intent of the director and the producer.  Throughout the movie you get bits and pieces of what is happening until near the end of the movie, when most, but not all, of the details are explained.<br /><br />Plot Spoilers Avoided to the Extent Possible!<br /><br />Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) is taking her adopted daughter Sharon to the town of Silent Hill to understand why her daughter is having nightmares and sleep walking.  Husband Christopher opposes Rose's trip and does everything in his power to stop the trip.  Of course, Rose and Sharon arrive in Silent Hill with a motorcycle officer close behind.<br /><br />Once in Silent Hill, all confusion and horror breaks out.  Sharon immediately disappears.  The imagery is bizarre and surreal, alternating with sinister figures and creatures that can only be some kind of ghosts.  What is going on?  Why is the sky around Silent Hill always overcast with ash falling?<br /><br />A few minor details about the story of \\"Silent Hill.\\"  We learn that a little girl was molested, and a self-righteous woman decided the little girl had to be \\"purified.\\"  The girl's injuries were horrific, but she also acquired an incredible, largely evil power driven by her need for revenge.  Eventually the little girl caused a fire deep within the earth to erupt into the town of Silent Hill, killing many of the citizens.  We learn that citizens of the town have imposed their own peculiar and strict brand of faith on the town for centuries.  The town has mostly been abandoned, but the abandonment does not necessarily extend to every dimension...<br /><br />This movie shares some similarities to Japanese horror films.  The movie is loosely based on the Silent Hill series of video games, and a couple of artifacts of the video games were imported that appear to make little sense in the movie.  Fortunately, the distractions from the video game that fail to advance the plot are minimal, though they do enhance the confusion felt by Rose.<br /><br />This movie falls well shy of being a great horror movie, but it is fun to watch and the cinematography is outstanding.  The director used overhead shots a lot to reinforce our aloofness from certain scenes, but in other scenes we were extremely close to the action.  The director also alternated dramatic scenes with detailed scenes.  The director's intent seemed to be to contrast our desire to know, but our desire to keep from being affected by our observations.  The director refuses to let us escape from being part of the action, and by the end of the movie we are all too up close and personal with the events of the film.<br /><br />Horror movie fans will want to watch this movie for its brilliant cinematography and imaginative special effects.  However, be prepared to think and watch the movie more than once to figure out what is going on.  Splatter film fans will likely be bored by the carefully constructed story line that requires the entire movie to evolve.

B0006GAO5Y|4.0|It was fun to revisit \\"Rocky\\" after many years.  As a Philadelphian, I always hear \\"Rocky this\\" or \\"Rocky that\\" when talking about the city to visitors or folks out of town, but I hadn't actually seen the movie for quite  a while.  Happily, it still remains quite a film... subtle yet crowd-pleasing, complex yet supremely entertaining.  And the small touches are as great as I remembered: the ice rink employee yelling out the minutes Rocky has left to skate with Adrian; the loan shark Rocky works for, who's actually almost as sensitive and nice as Rocky; Rocky's turtles Cuff and Link, etc., etc.  In the end, the original \\"Rocky\\" is, I think, up there with the better works of Francis Ford Coppola: it has mood, intense visual details, and characters faced with some major decision-making about their futures and where they want to go. \\"Rocky\\" is still a winner.

B000GFLKF8|4.0|\\"Inside Man\\" unfolds its characters and plot in seeming slow-motion -- perhaps a bit like a real-life hostage drama. The film's plot advances by millimeters, in a seemingly unknowable direction. Folding back upon itself via the use of flash forwards and dramatized hypotheticals, the film always returns to the present, sometimes, but not always enriched by its wanderings.<br /><br />A well-planned hostage situation develops at a New York City bank. Dozens of hostages are taken, and they are cowed into submission by acts of profanity and violence. Keith Frazier, an NYPD detective and hostage negotiator played by Denzel Washington, is brought in to get into the minds of the criminals and to end the crisis. But this is no ordinary hostage situation, as the hostage-takers aren't playing by the normal rules. What are they after? Why are they stalling for time?<br /><br />The bank's philanthropist owner (Christopher Plummer) has taken an unusual interest in the situation. When he contacts a high society fixer (Jodi Foster) to retrieve property from the besieged bank, it becomes clear that he has a greater stake in the crisis than the good name of his bank. Foster, Washington and the lead hostage taker (played with intelligence and canny reserve by Clive Owen) soon find themselves in a dance of wills and activity.<br /><br />Spike Lee's cinematography is terrific. A long shot of the Brooklyn Bridge  is just one of many ornaments to this well-made film. The writing and the plot are believable -- and hold back on the unrelenting sarcastic chatter that makes up so many forgettable cop movies. The final plot lines are not tied up until literally the final few seconds of the film.<br /><br />Other than the pace of the film -- which mimics the wait-and-see pace of real negotiations (but is slow to the point of torpor) -- \\"Inside Man\\" is brilliant.
0062502182|3.0|When this book first came out, I was 15 and if I had read it then, it would have been a more life-altering experience for me. But it was only recently that a friend of mine recommended The Alchemist to me, which is kind of unfortunate. I did enjoy reading it, and it was lovely, simple prose. But I noticed that Coelho pretty much bases the book on an old Norwich myth, \\"The Pedlar of Swaffham.\\" The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because he's really not saying anything new, and basically rips off of The Little Prince and Siddartha, both of which I feel are much more poignant than this book. If you're at that transition point in your life, this book would be a good catalyst for inspiration and to buy into the cliche of following your dreams. But come on, it's not like I'm 15 anymore.
0767802470|5.0|Perhaps the most realistic submarine movie I have seen (and I am a submarine veteran).  Not all who are caught up in war agree with the cause; some just wish to do their jobs and survive.  Such was the case of many young German U-boat crewmembers in the second world war.  Their world was a depressing dark, wet, threatening world made more unbearable by madmen giving suicidal orders to nourish their own egos.  Das Boot is not only a realistic picture of WWII U-boat life, it is a realistic view of men pushed to the limits of mental fatigue and frustration knowing that the odds of their survival were slim.  It is one of those films that is difficult to watch but impossible to look away.  One of the great epics.

He excludes her from the training necessary to be chief, which includes stick fighting.  But she learns nonetheless and proves, time after time, that she is the one.  In the climactic scene she performs a miracle out of Maori tradition, perhaps a Maori equivalent of a newborn Moses recreating a Biblical story, the only problem being that the new Moses is a girl.<br /><br />If you are curious as to the nature of the miracle that our darling Maori girl is to perform, just notice the title of the story.
B0000025DV|5.0|Whether you're into symphonic rock or synthesized pop music, you still could dislike The Electric Light Orchestra. However, the music of this band is outstanding, not only because of their compositionary craftmenship but also for their musical abilities, like it or not. Particularly this album is the very best they ever made. As you can read in other reviews it is full of violins and other similar instruments, often packed on together in multitrack dubbings by the way. I really think this makes this record, as well as some other E.L.O. records stand out from the categories that I mentioned before.<br /><br />Out Of The Blue was a smashing double album on vinyl when it came out in 1978. The radio hit Mister Blue Sky may be well known by many people and I personally remember a local bar/dancing where it was played really very loud when the time had come to leave the premises. On a huge sound system it was so ultimately impressive in sound and musical experience that even nowadays I turn up my own system to get this feeling again. That song is something else, and really that is the same for the rest of this excellent record which does not have a single bad song on it. Although Out Of The Blue has more than a few highlights, overall it simply is the best symphonical pop and/or rock album ever.
B0000683DH|5.0|Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan in Star Trek II is nothing short of marvelous. It really deals with Khan's reclusive nature after being stranded on Seti Alpha V by Capt. Kirk in \\"Space Seed\\", and leaves to door wide open to Khan's obsession growing to the point where his own men are concerned. Kirk conversely is dealing with the fact that he is not the young adventurer he used to be and I must say seems to capture some actual feeling of gloom as he considers retirement or taking back his command. Suspicious though is the opinion of Bones. You might remember in the first film, McCoy was very much against Kirk getting the ship back and now supports his friend on this mission. As for Kirk, the approach to old age in \\"Khan\\" definitely is the more genuine between the two films, which says a lot for the acting of William Shatner. The only true constant is of course Spock. Although never face to face, both Spock and McCoy agree Kirk should have remained a captain. You still get a lot of classic Trek moments such as a scene in Kirk's quarters where he has to referee a philosophical argument between his two old friends. <br /> <br />Star Trek II is also the beginning of casting top notch actors as villains, a trend that lasted until Nemesis. (the role of captain wasn't as diverse until passed to Patrick Stewart either.) Khan is definitely a classic film. Blending together humor, drama and very important sub-plots that carry through to this day. Wether you're a Trek fan or not, buy this one.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|ELF is now a family favorite at my house. Will F's hilarious performance almost made me wet my pants the first time I watched it.<br /><br />The humor never ages. A dept store Santa is attacked by the large elf. Will says his breath smells. Scene after scene of goofy but wonderful humor. If you like Will Farrell, you will LOVE this film.<br /><br />If you aren't a fan of Will's type of comedy, you might want to rent it before buying.
2913903878|4.0|Hi, the title of this book, G.I. Collector's Guide is a great book, but it is a little bit misnamed.  The author of the book is a French guy who collected GI militaria.  He has a great collection, and this is a great book for a reenactor, WW2 history student, but it is NOT what a collector of WW2 militaria needs.  There is one picture of everything I've ever heard of the US Army in Europe using during the war, but only 1.  Collectors know that there were several (sometimes several hundred) manufacturers of each item, and a collector would need to know how each manufacuter's items differ.  This IS a great book, but, as I've stated, not a collector's book.
B000050FEN|2.0|I terribly disappointed by this movie.  It bears some resemblance to The Bone Collector and Silence Of The Lamb, but has none of the suspense, mystery, good acting and good story that these other movies have.  This lame excuse of a movie ended with with the killer appeared out of nowhere to confess his crime at the end.  The cops were basically two idiots who couldn't solve the crime on their own.  Add all the stupidities up and you have one boring movie.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|With all the uncertainty about the release of this DVD being color or black and white, it's black and white. I just got back from buying it this morning in the store. I went to two different stores to make sure that one wasn't missing what the other had. It's also marked on the back of the DVD to be in black and white. I played to disc to make sure and it actually is just like it says: \\"B&W\\".    As far as the last gentlemen's comment about going to B&N's website and viewing the trailer, I too went and looked at the trailer myself. The trailer is in color but it may have been the trailer for the old VHS release in 1998 when they released it in color. Nowhere in the Trailer did it say DVD nor 60th Anniversary edition.    So again, to answer everyone's question--IT'S BLACK AND WHITE!!! The dics is also one sided--unlike the double sided that many have found to be annoying. So this makes it a little bit better. The bonus features are the exact same though.
B000FTWB7G|1.0|I've purchased hundreds of CDs from Amazon, and read probably thousands of reviews. I've never written my own. That being said, this album definitely deserves it.    There are times in a band's life where the band must grow - musically, emotionally, politically... it all really depends on the band. Most bands suffer from a poor sophomore release because they've spent their lives working on that first CD, and then get only a year or two to work on the next. Many bands that hit this sophomore wall are great bands that eventually fail, because they can't live up to the success of their first album. Those that survive typically have to grow a little.    With Evanescence, they lost two influential band members. Significantly, their music writer. Ben Moody used to write the music, and then he'd come to Amy Lee, who would then write the vocals. Their inspiration was gothic piano music, which they would then throw heavy drums and guitars all over to create and ethereal, dark, heavy sound. It was amazing.    Ben didn't write the music for this CD. That much is painfully evident. Perhaps their new guitarist from Cold wrote some of it. Other reviews here might lead you to that.    But the simple truth is that this band did not grow - they changed through the acquisition of new band members and the losses of others. This is not the same band that it once was.    You won't see many radio singles from this CD. Because there aren't really any. The list of good tracks on this CD is limited to three or perhaps four, whereas almost every song on Fallen was great. I'll give you my opinion, but please form your own. The good tracks are: Call me When You're Sober (of course), Snow White Queen, and All That I'm Living For.    Remember - fallen was hard rock, or goth rock, or heavy metal or whatever label you'd like to place on it. You've heard it before. The Open Door does not feature the same style of music - at all. Most songs are soft, slow songs, where Any Lee wails loudly or moans over the subdued music.    Those in the gothic world would most compare this to some of the European bands, perhaps Elis or Leaves' Eyes... although Amy has no experience with Ethereal Gothic Rock, and thus can't do those bands justice.    So, if you're going to buy the CD - great. But don't expect it to be Fallen, or even the same Evanescence. It's a completely different band with a completely different sound. I, for one, was greatly disappointed. The album is mediocre at best. It's certainly not a great CD. My music collection is built around metal, goth, rock, and what have you, so I've got a fair bit of experience in the matter.    If you're really an American Evanescence fan looking for some great goth rock or goth metal bands that you haven't heard yet, try Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, or Within Temptation. Those might lead you in the direction you're looking for.    I really hope that Evanescence can return to their roots for their third album. This isn't a horrible CD, as I said - it does have at least three good songs, but it certainly isn't Fallen caliber, and I'd really like to have some new material in that style.    Thanks for listening. I hope you find my review helpful.
0671027387|3.0|Deception Point by Dan Brown is typical of his other works in that it is long on plot and pace but short on believability.<br /><br />Rachel Sexton works for the super-secret National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).  The NRO serves as a spy agency and collects and analyzes data and then passes it along to the CIA, NSA, the Department of Defense and other government agencies.  The purpose of the NRO is to help these agencies thwart terrorism, locate crimes against the environment, etc.  Sexton serves as an intelligence liaison between the NRO and the White House.  Sexton also happened to be the daughter of Sedgewick Sexton, a senator running for president.<br /><br />President Zachary Herney arranges for a clandestine meeting with Rachel Sexton.  NASA has discovered a 300 year old meteorite buried in a glacier above the Arctic Circle.  The president wants Rachel to lend some credibility to the discovery and also, to brief his staff back in Washington.  He also enlists the help of some non-government scientists.  Herney also has an ulterior motive for using Rachel as her father is running on an anti-NASA platform (Rachel and her father do not get along).  But as soon as the discovery is made public, strange things start happening at the site of the meteorite and Rachel and her scientist-friends have to run for their lives.  Brown also weaves a tale involving the campaign of Senator Sexton.  It's hard to tell if he's really a bad guy or not.<br /><br />Brown is a genius for taking some facts and creating a story around them.  In previous books, he has dealt with religion, cryptology, etc.  Although I enjoyed Deception Point, I found the science angle to be the least interesting.  Some of his descriptions made my eyes glaze over.  For instance, \\"We can simply use the petrographic polarizing microscope, an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer, a neutron activation analyzer, or an induction coupled plasma spectrometer to measure ferromagnetic ratios.\\"  Also, the scrapes that Rachel and her friends keep pulling out of are downright ridiculous.  But I still stayed up until the wee hours of the night to find out what happened.  Deception Point will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.es that Rachel and her friends keep pulling out of are downright ridiculous.

055358202X|3.0|I was rather skeptical about reading this book, given the track record of the previous entries.  After all, only the third book of this series was really all that interesting, while the others sort of just dragged on as the characters moved from spot to spot facing the same dilemnas over and over and over.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that Martin out did himself for repetitive plot antics with \\"A Feast for Crows\\".  It's quite an accomplishment to write 975 pages about a world full of interesting places, characters and struggles and ensure that NOT ONE THING EVER HAPPENS!!!  I was really impressed.  Not even Robert Jordan, the King of all Mindless Fantasy Serials, was so successful in writing a tome in which NOTHING HAPPENS!!  And the best part is that Martin actually made it rather interesting!!  I don't know of another writer who can do that!!  It was an extremely well-written 975 pages of nothing happening.  The best part is that the author actually cuts out the most interesting characters of his previous novels, concentrates on the dullest ones for this novel, and still makes it rather interesting.  Of course, we still have way too many chapters in which Cersei takes a bath and has a glass of wine or other chapters where Jaime bemoans the loss of his hand or Samwell thinks he's a coward, etc. But those chapters end, another chapter takes its place and then we go right back to another chapter where Cersei takes a bath and has some wine and Jaime bemoans the loss of his hand, etc.  The whole book is like that.  One neverending cycle of repeated chapters in which the plot moves barely at all.  I don't know what's more amazing: That Martin was able to write such a repetitive, action-depleted fantasy novel or that someone actually let him publish it!   <br /> <br />   Now, I read the previous book four years ago, so maybe four years from now when the next book is published I'll have a different review, but for now, it's enough to say this book will keep you interested in nothing for 975 pages. If you don't have that kind of time to waste, then just wait another four years and read \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" because not reading \\"A Feast for Crows\\" will in no way hinder your ability to read future entries.  That's because, if you haven't already figured it out, nothing happened.
B0000657UB|5.0|For my money, \\"Liege and Lief\\" remains the best of the many recordings issued under the name Fairport Convention, a band which has experienced myriad shifts in personnel and sound over the band's broad span.<br /><br />Several factors contributed to this excellence. One was the strong line up featuring no less than Richard Thompson, Sandy Denny, Dave Mattacks, Ashley Hutchings, Simon Nicol, and Dave Swarbrick--a group of folks that in one way or another established and perpetuated the English folk music revival that followed (and continues).<br /><br />The music and times cannot be separated, for great music was being generated on both sides of the Atlantic back in 1969, and musicians were keen to do their best for the sake of creating music. Third, \\"Liege and Lief\\" was a unique rendering--partly wonderful folk, partly swashbuckling rock and roll--and as such the band was not imitating (consciously or not) other bands in this genre.<br /><br />Finally, this music is a perfect pairing with traditional ales!<br /><br />All musing aside, the opening notes of Come All Ye still stirs the soul and sounds strong and clear.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The lyrics and musical lyricism of \\"OK Computer\\" are astounding.  Every selection reminds us of what our political and social challenges were in 1997 and how we are still reaping what was sown.  All this with catchy tunes, heart-melting melodies, punchy electronic vocalizations, complex harmonies, intricate rhythms, lovely instrumentation, etc.  If you really hate a cut, try another (or another section of that cut--the three distinct sections of \\"Paranoid Android\\" deliver a message three different ways, appeal to very distinct musical tastes and all three sections are musically brilliant)! <br /> <br />\\"Karma Police\\" is a heartening anthem when dealing with institutional/institutionalized idiocy.  The plaintive cry at the end could be any of us.  \\"Electioneering\\" packs more punch than Bowie's \\"Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (reprise)\\" and \\"1984\\" combined.  Some love the gentleness of \\"No Surprises\\"; I far prefer the combination of \\"Lucky\\" and \\"The Tourist\\".  These last two selections  can remind us why we don't give up after \\"Exit Music\\" (the song or the impact of the message) or turn to robotic responses such as those found in \\"Fitter, Happier\\". <br /> <br />I admit that I often skip over \\"Fitter, Happier\\".  My favorite cuts are \\"Karma Police\\" and \\"Paranoid Android\\"; but then, I am still listening to Velvet Underground, VERY early Roxy Music, and Eno-inspired Talking Heads.
B000FVGMC4|4.0|Saw him on Craig Ferguson- the CD is just what I hoped it would be, except, like a previous reviewer said, it loses some of the rawness of his voice from overproducing. His phrasing keeps you listening closely, anticipating the great lyrics. Over all, a GREAT album.
B0000073BG|4.0|I love Renaissance and I love this album.  However, it has absolutely NOTHING to do with Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, despite what Amazon says in it's blurb. <br /> <br />Amazon really should not allow its ignorance of music to show, particularly on a music site!  They should hire only informed people to review albums.  The blurb trumpeting Renaissance's \\"interpretation of Rimsky-Korsakov\\" is frankly embarrassing to read. <br /> <br />RM's Scherazade is one of my favorite musical pieces and it shouldn't be confused with this album, no matter how good it is. <br /> <br />By the way, Rimsky's is far better.  I'm not knocking Renaissance. It just is!  I think Mick Dunford would agree. His music sounds heavily influenced by Russian composers.
B000002GQE|5.0|Despite what anyone might tell you, the first seven Moody Blues albums are all wonderful and consistent in quality.  If you like one of these albums, the other six are guaranteed to give you the same amount of enjoyment.  This album is just as melodic as the others, and features soothing and relaxing vocal melodies and guitar playing and other fine instrumental choices.
B000ESST6U|5.0|All the other reviewers have raved about almost everything about this production (and with good reason).  But no one has mentioned the wonderful camerawork; so I thought I would.  Just as bad camerawork and editing can spoil an otherwise first rate production (cf Lucie de Lammermoor), the excellent visuals of this DVD add yet another layer to enhance this superb production.  There is no credit given, so I presume that it was under the control of David McVicar who conceived and directed the stage production.  This production cannot be recommended highly enough.
0618680004|5.0|At long last we have a book that addresses the abundant deficiencies of theistic belief with a refreshing, fearless candor and a staunch refusal to accept logically unsupportable \\"evidence\\" for supernatural causes and phenomena.   Dawkins minces no words in denouncing the privileged status and \\"undeserved respect\\" with which \\"virtuous\\" unquestioned faith is almost universally treated.  His arguments are strongly buttressed by the many relevant anecdotes, quotes, and allusions that pack this quick-reading, engaging, and frequently humorous book. <br /> <br />Whereas creationism and fundamentalism, in Dawkins' view, subvert objective inquiry while missing the mark in interpreting the processes of evolution, science offers mankind a more nuanced and awe-inspiring view of the universe.  Natural selection - the widely misunderstood driving mechanism behind the Fact of evolution - has a rich explanatory value and elegance precisely because it emerges from the conceptual engine of the Scientific Method, which renders our natural universe as intelligible to the rigorous scrutiny of the inquiring mind.    Just before I read \\"Delusion\\", I read acclaimed evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr's peerless \\"What Evolution Is\\" - and I would heartily recommend that book as a comprehensive primer (and a companion to Dawkins' books) for anyone with a serious interest in grasping Darwin's unequaled contribution to science.  <br />
0060734191|5.0|I discovered this trilogy a few years back, and it has been a favourite for some time. After a recent re-read, I decided it was high time I reviewed it.  <br />This trilogy by Garth Nix, begun with Sabriel and followed by its sequels Lirael and Abhorsen, is a truly original piece of work and an amazing masterpiece of imagination.  <br />It is set in two neighbouring lands. Ancelstiere, a modern country full of modern technology and modern thinking people. And the Old Kingdom, a country where magic and sorcery abound and the dead have an annoying habit of not remaining that way.  <br />Sabriel is an Abhorsen, heir to a legacy that has passed down through generations of her family. On the death of every Abhorsen, a new one continues the work of laying the dead back to rest and defeating the necromancers who seek to raise them.  <br />One of the things that makes this trilogy so original is Garth Nix's portrayal of death.  After life is ended, a victim enters a kind of in-between realm consisting of a cold, fast-flowing river that passes through nine gates. Only once passed the ninth gate does a person embrace true death. Until then, a dead spirit can either be returned or banished, and those with the ability can cross in to death to work their will.  <br />Twenty years after Sabriel has come in to her inheritance, we meet two new characters. Lirael, a member of a clan of women able to see the future. And Sameth, son of Sabriel and Abhorsen in waiting. Both these characters are set on a path to discover their destiny.  <br />Garth Nix writes both richly and atmospherically. His portrayal of the realm of death is done particularly well. His characters are well thought out and thoroughly explored. Most Notably Mogget. A white cat who is far more than what he seems and is by far the author's most complex and interesting creation.  <br />Danger, magic and monsters abound, with more than a little of the scare-factor thrown in.  <br />I would recommend these books to any fantasy reader looking for something a little different from the usual formula. I don't think you'll be disappointed.  <br />
0618551050|5.0|The Trouble with Physics is like four small, lucid and intertwined books in one - The first one is about the sociology of the theoretical physics academic community.  The second describes in what sense string theory has failed.  The third is about the five great problems in theoretical physics today. The fourth is about the current experimental results that need explaining.  I have listed the four books in increasing order of interest to me.  I was reading the fourth book on a plane trip and discovered that I was mumbling to myself \\"Oh my god, Oh my god\\", laughing out loud (from a sort of nervousness I guess) and constantly having to remind myself to breath.  Instead of trying to convey that science is pretty much on top of things Smolin conveys the utter confusion and excitement that these results warrant.  This is not the stuff that firm calm is made of but rather fire that heats and burns.  What Smolin has done is to describe the theoretical context that exists (that's in book three) and how the experimental results don't fit.  I have a physics degree from 36 years ago, have recently studied Quantum Field Theory and string theory and yet I have just understood the magnitude of the issues raised.  Other books and popular descriptions seem pretty banal in comparison.  In the spirit of balance, I probably should say that I may be a little prejudiced towards Smolin as it was his Three Roads to Quantum Gravity that got me studying QFT six years ago.  Why?  Because after reading Three Roads, I remember thinking that I wanted to be able to follow these developments mathematically and not just from the popular descriptions.  Incredibly, Smolin's book, totally without math, conveys the substance and depth of the issues in an unprecedented fashion.
B00005JPBJ|3.0|Lots of blood and gore, not as thought provoking as the 1st. The ending was well done and does look like there mihgt, somehow be a fourth. I dont see the reasoning for the full body nude woman (when will they start using fully nude men and make it equal?) It could have easily been a man chosen for that particular scene, but of course not. ANyway, the best part of the movie is the ending.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Having been a fan of Jane Austen's literature since first studying it during my school years, and having just about every filmed adaption of her novels in my collection, I awaited this version with high expectations.  To my mind, it is both good and bad in about equal proportions. <br />Good from the cinematography angle, with the scenery and beautiful,gracious homes used being quite extraordinary.  Bad from the point that much of the language and intent of the book is lost, when the storyline is condensed down to such a short time.  When you choose to make a movie of a book, especially one so well loved as P&P,I really think that you have a duty of care to hold the book close and stay true to it, not change things to suit your whim. <br />I do believe that this movie was aimed at an audience who have a short attention span, and those who have never read Jane Austen's books.  Who else but the American market would expect a specially made soppy ending (which fortunately is an 'added extra' here) and would willingly accept so many omissions and deleted characters that causes much of the point of Austen's writings to be entirely lost.  For instance, there is no explanation of how Mr Collins came to propose to Charlotte Lucas - she just appears out of the blue and makes the announcement. <br />And Lady Catherine arriving at the Bennet home in the middle of the night - no way, and it's not in the book. <br />Mr Darcy's initial proposal in the rain, not in the Collins' house as should have been, was rushed and muddled. <br />And he just walked straight into the house in the middle of the night to deliver his letter? Hardly - he was waiting in the woods for Lizzie who walked there. <br />Did anyone else notice that when Lizzie first goes to Pemberley and comes across Georgiana playing the piano, that there is a mirror above her as she plays, and yet when LiZzie and the Gardiners arrive next day, Mr Darcy is standing in front of the piano underneath that superb painting onthe wall of the other room?  ?Continuity? <br />With regard to the actors chosen, they are for the most part extremely good, although I did not like the choice of Donald Sutherland for Mr Bennett at all.  Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennett, the indomitable Dame Judy Dench as Lady Catherine,and the luminous Rosamund Pike joining Tom Hollander again following their roles in the BBC series of 'Wives and Daughters', were quite outstanding.  Keira Knightley glows as Lizzie, although sometimes I found her a little lightweight,and Matthew Macfadyen (well known in Australia from his starring role in the TVseries 'Spooks') speaks volumes with just one look, and broods stylishly, although the racing speed with which he delivers his proposal was most unfortunate. <br />While this version of Pride & Prejudice has scenery and music to enrich your senses, I will continue to prefer the A&E version with Ehle & Firth, however the BBC version with Garvie & Rintoul remains the closest word for word capturing of Jane Austen's writings.   <br />Not a bad attempt, but should have been much better. <br />
078322933X|4.0|Very good film with a great cast. Reese and Wahlberg are wonderful in their roles and play them to perfection, Walhberg especially. Very much worth watching/owning.
B0002KVULG|5.0|Important distinction.  Taken apart from every other Dracula film, this is a wonderful take on the story - with Dracula popping up in England.  The film, by avoiding the Transylvania prologue and moving the action direct to England, builds a swirling air of mystery around the Count.  A ship has wrecked, boxes delivered for the count are full of dirt...and a wolf was the only survivor - until Dracula is found waterlogged and hiding in a cave.  Then, it kicks in.  This is all about the romance and Gothic melodrama/mystery.  Watch it in that spirit and you can't go wrong.  BTW, those laser-lights were a big deal in 79 and most films don't age well when held up to scrutiny.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let me start off by stating that I hate the Sci-fi channel and their low-budget, B-style approach to well... everything. And I don't care for Buffy either. I rented the movie Serenity for my son without any high expectations, but was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked the story behind the movie. I bought the series, and with my son, enjoyed it immensely over the course of a week.  <br /> <br />Firefly is in my opinion the best thing to have come out of the Sci-fi Channel since the computer animated Starship Troopers series. The only element I didn't warm up to was the western theme, which was over-done. Bonnets and covered wagons pushed it a bit. <br /> <br />The series had so much room for development. Characters with questionable and mysterious backgrounds, well thought up antagonists - both great and minor. It truly is a shame that Sci-fi let go of this jewel. The graphic novels do this series no justice ... Firefly is something to be watched ... the characters' actions, dialogue and story cannot be put to paper.

B00005JPAM|4.0|First, I'd like to reiterate what everybody else has said - Helen Mirren's portrayal of Queen Elizabeth is superb. Her portrayal was very believable and sympathetic, as she showed a woman who, in the words of my dad, \\"thought she was popular with the people, but found out that she wasn't nearly as popular as Diana, and that really shook her.\\" <br /> <br />This movie is absorbing, thoughtful, revealing... and ironic. It's entitled \\"The Queen,\\" a title which would imply that it would cover the life of Elizabeth. In fact, this movie primarily covers a single week in her very long life as queen. And then, at the end of the movie, Tony Blair basically tells her that the week of Diana's death would just be a blip in people's memories - that people would remember Elizabeth for all of the things she'd done in her lifetime as queen, and not just for her reaction to Diana's death. But apparently that's not the case, if this movie is any indication.
B000068IEU|1.0|You talk about disappointed, this is the icing on the cake.  All I hear about is how scary and cutting edge this was.  Not even close.  Whatever big shot film critics say that are truly wrong.  I love older movies too and am open minded to the change in times and such. There are actually some scary or at least entertaining horror flicks during the 70's, but this is not one of them.  Seriously, don't buy this.  I don't know why it is so highly regarded.  The acting, story, and especially the music is terrible.  It's like porn quality acting, a story written in about 25 minutes and music from a Disney movie.  It could have been a good movie if they would have taken out the attempt at comedy, threw in some disturbing music, and made the bad guys, well, more bad.  It could be remade (which I'm usually against).

0743455967|5.0|Someone once told me, \\"If you want to know how to do something right, learn from the best.\\"  Well, here it is.  King has proven time and time again, year after year, novel after novel, that he's one of the best at his craft.  And in _On Writing_ he shares what he's learned over the years.  King's writing and teaching style is so fluid and natural I was drawn into this book as if it were one of his novels. Whether you're a novice writer just delving into the world of fiction writing or an experienced novelist, there's something to be learned from someone who's travelled the road.  I read the book through once but have gone back to it time and time again since then.  It's a book every writer should have on his/her bookshelf.

I bought three books by Patricia McConnell:<br />1)  How to be the Leader of the Pack...And have your dog love you for it<br />  (a WONDERFUL short primer on having happy relationships with dogs)<br />2)  The Other End of the Leash<br />  (a full-length book about communicating with dogs-- GREAT!!!!)<br />3)  Family Dog Training<br />  (a very readable, clear, wonderful book on training dogs gently--  it works!!  My dog is learning so quickly!)<br /><br />This is the best author I have ever found for people who want to learn how to train their dogs through understanding effective canine-human communication.  Read her books and you will never again try to train your dog through \\"leash pops\\", etc..  What a breath of fresh air!  Finally, training methods you can feel really, really good about.  Fun for dogs and humans.  I can't say enough good things about Patricia McConnell!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I own one of these and I LOVE it! I don't know how anyone could write a bad review about it. It is the first small sweeper like this that will work on ANY surface - haven't seen one out there yet that will. When you empty the dirt tray, you will see that it not only picks up the obvious like pieces of dirt, food crumbs, etc. It also gets fine hairs, and also DUST, yes DUST! So it does have pretty good suction to be able to do that. The rechargebale battery easily comes off the unit, so you don't have to find a place to put the whole unit while charging. This is SO nice for in-between sweeps, and not having to pull out the monster vac everytime to do a quick pick-up or small area. Got company coming in 5 minutes? This is PERFECT for those stressful situations. Anyway, can't say enough about it. I just love it ;-)
B000067J1H|4.0|I like to refer to it as \\"fashionably late\\" actually. My co-worker and I were discussing movies and books that throw you curveballs you never saw coming. This movie came up. I told him that I had wanted to see it, sort of, but never did. He recommended it and loaned a copy to me. I LOVED IT.  <br /> <br />Initally, I thought the movie was too dark, too disorganized, and the character actions were far too extreme. I remember thinking, why would any rational person do these things? Then, in the same moment he got it, I got it. I was thinking the same things he was saying. Noooo. Couldn't be. The movie had me replaying scenes for 2 days thinking \\"ohhhh that's why he/she did or said that.\\" I honestly never saw the twist coming and I was still stunned days later when trying to unravel it all. I think this is gonna be one of those \\"watch it again now that I understand it all\\" kinda movies. The usual suspects made me do that.  <br /> <br />The only gripe I have with the movie is the ending. I'm not a spoiler and I'm not about to start now. However, bad CG and a tidy wrap-up just didn't fit the rest of the movie. I understand that the book does a better job of fleshing it out and I might pick up a copy instead of watching the movie again. But I highly recommend this one if you are \\"fashionably late\\" like me.
038572179X|5.0|This sweeping novel covers a lifetime of a novelist from a child writing naive stories and a \\"play.\\"  The child's play becomes serious when there is a rape on the family estate and the servant ladies son is accused.  The events following over a lifetime make for compelling reading.  Again powerful seems not adequate to describe the story of events following that event on a hot summer night in England. Hard to put down once you begin. Makes you think when you finish.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|When the show first aired, I didn't think it would be much more than the usual tv fluff.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find it both immensely entertaining, full of humor and wit, as well as full of unexpected depth.  The emotional quest that the brothers go on, while searching for their father and fighting assorted bad things, is very compelling.  Over the course of the season real character growth happens.  And that alone, is worth the price of admission.  Two wonderful actors with great chemistry, fun and spooky cases, an underlying story that the PTB have clearly invested a lot of thought in:  this show has it all.
B0000C9ZBW|2.0|I looked at a lot of these watches and the designs are really superb! However, like other reviewers have pointed out, the black on the band scratches easily. Also, mine arrived DOA. I took it to a watch repair place and had them check the battery. I was a bit suprised to see MADE IN CHINA stamped on the inside. They had to replace the movement. I am disappointed.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Silent Hill sure is a surprise and it certainly gets the job done by freaking you out in every way possible. The movie starts off really quick, it doesn't run around anything and it gets right to the point. Rose (Radha Mitchell) is frantically looking for her daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) who hasn't been kidnapped but somehow sleepwalked all the way across a hectic highway to the edge of a canyon. You soon find out that this is a regular thing for Sharon and she is always saying things about Silent Hill while sleeping. After saving Sharon from attempting to throw herself off the edge Rose is fed up and takes a trip to Silent Hill against her husbands will and the real crazy stuff starts happening. After about 10 or 20 minutes into the movie when Rose has an accident entering Silent Hill and Sharon goes missing you start to doubt that anything more can be done with the story. It's actually a good feeling because you're unable to predict the next events and that's one of this films strengths.<br /><br />The acting is great and right on target, especially Radha Mitchell who goes above and beyond to save a child that seems so demented. I have never played the game Silent Hill but I was told there were changes made. The first change seems to be the biggest and that is Sharons mom takes the lead role and not her father. If you ask me the change was effective and positive because you can feel more emotion from the story and Radha Mitchell. The change even puts more to the story and actually allows Rose, Sharon, and Sharons past to have more in common. Another change is that in the game the town is covered in fog and snow but in this movie it's smoke and ash which actually make more sense because the back-story is the city is abandoned because of a coal mine fire that's still burning. That part actually freaked me out because it is said that the coal mine fire is modeled after one that actually exist in Pennsylvania, somewhere not too far from where I live.<br /><br />The most amazing thing about Silent hill is the sick creatures living deep within the town. I have never seen anything like these and they're perfectly nasty to give you that extra chill. Actually I should probably warn anyone with a weak stomach cause some of these guys remind you of the guy in the bed from the film Seven. Everything is perfectly paced and set so when it is time to creep you out your mind goes crazy. Silent Hill has a nice story that you wouldn't expect it to have since some scary flicks are lacking a good story these days. The question now is why did I give Silent Hill 4 stars if I talk about it like a 5 star movie? Well the problem is the ending. Silent Hill ends like a game would or a movie that is sure to have a sequel and since the viewer doesn't have the pleasure of playing this movie a different way to get an alternate ending like the game nobody will know what the heck was going on until a part 2. The movie is good and very entertaining, now all I'm waiting for is a sequel to clear a few things.g thing about Silent hill is the sick creatures living deep within the town.

B000005IU1|4.0|All right, ladies and gents, HERE'S how ya rock out! Ron Asheton, Dave Alexander, Scott Asheton and the GODFATHER of Punk himself, Iggy Pop (then called Iggy Stoogie). This album is so cool... <br />Okay, it's not perfect. We Will Fall is, to be frank, a disastrous, neverending train wreck with absolutely no musical merits, a failed attempt to be \\"atmospheric\\" for a group that does NOT do that kinda stuff. Ten minutes long... oh god, you have to wonder when it STOPS! The psychedelic Ann is a filler too. But the rest? For one is my favorite Stooges song, I Wanna Be Your Dog. Iggy's maniac vocals DOMINATE this song, he completely goes INSANE, to the point where you'd think he'd hurt the girl if she doesn't let him be her dog. The band also throws in a driving performance, with Ron positively SHREDDING. And the rest? Friggin' AWESOME. 1969 has one of the coolest wah-wah solos ever, and it's funny, too! No Fun is the other classic, and it kicks ass, and is damn funny to boot. It's true. And Real Cool Time is, dare I say it, Real Cool. But this is NOT for the faint of heart. You think Slipknot's heavy? They're ABBA. (For the record, Slipknot sucks, as does ABBA). So strap yourself in and get ready for a loud, wild, messed-up ride.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|Ok, for those of you who do not collect bootleg Kiss DVD`s, this set is for you.  For those of us that collect this stuff, visually speaking, I`m not that impressed.  I will start by saying that the sound is great.  Work was done on this and you can hear it with the winterland show and the Detroit show.  I was expecting the shows to look better than the bootlegs I already own.  I`m afraid to say that my bootleg copy of the Winterland show is better than what`s offered here.  My copy does not have as many jumps and is much clearer.  For those who would like to see an example of the differences in image quality that I am speaking about, refer to your copy of Kiss Exposed and you will see that the clips from Winterland, Detroit and Houston actually look better on Exposed than they do on Kissology.  Another example is the footage from the Midnight special.  For those of you who are up late at night, you might have seen the commercial advertising the sale of the Midnight Special TV series on DVD.  Well the Kiss footage from this set is simply outstanding.  I`ve never seen it that clear.  I expected the version from Kissology to be the same, but was dissapointed to see that the version was no better than the DVD bootleg I already own.  Again, I`m not talking about the sound as that has been approved upon, but I`m really suprised to see that the footage that Kiss was working with was no better than what most of us already own.  I can only think that they did not have access to the master tapes of the Midnight Special and relied on video copies that they did own.  This is not to say that you should not go out and buy this, it`s still very cool and the Largo bonus show was worth the price alone.  I drove from Montreal to a Walmart in Plattsburg after work and I bought the last copy they had.  This show is simply awesome and much better than the Houston show.  It is not the complete show as everyone knows, some songs are missing, but I cannot understand why they left off Kings of the Nightime World?  The song was played that night.  I like the commentary aspect of the DVD and the booklet and backstage pass is a nice added bonus.  I think overall Kiss did a good job.  It`s nice to have everything compiled on 3 discs and it creates excitement for the next 2 releases.  I can only hope that they release a full 1980 show with Eric Carr, and a full Creatures show.  That`s all I ask.  Now run out there and get yourself a copy, if you can manage it, get the Walmart version, the Largo show is really smoking.
B000005IU2|5.0|Still, what an album! If you want brilliant hard rock masterpieces, this is certainly one of them! The debut was brutal. But this transcends brutal. Along with The Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat, it's one of those records that will make those less hardy listeners run and hide. Just listen to L.A. Blues, AKA Formless Mess. When I played this tune for my brother, he covered his ears and ran away. I can't say I blame him, either. That song lacks melody, harmony, or anything else even remotely related. I love it. It gets better - T.V. Eye certainly fills the \\"brutal, insane, straightforward rock 'n' roll\\" quotient required of anything Stooges-related. Sex anthems 1970 and Loose prove that NOBODY can do sex anthems (no pun intended) like the Stooges. Then there's the slow, lurching mutant-blues Dirt, very underrated and very, VERY cool. And there's that title track... woof. All the hype about this one is true.<br />And Howard Tuttleman, you are so self-absorbed it's sickening. You claim yourself \\"Master Reviewer\\" and \\"Teenage Genious\\". Well, guess what? You misspelled \\"genius\\", which speaks VOLUMES about your intelligence.
B00013F38K|5.0|I forgot how old I was when I first saw the pilot.  Shaolin Kung Fu is a life style not only a Martial Art.  David Caradine who played Kwai Chang Cain was not the actor who was to be.  Bruce Lee originated the concept and wanted to be the main actor.  His son Brandon Lee played in one of the roles in a future episode.  Bruce Lee was too Oriental or Asian to play the part and never acted the role.  Wonder what Kung Fu would have been like if he did.  We will never know. <br />   This is not an action movie like Jackie Chan or Jet Li.  It is a movie to show the philosophy behind Kung Fu.  The movement of animals, the balance between man and nature.  Black and White.  Soft and Hard.  Man and Woman.  Yin and Yang.   Give and Take. Push and Pull. <br />   Kung Fu showed the simple things in life are always the best.  Just a bag Kwai Chang Cain carried after given to him by his Senior Priest and Sifu(Master).  In it a bowl, a book, some trinkets and a memory.  What would you carry in your bag?  Money? Makeup?  Would it be half full or half empty?
B000005IU1|4.0|Okay, it's not perfect at all. Why not? For one, there's the infamous We Will Fall, a ten-minute disaster that is unlistenable, endless, and void of any merits whatsoever. Harsh, but true. Anne isn't much either, a psychedelic ballad with Iggy attempting amusing-yet-annoying Jim Morrison-esque vocals. But the rest is excellent. I Wanna Be Your Dog is the most familiar track, having been covered by virtually every self-respecting punk band. Not coincidentally, it's the best thing the group ever recorded - Iggy's maniac vocals; a burning, brutal riff and a driving rhythm come together to make this one of the best sex anthems ever. No Fun is another classic song, and justly so. The group rocks out, and it's funny. Same with 1969, another keeper with a great wah-wah solo and hilarious lyrics. Meanwhile, the lesser-known Real Cool Time is - wait for it - real cool. Okay, there are a couple duds. But this is a great debut from the original punk band.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Confusion.  You must see Kill Bill 1 and 2 to understand.  Quite a good movie.  Bloody as it can get.  Quite graphic.  I  cringed at the sight of an eye being pulled out, someone getting scalped and hair flying upwards.  Splat, swoosh, squirt. <br />  I saw Kill Bill 1 and thought what the hey this movie is about.  I saw Kill Bill 2 and then I understood.  Neat, with a weird sense of styling.  Made me want to go out and buy the sword, a Hattori Hanzo Katana.  It was nice to see Gordon Liu.  He plays a Shaolin Monk Master in other movies.  Sonny Chiba was cool.  He played Hattori Hanzo, a ninja in other movies. <br />Only wish they played Spagheti western music like in Clint Eastwood movies.  Weird movie if you like a lot of blood splashing the screen.  Wear red sunglasses and it will be alright.  A little anime cartoons. Typical Japanese gore. Watch the movie and correct me if I am wrong.
0525948023|3.0|At the beginning of any new spiritual journey you don't have or get as many pieces of the puzzle as you might if you'd been on the path looking for a while. For those who are more spiritually \\"advanced\\", a more appropos book might be Robert Scheinfeld's new book, Busting Loose From the Money Game, a book that uses money as a segue into the whole issue of spirituality. People either love that book or they think Bob's a nut. But then, many newly discovered spiritual principles and laws of the universe are laughed at in the beginning. I invite you to compare the two books and make up your own mind. I've done that, and it's okay with me if I'm considered a \\"kook\\".
B00005JMUA|5.0|You must see this to understand a weird saga.  You would think they killed Bill twice.  I did not recognize Darryl Hannah.  After all I first saw her with a fish tail and 2 good eyes. At the end she had none. Nice legs though, such a foul mouth she had. Hey pull my eyes out and hear the words come forth. Yeah close your ears if you can't stand the language. <br />It was bloody and gore. See this movie.  Buy 1 and 2. You can always make a Frisbee out of these discs.  Or Pull and shoot it with a shotgun. <br />Go buy a Hattori Hanzo Sword and make your own movie.  Is that where they got the song Marry me Bill?  Fifth Dimension.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|It's tempting to imagine that the overwhelmingly negative reaction to Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm was down to Harvey Scissorhands' reputation. After all, hadn't the film sat on the shelf for a year because Gilliam and the Weinsteins were arguing over the ending? Hadn't Harvey fired the cinematographer and (quite rightly in my opinion) insisted that Samantha Morton not be cast over Gilliam's wishes? And wasn't the film suddenly rushed out on the market as part of the mass dumping of other troubled Miramax/Dimension titles when the real-life Grim Brothers were making their lucrative slash-and-burn exit from Disney? How could it possibly be any good? <br /> <br />The big surprise is that it actually is. While the bad reviews all seemed to focus on how this almost certainly wasn't Gilliam's vision of the film because of all the problems (as if he's known for untroubled shoots) and went to town on it, I found it surprisingly entertaining and even more surprisingly well-constructed. The screenplay is often genuinely witty and imaginative, the much-derided look of the film and its special effects are both perfectly right for the film in their sense of studio/storybook reality, Dario Marianelli's score is beautifully effective and the film itself is a lot of fun despite Heath Ledger's typical mumbling losing some of the funnier lines. Pitched somewhere between George Pal and Time Bandits, it sees a well paired Matt Damon and Ledger (mumbling aside) scamming their way from village to village vanquishing theatrically faked demons and witches until they find themselves up against the real thing in the form of Monica Belluci's immortal child-snatching queen (\\"She's 500 years old and the years have not been kind, I'm telling you!\\"). There's never much doubt about the outcome, and Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare's comic relief in the Terry Thomas-Peter Sellers roles is clumsily overplayed, but if you're willing to go along with it and take it for what it is rather than what it should be, it's a lot of fun. All in all Gilliam's most satisfying film since 12 Monkeys. I loved it. <br /> <br />Gilliam's commentary avoids being too specific about the production problems while the two featurettes are typical promotional love-ins, but there's a good selection of deleted scenes, including an excellent battle with a living tree that's more exciting than anything in the picture proper.
0062502182|4.0|In the past month, in very accidental manner, I read two books which resonate similar themes.  This was one; the other was \\"Life of Pi.\\" Each is written in the mind or perspective of a young boy. Each involves a journey of great proportion,. And, each involves the boy's wisdom maturing, flowering, and ultimately surpassing the older and previously wiser people -- people like myself.<br /><br />Recently, Frank McCourt wrote \\"Angeles Ashes\\" with the great wide-eyed vision of his youth. His ability to write in the boyish perspective  was one reason that book sold so well and touched so many hearts.  This book follows that path; but, instead of the Emerald Isle, it leads us through the arid and unknown world of the Saharan sprawl.<br /><br />The alchemist's role is great, but not nearly as long as one may have anticipated.  But, like the typical wise man of folklore, modern novel (Zorba or Magus), or modern  movie (Yoda ), the wise man's speaking through riddle is both embracing and enticing.  We love to hear the alchemist respond to the questions posed by the boy, as they produce only more questions.<br /><br />Written in a simplistic, choppy fashion, the reader may be fooled to believe that the topic is great, but the writer is not.  To the contrary, the style of the delivery perfectly compliments the story.  It is the stitching for the marvelous fabric.  The artistry is not just the story, but the method in which it is told.<br /><br />Do not underestimate the author's intentions of this book, or how intentionally it was written. This is not an  amateur's attempt to bring folklore to the 21st century. This is the product of a professional 21st century folklore artist.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|When I first heard that Jim Steinman wasn't going to be directly involved, I was a bit worried. Would it capture the feeling of the first two \\"Bat\\" albums? Would it be a worthy end piece for the trilogy? <br /> <br />Well, let me tell you ... this CD blew me away!   <br /> <br />Half the songs are by Jim Steinman, Diane Warren contributed one song, and the rest are by Desmond Child (with a few co-writers). They all fit together perfectly! There's not one weak song in the bunch. I won't comment on every song because I can't possibly tell you how good they are with mere words - you have to hear them - but I do want to mention two songs: <br /> <br />\\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" -  Forget about the sappy Celine Dion version. THIS is the way the song was meant to be performed! It has so much more power and emotion than it ever did when Celine sang it. I LOVE it!  <br /> <br />\\"The Monster is Loose\\" - the title track, written by Child, is very different than anything Meat has ever done ... yet somehow, it is a true Meat Loaf song. It sets the tone for the entire CD and brings the trilogy into the 21st century. Possibly the best thing Child has ever written. <br /> <br />\\"Bat Out Of Hell III\\" definitely captures the heart and soul of the first two albums. Everything we loved about them is there, but a whole new dimension has been added to it. Meat Loaf, and the trilogy, have grown up.  It was well worth the wait!
0618680004|5.0|\\"I seem somehow to have acquired a reputation for pugnacity toward religion.\\"  So writes the world's most famous atheist, Richard Dawkins, in _The God Delusion_ (Houghton Mifflin).  He maintains that he doesn't like debates and he doesn't thrive on confrontation, but that title will not convince anyone that he is avoiding confrontation: \\"If you believe in God,\\" the title seems to say, \\"you are deluded.\\"  There is no compromise in these chapters; when Dawkins sees a false doctrine or faulty reasoning, he marshals the considerable power of his accessible writing and measured polemics.  He does explain, \\"I shall not go out of my way to offend, but nor shall I don kid gloves to handle religion any more gently than I would handle anything else.\\"  He has never before written a book to convert anyone to his way of thinking about religion.  (However, this book is dedicated to the memory of the creator of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe_, Douglas Adams, who read Dawkins's earlier books on evolution and became an atheist as a result.  Dawkins writes about him fondly here, as \\"possibly my only convert\\".)  This book sets out to change people's minds.  It will be interesting to see what an effect it has.  Jerry Falwell is not going to read it and suddenly realize he has been in the wrong business all these years, and it is hard to imagine any of his camp even picking up a book with such a title.  No one from the Taliban (fundamentalists Dawkins frequently compares in degree with some Christians) is going to be swayed by it.  Those who are already atheists will find entertaining arguments to confirm them in their own position, and so will agnostics (although Dawkins feels that while agnosticism might be an appropriate stance on some questions where the evidence is not in, the probability of a God is so small that it is best to be strongly on the atheism side of the spectrum of disbelief).  I highly recommend this book to anyone of any religious belief who cannot conceive how anyone else could live without religion; such readers will find much to think about here.  Dawkins is funny at times (even when it is obvious he has an \\"How can they possibly believe that?\\" exasperation), always clear, often gentle, seldom angry, and generally persuasive, although quite possibly there will be few who are persuaded.<br /><br />Dawkins rationally sets out to discuss the arguments put forward for the existence of a God.  Aquinas's Teleological Argument is the famous Argument from Design: all the complex creation around us seems to be designed, so there must be a designer.  This gets to an infinite regress, with something as complex as such a designer requiring a designer of his own.  It is also the argument which impressed the young Charles Darwin, who was eventually to show that design didn't take a tinkering designer: \\"There has probably never been a more devastating rout of popular belief by clever reasoning than Charles Darwin's destruction of the argument from design.\\"  Naturally, being a biologist who has written extensively on this theme, Dawkins gives a full chapter and more to just how badly the Argument from Design can be contrasted with the idea that evolution quite sufficiently produces the appearance of design.  Believers have come up with many proofs of God, but people believe not because of proofs, but because almost always, they are brought up that way.  Dawkins feels that it is nothing short of abuse to indoctrinate children into a feeling about religion; they are too young to decide such complexities. He does allow that religious education is part of literary culture, and is enthusiastic about the King James Bible as a literary standard, but he can't read the book without dropping his jaw at its absurdities.<br /><br />Dawkins has an engaging passion for his life and the world he inhabits.  Toward the end of the book, he quotes his lamented friend Douglas Adams: \\"The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas-covered planet going around a nuclear fireball ninety million miles away and think this to be _normal_ is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.\\"  Dawkins is clearly delighted by nature and the human ability to understand it scientifically.  He also has reverence (I don't think he'd mind that word) for the mysteries that we cannot intuitively comprehend, like the oddities of quantum theory or speed of light travel.  He has irreverence for those who rely on the supernatural to give them a sense of joy or love, but it is clear that anyone who insists that life would be empty or meaningless without belief in God can't use Dawkins as an example.  This book will be delightful reading for nonbelievers, and a challenge for others.  It is a personal manifesto of appealing clarity and passion.he surface of a gas-covered planet going around a nuclear fireball ninety million miles away and think this to be _normal_ is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.\\"  Dawkins is clearly delighted by nature and the human ability to understand it scientifically.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|\\"Munich\\" is not one of Steven Spielberg's best films,but it is still worth watching due mainly to a brilliant cast.Eric Bana,Geoffrey Rush, <br />and Daniel Craig are especially outstanding.The film also has an  <br />impressive physical production and a haunting John Williams score. <br />But there are problems.For one thing,it's too long.That seems to be  <br />a problem many directors have today.Why do all of today's big movies have to run nearly three hours?Spielberg could have cut half an hour,and the film would have been much better.But the biggest problem is that Spielberg,Kushner,and Roth have really stacked the deck for Israel here. <br />The story is entirely one-sided.There is an excellent scene where the Arab <br />and Israeli agents confront each other,and the three filmmakers would have been wise to pursue that angle.Instead,no explanation is given to the Arabs'side or to WHY they seized the athletes in the first place.The result is a decidedly unbalalnced story.And the ending is ambiguous.Still, <br />\\"Munich\\" is an ambitious film worth watching.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|We've all seen the movie.  We all know what a masterpiece it is, so I'm not going to write a review about the actual movie.  That part gets 5 stars.  But to boast that you're releasing the unaltered version (something fans have wanted on DVD since the format came to be), then present it in 4:3 letterbox and 2.0 Dolby sound is cruel, pathetic and nothing more than an insult to fans everywhere.  Better that the unaltered version not be released at all.  It amazes me that George Lucas refuses to satisfy his fans so completely that he pulls something like this. <br /> <br />In this day and age where a DVD player, surround sound system and an average TV can show movies better than theaters can, you DON'T put out a movie in 4:3 letterbox (especially Star Wars!).  The picture quality is so horrible, you don't even want to think about watching it on a widescreen TV.  To say nothing about how crappy it sounds.  If you bought the 2004 DVD releases, this 2-disc version is an utter waste of money.  The special edition version is identical to what's already on DVD.   If you don't have the first DVD release, I suppose it could work.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|To be perfectly honest, the first time I listened to this CD I wasn't all that impressed. There just seemed to be something missing. Something was different. But the more I listened to this disk, the more I came to like it.  <br /> <br />I'll admit, I was a little biased before I even took the wrapper off this CD. There was the whole \\"Ben wasn't a part of this album\\" thing in play coupled with a few pretty negative reviews on here, and the high expectations (Fallen set the bar pretty hight). Don't get me wrong, this disk is not quite as great as Fallen, but it more than holds it's own once you get into it. <br /> <br />I knew I was hooked when I realized that I had several of the songs stuck in my head. So give this one a chance and come in with an open mind.
0743454537|5.0|Wow, what an intense journey. I Loved the book from the beginning and was so touched by the topic and how Picoult dealt with the emotions involved from every side. <br /> <br />When I finished it, I was angry and felt manipulated. But the ending stayed with me. As I have thought about it over time, I realized the ending was the only way the reader could finish the story without hating Anna. And to hate Anna would be the wrong way to emerge from this very difficult story. And, truth be told, anger is not an unusual emotion in this kind of a story, especially in real life. <br /> <br />I think that Jodi Picoult offered a very deep and touching scenario and allowed the details to unfold in a way that many of us could relate to in this tale of love and heartbreak. I felt that I could relate to every character in the piece, both in loving them and feeling frustrated by them. Not at all different from real life.
B000GFLAI0|2.0|Which has obviously passed.  I can't imagine he needs the money so why is he recording this stuff?  What this CD doesn't need is another review-159!  But here's mine anyway-first off-I have never been a Dylan fan (his voice grated on me) and in my youth only bought and liked Blood on the Tracks.  My husband, on the other hand is a fan, and he thinks this album sucks.  Well-it is nothing special for a formerly brilliant poet (and is basically reeking with co-dependent lyrics-the world doesn't need more of those-Country provides enough)although I agree with the other folks that think his voice has improved with age.  I gave it 2 stars because it isn't a bad listening album, it is just a bad Dylan album. And I was hoping I could convert.
B000J10ERO|4.0|This is a solid comic book movie. I liked it. Yes, it isn't perfect but it sure was entertaining. I liked it much better than Spider-Man 2... but not as much as Batman Begins. Killer rental!
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Hey out there everyone that thought,this wasnt that great are you for real.This has to be the cream of the crop and a dream come truue for me and many other kiss fans.. KISS  ROCKS>>>>>
B000HIVO64|4.0|I like this alot. it is not as easy to grasp the grove like his previous records. Cellphone's Dead sounds like something Caberet Voltaire (remember them???) would do. The rest is solid. The other reviewers have said it all except my Caberet Voltaire reference.
B000FZET5W|4.0|sonny rollins' tenor playing sounds effortless, like talking or humming. jazz artists who feel the urge to play classical concert music, branford marsalis and regina carter, find ravel's pavane pour une infante defunte a seductive choice. sonny rollins' rendition of the way you look tonight is a jazz variation of ravel's pavane. <br />monk's sound, as always, is definitively monk.  <br />rollins and monk play well together.
0375831002|5.0|The Book Thief is an astounding and powerful story, with a surprisingly warm narrator. I had to intentionally slow down my reading to prolong the ending, I did not wish for it to come so soon. Thought provoking and unnerving. I found myself pausing frequently to catch my breath - taking in the fullness of the phrases and lines throughout. Haunting from start to finish. Death himself, the colors, a book thief. So ugly and so glorious . . . so damning and brilliant - the power of words ~ indeed!
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This Lp is great great great ! <br /> <br />What a genius ! This LP sounds very similar to the \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" Pink Floyd Album... <br />
B000A6CLL0|4.0|I was never that conviinced by the first season of Enterprise which is why I never really followed it up. Then I decided to go for it and buy Season Three and I must say it has improved a lot. While it does not really have all the traits that amde the orginal Star Trek great, it is by no means a bad series, on the contrary.  The characters might not be as interesting as even the next generation characters, but the overall production is really improved.
B000002A46|5.0|Merry Christmas is a relativly new Christmas tradition that has already yielded a true Christmas classic with the retro, fun, All I Want For Christmas Is You.<br /><br />Mariah balances the spritual and secular sides of the holiday like a pro, and she delivers the vocal goods on Joy To The World, a simple, repsectful take on Silent Night, and one of the standouts, O Holy Night.<br /><br />Santa Claus Is Coming To Town celebrates the kid in all of us, and Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) adds an adult vibe to holiday season emotions.<br /><br />This CD was first released in time for Christmas 1994, and that year a sleigh full of holiday releases were issued, including Donna Summer's outstanding release, Christmas Spirit. See my review of that release and my listmania, Diva Christmas Albums.<br /><br />Ken
B00005O5UJ|1.0|What a tremendous waste!  There is no disputing that as a classic rock masterpiece, this, Jethro Tull's best known album is a force to be reckoned with.  The MVP of this album is not so much Anderson although the flautist does some brilliant work on this but the real reason this album rocks is the work of the underrated but excellent guitarist, Martin Barre.  Every track is a riff fest and how he comes up with great riff after great riff is beyond me!  It's been said that between Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, all the great riffs of classic rock had been exhausted but try telling that to Martin Barre!  Simply brilliant guitar work!<br /><br />But what a great pity!  The mini-lp cardboard replica sleeve is one of the better ones that I've seen; the cardboard is felt and of very good sturdy build and quality and the artwork is simply stunning.  You also get all the lyrics in English and Japanese but is that alone worth the extremely high price?  The answer is it would be if the sound quality of this allegedly remastered disc was anywhere near decent.<br /><br />I have heard many, many cds in the many, many years that I've been a fan of all kinds of music but I have to struggle to recall a disc that is so poorly mastered.  The sound quality is even worse than the non-remastered version that I got years ago!  This is a great sin given the excellent material that Aqualung represents and as a musician, I'd be ashamed to admit that this is my cd as it currently sounds on this version of the album.  The volume levels are ridiculously low and when you raise the volume all you hear is extremely muddy sound which makes you wonder what the heck they actually \\"remastered\\"!  I can only conclude that this album hasn't been remastered from the best possible available master tape from the vaults.  The laughable irony of it all is that the only time the sound becomes relatively better is on the last couple of filler tracks which of themselves are totally unnecessary and even detract from the overall album which to its defense is probably why it's called \\"filler\\" to begin with.<br /><br />Ian Anderson, I hope you are reading this and if you are, please, please please take control of your material and prevent the incompetents from killing your brilliant work.  Take charge and commission another TRULY remastering project using the best possible masters and ensure that you yourself would be proud of the output.<br /><br />In the meantime, give this very expensive and terrible-sounding version a very wide berth.  The phrase, \\"you can't judge a book by its cover\\" certainly holds very true here.ct from the overall album which to its defense is probably why it's called \\"filler\\" to begin with. <br /> <br />Ian Anderson, I hope you are reading this and if you are, please, please please take control of your material and prevent the incompetents from killing your brilliant work.

B000002BQK|5.0|This is probably the best Mariah Carey album ever released and I know that's completely opinionated but this review, of course, is going to reflect my opinion.  The first single `Honey' is still one of the most infectious, sexy and downright brilliant R&B / Hip-Hop tracks every released.  Every time I hear this track I can see her music video and that makes it all the more wonderful (I'm sorry but I still hold strong to my belief that not only is she one of the most talented BUT ALSO one of the most beautiful women in the industry).  Tracks like `Breakdown' and `The Roof' give Mariah her upbeat hip-hop groove while songs like the irresistible `Babydoll' dripping wet with sexuality prove that Mariah is the maiden of titillating bedside manor. <br /> <br />Tracks like the title track `Butterfly' give us that soft side of Mariah, those ballads that made her famous in the first place, and as far as ballads go, by far her best EVER is `My All' which gets me going every time I hear it.  With the Spanish guitars at her side Mariah has never been so incredibly desirable.  With every track here Mariah proves that she alone deserves the title of queen of R&B, and even though after this release she had her share of minor slumps, her brilliant `Emancipation of Mimi' album has her once again at the top of her game as if she never left.  Definitely, one of the best all around albums, not only by Mariah but ever.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|1st let me say that with bands like Kiss & Led Zeppelin this doesn't even begin to touch the live shows that are in their vault. Kiss unlike most bands video taped every show from the beginning to now, so you can imagine what they have to draw from. <br /> <br />Now let just say that to all hardcore KISS fans this is the stuff to get, the quality is awesome & for the not so KISS fan still buy it. Now having said that i agree with another reviewer that the bootlegs that are out there are of better quality, but if you keep up with KISS & bootlegging you will realize that towards the end of 04 & all through 05 the KISS CORPORATION cracked down on bootlegging & a lot of people went to jail & had their cd's, tapes & albums run over with a construction truck. (the article used to be on Kissonline) so the source tapes that Tommy Thayer had to pull from have probably been sitting around forever. <br /> <br />NOW on to the review: the Long Beach 74 footage is great, earliest known footage of the band live (although i have heard rumors that the guys DO HAVE footage from the Hotel Diplomat), the clarity of this plus IN CONCERT & the Mike Douglas Show is incredible. To answer an earlier reviewers question the reason KISS didn't use the tapes from the Actual Mike Douglas Show is due to licensing issues & to answer another reviewer's question the backstage pass comes with all of them & is a replica sticker of a 75 pass. <br /> <br />The Winterland footage, Tokyo & Houston footage has been cleaned up considerably, now i own concerts for kiss from 74-83 & 1 from the farewell show in Roanoke, VA & as i agree the bootleg tapes of Winterland are better, Kissology is official release from the band, so i have no complaints except that i find it weird that the 76 Anaheim show on the DESTROYER TOUR wasn't included. <br /> <br />I highly recommend anybody picking this up, so they can see a great band from it's infancy all the way to mega stardom & with the other 2 volumes coming out next year it's only getting better. As far as i'm concerned the guys could just keep coming out with the live DVD's & i would be happy. <br /> <br />BTW i have also gotten all 3 bonus discs as well, 76 Detroit, 77 Garden & 77 Largo show <br /> <br />to close BUY THIS you will not be disappointed
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Three Days Grace took their sweet time compiling a blistering sophomore effort, an album that not only meets the standards set by their debut but surpasses them and delivers a solid album than truly proves the weight of a band that has grown musically and lyrically.  `One X' is an extremely strong album, one that should keep their fans happy for quite some time. <br /> <br />Starting things off with the in-your-face track `It's All Over', Three Days Grace doesn't waste anytime getting to the brute force that made `I Hate Everything About You' such a blockbuster success.  The second track, `Pain', has a very different feel to it, and it took me a while to get into it but the diluted sound to the verses is actually really cool.  The first single off the album, `Animal I Have Become', follows in the same vein and delivers a brilliant rock track, and it's probably an even better single than `I Hate Everything About You', it's catchy, it's strong and it's relatable...a true anthem for the youth of today.  Another blistering track is `Riot' which makes me just want to scream along \\"Let's start a riot!\\" every time I hear this song.  The closing track `One X' is one of those tracks that tries to be inspirational with the chanting \\"we stand above the crowd\\" and it actually pulls it off quite well.  A great way to close out the album. <br /> <br />But heavy anthems and blistering guitar work is not all this band has to offer.  Some of the best tracks on this album are stripped down and simpler than that.  `Never Too Late' is the first track on the album that capitalizes on the finger picking acoustic sound, and the lyrics about fighting against the impulse of suicide carries a strong message.  `Get Out Alive' is one of my favorite songs on this album.  The song is about relying in yourself and not leaving your life in others hands.  It's a very strong song with a very deep message for those who want to find it.  `Over & Over' is another song that I really like, using the strings to give it a unique sound as they sing about another broken relationship.  But when it comes to relationship songs, one of the best here is `Gone Forever' which switches from soft and simple to heavy and strong.  Great all around track. <br /> <br />So as you can see Three Days Grace has delivered a top of the line album that makes good for the time they spent working on it.  We've been waiting three years for them to grace us with their presence again, and it was well worth the wait.  It's nice to see a band you like become a band you absolutely love.  Great work guys.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|My first impression of this album is that it doesn't sound like a Bat out of Hell production. The first two albums at least had the theme of a Motorcycle given the albums an impression that it was like a soundtrack for a road movie. The motorcycle road movie theme seems missing on this particular album, apart from the album cover artwork. There also seemed to be an emotional content missing somewhere and the album itself wasn't telling me a story like I was on some mystical journey. <br /> <br />The songs I do like on this album are \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" by Jim Steinman, \\"Cry Over Me\\" by Dianne Warren, \\"If God Could Talk\\" by Desmond Child. However \\"Cry Over Me\\" sounds a bit weird because it is written from a female perspective. The other songs on the album didn't do more for me, even the Steinman penned songs. <br /> <br />This album isn't my cup of tea and I would advise anyone contemplating getting it to at least listen to it first to make up their own minds.
B000000OU0|5.0|This album is so polished and clean it's hard to believe that it's really a live album.  Songs like `Hotel California' and the closing track `Desperado' are so beautifully arranged and executed that you feel as though your there, in the audience, you own little private live session.  This is actually the first Eagles album I've ever listened to.  I've never been a fan of 70's rock but my best friend just uploaded this album onto my computer yesterday and told me to give it a try.  Reluctantly I did, but that reluctance turned into thankfulness.  This is a great album, not just because it's polished and clean but because musically it's brilliant.  I'm a new fan, and can't wait to hear more.  And I do agree with the masses, `Hotel California' (one of the only Eagles songs I had heard prior to this morning) is truly one of the greatest songs ever penned...and on this disc it's at it's grandest.
B000HIVO64|5.0|I didn't want to get out of my car yesterday after buying and having a first listen of The Information.  This is a brilliant album.  It tantalizes each and every delicate nerve.  The layering of each song goes so deep, with so many intricate sounds and instruments.  I could've driven around for hours listening to it..especially Movie Theme and Strange Apparition.  This is a little more up-tempo than Sea Change, but has the depth.  I personally didn't take Sea Change off my CD for 6 months.  This one will surely be on my #1 listening list for months to come. With the weather changing, and a melencholy feeling all around, this CD is the breath of fresh air I, and hopefully many others needed.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I bought this yesterday at Best Buy, but haven't had a chance to check it out. I'm sure the set is excellent and I can't wait to watch. But I have just one quick question, I've seen a couple mentions of a replica backstage pass being included in the package, but my set did not have this. Is this another piece that is only available at certain stores, or did they only put it in some of the boxes? Not a big deal at all, just curious
B0009S4IHY|4.0|Boy, did this movie suck at the beginning! And boy, did it just get better and better from there on in. Even the Oriental humor, which is usually so awful, was actually funny at times. The action sequences, while a little too often fanciful, were very impressive, even innovative. Chow is a talented guy. Having seen this I'm interested to see what his earlier work is like. If you like martial arts/action/weird comedy, you'll love this.
0201485672|5.0|The book is critical for beginner developers who want to achieve the next level.  The topic is presented as \\"cleaning up code\\".  In the process; however, it teaches how to move from bad design to good.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|There are some cool ideas and action sequences here, but the script doesn't do them justice. You never really feel Constantine is in that much danger, that there's anything he can't handle. Without that, it's just a guy going through the motions. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent movie, just not the movie it could've been. Pity. <br />
B0009I7NNA|2.0|OK, so they won awards for this album, but to me that's proof that the public eats up anything that gets radio play. Honestly, it's the worst of their three albums. I mean they simply sold out with this album. I'll admit to liking it a little. There are some good song, but there is no edge to them anymore. To quote a friend \\"They went from being Iron Maiden clones to Guns and Roses clones.\\" That pretty much sums up A7X for me. They have never been super innovative with their music, but at least with SOTST and Waking the Fallen they had mostly interesting tracks. City of Evil is simply another nauseating nu-metal album. The only great tracks on this album would have to be M.I.A. and Betrayed(which is a tribute to Dimebag Darrel). The rest of them just blend in with all the other stuff that pollutes the airwaves.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Kate Beckinsale is stunning in this - take her out and the movie kinda falls flat. The story's nothing special. The effects are decent, but nothing ground-breaking. The acting is capable. The premise of werewolves fighting vampires is cool, but a more involving plotline would've been even cooler. (Can't say more without spoilers.)  <br /> <br />All in all it got the level of acclaim it deserved and nothing more. Worth seeing, but instantly forgettable.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Interesting characters and plot. If they would make a sequel to <br />the movie or more TV shows I would pay to see them.
B000957O82|2.0|Saw this as an inflight movie. Boy, did I pray for engine trouble, so we'd have to land and I could get away! Sucks or what? I liked Smith in 'I, robot', 'Independence day', etc, but this was awful. It's a one-joke movie. Problem is, the one joke was the one plastered all over the TV spots and trailers (the jet ski incident). The highlights involved the subplot of him teaching a guy to be cool - wish that'd been the main storyline instead - far, far superior! Will not be adding this to my wishlist.
0684803356|3.0|I learned a very important lesson here; take a good peak at the book before you get it. The Scribner publication (paperback) of this Hemingway Novel wasn't the one I believe most people read. This was spattered everywhere with \\"Thee\\" and \\"Thou.\\" That really detracted from the story. Unfortunately I don't think even with out that distraction the story wouldn't have been much better. It also would have helped me had I known more about the bigger picture. I'm not that familiar with Spanish history and wasn't sure who represented what. Also a strange personal quirk; I keep thinking of the protagonist Robert Jordan, and transposing him in my mind with Di Vinci Code protagonist Robert Langdon. I guess it's the common name Robert.
B000FIMG68|4.0|I enjoyed season 2 much more than season 1 as there seemed to be more answers, more action, more character development... simply MORE. To be honest, I got a little bored with the first season at times. It was infuriating keeping you in the dark, but then it was supposed to create intrigue. But I often found that the characters or the episode plots weren't giving me enough to make up for that deficiency. Still, I stuck with it. And I'm glad I did. The second season far surpassed the standards set by the first. Not only do you learn more about the characters, the island, and the Others, but it introduced new characters, who were both likeable and dynamic in their interplay with the original ones. And it had it's fair share of shocks. Not everyone who started out in the first season made it all the way to the second. Well... Need I say more???  <br />  <br />Supposedly the third season is going to increase the level of action and answer even more of the questions, WITHOUT posing too many new ones. If that's the case, the third is going to be the best so far.  <br />  <br />Get this quick and get up to speed on the story so far. You don't want to miss out on season 3 and a show that promises to be the televisual highlight of 2007! <br />
1569242739|5.0|I am not a Vegan or Vegetarian but prefer to cook vegan and vegetarian meals.  I find vegetarian recipes more fun and creative than meals that focus on meat.  Isa's books are by far the most creative (and tasty) I have used and I highly recommend them to anyone.  To omnivores who are wondering if these recipes only taste good to vegans who have forgotten the way cupcakes are \\"supposed\\" to taste; you have nothing to fear.  Happy Baking!
0141439475|3.0|Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is recommended for anyone interested in contrasting the 'original' version of the story with the (mostly) better-known film versions from Universal and others. The novel is anything but a 'mad scientist' yarn, with a great deal of soul-searching from both the title character and his creation. As noted in other reviews, the language is the typically 'flowery' prose of the early 18th century, and there are several instance of paragraphs being restated just a few lines apart(presumably Shelley rewrote some paragraphs over the course of several years, without eliminating the originals).<br /><br />I thought there was a bit too much time spent on some of the minor supporting characters, all of whom seemed to have deep, complex backstories usually found in TV soap operas. Once Frankenstein and the monster finish their lengthy 'flashback sequence' storytelling, the action picks up, and the basic 'man vs. monster' conflict takes over, enhanced by each character trying to reconcile their actions with their own 'inner demons'.<br /><br />The scientific plausibility is questionable at best, and some may not like the less than clear-cut explanation behind Frankenstein's 'creative process'. I think the ambiguity can be set aside for the sake of an entertaining story. If you can make it through the middle chapters of the book(AKA, 'the bit with  the family in the cottage'), you'll be won over by 'Frankenstein'.
B000E1ZK5A|5.0|Yes, I am a video geek...I actually owned this movie on D-VHS and it was the best looking title of ALL my D-VHS movies, even better than Ice Age and Terminator 2 (I still have both of these on D-VHS).  The HD-DVD is every bit the equal of its D-VHS predecessor...amazing clarity, wonderful shadow detail and a soundtrack that will bust your windows with the right sub-woofer.  This is pure and simple demonstration material.
B000I5Y8XM|5.0|I had shivers down my spine right from the first song on this CD. After the dreamy new age voyage of \\"Two Horizons,\\" \\"Signature\\" takes us back to Moya's Irish roots. The songs are dreamy and ethereal, heavily featuring traditional Irish instruments (including Moya's own harp playing). All of the songs are a bit haunting and utterly beautiful. Moya's voice is better than ever, and the lyrics are thoughtful, enchanting, and inspirational. At times, her voice is the softest feather- and then at other times, it hits home like an arrow hitting a bullseye. There is still quite a bit of Christian influence; yet the Christian songs are universal in their message and will not leave idividuals of other denominations feeling alienated. All in all, I would say that this is one of Moya's best albums to date- it combines the best Irish influences from her Clannad albums, mixes in some of the best from her more Christian albums (\\"Whisper to the Wild Water\\" and \\"Perfect Time\\"), and keeps you floating in the dream world that Moya has created on every album she has ever done. Moya has a truly unique way of lifting you up when you are sad, and lifting you higher when you are happy. If you love this album, do your family and friends a favor and intruduce them to it as well. I have played \\"Signature\\" for people who have very diverse musical tastes- and everyone so far has been captivated by it!
B000GPIPVU|4.0|its more like Dan Fogelberg.   While I was really blown away by the CD's first two tracks, I found the rest of the album a bit of a let-down:  Pleasant, a nice showcase for Mr. LaMontayne voice, but lyrically undistinguished.  Even so, I've enjoyed the CD quite a bit -- ESPECIALLY THE FIRST TWO TRACKS -- and would recommend it to fans of Nick Drake, Jack Johnson and -- face it -- Dan Fogelberg.  I know it's hipper to be likened to Drake than Fogelberg (by a long stretch) but let's not get carried away, people!
B000IOM0YM|3.0|Every KISS fan's dream video collection is probably a full unedited concert from every tour.  We're not quite there, but after three decades, KISS finally has a worthy video release.  Over six hours of footage on two discs plus a bonus disc (in Amazon's case, it's a seven-track Madison Square Garden disc from 1977).  None of it is new to anybody thanks to years of...uh...\\"tape trading\\"...but you'll appreciate the comparative transfer quality.  In particular, the Cadillac Michigan footage (which has a modern narration done over the phone by a local participant) is cleaner than it's ever been. <br /> <br />The DVD auto plays out of the box but, once you hit \\"Menu\\", has a fine structure separated by decade, then feature, and if you choose a concert, by song.   <br /> <br />There's plenty of footage missing, most glaringly \\"Beth\\" from the Paul Lynde Show.  Considering Stanley even mentions Peter sitting at the keyless piano in the liner notes, you'd think they'd include it. <br /> <br />In any case, it's here, and I'm happy to have it.  Bring on Volume 2!
B000078DOI|5.0|Frusciante really earned his sock stripe here! This kid is A MAZ ING! 19? And plays this well! John played his tail off on Mom's Milk! Chad really proved his skin skills here also. Funk, Rock, Punk all making the dough of this band! Flea and Swan? What Else needs to be said about them! Does Anybody wants some MAGIC JOHNSON!
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Of all the films I watched this year, this one impressed me the most. It is well directed, edited, acted, and shot. It deals with an extremely controversial issue by attacking it head on, and making both sides laugh at themselves. Thank You for Smoking is both hilarious, and terrifying at the same. You can't help but fall in love with one of the most despicable, morally vacant characters ever to grace the big screen. When he gets what's coming to him, you fell sorry for the guy, and root for him to come out on top. If you want to laugh your butt off, while learning a little something about how to succeed in American politics and big business, watch this film!
B0002TKOYG|5.0|Being in my 40's and remembering the Chili's in 1985, this is not the novalty punk/funk band they once where. Yes, they still have the funk, but this is truely a great group of pure musicians all at the top of their game. The technical skill at each instrument can be compared with the rock ledgends of the past and they more than hold their own. In 2004 during the 3 shows at Hyde Park in London the Chili Peppers demonstrate on a live disc what many fans of the band have known for a long time, these guys can really play. The range of funk and disco songs to hard core guiter rifts that rival that of the greats like Page and Beck (Jeff)showcase how good this band has become. Add to that the pure excitement that came out of the early U2 shows and you have the best live band touring today. Put on a pair of headphones, close your eyes and see if you agree. It is a shame that this disc was never released here in the states since there is finally a live document (Other than the Slane DVD) that captures this band doing what is does best, Rock out live! No back up singers and extra players, its pure old school all the way through the 27 tracts. I myself can't believe the comparisons I have referenced, but they are well deserved. Keith Richards once said that any band on a given night may be the best band in the world. These 3 nights in London showcase what is truely a great band.
1401206905|4.0|For the casual comics fan (of which I am one) this is a great introduction to Batman. Miller's re-telling creates solid characters out of Bruce Wayne and Gordon and introduces us to the dark world of crime that Batman is out to combat on a nightly basis.<br /><br />I wasn't terribly fond of the introduction of Catwoman - I much prefer the introduction of super-criminals that the movie \\"Batman Begins\\" presented, but that is neither her nor there.<br /><br />Bottomline - this is solid escapist entertainment. Well-drawn and well-presented.  I give this one a grade of B+.
6305546789|5.0|I like a good horror film, and this is among the best. I just watched it again for the umpteenth time this Halloween (yesterday) and found it to be just as enjoyable this time around. The energy that went into this project is evident, its sincerity genuine. What makes this movie so good is a great combination of many factors: the music is compelling and unforgettable; the cinematography is quite good while remaining unobtrusive, and the suspense is sustained from the opening frames to the closing. Although filmed in California, the film perfectly captures the flavor of Halloween and fall in the Midwest: leaves, having fallen from the trees, blowing around in the wind; cicadas and crickets singing, providing a nightly chorus, and the traditions of Halloween, including the ubiquitous pumpkins, popcorn and horror movie marathons. Haddonfield is every town in the Midwest and its residents quite typical. The feel of this setting makes the film seem familiar and plausible. Apparently quite comfortable in the realms of both teenagers and adults, John Carpenter melds the two worlds seamlessly. Too many horror films, or films of any other genre, for that matter, cannot seem to get this correct. The adults are typically treated like the enemy or too dense to catch on. Teens are normally reduced to caricatures, all hormones and no sense. The treatment of the \\"good guys\\" isn't the only aspect of this movie that distinguishes it from the rest of the lot, however. Michael Myers is a legend in the town and his story is well known among the locals. For him to come home does not seem possible because that would mean breaking down the wall that separates reality from myth. Yet, he is a real person (or character, that is), not an imaginary Boogie Man. After Michael kills one of his victims, he stands with head cocked, staring at him. The camera holds this for a few seconds, allowing us to contemplate just what is going through his mind. Prior to this point, we have only heard Dr. Loomis' resolute claims that Michael is somehow subhuman. Now we witness his confusion and bewilderment, much as a dog cocks its head and stares at a small animal it has just killed. Does he not realize the nature of what he has done or the finality as the result of his actions? Is he wondering who this person is? Is he wondering why the man has stopped moving? In this moment, we are voyeurs, catching a glimpse of Michael Myers alone, not stalking, terrorizing or killing. We don't have a victim's reaction to inveigle us, only a maniac's attempt to comprehend the world around him. Perhaps it sounds as though I am making too much of this movie. To someone who yearns for a well-made horror film he can appreciate, a film like \\"Halloween\\" matters substantially.is' resolute claims that Michael is somehow subhuman.

0375507256|5.0|One of the most amazing novels I have ever read. It's an unbelievably complex, beautiful creation, and its virtuosity is always at the service of its series of stories that are moving and humane. I'd say this is a must-read for anyone serious about fiction.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|I've always felt that Def Leppard peaked with their 1983 album Pyromania and that Hysteria, while a remarkably solid album, saw a tiny bit of a slide start to happen in the playing/songwriting department that would bottom out quickly by 1992's horrible Adrenalize.<br /><br />When Hysteria originally came out in 1987, Def Leppard lost a lot of their older fans at the time who decried the band abandoning their metallic roots from the Pyromania days in favor of a more contemporary pop/rock sheen that they went in on Hysteria. I was initially disappointed with the album when it came out. But over the years, I have grown to like it. While I don't think it represents the band at the pinnacle of their songwriting/playing levels like on Pyromania, on its own, it is a really good selection of songs with only a few being filler-ish.<br /><br />The actual album was composed of 12 tracks and at the time turned a lot of heads since it clocked in at 63 minutes. Vinyl was still pretty much the standard at this point (along with cassettes) so it was kind of unheard of to see someone cram so much music onto a record without sacrificing any sound quality.  Record still usually only clocked out at 40 minutes max.<br /><br />This album also spawned 7 singles in the U.S.  with 6 of those going top 20 (Animal, Pour Some Sugar on Me, Love Bits, Hysteria, Armageddon It, Rocket) and the 7th lead off single Women only breaking the top 80.  It ended up selling 10 million copies just in the U.S. alone.  This topped the 6 million that they sold with their prior album Pyromania. Hysteria will always stand as their commercial, if not critical, peak.<br /><br />The tracks that haven't quite worked for me over the years are Love Bites, Don't Shoot Shotgun and Excitable.  Pour Some Sugar on Me isn't that strong of a track in my opinion as well. They're not actually bad songs, they just don't seem to really go anywhere or do anything that jumps out at the listener in comparison to the rest of the tracks. The standout track for me actually is Rocket which in its original album form clocks in at 6 1/2 minutes and has a really cool extended jungle groove/drum break down in the middle in which the band has some fun with a style that was new to them at the time.<br /><br />So as a whole, I still give the album 4 stars as it does feature mostly extremely strong material.<br /><br />As for this 2 disc deluxe edition, I give this a resounding 5 stars.<br /><br />On disc 1 you get the original 12 album tracks in crystal clear remastered sound.  They also tacked onto disc 1 the 4 studio B-sides that were recorded/released at that point.<br /><br />Disc 2 sees the band putting 5 live B-sides at the start followed up by 5 remixes of some tracks finishing up with a joke cover B-side that truly has to be heard to believe.<br /><br />It comes with a deluxe booklet with tons of great vintage photos and a long and very insightful essay about the making of the album.<br /><br />I really wish that they end up doing the same treatment with their 1983 album Pyromania and their 1981 breakthrough album High 'n' Dry at some point.<br /><br />A must have for all Def Leppard fans.ctually is Rocket which in its original album form clocks in at 6 1/2 minutes and has a really cool extended jungle groove/drum break down in the middle in which the band has some fun with a style that was new to them at the time.

I really wish that they end up doing the same treatment with their 1983 album Pyromania and their 1981 breakthrough album High 'n' Dry at some point.    A must have for all Def Leppard fans.
B0007OCG56|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie, a rare winner in a field of sophmoric retreads.  Yes, the overall story  line is a well-worn theme, and I wasn't a fan of the lead (Sandler) or the 2-dimensional wife character.  Fortunately, they merely serve as backdrop for the story on another level that makes it worth watching - the growth and transformation of an immigrant maid and her daughter in a classic American tale that also explores values and character with poignancy and wit.  You care about these people.  It's worth watching alone for the brilliant timing and humor of the \\"translation scene\\" as daughter translates mother and employer's argument in Spanish and English.   Fresh, funny and satisfying.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Possibly better even than 69 Love Songs and f#a#~. The songs make you want to weep they are so beautiful. I love it; so does the wife (she rarely agrees); so do my friend's kids. I bought this purely on the strength of reviews on these pages and have since bought multiple copies for other people. Check out the label: asthmatic kitty.
B0002EXH54|5.0|This is definetely one of the best metal albums of all time and should be on anyone's top ten list of all time. Megadeth has not produced a CD of this greatness before or since. Don't interpret this as not liking their other stuff. But this is the first one I pull out to listen to in its entirety. The guitar playing and Dave Mustaine's growling voice just don't get any better. My ultimate favorite songs are \\"The Conjuring\\" and \\"Bad Omen\\". <br /> <br />Even the cover art is awesome and puts forward the premise of \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying\\". This one along with Metallica's \\"And justice for All\\" sums up the state of today's world.  <br /> <br />If you're a metal head, this CD is a must buy!!!
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Meat is taking some chances with this one.  He ranges from very hard rocking songs (as admitted by John5 of Maryln Manson) to much more lyrical tuness.  Steinman's enfluence is obvious in some songs and the established artists he brings in with him add a new dimension to Meat's characters.  This songs are not so much the result of character studies, but instead has been internalized more than he has in the past.  Marion Raven, his newest addition is fantastic - Pattie and CC bettwe look out for this newcomer.  This album is all Bat.  But like a monster that has been locked up for a decade, it has morphed into something different than when it went in.  And the change is fantastic.  Another incredible production
B000FTWB7G|5.0|In the case of this CD, it should be. Amy Lee and crew have cranked up their artistry a notch with this release. Their melodies are simple but the way they intertwine the piano, guitar, and Amy Lee's magnificent vocals is nothing short of pure art.  <br /> <br />Not since Ann Wilson of Heart or Pat Benatar has a female vocalist impressed me with the strength and beauty of her voice fronting a rock band. (She could sing opera, if so inclined) Her voice soars with an incredible range from lilting high notes (you try to sing that high!) to a gritty rock texture that has all the punch without losing the beauty of it. <br /> <br />\\"Lacrymosa\\" (which refers to a part of a Requiem Mass) is my favorite song on a CD that, again, has no bad songs. The haunting choral arrangement (done by Ms Lee) and the wonderfully crafted guitar solo (no need for speed - just feeling) has such an ethreal feel like it taking your soul on a flight to another world. \\"Lose Control\\" with its bending guitar chords is my second favorite with \\"Your Star\\" that builds from its beginning to it's awesome finish. <br /> <br />As \\"The Beatles\\" were to the sixties, \\"Led Zeppelin\\" to the seventies, U2 to the 80's and \\"Nirvana\\" were to the 90's, \\"Evanescence\\" will be to the first decade of the 21st century.
0743289412|5.0|Literally could not put this one down, really alot of emotion here, and almost like a search, a desparate search for something out of reach.  This man cannot write fast enough, for as much as I enjoy the reading of the tales.  I always keep my eyes open for the next tale of what this gifted writer will bring.
055358202X|5.0|I was hooked on this series after book 1 and was somewhat discouraged when some of the reviews for this one came out on the negative side. After reading it for myself however, I am not in any way dissapointed in this book, and will be eagerly awaiting the next.<br /><br />Alot of new characters are introduced, and some of the characters from previous books have there point of view revealed. Alot of people complained about a lack of main charaters, such as Jon, Tyrion and Dany, but one of the best things about this world that Martin has created is its vastness and seemingly endless supply of personalities to explore. This book to me just added more depth and dimension to an already riviting story, and the lack of characters from previous books didnt take away from it at all.<br /><br />This book explores the veiws of a number of Greyjoys, including Asha, Aeron and Euron. The Martell family in Dorne, and plenty of Breinne of Tarth. There is also plenty of regulars like Sansa, Arya and Samwell Tarly, along with Cersei, and Jaime Lannister. So for all the complaints about who appears in AFFC, any one who has read the previous books will recognize all these names and realize that it isnt so much a ton of new characters so much as it is exploring some previously ignored ones.<br /><br />If you've read the previous 3 books dont bother reading any more reviews about this one, it will not dissapoint.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Normally I don't give two craps about David Caruso, but in this movie he works very well. The whole thing, cast and location and story, is marvelous. It's a deliciously unsettling film. It's excellent.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I think this is a great season! but, then again I love every Season of Charmed! I think this season is very much worth buying! and hey have you guys noticed that we got the pretty cover this time! I saw a different copy somewhere else I think it was ebay it was a ugly yellow! the cover we have is much prettier! well guys we only have one more season to get and our collection will be complete!
B0007XT87G|5.0|I haven't heard an album this good from front to back in a long, long time.  Usually there is a low point or a song that just kills the mood along the way but not so on this cd.  If you are a fan of good rock music delivered in true high fidelity with intelligence and craftsmanship, this is an essential addition to your music collection.  One of the best albums I've ever heard.
B000062XM7|5.0|I enjoy good cinema - regardless of whether it stands fast to the book the script was derived from. This adaptation was indeed captivating. I added it to my collection. It is worthy of a look see.
B000GYI32M|2.0|Even though the show is on a downfall, hoping to end soon, the cover looks vaguelly familiar. Oh, yes. It looks like Friends. Not only is one of the worst shows trying to look like one of the best shows, it doesn't help to copy artwork from the cover of a friends season DVD set!
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Hey Barack, I liked your \\"C'mon Quad Cities\\" reference.  Anyway, my fave show here was the Tokyo show.  Great sound quality and it just seems they were trying to perform the tunes better than usual.  I think this is the show that aired on HBO in like '79.  Performance of \\"She\\" on the Midnite Special is really cool.  Yep all the Cadillac footage was great.  Oh the C'mon and Love Me promo was awesome, and I also liked the British interviewer little documentary thing.  Seeing KISS in their prime is a special thing - they're young and ferocious.  Ace's guitar work on the Houston show is outta this world (well, for him) - really it's good.  Rock on My Heroes!!

If not for the amazing, sensational and hilarious Christopher Walken, this would have been a total bomb. The jokes he makes at Sandler's expense are right-on and it's a shame he wasn't in the movie ALOT more. Sandler over-acts big time, and when he tries to get you to cry for him, well, I'd just about had enough by then. Granted, you will laugh a few times, this is Adam Sandler, and for the most part, the man is a comic genius, I'd just wish he would have made either a comedy or a drama, not both.<br /><br />But what really, and I mean REALLY dragged this movie down was the complete and total waste of one Kate Beckinsale. This is one of the hottest, sexiest, fiery women in film today, and she looked absolutely lost in this. If Selene see's this, she is gonna kick Kate square in the booty for wasting her time with this. Drew Berrymore would have been perfect for the role, and who knows, might have improved it even................a little
B000BC8TBE|5.0|This is one of the best christmas albums ever released. Mariah's voice is flawless, and the songs really make you think of christmas and will totally put you in the mood to go shopping, decorate your tree, or have some egg nog.  Get this cd and have a merry christmas! <br /> <br />P.S. If you like this one, get RuPaul's HO HO HO, it's a hoot and also has some awesome christmas songs!
B000HCO840|3.0|I thought this package was going to have some extra features on the DVD or a second disc like the \\"Batman Begins\\" special edition did, but instead I got the regular edition DVD and paid ten extra dollars for a stupid comic book. Shouldn't a collector's edition have more than a comic book? Especially with the ten dollar difference in price.  <br />If you want X-3, skip this version. If you want X-3 and a comic book, skip this version, buy the regular version and buy your comics at a comic book store, where the comics are better than the one you get with this package.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|WHo would have thought that Warner Bros would ever let the Richard Donner version of Superman 11 see the light of day after he was fired following completion of 70% of the film?  That's what I love about the DVD age we live in, we are seeing more options for movie lovers.  And because of amazing tecnhology these days, they will splice his version with some of Richard Lester's pathetic version to give a brand new experience.     AS many of us are aware, Lester changed the feel of Superman movies so that they were comical and stupid.  Donner's original vision will remove that and this will be a DVD which will be worth owning.     Have a read of this description:    Superman 11 fans will be thrilled after years of imploring Warner Home Video via voluminous numbers of petitions, letters, phone calls and e-mails to release the Donner cut. In fact, Donner had already shot most of the Superman II footage during Superman: The Movie. But as production on the sequel continued, creative differences between the director and the film's producers became irreconcilable and Donner left the project. Although Richard Lester was hired to finish production, he chose to make major changes to the film, leaving only vestiges of Donner's original vision and concepts in the version of Superman II that was ultimately released to theaters. Now, nearly thirty years later, Warner Home Video is honored to grant the wishes of countless Superman fans. With this DVD release, Richard Donner has become the first director in history to be able to complete a film he left during production with nearly all his footage \\"in the can.\\" Adding back a substantial amount of that unused footage, the director has seen his original vision restored and brought to fruition. Most notably, the \\"Donner cut\\" restores the Marlon Brando role, filmed for, but not included in the final theatrical release version of Superman II. The legendary Brando's performance as Jor-El has finally been restored in key scenes that amplifySuperman lore and deepen the profound relationship between father and son.With so many other changes, large and small, including a variety of Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) schemes to unmask Clark Kent as Superman, this Superman II will prove to be an eye-opening experience and an important addition to film history.

B0001GMIOE|3.0|I have this battery in my digital Rebel and I do take many photos with it. I have had it for 18 months and it is now showing signs of dying. I will buy a new canon battery but it does seem that the original should have lasted longer.

B000078DOH|3.0|. . . but far from the funkiest thing I've ever heard (see James Brown's live LOVE POWER PEACE for that), sometimes heavy, a pretty fun listen . . . but frankly kinda limp compared to latter-day RHCPs (starting when guitarist John Frusciante entered the band, but especially on BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIC), in my view at least. Anthony Kiedis and Flea have vastly improved as musicians since FREAKY STYLEY came out. Their recent STADIUM ARCADIUM just might be the greatest thing they've ever done.<br /><br />Guitarist Hillel Slovak was without a doubt something special and probably would've gone on to much greater heights with the band had he not ODed. Also without-a-doubt, there's some good stuff on here and I especially like the bonus extended version of \\"Freaky Styley.\\" And their version of \\"If You Want Me To Stay\\" is pretty good, but why bother with it when the original is so much groovier and soulful? This music is pioneering, trend-setting stuff to be sure, but the band has gone on to make music so much better that this album mostly retains an appeal for fans who were there when it came out, or maybe for those who just want to funk and don't mind the lack of superior songwriting that the band would go on to produce.
0140131558|5.0|\\"The New York Trilogy\\", a volume containing three separate novellas: \\"The City of Glass\\", \\"Ghosts\\" and \\" The Locked Room\\", is an intriguing example of the author's game with the readers and, perhaps, with himself. The motif common for all three stories in the mystery, the solution of which is pursued by the main character, and the place of action, New York City (I do not agree with one of the reviewers who said New York could be here any other urban environment as well; certainly it could not be any European city, NYC gives these stories the distinct character and for anyone who has walked the streets through which the characters wander, it is a setting unmistakable for any other; The City's atmosphere hangs over the characters like a cloud).<br /><br />\\"The City of Glass\\" features Quinn, a solitary man, living quietly after the death of his wife and son, and writing detective stories under a pseudonym. One night, Quinn receives a mysterious phone call from a man demanding the services of a private detective, Paul Auster... Although it is clearly a wrong number, Quinn decides to pretend to be Auster and take the challenge, changing his life forever.<br /><br />A complete change of life circumstances is also a fate of the protagonist of a second (and the shortest) novella \\"Ghosts\\". Blue, who is a professional private detective, receives a task from the disguised client, White, to watch Black. The trouble is, Black never does anything interesting except reading or writing, and bored Blue tries to find out, where the real secret of this investigation lies.<br /><br />In the last novella \\"The Locked Room\\", the main character is involved in the publication of the works of his missing childhood friend, Fanshawe. The books are a great success, he marries Fanshawe's wife and he assumes Fanshawe's identity, happily at the beginning...<br /><br />These novellas are not, as has been pointed out by many reviewers before me, typical mysteries, where clues lead to conclusions and the reader may amuse himself with finding a correct answer. They are, on one hand, explorations of the soul, of the unknown in us, and, on the other hand, and taken together, a postmodern riddle, with literary jokes, cultural clues. They can be read on various levels, which is what really makes them interesting. For somebody, who expects a mystery story from the beginning to the end this book would be a disappointment, However, it is rewarding for the reader interested in reading itself (sounds absurd, I know, but this may be the truth - books play an enormous role in all the novellas). The introduction of Auster, as a detective, but really a writer in the first story, as opposed to Quinn, the writer, who has to become the detective, is only one of the twists here. The exercise with giving the characters the name of the colors (after all, what, if not \\"real\\" names make the reader think of the book characters as real? And are the color names unreal? Such names are common enough...) - is another.<br /><br />By the way, has anyone been lured into drawing Quinn's walk on the street grid of Manhattan?lusions and the reader may amuse himself with finding a correct answer.

B000003TAL|2.0|. . . that is, if you're tone deaf. SY fans will immediately poo-poo my review for that statement, but let it be a warning to new-bes thinking about purchasing this album because of all the high praise it gets.<br /><br />I actually like a lot of radical, tripped-out and avant-garde music, such as Faust, Mr. Bungle and Death, for example. And while I'm not exactly a fan, I really do like a fair amount of Sonic Youth, such as the eerie, trippy \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\" from EVOL and the epic, extended zone-fest \\"The Diamond Sea\\" from WASHING MACHINE along with quite a few of the tracks from their experimental SYR series of EPs.<br /><br />While I'm well aware that my opinion is way outside the conventional views of Sonic Youth, I still strongly believe that DAYDREAM NATION gets a lot more credit than it deserves, I suspect in part because some people jump on the critical bandwagon in a vain attempt to look cool. I actually think their previous album SISTER is stronger and more paletable. Their major-label debut, GOO, does absolutely nothing for me but I do think there's some cool stuff on their next record, DIRTY, especially \\"100%\\" and \\"Drunken Butterfly.\\"<br /><br />One could say DAYDREAM NATION \\"rocks,\\" but it's just so gratingly atonal and annoying, especially when Kim Gordon opens her mouth. To be perfectly honest, most of their music could be described that way. I think their later albums are typically more artistic, more listenable and generally better, but no doubt many fans prefer the alien F-U radicalism of their earliest material.<br /><br />SY deserves props for their fearless experimentalism and severely art-damaged, strangely tuned, feedback-drenched guitars. But this band has an extremely limited appeal for good reason. Approach with caution.<br /><br />I'm sure my review of DAYDREAM NATION does not conform to the vast majority of opinions by Sonic Youth fans, but I bet plenty of non-fans would agree with it. Whatever the case, it's my honest opinion.
0380778556|4.0|\\"Rebecca\\", the book that gave Daphne du Maurier immortality, has all the features of the novel of its time. Balancing on the thin, invisible line between plain romance and deep psychological analysis, it is engrossing, for me to the point of sacrificing sleep.<br /><br />The plot itself is constructed quite simply and classically, starting with the young girl - companion to the wealthy lady, falling in love and marrying the rich widower, Maxim de Winter. The young bride is the narrator of the novel and she finds itself initially incapable of understanding her husband's past (especially as she gets no direct answers) and of bearing the burden of living in Manderley, the mansion haunted by the powerful presence of his first wife, Rebecca.<br /><br />In fact, the naivety and childishness of the narrator sometimes irritated me massively, she was extremely self-conscious and eager to please, so much that she could not see the obvious...Very good character, I bet this was the author's plan. But finally she undergoes the complete transformation, albeit in very dramatic circumstances, discovers the truth (a horrible secret... more than one in fact) and can be happy with her husband (this is not a spoiler, as the novel starts at this pint and is written in retrospective). Ultimately, this is a story of lack of communication which is the basis for misunderstanding, suspicions, false loyalty and the whole spectrum of emotions with which this novel if bursting.<br /><br />\\"Rebecca\\" is a great classic, full of suspence, with great characters (Miss Danvers!). It is definitely worth reading even as the only book by du Maurier, to get acquainted with her style, and it is a very good novel for a long, winter evening, virtually moving the reader to the British countryside at the beginning of the twentieth century. Although the novel certainly aged, it did so gracefully, retaining all its charm.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I don't like Harry Potter - movies, books, lunchpails... you name it. I mean, I'm a guy. I like beer, sports, action movies with sex, violence and car chases... So, well, er... it's kinda difficult admitting I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have awarded it 4 stars! But it deserves it.  <br /> <br />I only agreed to watch it because my partner wanted to. Despite her age, she loves the books, so the movies were a must-see. The books are way too childish for me. As were the first movies. But with this one, the franchise seems to have come of age. It's much darker, the atmosphere, the themes, the plot. The actors are more accomplished - I no longer yearn to slap that Hermione, as I did in her earlier incarnations, but can now watch her in relative comfort. The whole movie seems so much grander in scale.  <br /> <br />So for any 'real men' out there who don't want to suffer the stigma of watching Harry Potter, I say, swallow your pride, sit down, shut up, and prepare to be as surprised as I was. This really is a good flick. So much so, I'm almost, that's 'almost', looking forward to the next installment.  <br /> <br />Give it a go, it might just surprise you! <br /> <br />

0060977493|5.0|I had been looking forward to reading \\"The God of Small Things\\" and was definitely not disappointed.  Ms. Roy, in my opinion, is an accomplished writer and conveys a vast amount of data, using very few words.  I got such a feel for the characters and locations in the book, such a true sense of it all - the sights, the smells, and the impressions these made on the characters.  If you are looking for a \\"happy endings\\" book, this may not be the book for you.  However, if you're after insight, imagination and a lyrical writing style that delivers harsh reality in kid gloves, then this is it.  Arundhati Roy is definitely on my list of authors to actively seek out.
0618680004|3.0|If you want to read a great book by Dr. Dawkins, read The Ancestor's Tale.  In that, he's brilliant.  In this book, he's merely fun.     Let me start by stating that I think the argument, \\"science or religion,\\" is pointless.  I'm not convinced that an argument from a rationalist fundamentalist is any more worthy of our attention than an argument from a religious fundamentalist.  Prof. Dawkins knows this.  By the way, I feel free to put words in his mouth, since he feels free to tell me what Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould would contribute to this discussion if either were alive.       I could as easily and just as pointlessly (but admittedly neither as entertainingly or as articulately) argue that Dr. Dawkins' well-intentioned and clearly \\"sacred\\" science has given us the atomic bomb, global warming, weapons of mass destruction, lobotomies, and thalidomide (among countless other horrors that only the application of scientific progress could have made possible), and that, clearly, we should put a stop to it.  The misapplication of science is surely as much of a nightmare as the misapplication of religion.  It also seems to me to be just as prevalent.  Would it be appropriate for me to argue that science should be outlawed?  Could I get the audience I'm after to pay attention?  And don't argue, as Prof. Dawkins would, that science exists and that God does not.  Even if God does not exist, religion certainly does.     Much of this very entertaining polemic is specious at best.  Dawkins claims that ten percent of the American population are atheists, and that, therefore, ten percent of the Congress and Senate must be atheists (he claims they refuse to admit it for reasons of political exigency).  By this reasoning, we could say fifty percent of the American population are female; therefore, fifty percent of the Congress and Senate must be female but refuse to admit it.  Shocking!  Why do almost all of them masquerade as old white men?       Just get over it.  Any attempt to make a serious argument of this issue, despite Dr. Dawkins ridicule of what Stephen Jay Gould called NOMA (non-overlapping magisteria), is doomed to failure.  There isn't, and probably never will be, any plausible argument for a \\"meeting of the minds\\" on the subjects of science and religion.  You have to take this book for what it is, a fun read that gives Dr. Dawkins a chance to vent.  This book was like having an articulate, entertaining, and extremely well-educated dinner guest who drinks to excess and tells you, in a deafeningly loud voice, how he \\"really feels.\\"  Despite the futile logic (both formal and informal), this book isn't going to change anyone's mind any more than my imagined screed against science could or should.  I found myself ruefully laughing at both sides from cover to cover.     Incidentally, Dr. Dawkins is not above playing fast-and-loose with facts.  He incorrectly repeats a statistic most people seem to take as a given - that Christianity is not the largest religious denomination.  Although I'm not trying to make any kind of point other than to set the record straight, Christianity - whatever that may be -- claims the most adherents by a considerable number.  This isn't an issue in which the majority rules - at least it shouldn't be.  [...]  However, since China is officially atheist, perhaps an effort to include this group in the demographic would make one side or the other happier.       Regardless of whatever facts you muster, you won't bring either side closer to being what both sides of the issue claim to be -- right.  It's no surprise that this book, while undoubtedly entertaining, is not the definitive word on the subject.  There isn't one.  Please forgive the singularly inappropriate metaphor, but Prof. Dawkins is preaching to the choir.
B00005JOQS|5.0|There are some inconsistencies with the first 4 movies and with Superman Returns. In the 4th movie, Superman's earthling mom was already dead, however in Superman Returns his mom was still alive. Some say that Superman Returns is a sequel after 1 and 2, however that's not entirely right either, because after the 4th movie \\"Quest for Peace\\" Lois Lane did not have her child. <br /> <br />It's best to assume then, that Superman Returns uses the elements of all these movies and then goes in a separate way. <br /> <br />Still this doesn't make the movie any less appealing. The movie was much darker than most Superman movies that have been made, with a much meaner, darker look to Lex Luther. With Lex Luther's ingenious qualities, I would love to see what a final showdown between Lex and Superman would be like.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|I've always been a Warren Beatty fan. I think his earlier movies were always innovative and refreshing. (Bonnie and Clyde, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Shampoo and Heaven Can Wait). So it was with great anticipation I went to see Reds in early 1982. I thought it was thought provoking, and a history lover's dream. In high school we had to take Americanism vs. Communism (this was during the Kennedy Years 1960-63). However, I have yet to find anyone down here who would share my enthusiasm without being labeled a \\"communist sympathizer\\". At the time, I worked for a large metro newspaper and on Monday morning I came in raving about the movie, and you should have seen the look on the \\"suits\\". One of them frankly told me, \\"I'm not interested in communist movies.\\" Well, that was almost 25 years ago. Now I run my own business and I'm still not a communist sympathizer but do enjoy a masterful job of moviemaking. Beatty really did an outstanding job as director as well as Dianne Keaton, Nicholson, Stapleton and others. It is sweeping, grandiose and sad. But back in 1981, when the movie was released you still had a lot of right-winged sentiments and a lot of old timers left over from the McCarthy 50's that saw this movie as communist propoganda. You can look at it anyway you want. I choose to look at it as a fairly accurate historical depiction of the years 1912-17 and the Russian Revolution and all the idealistic Americans involved in New York, and all the heartbreak too. Guess what! Now that I run my own business, I don't have to meet with the suits around the water cooler on Monday morning. Actually, I think we've regressed as a country in accepting different intellectual views. Be careful, If you buy this movie, big brother may write your name down on a list. Seriously, It's just good entertainment, don't take it as a political agenda and you'll be O.K.

B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is surreal.  It's tragicomic, and to me, it brought an unconscious weirdness to my reality.  I watched the movie at 3 AM and at times, the movie urged me to kill myself, to explode, to pressure and bang against everything around me and my confines (my dorm room).  Unlike other semi-realistic pictures, American Beauty only hinted at this \\"stuffiness\\" of life.  And that's what makes it so frustrating--yet so beautiful and aesthetic, as Rick would say. <br />Precise acting, intriguing screenplay.
B00005JPB4|5.0|The story of the photograph of six soldiers raising the flag at Iwo Jima in 1945 is brought to the screen with the signatures of its producer, Steven Spielberg and Director, Clint Eastwood.  Based on the book by the son of one of the original flag raisers, the film not only depicts the full epic of war, but it also delves deeply into the bond drive that followed the publication of the photo, and the ambiguities as to which soldiers, exactly, were in the photograph.<br /><br />The film is scrupulous in trying to tell the truth.  We meet the soldiers and get to know their horrific experience of the war.  And then we get to know the individuals who wound up in the public relations campaign across America.  And, briefly, we meet one of the men as an old man with flashbacks about it all.<br /><br />Iwo Jima was one of the last strongholds of the Japanese.  In preparation of the invasion, the Americans bombed it for weeks until all vegetation was gone and the entire island was a scorched landscape with 20,000 Japanese troops dug in and willing to fight to the death. These battle scenes are shot in desaturated  shades of gray with occasional flashes of orange-yellow flames.  It's very effective, and very frightening, especially since by now we have become acquainted with some of the soldiers.  There's Doc, a medic, played by Ryan Phillipe.  There's Rene, played by Jessie Bradford.  And there's Ira Hayes, a Pima American Indian, played by Adam Beach.  We see fear, we see courage, and we see perseverance.<br /><br />But the battle scenes are only part of the film as later, these three soldiers are wined and dined and trotted across America like pet monkeys.  Rene was offered business deals which he believed were really true.  Doc found himself in the position of lying to mothers about which soldiers were actually in the photograph.  And Ira became a raging alcoholic.<br /><br />The story is complex and doesn't pull punches.  And even though I knew how it would all turn out, the acting and directing were so good that I was engaged throughout even though I didn't actually shed any tears.  But that was not what this film was about.  It was about setting the record straight on an historical event and the photo snapped by an Associated Press photographer that wasn't exactly a spontaneous act.  It's all very fascinating.<br /><br />This is a fine film.  There's a lesson to learn.  And an historical record to set straight.  See it.d all turn out, the acting and directing were so good that I was engaged throughout even though I didn't actually shed any tears.  But that was not what this film was about.

0679720200|5.0|This book changed my life. Period. Camus, best known for his advocacy of existentialism and absurdism and his collection of essays, writes a novel that seeps into one's subconscious and begins to have the reader identify with the character, care about the character, and wonder about the absurdity of the trials and ridiculous nature of humans. <br /> <br />Intriguing, engaging, page-turning and (sadly) short, this book is a great weekend read. This translation in particular makes the story accessible and easy to comprehend-- a major plus.
B00005JPAD|1.0|I went to the theater preparing to love this film.  It seemed to have all the elements I like... mob....corruption....violence...famous director (Scorcese).... Movie stars (Jack Nickolson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio ...  big budget.  The critics all praise it and it's a box office hit.<br /><br />But, frankly, I found it confusing, pretentious and lacking characters that I could care about.<br /><br />It's set in modern Boston where the Irish Mafia rules.  Jack Nicholson has seduced a kid into a life of crime and we know he is grooming him to be his connection in the police department.  There's another young cop being groomed by the police department to infiltrate Jack Nicholson's organization.  So here we see the two young men at cross purposes.  I know this might sound silly, but it took me a while to figure all of this out.  Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio look alike to me.  Also, both are really bad actors.  It's hard to see emotion on their faces.  And neither seems authentic.  Lionardo DiCaprio is just Hollywood and plays the role so over-the-top  macho that he seems like a stereotype rather than a person.  Naturally, a young naïve police psychologist falls for him.  This romance is all about wisecracks by DiCaprio.  There just doesn't seem to be any romantic chemistry.  The best acting, of course, is by Jack Nicholson.  He seems to shine in everything he does.  But I didn't get the feeling of him being a mobster.  Yes, there was one scene where he talked rough and cheated some Asian dope dealers.  But he didn't seem like a bad guy.<br /><br />I found the plot hard to follow.  I also just didn't care and spent too much time looking at my watch and waiting for it to end.  The last ten minutes have a lot of bloodshed.  That's the way they concluded all the loose ends of the plot.  I also could never figure out where the title \\"The Departed\\" came from.<br /><br />I can't recommend this film. This certainly is no \\"Casino\\" or \\"Goodfellas\\".  And It just doesn't hold a candle to the The Sopranos or Brotherhood on TV.t just doesn't hold a candle to the The Sopranos or Brotherhood on TV.
B0006GAI82|3.0|+++++<br /><br />\\"I want to play a game.  'Simon Says.'  Simon is going to tell Lieutenant McClane what to do and Lieutenant McClane is going to do it.  Noncompliance will result in a penalty.\\"  (The penalty is a bomb detonated in a public place in New York city.)<br /><br />The above, said by \\"terrorist\\" Simon (Jeremy Irons), is what most of this movie is about.  New York city cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) has to go from one end of the city to the other as he struggles to keep up with Simon's deadly game.  As the game proceeds, McClane picks up an unwilling civilian partner named Zeus (Sam L. Jackson) with a chip on his shoulder.<br /><br />Why is Simon doing this?  It turns out that he is the brother of Hans Gruber, the head \\"terrorist\\" who was killed by McClane in the first \\"Die Hard\\" movie (1988).  Simon is doing this to get vengeance on McClane (or so it seems).<br /><br />Those who like lots of explosions, car chases, gunfire, blood, and other special effects should enjoy this movie.<br /><br />However, those who want more in what they view may be disappointed.  Even though there is humor in spots, the first half of the movie has McClane with Zeus just doing want Simon says to do and the second half is McClane chasing Simon.  That's it!!  What makes this second sequel slightly more interesting that the first one (entitled \\"Die Hard 2: Die Harder\\" 1990) is the inclusion of Jackson as Zeus and the antics that occur between McClane and Zeus.  Irons also turns in a fine performance as the villain Simon (though not anywhere near as interesting as the villain Hans Gruber in the original Die Hard movie).<br /><br />Willis again turns in a fine performance.  Unfortunately, they have him now separated from his wife.  His wife under the threat of being killed was a key element of the Die Hard movies.  With this essential element removed, this movie, as a result, just turns into your standard cop chasing a bad guy movie.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2005) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are a few extras of which I found the alternate ending the most interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, those who like action and special effects will probably enjoy this movie.  Others, however, will probably be disappointed!!!<br /><br />*** 1/2<br /><br />(1995;  2 hr, 10 min;  wide screen;  26 scenes;  rated `R')<br /><br />+++++ased in 2005) is perfect in picture and sound quality.

B000001FLI|5.0|This is a guitar lovers' and blues lovers' dream...blazing hot, scorching guitar played with drama and emotion. The tone cries, screams, and elates you.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Dreams\\" \\"John Blues\\" and \\"Petes Blue\\" are killer blues songs. The muscular bends and abrasive single-pickup telecaster tone will rock your skull out.<br /><br />The highlight of the album is \\"The Messiah will come again\\". It starts out as a somber, spiritual song and then, out of nowhere, a lightning fast guitar run transforms the song into a show case of fast playing and acrobatic bends.<br /><br />Roy Buchanan is an unheralded guitar god and this album is terrific.

B000J10ERO|5.0|\\"Spoilers ahead, Beware\\"  The movie is set after the events of donner's Superman II. Superman left the planet Earth for five years hoping to find another kryptonian like him. This movie point out another take on what it is like to be Superman and in this film, to be Superman is to be lonely.  Lois Lane moved on and have a son and she wrote an article about why the world doesn't need Superman.   Meanwhile, Lex Luthor gets out of prison and finds the way to obtain one of the cristals in order to learn about Superman and take advantage of the Krypotonian technology to hurt him and make a whole new continent.  It is true that the movie isn't loaded of action scenes, The plane sequence being the best imo, but it is still a really enjoyable ride.   Brandon Routh is Great as superman. The kid works aswell. Unlike any other superheroe movies involving kids with powers, which most are just plain annoying, this one is quite the opposite. Lois lane does a fine job aswell, but a more mature actress would have being better. Kevin's as Lex Luthor is very good aswell. I enjoyed this Lex better than Gene's one.  One of my favorite parts nearly the End when Superman is hurt and falls from the sky,...Everyone tries to save him, His mother, Martha Kent, willing to see his son but afraid she might reveal his identity, Superman is Alone no matter what, which leads to understand a little why he needs to watch over lois (which was critized as stalking) but I don't see it that way. But when he learned the truth about his son growing on earth while he was looking for someone like him around the universe, his own blood was right here, for all these years.    I think it is a Great Return, Brian Singer took some risk, mainly with the kid but it worked. Definetly a must own in your DVD collection mainly if you are a fan of the man of steel.   Now that The sequel is confirmed, let's all hope Singer will bring a great villain and more action. The kid should remain very secondary in my opinion.  I'm only disapointing thing is the quality of the transfer of the Movie on DVD. Grainy in some points, If only it could have being an EpIII or Lord of rings quality , it would have enchanced the experience. The Sound is Great, Mainly in the airPlane sequence. The Extra are great too, from finding The man of steal, the design of the costume,...
B000021Y77|4.0|I liked it. It was real fast paced, the actress was sexy and interesting to look at, the camera angles were cool, the director employed just a hint of animation, the production was artsy yet gutsy, there were cool plot twists and manipulations and the story was good. Most of all, with all of this innovative filmmaking, the ending was satisfying.<br /><br />I give this a big thumbs up!
B00000I8UK|5.0|It could certainly be argued that multi-reedsman Eric Dolphy had finer moments as a player than OUT TO LUNCH, his last studio date as a leader and the only one he recorded for Blue Note Records. But as the only entirely self-composed Dolphy session and one of the most famed avant-garde jazz recordings ever, this set has little if any competition as the most comprehensive expression of a tragically short-lived artist's very personal vision.      Dolphy had barely four months to live when he recorded OUT TO LUNCH in February of 1964 with trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, bassist Richard Davis and drummer Tony Williams - indeed, he would not live to see the album's release. By this late date the Maestro's normally sublime blowing had taken on some of the harsher, squeakier, squawkier and gruffer qualities then in vogue among many of his \\"free\\" progeny, though Dolphy manages with admirable tenacity to keep at least one foot on firm sonic soil throughout most of this session. The leader's best performances are probably on his two alto saxophone workouts, \\"Straight Up and Down\\" and the title tune, while \\"Gazzeloni\\" is a skittering flute race quite unlike any of Dolphy's earlier efforts on that instrument and \\"Hat and Beard\\" and \\"Something Sweet, Something Tender\\" showcase, respectively, the most raucous and most genteel aspects of his legendary bass clarinet playing.     OUT TO LUNCH is less remarkable for Dolphy's solos, however, than for the stunning manner in which it manages to skirt the very edges of chaos for most of its forty-two minutes without once falling in. Regardless of one's opinion of this sort of music, there is no denying the internal cohesion and conceptual/compositional integrity of this remarkable date. Much of this is undoubtedly due to the superb rhythm section, particularly Hutcherson, who manages to hold all of the wildly swirling parts around him together on the most unlikely of instruments. Hubbard, for his part, provides the essential link to more mainstream jazz which helps keep OUT TO LUNCH as curiously accessible as it is, and proves as perfect a foil for the leader here as he had been on Dolphy's very first album, OUTWARD BOUND, four years earlier.     As a huge Eric Dolphy fan, I necessarily love OUT TO LUNCH, but less than I do several of the Maestro's more traditional sessions. Nevertheless, this album's seemingly impossible refusal to implode, shatter or just float away qualifies it as a singularly spectacular moment in progressive jazz history, and an absolutely essential part of any comprehensive collection.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|This is what makes this man so special, he doesn't just add his voice to the words and music, he throws hisself into it full force. The depth of emotional content is drawn from inside of him and he wraps it around him and draws from that energy as it pours out.<br /><br />It makes you wonder how he transitions back into every day life after walking out of the studio after having done this for hours. The emotional strain must be tremendous. But in the end it's worth it when he gets it where he wants it...<br /><br />It's not just the power you can feel reverberating from the music and his voice both at the same time, but the feeling poured into the words like he reached inside his very soul and pulled it out somehow to share with us all.<br /><br />There's a mix on this album that will blow you away. From the hard rocking songs to the gut wrenching ballads, Meat Loaf exemplifies Rock opera and puts it across in a way I have never seen anyone else do before. Now that I have played these songs back to back to back to back I need to get back into the real world and get my work done... LOL... But you can be sure I won't be able to shake him off so easy. He stays with you after you turn the cd player of whatever type off....<br /><br />Buy it, feel it, love it.... He's a one of a kind to be sure.

B000002VRZ|4.0|Anytime a greatest hits collection is put together, there will be disagreements over what material to include. This is a good place to start, but also you must pick up the self-titled first CD, as well at the very least. The greatest hits is missing some of the softer, almost delicate songs such as \\"Song in the Breeze\\" or the beautiful, ethereal \\"It Follows From Your heart.\\" This is; however, a \\"greatest hits\\" disc and so that is what we have here for the most part. So, start here, but don't stop here. A little further exploration of The Outlaws will show you they are indeed distinguishable from other southern rock acts. Truly, to lump The Allman Brothers band (blues and jazz influenced), The Marshall Tucker Band (country influenced); Lynyrd Skynyrd (straight ahead rock and roll with a southern flavor) and the Outlaws all together does a disservice to all of these groups. There is a difference and the difference is worth looking for -- at least to me. If you're not familiar with The Outlaws, pick up this CD. In addition, take a look at Henry Paul's country group Black Hawk.
0743289412|1.0|Stephen King: on a good day, there are few better. On a bad day, there are few worse. This is not a good day. <br /> <br />Back when King was writing his best material, he had a bad habit of mannered technique which he got away with, because the rest of the writing was so good - namely, distracting his readers with interjections <br />(so vivid!) <br />like so. I do not know if King supposed reverting to made-up words and echoing interjections - often of nonsense words like an insane toddler babbling in the background - would pump some of the old life into his new work, or if he felt he was taking any kind of artistic risk by doing so. Bad technique is just bad technique ... had any of the greats in literature used bad technique, it would still be bad technique. There were some potentially wonderful scenes ruined by the inistent and baffling use of annoying words and phrases: bool, smuck, SOWISA, babyluv, \\"the thing with the endless piebald side.\\" It was simply teeth-grinding to be jagged out of a story by these distractions, like background noises of painful pitch. The story otherwise could have been quite captivating, as there were glimpses of King at his best. But I do not like the sound of fingernails scraping across a blackboard, particularly if it's louder than the music playing. Hence, regrettably, one star, and a sincere plea to Mr King: just tell the damn story next time.

B000H7JD4K|3.0|Iron Maiden will never get out of their rut as long as Steve Harris is in charge of EVERYTHING. I know he is the founder and leader, but he needs somebody to tell him that is a lousy producer. Well, either Kevin Shirley is just awful, or Steve overrides him at every turn. Just listen to everything Maiden put out with Martin Birch before NPFTD. It was excellence. I cannot fathom how the guys in the band listen to what they have been putting out and actually agree that this is the best they can do. There are some pretty good songs here and the guys perform wonderfully as usual, well, except for Janick Gers who is just an embarassment. There are some really great riffs and Bruce still sounds really good for a 48-year old. The sound on this album does not even compare to stuff they put out over 20 years ago. I agree with several other reviewers that they seem to be putting out the same stuff ad nauseum. I love Iron Maiden and AMOLAD is still head and shoulders above most other stuff out there, so you will still be getting a great album when you pick this up. It is just unfortunate that Steve Harris' ego is so out of control that he cannot smell his own funk.
B00009V93Z|3.0|Elvis Presley fans will find diminishing returns in yet another RCA box set. \\"Close Up\\" offers more outtakes from the 1950s and '60, but nothing revelatory except for the gospel classics. However, the previously unreleased 1972 concert is worth a listen, with memorable versions of \\"Burning Love\\" and \\"How Great Thou Art.\\" Though a relatively good investment for under $20, it's not an essential purchase.
0800177177|4.0|Visually, this movie is stunning, amazing, beautiful and sensual. Steeped in Viennese decadence and opium dreams. The direction and the text book compendium of camera tricks was wonderful and marvelously entertaining. The script however presented the audience with a catch 22. It is laudable that you would want to give depth to the character of Dracula by making him a figure of tragedy while making the male vampire killers cartoon cut-outs. The trouble is, by giving depth to the love story it (pardon the pun) completely sucked the horror out of the script...and the scenes between Winona and Gary were bathroom break bad to say the least. So instead of having a chilling horror piece where the \\"other\\" was completely alien, evil and horrifying, you have a beauty and the beast story with some truly chilling and horror seasoned scenes in the first half of the movie. You can feel the horror bleed away starting when Dracula and Madame Mina meet on the London street. Then there was the um...troublesome and ever changing british accent of Keanu.    All in all though, I would much rather watch this version than the Badham version, because it is breathtakingly gorgeous.
B000002WYT|5.0|There's also much to hear and feel when you give the Dave Matthews Band's sophomore effort a spin. Ten years later, this CD still holds up and is now a mid-90's classic. The many tones and moods within the songs will tease the senses whether it's a rock gem like \\"Drive In, Drive Out,\\" or the romantic fantasy of \\"Say Goodbye.\\" The DMB may be an acquired taste for some, but once you catch the rhythm of the extended arrangements and appreciate the feel of the driving guitars, violin grooves, and blasting horns complete with heartfelt lyrics and Matthews' cool, cutting edge vocals, you'll see why Crash is an irresistable collection of songs. The CD is full of stand-out tracks like \\"Two Step,\\" \\"Lie in Our Graves,\\" \\"41\\", \\"Proudest Monkey,\\" and \\"Tripping Billies,\\" which includes a line that I consider as the overall positive message that make the Dave Matthews Band an original-\\"Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.\\"
B0007GAERG|4.0|I really like this disc. I've never given much thought to Mariah Carey before this album. She exists in a musical world I do not inhabit. (Check my other reviews.) But this disc reaches me. It's funky, super well produced (it'll blow your speakers if you let it), and her singing is technically brilliant.<br /><br />I really get with this record that Ms Carey is a professional entertainer. That she shows up to work and makes music like this. And that it may have nothing to do with her real life. The people she worked with on this project must be some of the best studio technicians around. It's such a treat to listen to!
B000IOM0YM|5.0|If you grew up loving KISS like I did, then this DVD set is a dream come true.  Every significant performance (including some I didn't even know existed) between 1974 and 1977 is captured.  Like others have said, this footage has been \\"around\\" for quite some time, but the picture is beautiful and the sound is out of this world.  No crappy VHS multi-generation footage here!  Sure, there's some stuff missing, but short of opening up the vaults and releasing every second of footage there's always going to be something that someone feels was left off. <br /> <br />The highlights for me include Gene on The Mike Douglas Show (for someone who's become such a camera hog, it was kind of endearing to see him out there not really sure what to do or say), all the TV appearances (Paul Lynde, Midnight Special, etc) and the Cobo Hall Concert which is AMAZING.  I've always loved KISS's live shows, but nothing compares to seeing these guys in their prime! <br /> <br />Seriously, I can't wait for Vols 2 and 3.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|Seems Meat Loaf signals us when he works with Jim Steinman, and he's using a bat signal - BAT OUT OF HELL III.  This time out Steinman doesn't produce (that goes to Desmond Child with help from Todd Rundgren), but he does provide several tracks including a handful from his previous works (solo album \\"Bad for Good\\" and PANDORA'S BOX \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" & \\"The Future Ain't What it Used to Be\\").<br /><br />The album comes off harder and more mature - Desmond Child influences the music to sound more metal.  Steinman's production on the first two BAT OUT OF HELL albums was slick, pop, and pretty.  They were definitely rock albums, but had a nice sheen that is not present this time out.  Meat Loaf's vocals this round easily match the metal mood - his aging tenor has grown rough, and the choice is a wise one to let everything rock a little bit more.  The arrangements are still over the top and grandiose.  There isn't a theme like in the first BAT OUT OF HELL, but BAT OUT OF HELL II didn't really have a concrete theme either when you think about it.<br /><br />It's a strong album that will please Meat Loaf fans.  It's several notches higher than his previous solo work, but mainly because the production is bigger.  Meat Loaf just begs for more!  His voice is so big (even now), and his persona larger than life.  It takes a full choir and an orchestra to get close to drowning him out.  So bring it all!  And that is exactly what BAT OUT OF HELL III does.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Well I just finished listening to the entire cd, minus the Bonus Live Track \\"Life is a Lemon (And I want my money back)\\", and exclusive bonus download track available when you purchase the cd through Circuit City, and I found the CD to be great! I was never into listening to Meat Loaf, but my girlfriend encouraged me to listen and wow! In fact I am currently listening to the cd again! I will say that not all songs intrest me, and infact some just seem to drag on. There are 14 tracks available for your listening pleasure ranging from 1 minute and 39 seconds to full 9 minutes and 46 seconds! I would say that the top three definites that I enjoyed are 1: \\"The Monster is Loose\\" 2: \\"Blind as a Bat\\" and 3: Meatloafs spin of \\"It's All coming back to me Now\\" featuring Marion Raven. I would recommend this CD if you love Meat Loaf, and I would still recommend the CD if you like Rock-N-Roll. There was nothing like driving down the Highway today on my way back from the CD store with the warm wind coming in through the window and the sun just behind my shoulder, rockin it with Meatloaf Bat out of Hell III! Rock On!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I thought this was a great concert. The sound and visual are very good. all the songs were performed extremely well. I would advise you to buy the Eagles Millineium concert DVD. I thought that that was just a little bit better.
B000000SDN|2.0|Yeah, that's right. Except for Hampson (I love his Don G., too!), none of the singers were memorable.  I thought Despina's voice was especially thin and nasal.  I just had the feeling that this recording lacks momentum; it seems just to slog through.  Or maybe it's just the opera's style is a bit monotonous throughout?
B00009ATIX|2.0|Im a big SciFan fan and I do enjoy movies with more substance than space battles.  I gave 2001 A Space Odyssey 5 stars.  So, this film appeared to be right up my alley so to speak. <br /> <br />It started OK and had me quite interested as things got setup...but then it really started to drag and didnt resolve itself whatsoever.  This is what kiled it. Its not enough for a movie to simply ask provacative questions, the film has to present a potential \\"angle\\" on that question or even an intelligent opinion to actually have meaning. This movie just plodded along, it wasnt boring but it didnt really create much tension or spark any \\"what if's\\" either. <br /> <br />Clooney was OK in this movie but his imaginary wife was rather uninspiring and seemed to be on cruise control the whole movie. The rest of the cast was strange and didnt seem to fit all that well.  Overall, this was borderline watchable but I wouldnt see it again. <br /> <br />So, go and rent it or something but unless you're really into Clooney or like the original book you can probably skip this one.
0446528056|5.0|I went out a bought Dear John the day it came out and to tell you the truth I couldn't put it down.  Sparks has finally returned with the perfect love story.  This book recaptures the spirit and romance that was in my all time favorite Sparks novel The Notebook.  Dear John is sure to capture your heart just like it has to me.  I highly recomend this book to all true Nicholas Sparks fans out there and if you want to relive the true old fashion love story then definetly add this book to your collection.  You won't be dissapointed!
B000002LOE|5.0|Most \\"true\\" R.E.M. fans, who define themselves as having purchased Murmur the week it was released, trash this album with regularity. The criticism is unjustified. This is one of the three definitive R.E.M. releases (together with Life's Rich Pageant and Automatic.) Sure, it was popular and earned massive sales and airplay, but don't hold that against it. <br /> <br />This is a Tour De Force from start to finish. No clunkers here. \\"Losing My Religion\\" was so popular that it is easy to ignore, but has there ever been a more compelling song ever made? \\"Shiny Happy People\\" is the most misunderstood, ironic R.E.M. song. My personal favorite: the haunting \\"Half a World Away.\\" This is R.E.M. at its peak.
006441034X|5.0|I viewed the movie first and then decided to read the book. The book is nothing like the movie and even more exciting. It is not for small children but for older kids and adults. The author was very creative in writting this with keeping you guessing until the very end. If you love the movie or fantasy novels then you will love this.
B000005RQE|4.0|I actually owned every R.E.M. album but Document until I finally broke down. I had thought the two strongest songs would be \\"The One I Love\\" and \\"It's The End of The World....\\" Since neither of those songs are rated highly by me, I figured I would be disappointed by this album. Was I ever wrong! There are some great songs here. \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" and \\"King of Birds\\" are personal favorites. It's definitely not up to par with what came before it, and some of what came after it, but it's definitely a worthy part of their catalogue.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|The bonus discs are different shows from the one's already included. The Cobo Hall disc is a different date of show than the one included in all the sets. What I dislike is the marketing strategy here. You gotta buy three sets to get the three different discs. The MSG '77 could have been remastered better it is the same as a bootleg VHS tape I've seen years ago. Other than that the set is great.
B000005RQF|5.0|Like many, this was the first R.E.M. album I purchased. I had heard of them before, of course, but they were never my cup of tea. I have since bought them all, but this one remains their masterpiece, in my opinion. <br /> <br />There simply are no fillers here. Highlights (and there are many) include \\"Fall On Me\\" \\"I Believe\\", \\"Flowers\\", and \\"Cuyahoga,\\" but the ones not mentioned here are great, too. If there is anyone on the planet that has never purchased an R.E.M. disc, this is where to start.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|The latest CD from Evanescence takes a different turn from their last release.  While their record-label debut 'Fallen' consisted of catchy, mainstream rock beats geared towards pop/rock radio, 'The Open Door' changes things up a bit, incorporating new sounds into their music. <br /> <br />'The Open Door' takes a turn for the darker side.  While very dark, the album does not quite fall into 'goth-rock' category, mainly because of the absence of screechy vocals and explicit lyrics.  Amy Lee's vocals help boost the album and make it more accessable to the mainstream audience.   <br /> <br />The songs range from hot rock numbers with heavy beats, opener \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" and radio hit \\"Call Me when You're Sober\\" to piano ballad-ish tunes (i.e. \\"Lithium,\\" \\"Like You\\") to darker rock numbers (\\"Lose Control,\\" \\"Weight of the World\\")  The choir on \\"Lacrymosa\\" and the eerie vocals on \\"Cloud Nine\\" make them perfect for any ghost movie soundtrack, while the catchiest tune on the album \\"Snow White Queen\\" has 'hit' written all over it. <br /> <br />Perhaps, the most unique and credible number is the close-er \\"Good Enough.\\"  The album takes a turn for the lighter side with this beautiful piano ballad.  Amy Lee's vocals sound almost soulful on this, and this tune is completely different than anything they've ever done before.  This shows that Evanescence has what it takes to last in the long run. <br /> <br />Overall, a very good album and an excellent choice to pull out for Halloween!!
B000002LFU|4.0|This album is often overlooked because of the negatives (first major label release, \\"Stand\\" -need I say more?) But any album with \\"you Are Everything\\" and \\"World Leader Pretend\\" on it has to be in your collection. These are not just two of the best R.E.M. songs, they are two of the best songs-period.  <br /> <br />One of the other great songs isn't even on the label, so don't eject the CD from the player too fast!
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I wouldn't be suprised if this movie gets an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay. It's interesting how the time zones are two years apart for the two main characters. The two characters are determined to meet eachother, so they spend all of their time trying to think of ways. One of their ideas seems like the perfect plan, but something mysterious happens to get in the way of it. One scene shows that the two characters have already met in Sandra Bullock's charachter's past, but it is Keanu Reeves's character's present. The two character's plots come together in a suprising way that will shock you. The only reason I didn't give this movie five stars is because it gets a little bit confusing in the middle, but it's easy to understand after you think about it for a few seconds.
B000002MG1|5.0|Just a shade below Life's Rich Pageant, and gaining ground. What a work of art. The main hits have been mentioned again and again, but what sets this album apart for me are \\"Find The River\\" and \\"Sweetness Follows.\\" Just listen to \\"Sweetness Follows\\" in the underappreciated Vanilla Sky, and you'll never hear it the same way again. A remarkable album.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Everything in this show is very well thought out, and creative. The jokes are brilliantly written, and it has a perfect cast. The characters' personalities are so diverse, and so different. Joey's the stupid one, Monica's the neurotic one, Chandler's the sarcastic one, Phoebe's the dizty one, Ross is the smart one, and Rachel is the normal one. The recurring chacters are also hilarious. Among the best are Janice, Gunther, and the ugly naked guy. The show also had great guest stars such as Brad Pitt, Morgan Fairchild, and Cole Sprouse. Among the best episodes are \\"The One Where Chandler Can't Cry\\", The One Where Rachel Has A Baby\\", and \\"The One Where They're Up All Night.\\" This DVD is hours of fun.
B000002MU3|4.0|Loud, louder and loudest. The band was at their peak here, at least popularity wise. A deliberate departure from Automatic and Out Of Time, there are great moments here. The last of its kind. It is fair to say R.E.M will never make an album like this again. Whether that's good or bad is up to you.
B00005JPBL|2.0|Now that the Halloween ritual is over, so is the only good reason to see \\"Saw III\\" at a theatre. So here are some observations for those reading these comments while trying to decide whether they should pay good money to see the movie.     First off look at the situation objectively, by its third installment the \\"Saw\\" franchise has become what the film industry refers to as a \\"pre-sold\\" product. This means that during the pre-production phase it was known that virtually anything released to theatres with the title \\"Saw III\\" will do substantial business. For those (including myself) who enjoyed the first two, it would be a much-anticipated Halloween ritual. We would purposely not read comments or reviews (or even view trailers) to insure a completely pure viewing experience. Our tickets were essentially sold before \\"Saw II\\" had closed at our local mega-plex.     Although these economics guaranteed the production of the third installment (and apparently a fourth one), they provide no incentive for producing a film worthy of the preceding two. The original entry had to be good or suffer a \\"direct to video\\" fate, and the second benefited from (but was not over-whelmed by) a more professional production process because of its higher budget. In additon for the second one there was considerable incentive to prove that the first was not a lucky fluke.    Further red flags go up when you see that \\"Saw III\\" is using a \\"worldwide\\" saturation booking technique normally reserved for weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre-release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theatres (3167 in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide). This is normally done with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance. If a film is good it will be exhibited more discreetly because the producers are counting on positive \\"buzz\\" to promote attendance and reduce marketing costs.    Finally, the critics have overwhelmingly trashed\\"Saw III\\", even those who were extremely positive about the first two.     So as a potential (not a pre-sold viewer), you get on this site and sift through the comments to try to get a handle on the quality of the film while avoiding major spoilers; and you find an extremely divergent set of comments. My advice is to dig a little deeper into the source of the comments, click to see the comment history of each author. It is generally a good idea to give more weight to the more prolific writers-especially those whose comments about other films mirror your reactions.     In the case of \\"Saw III\\", the extremely positive (and least detailed) comments on the IMDb are almost exclusively from people for whom this is their first comment. If this seems extremely odd and if you are into conspiracy theories, you should at least consider the possibility that these are planted as part of the film's marketing campaign.     As for myself, I cannot imagine anyone who has not seen the first two films getting much enjoyment out to the third. Although there were times during the viewing process where I wished I was in this group because at least the confusion would have provided some degree of mental challenge during what turned out (IMHO) to be an extremely boring feature.     Nor would I expect anyone who did not get off on blood and gore to find this an enjoyable experience. The \\"Saw\\" films are in the horror sub-genre made famous by Dario Argneto and Mario Bava. This is called the \\"gialli\\" (yellow) style. These two Italian makers of horror/ thrillers place a huge emphasis on the deed of murder whereas other styles emphasize the solving of the murder.  Inherent in this style is almost constant self-parody, necessary to expand the target audience beyond the wiggers and drones who flock to the local mall.  The parody element fundamental to the first two installments is in short supply in \\"Saw III\\",  deliberately inserted into only one scene-the pig rendering trap.    Checking my watchevery ten minutes I kept hoping that something would happen to give an interesting tilt to what I had already seen, as had happened in the first two. But by the midway point I had abandoned this (not the checking of my watch but the expectation that any magician could pull a rabbit out of this lame hat).    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B000002KBU|5.0|I just listened to this album again after a nearly 30 year hiatus and was blown away by Mitchell's amazing poetry and voice. I think that I'm enjoying it more now than when it was first released. What's more, my teenage daughter has asked for her own copy for Christmas. One reviewer called this \\"quintessential Joni.\\" I'll raise my glass to that!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|No doubt about it, this was one of the most fascinating movies I've had the opportunity to see recently.  The photographs that Gore shows are absolutely fascinating and really puts into perspective the global warming crisis we are facing.   <br /> <br />Additionally, I found Gore energetic, engaging, funny; just an overall excellent example of a wonderful public speaker.  Wait, did I really say that?  THIS Al Gore was not anything like the Al Gore we saw run for/win the presidency.  What is seen in this documentary is someone speaking about something that really matters, someone that cares about the issue at hand, and someone that is willing to put it all on the line for that issue.  It is a shame that most politicians do not have this kind of exuberance for the \\"real\\" issues we face as human beings.   <br /> <br />Even if you are not a fan of Gore, go see it to increase your knoweldge about the issues we face in terms of global warming.  Guaranteed to increase your knowledege.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|Absolutely wonderful film with some great British actors. Colin Firth is brillantly bumbling and Emma Thomas is serenely understated as the \\"crone-come-guardian angel\\" Nanny McPhee. Vividly colourful and magical - though I'm sure there will be those who see undertones of witchcraft. But who cares? It was thoroughly enjoyable. And, thanks be to God, no song and dance routines! Well done, Emma!! Let's have some more like this!
1569242739|5.0|I enjoyed her first book.  But, I almost didn't order this one.  I thought it would be just another vegan dessert book.  I have made three recipes chocolate mint cupcake, peanut butter cupcake and sexy lof fat vanilla cupcake they were all wonderful.   <br /> <br />These are easy and taste great.  I am buying more to give as Holiday gifts.
B000GRUS22|3.0|Back in 1994 I discovered the project Enigma and was blown away by the richly layered, exotic and sensual music. When I learned of an impending 6th Enigma album, I was quite excited and a bit wary. After the first four solid albums, Voyageur was a bit of a departure from the earlier Enigma albums, but it was still enjoyble. Waiting for the release of A Posteriori, I wondered if Michael Cretu would go back to the Enigma that I fell in love with or would he go further away from it. After listening to the album twice it is my opinion that he went further away from it. Alone, A Posteriori is a decent album.. a nice \\"chill out\\" album, but compared to Enigma's earlier masterpieces, it fails miserably. (my rating is actually 2 1/2 stars) It sounds incomplete, almost as if it's just one layer of music and the other layers are missing. It's pretty much an even tempoed album from start to finish. There is no stand out track. No songs that made me think \\"wow!\\" No \\"Sadeness\\" or \\"Eyes Of Truth\\" or \\"Push The Limits\\" I'm sure many of us Enigma fans who fell in love with the project back in MCMXC ad days are longing for that Enigma again.. that flute, the Gregorian chants, the sexy French whispers and that hypnotizing background beat that makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. The best thing about A Posteriori is the very beginning of the album when, for a brief instant, the famous Enigma fanfare passes through, almost reminding us of how fabulous Enigma once was... and still could be. There is no doubt that Micheal Cretu is a talented man. I just wish he would go back to the Enigma that I fell in love with. Change isn't always a good thing. A Posteriori is clearly an example of the old adage \\"If it isn't broken, don't fix it\\".
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. I was expecting greatness and bombasticness and pure power and epic from Meat Loaf, but this is beyond anything I could have imagined based on the title track and \\"It's All Coming Back to me Now\\" which I heard as soon as they were released. <br /> <br />Meat Loaf certainly has unleashed a monster. He's broken chains and flown away from his norm and it is totally IMPRESSIVE. He's gone in a great new direction while still STRONGLY keeping what has made him great all along.  <br /> <br />There's not a single track that pulls down the power of this album. Of course, it slows down and gets sofer to soothe you before the anger comes through again, but the power of it does not stop.  <br /> <br />There is no question about the validity of this album as a Bat out of Hell.
B000IOM0YM|3.0|Buyer beware:  if you purchase your copy from Best Buy the bonus disc contains no menu, nor does it allow you to track from song to song.  I would have been better off simply transfering my old VHS to dvd than buying this.  I chose to drive an extra forty minutes simply to have THIS extra show on dvd - and I'm taking it back tonight.      As for the previous reviewer who wondered why the Cobo Hall show is in the set twice (for Best Buy purchases)...  it's not.  It's the previous night's performance.
B000H5U65C|4.0|These guys are compared to Lamb of God. This is wrong. LOG blows. Mastodon is the real deal and getting better. Just to let everyone know. That said, I do like Leviathan more than this album. But I love both. Thus 4 instead of 5 stars.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Dylan's latest masterpiece explodes into existence and then maintains an even keel throughout. Unlike the electronically moody and dark \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and the eclectic \\"Love and Theft\\", \\"Modern Times\\" has an almost beatnik coolness to it. The songs float by one after the other, just happy to be there, impervious to jibes. They brush off any excuses or platitudinous write-offs. Even the tracks that sound lame at first grow roots and expose their undeniably solid foundations. The whole work slowly taps into the conscious until it finally shatters all doubts. A single listen won't do it. Once past that point of no return, it reveals all it has to offer, which translates into endless hypnotic replays. Somehow, though these ten songs fit very well into Dylan's epic repertoire, the collection emanates a surprising freshness. \\"Modern Times\\" sounds familiar and unprecedented all at once.<br /><br />Dylan also reigns in his shattered voice on this release. Gone are the raspy phlegmmy notes that occassionally pockmarked its immediate predecessors. With cigarette stained larynx and well trodden neverending band in full control, Dylan sails to new heights not heard for years. Everything sounds perfectly situated, sure of itself, tight, and defiant. And though Dylan's vocal range is understandably squelched by age, no self-consciousness mars the polished growls and grunts.<br /><br />Lyrically, \\"Modern Times\\" delivers as many stratified depths as his surreal musings of the sixties. \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\", the ominous opening song, defies analysis while conjuring up memories of thin men, a row of desolation, and approximate queens: \\"I got the porkchops she got the pie,\\" \\"The pistols are poppin' and the power is down,\\" \\"I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows.\\" Morphing guitar solos, which seem to span the history of rock, add to the fantastic miasma. \\"Thunder\\" evokes both God and sickness with a chugging beat. Moving three steps from the apocalypse, Dylan remains stung by the mysterious amorous passion that emerged on \\"Blood on the Tracks.\\" The meditative \\"When the Deal Goes Down\\" pledges love until death do us part. Pain of the heart also pervades \\"Spirit on the Water,\\" \\"Someday Baby,\\" \\"Beyond the Horizon,\\" and \\"Nettie Moore.\\" Regret and disgust weave subthemes throughout the entire work. Until yet another stunning closer, \\"Ain't Talkin',\\" wails a parting shot at our slippery human-all-too-humanness: \\"In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell, I am a-tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others, But oh, mother, things ain't going well.\\" One too many mornings for Bob.<br /><br />The frustrated confused rage of \\"Wokingman's Blues #2\\" receives apt punctuation via a tinkling piano line. Dylan masterfully adumbrates the emotional nexus resulting from the neglect of poverty: \\"I'll drag 'em all down to hell and I'll stand 'em at the wall, I'll sell 'em to their enemies\\", but later, \\"Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking, That you have forgotten me?\\" Easily a classic.<br /><br />\\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" presages hard rain doom. \\"Some people on the road carryin' everything they own, Some people got barely enough skin to cover their bones\\", \\"Plenty of cheap stuff out there and still around that you take,\\" \\"I ain't got enough room to even raise my head,\\" \\"Don't be a stranger with no brain or heart.\\" How high's the water, mama?<br /><br />\\"Modern Times\\" shares its title with a movie featuring an almost mute tramp victimized by change, work, and progress. Somehow the ragamuffin finds and nurtures love, though not without great effort. He gets eaten by machinery. Both works, album and film, grope for light in the contemporary haze. Each succeeds in exemplifying the conflicts of the individual within the increasingly dense fog of modernity. Both will also continue to entertain, enlighten, and ground us lonely modern humans for some time to come.tung by the mysterious amorous passion that emerged on \\"Blood on the Tracks.\\" The meditative \\"When the Deal Goes Down\\" pledges love until death do us part.

6305949980|5.0|Although not formally announced, the 3D version of the 1993 stop-motion classic is in the theaters. It's been six years since the last release. So Disney is undoubtably readying a new version to accompany the cool new soundtrack with special cover versions that just came out.  Instead of paying top dollar for the above very good Special Edition from 2000, you might want to wait a couple of months and get the new version.
B00006JI3R|4.0|This strange but charming movie combines the unique talents of director Tim Burton, star Johnny Depp and co-star Martin Landau to tell the story of Ed Wood, the 50's B-movie director of such now cult classics as \\"Glen or Glenda\\" and \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", both considered to be among the worst movies of all time.  Depp stars as Wood, an eternal optimist with a penchant for cross-dressing.  Landau does an amazing turn as Bela Lugosi, whom Wood \\"rescued\\" off the scrap heap to star in his low-budget productions, all the time being a true friend in every sense of the word.  Burton contributes his singular surrealistic style--the world of the movie seems to be set in one of Wood's productions.  Not many people saw this movie on its first release, but like Wood's pictures, it's become a cult classic, but because it's so good, not because it's so bad it's good.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|....what a great singer and performer Meat Loaf is...and this new CD only proves how true that statement is.  Meat's voice is as strong as ever and the passion he puts into the songs on this CD make them exactly like the songs on the previous two Bat alubms.....Meat Loaf classics!!  A must have for all Meat fans and rock n roll collectors. <br /> <br />Thanks, Meat, for a FANTASTIC CD!!!!
B000BB1MI2|4.0|The involvement of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, along with the need to see another treatment of Roald Dahl's classic children's book got me interested in this film. We have the '70s musical version with Gene Wilder on VHS. It was OK but didn't quite capture Dahl's magic.<br /><br />This version was less a traditional musical as all the numbers featured the Oompa-Loompas and were takeoffs on big production numbers from other movie musicals. I guess as much could be expected from Danny Elfman, who has done the music for The Simpsons and other Burton movies (including the amazing \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\"). Elfman also does all the Oompa-Loompa singing vocals.<br /><br />Burton brings a back story to the Oompa-Loompas and to Willie Wonka, while Depp bring his own bizarre interpretation to the Wonka role. It's a good followup to his turn pirate Jack Sparrow in \\"Pirates of the Caribbea.\\"<br /><br />The other four kids who find the Golden Tickets are right on the mark--gluttonous Gloop, greedy Veruca, vain Veronica, and smart-a** Mike--and all get their just desserts, so to speak. Special mention also go to Deep Roy (an Indian actor, I assume) who by the magic of digital technology, plays all the Oompa-Loompas, including the one who is Wonka's psychologist, and to the young actor who plays good-hearted Charlie of the title. Squirrels also play an important digitally-enhanced role.<br /><br />Overall, this movie might be a little strange (especially the squirrels) for very small children, but is good family fare with its own style.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Meat Loaf has one of the most outstanding voices I have ever heard.  You can tell that each song has his heart and soul poured into it.  Bat out of Hell III is no exception.  Unfortunately, Jim didn't participate in the making of this album except for writing half of the songs.  It was very nice to see Meat dedicate the album to him, though.  Jim has stated that he has some brand new songs he would like Meat to sing for a Bat out of Hell anniversary album (next year marks 30 years: 1977-2007), so here's hoping! <br /> <br />Back to this album, though.  Every song sounds like it should be in a Bat out of Hell album.  \\"Blind as a Bat\\" and Desmond's other songs fit very well with Steinman's.  Steinman's \\"In the Land of the Pig, the Butcher is King\\" is an amazing song that I will constantly listen to and the duet for \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" is truly beautiful.  The one part I was worried about was lack of piano, but I worried for nothing.  The piano is there in full force in many of the songs.  It would have been nice to hear a speaking track such as \\"I've Been Dreaming Up A Storm Lately\\" before \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" (as was done for Pandora's Box), but that can be excused.  If you haven't gotten this album yet, you need to go out and get it right away!
B00008RH3L|5.0|On the surface, Miller's Crossing seems like a straightforward Prohibition-era gangster picture. But artistically, it's just too good to be confined to that genre--an intricate plot about \\"ethics\\" (can you imagine); great acting by Irishman Gabriel Byrne as the lead character Tom, by Albert Finney as the Irish boss, and by a host of others (including Coen regular John Turturro), highlighted by a positively inside look at evil by J.E. Freeman as \\"The Dane\\"; awesome cinematography and a perfect score (featuring murder and mayhem to \\"Danny Boy\\" and Italian opera); and a couple highly memorable scenes, one featuring Finney and the other Turturro. There's a good bit of violence, but very little done to a gruesome extent, and the language harks back to a \\"wholesome\\" time before the F word had been popularized (\\"rumpus\\" gets a lot of play). At a minimum, Miller's Crossing is a good evening's rental for an adult audience. You may even end up putting it on your list of all-time favorites.
B000H5U832|5.0|This movie is so funny!My favorite characters are Mater, Lighting Mcqueen, sally and Filmore.  If you didn't see this movie in theaters then you must rent this or buy it on dvd.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|A true love-it-or-hate-it movie: my reaction fits closer with the first group.  This gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound. The parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills, while her son tries to make a living dealing, although he, his partner, and his girlfriend smoke, shoot and snort a lot of the profits.  The director's jarring style fits the subject matter well, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing.  Julia Roberts beat her for Best Actress in 2000 with Erin Brockovich, which was a fine role and performance, but Burstyn was in another world.  Those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense.  I can understand the second objection, hence four stars rather than five.<br /><br />Note: I got this movie from Netflix--I'm not sure if I was watching the director's cut or not.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Owning the Criterion laserdisc version and all the subsequent DVD versions, I must say that this one-sided DVD release is the cleanest transfer yet.  It is superior to the last THX version (flipper disc).  Just watch the opening credits of this release next to Republic/Artisan's so-called \\"superior picture quality\\" from \\"the\\" original film negative. There's not a speck of dirt or flecks on a HDTV with this new release. <br /> <br />However, I question why this DVD running time is listed as 130 minutes and the THX is 132 minutes. <br /> <br />Maybe someone with time to kill could screen sync both side by side and see if it's an edit or compression or neither.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I have only gotten half way through the Winterland Concert and I really like what I have seen so far. What I don't understand is why Best Buy would give us a 3rd \\"Exclusive Limited Edition Bonus Disc\\" of the 1976 Cobo Hall concert when this concert is alread included on the first disc? Anybody know why? Who has the best 3rd Bonus Disc Concert that is not a repeat of something already included on the first 2 discs. Bad move on Best Buy's part. I also hope the range of sound frequency, deeper bass and higher treble gets better as I go through the set. I know the remastered vintage Led Zeppelin concert set sound and picture was out of this world. It was absolutely incredibly clean for that time period. I think alot of that had to do with the original source it came from.
032147404X|3.0|This is a good book for someone new to photography. Most intermediate on up shooters will find little in it to advance their skill. Ok for a reminder of basic approaches but nothing else.
6305537321|5.0|This charming and delightful film is the glittering obverse of that horrible downer, Midnight Cowboy. New York is dreamy, the clothes are gorgeous, Hepburn is unbearably lovely and appealing, Peppard is steady and straight. The characters develop through the film, they grow in maturity and substance. Peppard ditches his humiliating life as a parasite, and gets a job. Hepburn, who is what used to be called a B-girl (I think), not a prostitute or a call-girl or an escort, finally sheds the sleaze and finds true love. In the 30s she might have been a Manhattan baby. Moon River is about as different from that dreadful whiney thing in Cowboy as it possibly could be, written by the unmatchable Johnny Mercer. The only rats are the punters and snobs, and the hornily heartless middle-aged lady. There's a bit of Sweet Charity and Pretty Woman, as well as Cabaret, in the story; but this bubbling froth, with bite and feeling, rises to top the lot. Take your pick, folks, I know which one I'm going for. Audrey forever.
B000HIVQLW|4.0|Most \\"best of\\" collections for most groups seem to lack something. My expectations for \\"Echoes\\" were low.  I was wrong about \\"Echoes.\\" I have many \\"greatest hits\\" and many \\"best of,\\" and this one, for one of the greatest progressive rock groups, is an absolute gem.  While this album can never capture the greatness of Pink Floyd, it can intrigue you enough to go buy their albums.<br /><br />I am least familiar with Syd Barrett's work in early Pink Floyd. The songs \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" \\"See Emily Play,\\" \\"Arnold Layne,\\" \\"Jugband Blues,\\" and \\"Bike,\\" all written and sang by Syd Barrett, urged me to obtain Pink Floyd's early albums \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" and \\"A Saucerful of Secrets.\\" This music is psychedelic and imaginative, and now I know why there is a \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-7).\\"<br /><br />I think it is a nearly bizarre truth that there is almost no such thing as bad Pink Floyd music. There is weak Pink Floyd music, and Pink Floyd music that is difficult to appreciate. However, Pink Floyd at their worst is still musically a force. When I listen to this music I remember the promise and potential of progressive rock through what many consider to be the glory years of progressive rock. Music from \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" which set all sorts of longevity records on the charts, is represented, of course. However, Pink Floyd in the post-Barrett years has always been more than one album. There was the wonderful \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" the epic \\"The Wall,\\" and the bizarre and complex \\"Animals.\\" Then there is the sonically pleasing \\"The Division Bell,\\" and the often derided \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\" There are also the albums \\"The Final Cut\\" and \\"Meddle.\\" This album also includes one song from the movie \\"The Wall.\\"<br /><br />Note that this CD is listed as a \\"Special Edition.\\"  Pardon my cynicism, but, big whoop.  The only thing \\"special\\" about this edition over the previous version of \\"Echoes\\" is the biodegradable plastic cover.  If you have the original \\"Echoes\\" and tossed the plastic wrapper into the trash, I think you can rest assured that it is too late to get that plastic back into a barrel of oil.  Buying another copy may help someone's bottom line, but not yours.  There are three reasons to buy this album.<br /><br />(1)  You have to have every album released by Floyd (the definition of Floyd fanatic).<br /><br />(2)  You are just getting into the group and you want an overview of their career to see if you should buy more.<br /><br />(3)  You absolutely have to have the song \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" from the movie \\"The Wall,\\" which does not appear on the CD \\"The Wall.\\"<br /><br />Listening to these songs in the order on the CD is almost surreal as the album cuts back and forth between decades and band lineups. As I listen to this music I remember all that I love about rock, particularly progressive rock, and what I love about life and Pink Floyd, and then I wonder how we got here, and why David Gilmour thought Pink Floyd had run its course when it really had not. There is still time.  We can only hope that one day the members of Pink Floyd realize that they were always greater than the sum of their parts. Until that time, cherish all the music from Pink Floyd you can get, because Pink Floyd is one of the few groups that managed to find the middle ground between art and entertainment. These songs and instrumentals will always be diamonds in my collection, and they will carry me forward and backward in time, until there is no time left.e original \\"Echoes\\" and tossed the plastic wrapper into the trash, I think you can rest assured that it is too late to get that plastic back into a barrel of oil.

B000HWZ61Y|5.0|The sound quality on this remastered Hysteria CD is great. I highly recommend it.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|The cool thing about Meat Loaf's albums is that they never sound like anything else being played on the radio. Bat 3 is no exception. It's unfair to compare it to the two previous Bat albums as this one is unique unto itself. I think it's probably Meat's best album in awhile. It's got a metal feel to some songs (\\"In The Land Of The Pig, The Butcher Is King\\", \\"If It Ain't Broke Break It\\"), one of the songs sounds like Trans Siberian Orchestra (\\"Seize The Night\\") the rest of the album is just killer stuff that sounds best turned up very loud. Meat is also sounding better on here than he has in a while.    Overall just great stuff!! Highly recommended!!
B000H30B2C|4.0|This is a very good movie. But let me warn you, don't watch it on a day where you made plans to go shopping, see a friend... or a doctor, dentist and so on. it is a very long but a very fun movie to watch. Since it's three hours long you come to wonder is it drawn out? And the answer to that is... yes it is. Im not going to spoil it for any body who hasn't seen the original or any of the remakes including this one, but will say that the hugging scene at the end between Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts is like 10 miniutes long. And the scenes when kong is fighting the t-rex, although cenematic and entertaining, are around 30 miniutes long. The movie also features some very impossible things, aside from the obvious (cough, giant ape, jack black trying to act dramatic). Like the scene where kong first takes Ann. Kong is running through the forest at top speed swinging ann in is arm as if he were trying to give her whiplash, and that of course is what any human being would get. A very old car being flipped and tossed up to fifty feet in the air and falling back down to earth becomeing totaled and three feet shorter than it was before the incident and the passenger walks out with no broken bones but only a mere stratch or two. Dispite this it was a pretty good movie. I would reccommend this but would rather watch the lord of the rings myself. The cgi was brilliant, as the acting was to. I mean the way the natives of the island were, amazing, kind of creepy. Over all i'd reccommend for someone who is willing.
B00005OAIE|5.0|First of all, who the hell is Rickey Wright? (Amazon Editorial Review) I mean really, it makes you wonder if the guy is listening to the same music he is reviewing. My musical tastes range from Zepplin to James Taylor, Porcupine Tree to Pink Floyd, The Beatles to J.J.Cale. Pop, rock, blues, jazz, if it's good music I listen to it with an open mind.<br /><br />  I completely missed \\"Room for Squares\\" when it came out. Yeah, I heard \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" on the radio and thought it was catchy, but didn't investigate further. After being turned on to \\"Contiuum\\" by a friend, I went back and picked up \\"Room for Squares\\" and quite frankly, I was blown away by this effort. Yes it is mostly pop, but expertly written, played, produced and mixed. The sound quality is top shelf and every single cut is a winner. If you're not tapping your toe and singing along with most of these tunes after several plays, you better go see a doctor. You might be dead.<br /><br />  This music is incredible. The songs are not formula driven. There are hooks within hooks, great lyrics, excellent guitar execution. This type of recording only comes along every few years, so if you don't have it in your collection, my thought is buy it, you won't be dissapointed, or try and contact Mr. Wright. You could probably buy his copy for next to nothing, which by the way is what his editorial is worth.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|WOW! I've now listened to Bat Out Of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose 5 times through without skipping a track. This is an amazing album. I was cautiously awaiting it's arrival because quite honestly I can't hear It's All Coming Back To Me Now without seeing Celine Dion. I thought this was a poor choice on Meat's part -- my bad! The track fits seamlessly with the other songs on the album. As much as I love Steinman (his Bad For Good and Pandora's Box are staples in my collection) Desmond Child really gives him a run for his money as far as song quality goes. The 2 Desmond songs The Monster Is Loose and Blind As A Bat are an amazing 1 - 2 punch of an opening. They really set the tone. The music hits hard and only gets harder with barely a moment to catch your breath. I did not really think that Meat would be able to top Bat II -- I thought Life Is A Lemon was the pinnacle. I'm happy to say that I was wrong! This album is for music lovers. I love drama in my music and Meat delivers it in spades. Catch this Bat ASAP. It is extremely enjoyable -- great way to spend my Halloween.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not sure where Meat & Steinman are as far as their friendship goes but the album is dedicated to \\"Jim Steinman for 30 years of friendship and inspiration.\\" Now that's a class act!

0618680004|3.0|Being a person that holds no particular religious beliefs, one would think that I'd have a certain amount of sympathy with Dawkins' viewpoints.  You'd be wrong. <br /> <br />Dawkins shows a remarkable lack of understanding with regard to the entire legacy of philosophical and theological discourse throughout the past 3000-odd years.  He's written a polemic (although a fairly genial polemic) against religious/deistic faith while apparently not grasping that his faith in science is absolute.  He refuses to acknowledge that in some key areas (the meaning of life, the root cause of existence) science is silent, and likely always will be. <br /> <br />I'm also put off by his intellectual dishonesty in adamantly refusing to even countenance the notion of a creator/supreme being/higher intelligence.  If he were honest with himself, and honest in his scientific principles he'd simply admit that he doesn't know whether God exists or not and leave it at that.  I suppose that's why Socrates is still considered the wisest man ever since he at least admitted that he knew nothing. <br /> <br />Alrighty, so after thoroughly trashing Dawkins, I'm still giving the book 3 stars.  If you're a member of Dawkins' tribe you'll likely enjoy it.  Just remember that while he's preaching, you're a member of the choir.
B00000633N|5.0|I love this CD. The vocals and the beat of all the song are awesome. I think Introspective is the one of the best albums The Pet Shop Boys have. If your thinking of buying it do it you wont regret it and it's at a great price.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|In response to the last review by President Cleveland....it's funny how the MSG & Cobo Hall bonus discs don't have menus but the Largo '77 show (the Wal-Mart bonus disc) does! <br /> <br />Anyways, if you have to choose which version to get, I'd say the Wal-Mart version.  Almost the whole show (no \\"Shock Me\\", \\"Take Me\\", etc) on it, but does include the majority of this show.   <br /> <br />The Cobo Hall Bonus disc is 2nd choice to buy. <br /> <br />The bonus disc MSG that is sold in the majority of stores contains the least amount of footage (only 27 minutes, 7 songs)...is OK.  I'm not too crazy about this show anyways... <br /> <br />Bottom line it's a great set, but like another reviewer stated, they should have made a 3 DVD set and put the 3 bonus shows on the standard DVD for a \\"Limited Edition\\", rather than having to go and buy 3 different sets to get all 3 bonus DVDs. <br /> <br />The toughest one to find for me was the one sold at Wal-Mart (77 show).  I went to 6 Wal-Marts to get a hold of it.  It was either not in stock, or they haven't gotten them in yet! <br /> <br />Anyways, excellent set all around and good to excellent quality.  Except for the rare photos and Paul's note at the beginning, I found the content lacking in the booklets (they just write what Paul & Gene say in the DVD commentary -- but it's nice to see Ace & Peter's input in the book). <br /> <br />A+ for the content of the set <br />B for the marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|My Chemical Romance is an extremely talented band, but their music is not for everyone. You can pretty much tell right away if you are going to like them or not after hearing one song. I think they are an amazing band and I am impressed how fast they put out music of this calibur so often. Just like Three Cheers, I like every song on this album and can listen to the album all the way through.
B000FQ4M58|1.0|Bat 1 was a classic <br /> <br />Bat 2 was OK <br /> <br />This LP should have never been made. It is a retirement policy for Meat....
B0002W18MU|4.0|This album is very fragile. The great vulnerability of someone who is dying is clear. The voice is weakened but that adds to the attractiveness of the album. The highlights for me are God's Gonna Cut You Down, If You Could Read My Mind and Love's Been Good To Me.<br /><br />\\"If you could read my mind\\" is the old Gordon Lightfoot song and while it was a great song for Mr. Lightfoot, Johnny Cash makes it very special. You can hear the weakness in his voice and at that moment of his greatest physical weakness - he triumphs. A great swansong for a great artist.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I was SORELY disappointed that I missed the Dream Theater/Megadeth show when it came near me. I figured that I'd missed my shot of seeing Dream Theater live for this tour, so I sat and patiently waited for the next album. Six months later, I missed a SECOND show they played near me, cause I didn't even hear about it until it was already 2 weeks past it. This DVD is a decent substitute, I guess... :( <br /> <br />Now to a real review of the product: this DVD is high quality, with very good picture and sound quality. Too bad I only have 2.1 speakers and not 5.1, but I can deal; there is a 2.1 soundtrack available on the disc. <br /> <br />When I first picked it up I saw that there were only 14 songs in the show, and 3 bonus tracks. I felt kinda cheated, cause I thought there would be more, especially after the 18-song show on Live at Budokan. I also wished there was more from Six Degrees, since it's one of my favorite albums, and they had five tracks on Budokan from that album. Somehow I missed the fact that they included the ENTIRE TITLE TRACK from that album in the show. After discovering this, I was ecstatic. <br /> <br />The entire experience of watching this DVD was a pleasure, honestly. Even songs that I never really liked in their studio form (Innocence Faded, The Answer Lies Within) were excellent live. There was a very diverse collection of songs, ranging from early in their career (Another Won, from the Majesty days), up through five tracks from their newest studio album, Octavarium. The only thing I could've wished for was more from Train of Thought, but then again, that would've been just repetition, as they've done the entire album between this show and Budokan. <br /> <br />Absolutely excellent live DVD, it deserves every single one of those five stars.
B000HEWEJO|1.0|I just received a copy of It's A Wonderful Life 60th anniversary edition & I'm very disapointed! I sent Amazon a e-mail asking if the movie was in color because their dvd format say's (In color) & I didn't want the movie if it was in B&W beacuse I already had it. I received a e-mail back from  Amazon & they assured me that it was a colorized version of the movie. Well, I got my DVD today & on the back of the DVD it say's B & W. This is the same movie that was released a couple of years ago. It has the same stuff on it as the last movie they released. (The making of it's a wonderful life & A tribute to Frank Capra). There is nothing different about the movie. Paramount just wants to make more money. That's all it amounts to. So, all of the questions in these reviews are answered.<br />THIS MOVIE IS BLACK & WHITE- NOT COLOR!!!!!!! If you already own this movie don't buy it! You will just be getting a copy of the movie you already own & they wont refund your S & H, because the movie isn't defective. Amazon needs to watch what they are doing. They need to start putting the right DVD format on things. This is the second time I've got taken by Amazon saying the DVD format is color.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Bought the Wal-Mart dvd with the Largo Bonus disc. There was no display, no big sign at the electronic section of this store. After looking around, I asked a blue vest (who first gave me that confused retail clerk look) and followed him to the music section. He flipped to the back of a row and pulled out the LAST ONE! For those who are Peter Criss fans they announce his birthday toward the end of the Largo bonus concert, after God Of Thunder. Nice tribute to the Cat-man. Not sure why during \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\" that he adds \\"- mommy\\" during the song, but it's cute in a way. The bonus Largo concert features these 12 songs (including menu and chapter points):    I Stole Your Love  Ladies Room  Firehouse  Love Gun  Makin' Love  Christine Sixteen  I Want You  Calling Dr. Love  Shout It Out Loud  God Of Thunder  Rock And Roll All Nite (mommy!)  Black Diamond    I am impressed overall with this dvd set, but disappointed that \\"Rock Bottom\\", a favorite of mine from the Alive album, is not in here or in any of the 3 bonus discs. I'd be completely satisfied without any of the radio friendly heavy commercialized Rock And Roll All Nite songs for at least one Rock Bottom. While anxious to watch the other 2 bonus discs, I noticed more of the same songs on the track lists so I'll just be happy with this one. To answer a few other questions, yes this Wal-Mart exclusive came with a backstage replica and the cover has a silver sticker at the bottom which indicates the Largo bonus cd.

This collection is one of a kind...and if you don't own the other seasons than i would say to BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY.  <br /> <br />this box is the final product a show like ALIAS deserves...
B000089RVX|5.0|If you are an afficionado of powerful female vocalists (as I am), buy this CD.  Amy Lee is arguably the finest singer I have heard in years.  She conveys the full range of emotions genuinely and flawlessly.  Sure, some of the songs may be overplayed on the radio, but such is the fate of popular music.  This does not take away from the fact that \\"Bring Me to Life\\" is a very good song, as are most of the others on this CD.  \\"Going Under\\", \\"Hello\\" and \\"My Last Breath\\" are my personal favorite tracks, but all are very listenable.  Evanescence has been compared to The Cranberries, but, to my ears at least, they are far superior.  <br /> <br />Thoughtful lyrics, solid musicianship and Amy's soaring vocals make \\"Fallen\\" one of my favorite CDs.
1592400876|5.0|As an English major and former English teacher, \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" is one of the best books I've seen; the importance of punctuation toward meaning is clearly presented in a fun way.  I've gotten copies for grandchildren and friends children, and how I wish I'd written it!!  Grammar and punctuation are so necessary -- and so difficult to get students to get focused on.  This book pulls students in and makes the process truly a learning experience rather than a chore to get done.  Bravo!
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Nitpickers can go and jump off a bridge...this is what the Kiss Army members have been waiting for, for over 20 years. The most jaded Kiss \\"fans\\" here may tell you they are not happy with the video quality, but please don't listen-they've spent too many wasted hours and money on bootleg video since 1987, to have any clear perspective. Simply put-this DVD set is everything you could want on the \\"Classic 70's Era\\" of KISS. From rare live clips to obscure TV appearances, to full-length concerts, KISSOLOGY rocks like a ton of bricks. The gigs range from a legendary performace at the Winterland Ballroom, in San Francisco, from January of 1975, when Kiss was still an opening band, to full-tilt KISS-Mania shows like Cobo Hall '76 in Detroit, and The Budokan in Tokyo, Japan '77. Other random highlights include a mini documentary on Kiss' 2 day assault of Cadillac, Michigan and their High School Football Team, and Kiss on the Paul Lynde Halloween Special from 1976. There is really too much killer stuff here to go thru in this review, but as a KISS fan since 1978, I ask you to trust me on this-if you love 70's KISS, and you've been waiting for them to release vintage live, and rare footage from the vaults, you WILL love this. The picture quality of these concerts range from just decent, to Excellent, and the performances are all high energy, full throttle Kiss at their peak. It's all about the high energy vibe. If you're so stuck on \\"oh, this isn't perfect video quality like Led Zep's dvd\\" then go ahead and split hairs or whine. If you like to Rock and Roll All Nite and par-tay every day, then Kissology will satisfy.   Go out to Wal-Mart and get it, that version contains an exclusive bonus disc of the band live at the Capitol Centre in Largo, MD. This disc is a high quality show and performance from the 1977 \\"Alive II\\" tour, when Kiss was the biggest band in the world.        This is the best \\"product\\" Kiss has released in 25 years. Looking forward to Volumes 2 and 3.    5 stars, easy.
B0000009RT|5.0|Carefull with your brain ...we definitly need a brain police incrusted to listen to that great album!!! The Return Of The Son Of Monster Magnet is i think the best crackpot song i never heard... after 30 years it's still <br />give me the shriver.
B000I2J5UG|1.0|they are the biggest posers in the music business...don't waste your time. emo music should die!
B000000WCA|4.0|I remember being very young when this came out . I was only 10 or 11 years old , yet I was addicted to their sound , and having an younger sister she got me into it. This album makes you want to dance , whether it be in the car or in your living room , it has a great vibe to it . I was at a Halloween party over the weekend and i noticed that 5 girls were dressed as them , and they were truly obesssed with them , it was like that they were still popular today , even though the band has broken up and hasn't had a song together since 2000. It just goes to show how popular they really were . After seeing the girls dressed up ,the next day I popped in the album . It was great , It was like old times again . My favorite song on the Album is probably \\" 2 Become 1\\" , I loved the video for it , and it's just a really good song . All of the girls look great in the video . Rumor has it the Spice Girls are planning some kind of a reuinion , either a show or something , hopefully it's true , and I can't believe it'll be almost ten years since this album was released !
B00004SST6|5.0|Buy this album, it is timeless and the songs will remind you of why he is the best.
B000002UY5|3.0|Nothing special here aside from the song \\"No Rain\\", but it's still a pretty good album. Decent rock form a decent band.

B0002234LS|5.0|Johnny Depp did a terrific job. This movie is a great thriller for those who like psychological type suspense movies. Would highly recommend if you are a Johnny Depp fan! :-)
B00005JMX6|5.0|This movie is a great success.<br /><br />It's about a girl who is a famous porn star and she lives next door to the student's house.<br /><br />I think this is the dream of many men, to have a porn star living near you and<br /><br />to fell in love with her.<br /><br />This movie will change your way of think about<br /><br />porn stars and the adult movies.<br /><br />Fantastic!
B0002TKFR2|4.0|I have been very happy to be able to acquire these new processings of the original Living Stereo master tapes that Soundmirror, Inc., is producing from the master tapes of RCA's Living Stereo series. <br /> <br />To be able to hear the original performances just as they were recoded thirty to forty years ago is amazing. The DSD processing enables you to return to these important performances. <br /> <br />I am very impressed by the work Soundmirror is doing and I highly  recommend these recordings to anyone interested in these early performances.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|If you are the kind of Meatloaf addict that wore out multiple copies of Bat I be prepared. Call in sick, turn off the cell phone, sound proof the walls and experience the magic the hooked you in the first place. Bat III offers all the passion, pain, and raw talent that made Bat I soar to the top of the charts. If you don't know who Meatloaf is, stagger out from under your rock, sit down and strap yourself in, cuz you are in for the ride of your life. This CD is not just straight fireworks, it's one grand finale after another. The drawback to this CD? It's impossible to choose a favorite cut-they're all that good. It's rock all grown up and just as good.
0596007124|5.0|I did investigate several design patterns book in java and also the GoF Book.This book is clearly the far best among all.The text is fun and the examples are clear and coinsise,all topic are discusses and all questions are cleared.<br /><br />I strongly recomment this book to anyone interested in DP topic,especially with java background.
B00005MP58|5.0|Sorry, Keira, this is the version that really does justice to Pride and Prejudice.  Beatifully acted and directed, the characters are fully developed and as recognizable in the modern day world as they were when Jane Austen created them.
0201633612|3.0|Although this book initiated the now-famous design patterns phenemon,I think we have better alternatives these days.The book has sample codes in C++.<br /><br />I personally liked Head First Design Patterns.
B000003NA4|5.0|Diana Krall is the singer's Singer. Plain and simple. More than this, however, the Lady knows her way around the 88's, and puts together the best vocal and piano work since Jeri Southern. Of course Diana Krall is her own singer, but she brings up memories of the likes of Miss Southern, Julie London, April Stevens, and many other Greats from the past. Many of them are gone; we are SO lucky we have Diana Krall. This CD is among her Finest! If YOU like the Best, buy it and treat yourself to a true Artist in every sense of the word!
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Is it any wonder why the first 2 Bat Out of Hell Albums have sold 36 and 15 million each respectively and still counting. This is easily the best of the three. A lot has been made that Meat's voice is shot. Nothing could be further from the truth. He is in great form. Marion Raven is tremondous in her debut. Bat Out of Hell 3 will go down as a fitting end to the best rock triliogy of all time.
B00006FM77|5.0|When I was 13 I had an album collection consisting of Zeppellin, Sabbath, Cooper, Cream, Beethovin, Bach and the brand-new Chicago at Carnegie Hall.  I haven't heard this album in 20 years (since my last record player gave up the ghost and I switched to cd's and electronic formats) and my wife surprised me last night with this 4 cd set.  WOW!  This is how live music should be performed.  For those out there who actually LIKE live music to sound just like the studio version this isn't for you.  But if you want to hear what a late 60's era hard-working touring band sounded like night after night when mainstream audiences cared about musicianship and composition without the \\"repairing\\" of such recordings by later studio work...then this set is an excellent example.  This has got to be on anyone's list of top ten live rock albums.  I recommend a strong buy!
0131103628|5.0|I bought this as my first C programming book a few years ago. If I would have written a review back then, I would have given this book 3 stars. It assumes that the reader has some programming knowledge as well as a fundamental understanding of how computers work. <br />After reading another C programming book and following up with this one, I have a much better understanding of C programming practices and exactly what is going on, how certain syntax is more hardware-friendly than others, etc. <br />I would recommend reading Stephen Kochan's \\"Programming in C\\" and following up with K&R's book. Make sure to try some of the examples, the best way to learn is by practicing.
B0002XDODU|3.0|Not sure if that makes sense, but as good as their previous albums were, most of the songs were either slow or driving. Reise, Reise represents a progression of the band in my eyes. The songs here linger more and arent quite as driving, but are less strained and more colorful. I have to admit missing the driving nature of Rammstein songs that was prevalent on the Mutter album. Ich Will on the Mutter album simply rocked, the best 'driving' Rammstein song in my opinion. Its easy to dismiss the Reise, Reise album because theres no song like Ich Will on it. I think thats unfair to the album however.   I have to admit at first listen I underestimated this album and considered it inferior to Mutter. But as I continue to listen to it, I think this album has the most A grade songs on it of any Rammstein album to date.   I would rate it 5 stars now, a definitive buy for Rammstein fans.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This cd collection was excellent.  I really enjoyed all the extra scenes and bonus features.  I would highly recommend this product!!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I've loved Sarah since I first heard \\"Sweet Surrender\\" for the first time.  Then I went out and bought her older stuff as well as new.  I dont even listen to Christmas music, but Sarah turns it into something else, into her.  Its so beautiful, especially the title track.  I would suggest everyone get this album, I dont think Sarah could ever dissapoint me.  I mean I get irritated that she takes so long to do albums, but they are so worth the wait, dont wait to get this one.
B000HEWEJO|3.0|I just received this DVD from Amazon and was looking forward to the Colorized version from Republic Pictures.  I saw the colorized version on Lifetime Network several years ago (the Republic Pictures version) and it was very well done.  The previous version out of video was poor.  So, when seeing the description as color, and noting it's a Republic Pictures print, I thought it was FINALLY being released on DVD.  Disappointed and returning to Amazon....
B000784WMW|4.0|i couldn't resist putting in my two cents (or pence) here although many others have already shared their feelings on this adaptation.    first off, i have to say that the length of this production and the attention to detailed accounts only surpassed by reading the book itself are a huge driving force and makes this adaptation so wonderful. the story is too long to fit into the typical length feature, so thankfully this production runs at 311 minutes long. the thrill of the chase and the conversations between jane and edward are critical. in other adaptations,  they're always cut out or shortened so that their passion and their struggles lack that strong foundation.     i must say that dalton's performance really impressed me. if he wasn't tall and handsome, he would have been physically perfect. i thought his acting was superb, and probably saved this adaptation from mediocrity. (note: i loved ciaran hinds as mr. rochester in the 1997 adaptation, but the movie was too short to encompass everything.)     zelah clarke is not my favorite jane eyre (samantha morton from 1997 feels the perfect jane, to me). physically she might be a little old looking for jane, but she is tiny which is accurate to the book. clarke's eyre was just 'ok' and dalton's rochester was perfect. not sure if this is a result of him being a better actor, or just that this was the way she interpreted the character of jane eyre. in any event, she is satisfactory.    the embraces they share are not as perfect as i'd like them to be. something is a bit off- cant put my finger on it- but again, its satisfactory.     a word on the lighting. it is really awful, no doubt. someone else here mentioned the old tv program \\"dark shadows\\" and/or bad soap opera lighting. i agree. its unfortunate but if you're a real bronte fan, you will get around it for the performance value.     when i first saw the movie, the child cast seemed for the most part amateurs. between this and the sets and lighting, i was laughinga bit at the low quality. however, i persisted and i'm glad i did. to my surprise, i wound up really getting caught up in it after she gets to thornfield. now i can't get enough of it, especially the key scenes between jane and edward.    it was refreshing to see such detailed accounts of what happens to jane when she leaves rochester. the guy who played mr. rivers was terrific.     i felt the ending was a little anticlimactic, which is disappointing. i feel that when she finally agreed to marry him, after all they had been through, it should have been a more passionate scene. (again, as in that same scene in the ciaran hinds/samantha morton adaptation, which felt like it met the more appropriate height of passion).    so not perfect, but still very enjoyable and follows the book more closely than any other movie so far. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT DESPITE IT'S FAULTS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN OF THE ORIGINAL STORY.    i have heard that bbc just put out another jane eyre miniseries this year but i've not seen it. not on dvd yet.
B000001ELR|5.0|Powerful statement from the band. This is rock at its finest. I saw them on this tour and boy were they awesome. Unfortunately, after this album, things started to go sour.
B00030590I|5.0|Great story.  Great actors.  Beautiful scenery and colors.  My favorite movie.
B000001ELP|5.0|I love this CD. I guess it is the whole package, the mystery, and the great songs. The music proves the excellent musicianship-something I used to argue all the time. Eric Carr is a tremendous drummer. Ezrin really understood Kiss. (Destroyer and The Elder are tremendous;Revenge stinks)
B000GTJT16|5.0|This movie, much like many of Tim Burton's movies, are not for everyone.  If you like the movies Beetlejuice, Batman, Nightmare Before Christmas, or Corpse Bride, then you will probably not be thrown off by Tim's unique style.  This movie is every bit as atmospheric (and wierd, some might say) as any of the above mentioned movies.  Personally, I love his movies (hence the 5 star rating) and think that this is one of the best! <br /> <br />There is a great cast here, and Johnny Depp, in particular, shines in a role that seems made for him. <br /> <br />The palpable textures and ambiance make this movie really stand out on HD-DVD!  If you like Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and have an HD-DVD player then run and buy this NOW!
0446615625|4.0|While The Camel Club is certainly not the best David Baldacci book I've read, it does offer well-crafted, entertaining escapist fiction.  (For those who are interested, I think his best novel is The Winner, a story about a conspiracy to cheat a state lottery, which everyone who enjoys suspense yarns should make it a point to read.)<br /><br />But back to The Camel Club:  There are a couple of incidents toward the end of the novel that seem implausible, which is too bad because the plot is quite strong up until that point. Overall, however, the story engages the reader and reflects the current public awareness of terrorism and domestic security.<br /><br />The characters are well drawn, and I especially liked the fact that the female characters are all strong women who don't rely on the men to do their thinking.  The members of the Camel Club -- Caleb, Milton, Reuben and the leader Oliver -- are terrific characters who are likable and who the reader can root for unconditionally.  Milton, who suffers from OCD, is particularly endearing, and Baldacci gets a lot of humor from his situation, but does so in a way that is affectionate rather than offensive or cruel.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very entertaining read that holds the attention of an intelligent reader and makes you want to keep turning the pages late into the evening.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This film was absolutely beautiful because of the location in which it was shot and the main characters.  However, its true appeal comes from the manner in which it portrays the desperation that comes from living a life which is less than truthful, the struggles involved in being true to oneself despite the consequences, and the difficulties that sometime occur when trying to figure out what is really important to your soul.  Although I have recommended this film to several people, I caution them that it can be pretty disturbing.  I thought about it for weeks after I saw it the first time, and it took me a while to get up the nerve to watch it again.  Definitely not a \\"light hearted\\" evening of entertainment!
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|You remaster it brillantly(by the great Bob Ludwig),you add a slew of great single b-sides(Ride Into The Sun,I Wanna Be Your Hero,a stronger take of Tear It Down)live b-sides(Billy's Got A Gun,Women,Love And Affection plus a cover of Alice Cooper's Elected and a Rock Of Ages medley feturing My Generation,Come Together and Whole Lotta Love among others)and remixes of the album's biggest hits like Pour Some Sugar On Me and Animal,package it with a cool,informative 30-page booket loaded with great photos,mereoabilia(sic)and a nice essay n' interview by David Fricke with members of the band about the challenges and personal tradegies it acountered when working on this follow-up to the 1983 blockbuster Pyromania.Since this was the soundtrack of my youth(I was 12),it's wonderful to have an essential part of it given a hero's treatment.Thanks,Universal!
B000J10ERO|3.0|I don't understand the big hoopla over this movie.  I know many that don't care for it, some even hate it and  some thought it could have been much better. But I do know that it is loved as well. I (as well as many others) went in to it with the knowledge that it took place right after 'Superman II' however 'Superman Returns' contradicts as well as repeats much of the previous 2 films. Lois Lane discovers she has a child with not only superhuman powers but with the revelation that he may be conceived from Superman and never once questions it. (As you may recall, she had an intimate scene with Superman in part II, but her memeory of the event was erased).  <br />Also, Superman returns after a 5 year absence and so does Clark Kent coincidentally enough.  Lois never assumes Superman has been hurt or captured during his disappearance but instead becomes extremely bitter and angry. <br />I thought the performances of Lois Lane as well as Perry White were very bland and unmemorable.  Brandon Routh was a good choice for the role but the writers gave him no new material.  He repeated lines from previous films and at many points shrunk to a seconary character hardly saying a word.  The movie has much more of a serious tone than the first two, so there are no memorable lines as in 'Superman II' where Christopher Reeve stated \\"General, care to step outside?\\" <br /> <br />The movie had me all the way up to the Airplane rescue and then I felt went downhill from there.  Superman did not get the chance of any retribution or justice after Lex Luthor's attack. He had no good fight scenes. <br />With all this, there are some things that I enjoyed.  I like how they continued the story of Lex going back to the Fortress of Solitude to get the crystal to continue his property scam.  It makes total sense. And of course, the special FX were incredible. Not much more positive for me. <br /> <br />I hope you get to enjoy it much more than I did because I viewed it twice to give it another chance which helped a little, but not enough.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000A59PMO|5.0|My mother had been talking about this show for a long time and I never got a chance to watch it until this past August when a friend popped in the pilot episode on DVD.  Let me tell you that we did not stop until we watched the whole series.  Extremely funny, clever, suspensful and enough twist and turns to get you to crave the next episode.  And trust me, especially for this season, the end is a COMPLETE SHOCK.  I'm usually pretty good at guessing the \\"who done its\\" but this was a huge, and pleasant surprise.  I don't think I blinked during that last episode. <br /> <br />So, please, buy this DVD even if you've never caught an episode, and get the second season too.  This show, in an era of crappy TV programs, is golden.
0609610570|5.0|Great read and very informative. Suggest it for all leaders!
630542845X|5.0|Great movie.   Its a little old school as far as acting and cast, but great film.   This film does NOT express any homoeroticism in it, but just true care for human beings.   The religious undertows are awesome, and the paranormal wonder is so cool.   I highly recommend this film!
B000002LFZ|5.0|Every one of Fleetwood Mac's songs are timeless and brilliant but if you just had to put all their best on one CD, this is the one.  All their hits and most widely known songs are here... Go Your Own Way, Gypsy, Say That You Love Me, Tusk, on and on.  My only disappointment was that Beautiful Child was not included.  I wish one of the last songs had been skipped for inclusion and Beautiful Child had been put in its place.  The CD starts with 70's hits and moves forward into the 80's.  Without a doubt, it's one of my favorite CD's and is always in my car!
0399243631|2.0|This is a cute story, but my 16-mo-old had the flaps ripped off three of the pages LITERALLY within 10 minutes after introducing this book. Even tho it is a board-book construction, the flaps are only paper and not built to last. With so many other titles to choose from, why bother?
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Star Wars Empowers Women <br />   The civil rights movement in 1960s America gave new voices to unheard minorities, and the 1970s looked like it would be a decade that ushered in new equality for women too.  The ERA was a hot topic, and the second half of the decade featured a strong leading lady in one of the most popular movies of all time.  The movie was Star Wars, and the leading lady was Princess Leia.   <br />   Princess Leia was symbolic of the new feelings of empowerment many women were starting to realize.  The movie begins with Leia being questioned by the threatening Lord Vader, but she does not shrink back in fear as actresses in old-time movies did.  She stands her ground instead.  She famously uttered the line, \\"I thought I recognized your foul stench\\" to the most powerful men in the movie. <br />   And when in the presence of good guys (Luke and Han) she boldy takes charge, blasting a hole in the walls of the detention center so that they could escape the imperial troopers.  Not only was she strong-willed, she was also portrayed to be strong-minded, instantly recognizing that Han's Falcon escaped from the Death Star only because they were allowed to.  While Han denied it was possible, Leia knew that the empire was tracking them back to the rebel base. <br />   I give Star Wars 5 stars because I'm always finding more things I like about it the more I watch it.  So much happens in such a short amount of movie-time, and the strong role Leia played is an excellent example of contemporary cultural values influencing dramatic cinematography. <br />Reviewed by: Adam Platts <br />
B00065MDSG|4.0|Fine musicianship and expansive dynamics abound. However, this album is marred by John Wetton's horrendously off key and whiny singing. Exiles makes for particularly excruciating listening.
0743289412|5.0|No need to ramble on: this, indeed, is one of King's best books. He wrote some stinkers during his time, but some great ones. The Stand, It, The Dark Tower series. But this novel here, we get to see directly into his mind.    I point you to page 212. About halfway down the page: \\"He is eating a dirt sandwich. (It's a big one I caught in the pool where we all go down to drink and fish.)\\" By that he means the language pool, and in that quote is one of the only 1st person lines in the book. King's talking.    He makes me and, I'm sure, many others out there want to continue writing. He's passing the torch!    Give it a read.
0767812166|5.0|This is one of our favoite movies and it is just what I wanted
0767903862|5.0|I have to admit it, I'm a huge Bill Bryson fan. I've read and enjoyed all his books, some more some less but even his \\"weaker\\" books were well worth reading. <br /> <br />I've read this book in its UK form as \\"Down Under\\" and have to say it is my favorite of Bryson's books! It is funny, thought provoking, intelligent, and interesting all the way through. Bryson has a way of telling historical fact and making it interesting and here it shines. <br /> <br />A little tale of how I discovered this book: I was traveling through New Zealand and Australia for about a year. During my travels, backpackers (as low budget travelers are known) usually trade books between them. You pick up a book, you read it, you trade it for a different one from another backpacker. And so it goes. However, there was one particular book that many backpackers had in their possession and did not care to trade for any cost, it was indeed \\"Down Under\\" which I had to purchase for myself. Considering all the hype and praise fellow backpackers were giving it, I had no choice. It was a fantastic read full of relevant information. Afterwards, I too did not wish to trade it and it's sitting proudly on my bookshelf today, with red sand stains from the Australian Outback - a reminder to where the book was at! <br /> <br />In short, get this book, read it, enjoy it.
0345440900|5.0|This was the best book that I read when I was pregnaent.  There are lots of book out there, but this one helped get you on the baby's perspective.  I recommend this book to all my friends!!!
0060899190|4.0|Although some of the material was a bit depressing/disturbing, I liked the concept of the postcard collection. A nice addition to the casual, coffee table, conversation starting collection.
B0006399FS|2.0|Well, I'm less than impressed upon wrapping up a listen to this album.  While it has a few standout tracks among the 11 provided, for the most part they are all mediocre.  I was never a fan of `Vertigo' but I am a fan of U2 so I opted to give the entire CD a listen, and while the remaining singles `City of Blinding Lights' and `Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own' are classic U2 and wonderful listens, songs like `Original of the Species' and `Love and Peace of Else' really bring down the value of the CD.  Some of these tracks serve their purpose.  `Miracle Drug' quickly redeems the album after the dreadful opener `Vertigo' but `Love and Peace of Else' and `All Because of You' quickly knock it back down, and while `A Man and a Woman' struggles to be ballad worthy the following four tracks end the album in complete turmoil.  `Yahweh' has Bono coming off as an out of tune karaoke refugee and ends the album on such a sour note I'm almost forced to swear if off forever, but I won't do that, because they're U2 and on name alone they were saved, this time.
B0000683DH|5.0|Movie viewers interested in watching an intelligent space adventure must take a chance with \\"Khan.\\" (Do not worry about being labeled a 'Trekkie.' Those steriotypical, dateless recluses who, at age 36, live with their mothers don't exist anymore, like they did in the 80's; welfare reform got passed in the 90's.) <br /> <br />Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\" is the \\"Star Wars: Episode IV\\" of the Star Trek saga. Like the original Star Wars movie, \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" was made with a very tight budget. But low budgets inspired director Nicholas Myers to make a superior space opera, like George Lucas did in 1977. Much like the first Star Wars movie, the characters in Star Trek II are well developed, and the special effects are superb!  <br /> <br />After watching this special 2 Disc set, movie viewers can appreciate why Director Nicholas Myers should be knighted 'Father of Modern Star Trek.' His influence on this movie's dynamic spaceship battles, uniforms, and navy-style culture set a successful precedent for the proceeding movies (III, IV, V, VI, Generations, First Contact, Insurrection, Nemesis) and many TV shows (Next Generation, Deep Space 9, Voyager, Enterprise). With these DVDs movie goers will appreciate how Myers bailed out the franchise in the early 1980's, after it vomited out the unimaginative nightmare, \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture.\\" <br /> <br />The Wrath of Khan is not just a dramatic tale about two spaceships battling each other. It is about personable characters fighting an underdog war. Kirk, the cowboy hero, captains an Enterprise crew of young, inexperienced trainees against a genetically superior enemy, Khan. Not only are Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and Scotty caught off-guard, but their merciless enemy is armed with a doomsday weapon. This adventure is full of depth, epitomized by the heroic, \\"logical\\" sacrafice by a beloved, Star Trek character. <br /> <br />After adding \\"Khan\\" to your DVD collection, you can enjoy investing in these other quality Star Trek movies that are second and third in the Genesis Trilogy: <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\\" <br />\\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\" <br /> <br />To watch an adventurous conclusion for the original cast, please get: <br />\\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.\\" (also directed by Nicholas Myers!) <br /> <br />BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! For another great Star Trek trilogy in the 10 move saga, watch: <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek: First Contact\\" (a.k.a. 'Picard and Data vs. the Borg') <br />\\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\" (a.k.a 'Picard and Data vs. Aliens with Wrinkle Problems') <br />\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" (a.k.a. 'Attack of the Picard and Data Clones') <br /> <br />                   WORDS OF ENTERTAINMENT CAUTION! <br />1. Remember to never ruin your positive view of Star Trek movies by watching \\"The Motion Picture.\\"  <br />2. Don't bother with \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\" (a.k.a. 'The Search for God.') It is unimaginative, only slightly better than the first motion picture. <br />3. Don't bother with \\"Star Trek Generations,\\" either. It ranks as a made-for-TV movie <br /> <br />--Live long and Prosper! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0743454537|5.0|I love how Picoult uses multiple points of view so that the reader can feel the emotion from every angle. This story is particulary good because the ending. I can't wait to read more by this author!
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Seven Samurai is really the greatest story ever told!  I won't go into why here because there are plenty of reviewers both here and elsewhere on the internet who do a much better job than I ever could. This brand new Criterion reissue that improves on the older one in every way so you have no excuse not to buy it right now.
B000I5Y8ZU|3.0|I'm not the biggest MCR fan, but I did like some songs off of the previous cd. I think this cd is pretty good. I like the concept the band walks us through. I must admit, I actually like the Black Parade video more than I like the song, the imagery is just beautiful. Dramatic stuff, but I like dramatic, so it's all good. I like Mama a great deal, but over-all I don't like every song on this record. That's okay as well, because I didn't like every song on Three Cheers either.  However, I do like this band, even if I don't like everything they write, I do see what great musicians they are. I just think they are solid and they rock-- and there's nothing wrong with that!
B000I5YCCO|5.0|taylor swift is an amazing artist considering she's only 16 years old. the best part is that she writes about things that are relevant to her unlike some other young artists who write about finding true love and things that they probably do not actually know about. <br />a must have!
B00006AW2E|5.0|After living with the US version for many years I thrilled when I found out that the original UK version would be released on SACD. Now with the sonic/proto punk onslaught of \\"She Said, Yeah\\" replacing \\"Mercy, Mercy\\" as that opening track we have a more complete sounding album than it's US counterpart. Also, taking out the hit singles like \\"Satisfaction\\" and  \\"Last Time\\" keeps it flowing with any abrupt interruptions and allows other \\"filler\\" tracks like \\"Cry To Me\\" & \\"Hitch Hike\\" to be framed in a whole new context. <br /> <br />The sound is in glorious mono and is better for it. No off-putting, sparse mid-sixties mix with the drums on the left channel and guitars on the right, just a centred, tough sounding monophonic mix. The main different between the SACD layer and conventional CD is the bass. The bottom end on the SACD is much louder and fuller. Also the dynamics of the guitars have a bit detail in them, so they cut like switchblades on \\"She Said, Yeah\\" (like Richards would have wanted them too). Although most people may be put off by the tape hiss/distortion and occasional murkiness of the recording, this is the best we're going to hear these masters without being sabotaged by \\"modern\\" mastering techniques with older albums such as over compression and boosted top ends. Absolutely recommend.
B00008MLSH|5.0|Perhaps her voice is not as candid as some other sopranos, but her rendition of the score and interpretative expression make her and exquisite hearing pleasure. This recording shows a more matured artist capable of capturing the role dynamics and emotions.  <br /> <br />Yes, her voice is not as lyric as you might expect, and some roles may sound a little big heavy (sometimes maybe bordering verismo), but definitively at stated before hearing her is a gloriuos pleasure, almost as good as looking at her.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Finally, Sarah McLachlan has put out a Christmas album! Her voice is practically made for singing these songs. I love her arrangement of the music, especially on \\"Greensleeves\\" and \\"The First Noel\\" and her rendition of \\"River\\" is absolutely beautiful. I've never cared for the song \\"Happy X-mas\\", but her version almost makes me change my mind. This album is very well done and I can't imagine any fan of her music being disappointed. My only wish is that she had written more of the songs herself as she is such a talented songwriter.
B0009353IW|5.0|The songs, lyrics and beat is really good. I liked the variety of music and fun to listen too.
B000003FD9|4.0|Listening to these readings of the Bach solo Cello suites, I was reminded of Herbert von Karajan's 1960's recordings of the Beethoven symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic.  That was \\"big\\" Beethoven, just as Starker's performances here are \\"big\\" Bach: tempos are taken rather slow (except in the especially lively, dance-like movements, which are played at a good clip) and long, arching, legato lines are drawn out of the scores.  Everything is lush and broad and expansive; rich, resonant, and very modern instrumental sonorities are perhaps the centerpiece of this opulent, mid-century style of playing.  (This album was in fact recorded in '92, late in the century, but it was Starker's fifth and last recording of these works, made in his old age.  His aesthetic ethos is unmistakably that of the middle 20th century, the formative time of his youth.) <br /> <br />The wonderful thing about listening to different interpretations of these works is, they are just that: very different interpretations.  Each great player to approach them brings such a different style and expression out of them than the next does.  If I had to choose, I suppose I would take Pierre Fournier's readings as my first choice; but I am quite fond of almost all of the different interpretations of these works that I know, and so I heartily recommend this disc if you are considering it.
B000FVQYZY|5.0|This limited edition of one of 2006'best albums is worth every penny. The extra DVD (a live show) is quality. Nice editing (it looks like a show, not like a MTV music video),no stupid sound compression (what is supposed to be loud, is loud) and the song lineup is great. If you like Muse, get this one with no hesitation. If you don't know Muse, it's the perfect time for you to discover an amazing band!
B00005K3NR|2.0|Maybe I didn't really get this film for what it's supposed to be, but if you watch this movie expecting to see a horror film you'll come off somewhat disappointed. I'm sure it's another one of those movies that's much better as a book because as a movie it's just plain weird. It doesn't really make any sense, it just starts off with a bullied nerdy girl who then gets asked to the prom out of pity. You get about 3/4s of the way thru the movie wondering when the horror theme actually starts, almost as if it's a regular teen movie that they couldn't figure out how to end. Anyway a horrible prank is played on her at the prom with a bucket of pigs blood, she gets angry and burns the whole place down with everyone in it using her mind powers. She then goes home to her nutcase mother who tries to kill her because shes thinks Carrie is the spawn of satan or something. Using her powers she then makes knives and other kitchen utensils go flying into her mother. As Carrie is dying from being stabbed the house falls down, and the movie is over lol It's probably one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen! It just doesn't make any logical sense, but maybe that's the idea?! But to have Travolta listed on the cover is just stuntcasting, he's in it for all of 20 minutes. Overall this movie is fairly lame, I dont really understand why it gets so many stars by other reviewers. I guess because it's old and Steven Kings first book to movie people rate it for that alone, but it really is a whacked out film that doesn't make a whole lot of sense and never really moves anywhere until the last 15 minutes of the picture.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I have been a big fan of the X-Men juggernaut from comic books to tv series. The first two X-Men films directed by Bryan Singer were surprisingly entertaining and captured the essence of the X-Men. Brett Ratner did not with the third X-Men film X3: The Last Stand. The general premise of the film revolves around a 'cure' for mutants created by Warren Worthington III's father. I couldn't help but draw comparison between this storyline with the ex-gay movement Exodus which claims to cure homosexuality. I think it would be difficult not to see this comparison between the Exodus movement and this cure to treat mutants and get rid of what humans perceived as to be a sickness. This 'cure' quickly stirs up strong emotions with Magneto and the Brotherhood as well as Charles Xavier and his X-Men, especially Storm, and eventually the two sides has one last final showdown.<br /><br />I admit I was pretty much entertained by the film but it was all flash and not a lot of substance. While I appreciated the fact that the screenwriters incorporated glimpses of the dark phoenix storyline where Jean Grey comes back to life but as a darker, more powerful character but for the most part the writing was mediocre at best. The writers totally veered away from the heart and soul of the comic book series. I didn't like seeing a few of the major characters be written off so quickly. The dialogue was extremely cheesy, more so than the previous X-Men films.<br /><br />What I did like was seeing a bit more of Colossus, one of my favorite X-Men characters (although not enough), more screen time for Halle Berry as Storm, the opening sequence where the young students are in danger room being trained in combat, and the special effects. Overall I was sorely disappointed. This is not the way I wanted this series to end.
0446528056|5.0|I bought this book the day it came out, as I always do with his novels.  I have liked all of his books, but this one I LOVE!  This story will get right to your heart and make it melt.  The characters seem so real, like you actually knew them.  If you want a good love story (different from a romance novel because a love story always has tragedy in it), then I highly recommend this book for you.  Wow - this is definitely a book I will read again and again as the years go by.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|There's not much to say except that I LOVED it! I've wanted to see this for some time and I wasn't disappointed. If you like musicals you'll like this.
B000IOM0YM|1.0|I've seen better quality from a flea market.  Remastered?  Crap.  Led Zep's stuff is older, and the quality came out tons better.  My portable AM/FM radio sounds better than this.  Money wasted...
0375505091|1.0|It was mostly about her family and they are not that interesting.
B000002VCU|4.0|This 1980 album makes for a very pleasant listening experience and nicely balances dreamy synth heavy pop with the more symphonic approach demonstrated on albums like Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1976).  Come to think of it, I don't feel that there are any weak moments - the album is well-paced and the pieces all work together.  The tracks on The Turn of a Friendly Card range from the excellent, Pink Floydish sounding and moody song Time (with excellent vocals by Eric Woolfson) to the lengthy, multi-movement, The Turn of a Friendly Card suite.  There is also an instrumental on this album (The Gold Bug) that is actually quite good.  In general, all of the pieces are very well written and played and the different vocalists work well with the tracks they were selected for.  There is also greater use of an orchestra on this album (especially on the title track) although perhaps not as heavy as the orchestra was used on Tales of Mystery and Imagination.  All in all, this is a great album of symphonic pop that is recommended along with Tales of Mystery and Imagination; I, Robot (1977); and Pyramid (1978).
B000FKO0Q0|4.0|All right, so this HD-DVD is not home theater demo material.  It still easily surpasses the standard edition upon side by side comparisons.  Yes, there are still some scenes that look like standard DVD, but for the most part, you can see Harrison's beard more clearly as well as many other details.  Perhaps this is a testament to the movie itself...the story is so good you don't simply sit there and marvel at the clarity!  Until another edition comes along to best this latest one ( and you know one will), then this is the one to buy!
0800141660|1.0|Simply put, I didn't like it. Emma Thompson was too old to play a 19 year old. Not only did the movie leave out a/o change alot of what was written in the book the movie left out a/o changed the characters. So, once again I must say, I didn't like it...
B000GFLEAY|5.0|I am a sucker for this type of movie and the HD presentation captures EVERYTHING in wonderful detail...moreso than the regular DVD presentation which was a pretty good looking DVD on its own.  But this edition brings out all the finer details such as the manes blowing in the wind, the clothing fabrics, facial skin features...I could go on, but you get the idea.  It tops all other video presentations of this fine movie...definitely the version to get if you own a HD-DVD machine.
B00005O3VC|5.0|All Monty Python movies are a must-see. I think my generation has seen them all. I hope the younger generation (less than 40) watch at least one. The humor is at many levels, so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in. This just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing. Like all good humor, it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general, as well as, politics and religion (without getting nasty).
B000HT3Q14|5.0|Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys throws a LOT of detail at you almost incessantly.  With this HD presentation, you can finally see ALL of those details clearly.  Gilliam's love of wide angle lenses make for a wide and slightly distorted visual experience.  I applaud Universal on this edition as it is nice and sharp.  I catch new things with each new viewing.  The sound is also quite a ride.
0786890762|4.0|Revives the argument for the existance of soulmates.  There is a significant spinning of plot complications...near misses and misunderstandings do make you look at the halfway point and say what ELSE could possibly keep them apart?  Though it is handled with a deft touch that does stay grounded in the delicate balance between male and female friends.  XOXO it.  I stayed up late to reach the satisfying conclusion.
B000G8P1VE|5.0|Okay, most people realize that 35mm film stock from the 1970s was really rotten, much of it is already fading.  So it stands to reason that most movies shot in the 1970s will not fare as well on HD-DVD as newly filmed movies.  Animal House is no exception.  Universal has done about as well as could be expected with this classic.  It has more detail than the standard edition in my side by side comparison.  Dean Wormer's face is almost too clear!  There is not much difference in the sound.  All of the extras from the previous special edition are here AND you even get the movie in standard DVD on the reverse of the HD side.  All in all this is a wonderful presentation.  If you come to view this HD-DVD, just remember that the 1970s were NOT the golden years for 35mm film stock.  Just be glad that this HD-DVD looks as good as it does.
B000B894AI|5.0|After reading Stuart Woods, Andrew Greeley/Nelson Demille, what does one expect from the creator of 10 Top, New-York Times No.1 best sellers. After years of being away from David Baldacci, I can say,\\"I'm glad to be back at home!\\" Even though switching-off to Iris Johansen, I still was compelled to finish the Split Second, first!  <br /> <br />The story takes fascinating twists & turns through rapidly moving stages and intriguing personalities, as Secret Agents in the CIA, FBI and Federal Witness Protection Program! Sean Ignatius King, Michelle Maxwell, Joan Dillenger are focused characters in swiftly moving tales of assassination, betrayal, kidnapping, murder and plots of careful planning to be objects of continued search over periods of Vetnamese and Watergate cover-ups! The areas covered are basically in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina.   <br /> <br />There were some familiar areas touched upon by Baldacci, that reminded me of being back home in East Tennessee and the Great Smoky Mountains! It is one superbly continual spinning-out of profoundly suspense-filled engrossing drama... At least 5 or 6 stars. Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
B000GTJT16|4.0|Yes, this was my first HD-DVD purchase and I thought it looked fabulous.  Eighteen HD-DVDs later and I am less enthusiastic about this one.  Yes it is much better than the standard presentation.  But Tim Burton films so much of this in dream-like foggy soft-focus that the presentation seems like a soft video transfer (however the sound is top notch!).  I still believe that a bit more sharpness could have been coaxed out of the original negative for this release, so this is why I give this gem of a movie 4 stars.
B00005QDW5|4.0|I'll start by saying I've never been a huge Floyd fan but have liked the music over the many years.. This being said, Echoes is a vastly enjoyable, though at times testy, anthology of Floyd. Note I say anthology, not hits. With the exception of a few singles like Money and Another Brick In The Wall Pt.2, they were the essential album rock band. The concept of the album as an entire piece was the focus. Therefore it's understandable that the majority of track flow into each other with no track breaks in between. One of the interesting highlights is Shine On You Crazy Diamond pts 1-7 which, unlike the bookends of being on \\"Wish You Were Here\\", have been put together as one track almost like a suite or tone poem. It's jarring at first, but then it seems to make sense after repeated listening. Like many collections, there are always questions of what was included (\\"Marooned\\" from The Division Bell? \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" from The Final Cut? Huh?) and what was left out (Where's \\"Not Now John\\" or the title track from \\"The Final Cut\\"?). But that still leaves about 90% of what any Floyd collection should have. And as usual, it's captured in brilliant remastering. Highly recommended for both the novice Floyd listener and veterans alike.
B000I0RR76|5.0|Yes this movie looks wonderful in High Definition.  Every detail comes through on the transfer, which is better than even the two disc high resolution remastered special edition.  On top of that, some of the extras are in HD.  The Looney Tunes in HD look AWESOME.  If you can, make this movie one of your first HD purchases.  Every classic motion picture should look this good in your home.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|Dream Theater have kept fans rockin' with hard crunching guitars, amazing drums and good vocals.  This show shows all of that and the softer side of Dream Theater with the added strings.  This is a good show but in my opinion live at Budokan is much better.  In my opinion the best part of a Dream Theater show is the instrumentals that they have during most of their songs which allow for creative expression during a concert.  These get lost in this show due to the orchestra but the songs themselves are done well.  If you're looking for a good show from Dream Theater I'd recommend you get Live at Budokan.  If you already have it or you're looking for something different from their norm this is a good show for you.
B000FA57NK|5.0|Universal is consistently releasing top quality HD releases and Apollo 13 is no exception.  The clarity is wonderful, the sound is full and powerful.  You already know the merits of the film.  So rest assured, this HD-DVD puts all home video releases of this film in the dust!
B000IOM0YM|1.0|just recieved my kissology today along with Shannons book <br />I can not believe some of the quality of the shows...awful,awful,awful <br />I am so disappointed I have got better quality from KISS conventions and Ebay <br />I won't be buying the other sets as I am sure my dvds are better <br />why can't we just get a new KISS album <br />I give it one star only because it came with a free reproduction pass <br />but like they say everyone has a opinion so read other peoples and judge for yourself
B000E5KJGQ|3.0|Yes, I was disappointed with this release.  Only on occasion does it surpass the standard edition, even with side by side comparisons.  The choice to letterbox the presentation, against Kubrick's intentions, does not jibe with the intent of HD, which is to give you the most accurate presentation of the film on a home video medium.  Hopefully Warner Home Video will revisit this title again in the future and give it the remastering it should have received.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's A Wonderful Life  begins in Heaven. Someone on Earth is about to commit suicide and needs urgent help. This man is George Bailey (James Stewart). He is a victim of  his business rival's dishonesty and he faces bankruptcy and jail. George is desperate, he wishes, he never was born. Many people pray for George. Their prayers have been heard and  Angel Clarence is sent to save him. On completion of this mission  Clarence will be honored with angel's wings. On Christmas Eve, George contemplates jumping from a bridge in the freezing waters of a river. That will kill him for sure but Clarence has a plan. He jumps first and George has no choice but to save him. Then Clarence decides to show George what would've  happen if he wasn't born in the first place. Not a pretty picture- too many people would have been affected in a bad way. This is when George Bailey realizes that life is a precious gift and it is wrong to throw it away.     It's A Wonderful Life is a deeply touching movie. There are dark moments when the tragedy evolves but the film is not depressing. It blends masterfully drama and humor, love, friendship and hatred  and its climax is the most memorable and inspirational ever! It's A  Wonderful Life ranks #1 on the American Film Institute's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time and it is truly THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FILM OF ALL TIME because it caries the most important message that WE WERE NOT BORN TO BE A FAILURE. The message is delivered by James Stewart, who was not only a brilliant actor but a living proof of the above- everything he did was success! George Bailey is one of Jimmy Stewart's finest performances. He is superb in portraying George's emotional roll-a-coaster: the enthusiasm  of a young, small-town guy, who wants to conquer the world; the strength of an industrious businessman fighting competitor, who doesn't play fair; the devotion of a loving son, brother, husband and father and the despair of a man, who has lost the battle and sees killing himself the only possible remedy.     Those who criticize the film simply waste their efforts. It's A Wonderful Life stood the test of the harshest of all critics-TIME! For 60 years it entertains, moves, inspires and it is the ultimate Christmas film of millions of people. Perhaps it would be better if the \\"critics\\" shut up and let us listen to the bells, that ring at the end of the movie to  celebrate LIFE- the greatest of all gifts!     The 60 Anniversary Edition is definitely Black&White copy and  thanks God for it, because this is how it should be! I do not believe that making it colorized will benefit the movie. You can not improve something that is perfect, why bother then? May be the \\"artists`s\\" next project will be colorizing Schindler's List?!  Why not, it is B&W?  Well, they should ask Steven Spielberg if he would be happy about it. I think, he shot his film B&W on purpose, and so did Frank Capra!
B000E5KJES|4.0|Everyone knows the movie, so which is the home video version to own?  The HD-DVD, of course, but only by a slim margin.  The differences between this HD edition and the standard edition are not quite the leap of other releases.  Yes, this movie does benefit from the higher resolution.  It just does not pop off the screen like so many other HD releases.  Perhaps it is not meant to shine as brightly when you consider the artistic intent of the cinematographer.  Still other HD editions of dark films such as Million Dollar Baby and (to a lesser extent) Ray, I still think that more could have been done from the encoding side to cring out more details.  Perhaps the length of the movie played a part...who knows.  In any case, my purpose is to review this edition.  Surely it is still the one to own, beating all other home video presentations to date.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The 10,000 days album starts with the song Vicarious which Rocks. The whole album is great. My favorite track is Rosetta Stoned. If you love Rock Music you should get this album. Maynard's voice is beautiful!
B000E5KJE8|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, fantastic acting, great story.  The HD-DVD completely does justice to both the aural and visual aspects of this motion picture.  The soundtrack is very lively and the image captures all the grain and oversaturation perfectly.  Highest marks on this HD-DVD.
0805047905|4.0|I guess I should have read the dimensions.  The book itself, especially in standard-sized hardcover is wonderful, but I was very disappointed with this books miniature size and the font used for the print.
B000H0MKGK|1.0|There is nothing lyrically inventive in his latest album, nor in his previous efforts to suggest the surprising Room for Squares and Inside wants out were nothing more than flukes.  Continuum plays pretty, like it belongs in an expensive mall t-shirt store and no where else.  So, it's fitting that my first listen was while sitting in a Starbucks.  This is ineffectual preppy music-like stuff.  Gone are the well wrapped insights, history are the unique applications of his life to everyone elses.  This value being replaced by cliches and \\"hey I'm buddy guy, too\\" guitar playing.  John's coming close to the line where I forget him, and that's a shame because he's still a very witty, funny fellow outside of his albums, so what was is still there.  Even his song titles have become heavy handed and empty.  3X5, Neon, Great Indoors are titles that take a little while longer to get a touch on their meaning than say \\"I don't trust myself with loving you,\\" \\"Dreaming with a broken heart,\\" and \\"Bold as love.\\"  If you want something unique back in your music, hope John wakes up from his self-imposed sleep, or revist Room for Squares and say hello to \\"I'm wide awake, It's morning\\" by Bright Eyes.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|In an interesting bit of counter-programming and offering some relief from the glut of big, dumb summer action movies, The Lake House is a romantic movie for adults and is a reunion for Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock who, ironically, starred in the blockbuster action film, Speed. Obviously, the powers that be hoped that lightning would strike twice as they had such genuine chemistry in that movie.<br /><br />Logically, this movie is a mess but it is a testimony to the chemistry of Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves that this matters little towards the overall enjoyment of watching their romance play out.<br /><br />Bullock has been spinning her wheels, career-wise, in the past few years with flawed dramas (Murder By Numbers) and forgettable comedies (did we really need a Miss Congeniality 2?) but has finally found the right material and the ideal role that showcases the same kind of attractive vulnerability that made the world fall in love with her in the first place. She has an enchanting smile that is beautiful to see. This enhances her character's appealing personality and makes you care about her.<br /><br />Reeves has definitely improved as an actor with age, delivering his most relaxed performance to date. He's always come across as stiff in many of his roles with his best efforts when he plays a more reactive character (i.e. My Own Private Idaho). However, with Something's Gotta Give he showed a capacity for light comedy in a much-needed break from the action and science fiction genres. The Lake House suits him well as he slips comfortably into his character.<br /><br />Credit must also go to director Alejandro Agresti who utilizes a warm and inviting colour scheme of earth tones that is perfect for this movie as it envelopes you and draws you in. He also adopts a leisurely pace, gradually immersing us in this engaging world and taking its time in getting to know these characters.<br /><br />In this day and age with email and instant messaging, it is refreshing to see a film that champions correspondence the old fashioned way - through handwritten letters. There is something more personal, more tangible than impersonal emails. Alex and Kate are lonely souls and in no time flat you want to see them together. This is a large part of the appeal of The Lake House. This is a romantic movie for our times with two busy professionals who are isolated in modern society and find each other through a bit of magic realism.<br /><br />The key to any romantic movie is the chemistry between the two leads and Bullock and Reeves have it, recreating the same spark that they had together in Speed only now they are a little older and wiser. Both have matured as actors and are a perfect for this movie. So, ignore the daft logic that The Lake House struggles to maintain - it is merely a device for which to establish a connection between the two lead actors. Once this happens nothing else matters but the relationship that develops between these two intriguing characters.<br /><br />\\"Additional Scenes and Outtakes\\" features more footage of Alex and Mona's disintegrating relationship, including its inevitable demise. There are a few other bits that were rightly cut as they would have distracted from the main story.<br /><br />Also included is a theatrical trailer.refreshing to see a film that champions correspondence the old fashioned way - through handwritten letters.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie due in part to the music. That's why I bought the soundtrack which I think is outstanding!!
0688145078|5.0|We own and have read plenty of books in preparation for my son to become a big brother and this one is the most positive one we've come across so far.  We love it!  So many books highlight some of the negatives about having a baby sibling - which isn't all bad - but this one was refreshingly upbeat with adorable pictures.  My two year old loved it and still likes to read it even though his little brother is not a newborn anymore.  I highly recommend reading this one along with \\"When You Were Inside Mommy\\" to help prepare your child to become a big brother.  These were invaluable tools for us as soon as I started showing in my pregnancy with our second child!
B000003489|4.0|I had read more than one review of this CD, but was waiting for a re-mastered version. Well, I finally got it, in more ways than one. Now some might think me crazy to compare John Coltrane to Jimi Hendrix. But listen to Giant Steps & Live at The Half Note, and you might change your mind. <br />     The only differance between the two in that Jimi Hendrix had a whammy bar & distortion pedals to create his sound. Coltrane had his horn. The solos he plays on Giant Steps almost outdoes Charlie Parker. You have to pay attention, just to see if he'll make it to the end before passing out..! All in all, this is a fine CD and should keep you wondering how he did it.....
0792164903|5.0|This is truly scary, completely replacing the  original story with a serial killer. My only criticism is that some of the scenes went on a bit too long. The acting is marvelous and the story fascinating. Johnny Depp is great as the Scientific detective.
B00005JPAM|5.0|After watching this drama-documentary, the question probably weighing on my mind as well as others in here who have seen this film is.... How would Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth (the real one, not Dame Mirren) and the rest of her family react if they were to sit down and watch this film from beginning to end? I imagine that dear old Liz would not be very amused at all.  <br /> <br />Having said that, if Stephen Frear's \\"The Queen\\" does not win best picture at the Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles this next spring, then I will be very shocked. Helen Mirren has given her performance of a life time. The way she walks, the way she behaves and speaks, all the way down to the real Queen's trademark hairstyle is uncanny. If I were to see Mirren impersonating the real Queen on the street, I would have thought that she was the real monarch. She has gotten it all spot on!  <br /> <br />The Duke of Edinburgh, played by James Cromwell acted like a complete jerk. I wonder if Philip is like this in real life? Besides the comic relief of the Queen Mother who I found hilarious, as well as a skiddish Prince of Wales, where were the rest of The Queen's family, namely Andrew, Edward, and Anne? I also found it a little odd that William and Harry were not a large part of this story. I was relieved when they did not cast someone to play the part of Princess Diana. Instead they relied on real footage of the Princess just prior to her tragic death in Paris.  <br /> <br />This was an excellent film and it deserves 5 stars. Well worth the $7.50 I spent for an afternoon viewing at the theatre.  <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This movie was VERY well done. An epic that was paced well. <br /> <br />Brad was believable as Achilles. And what a hunk - he put on loads of muscle to pull this one off. The cast was balanced as well...except I wanted to smack Orlando's character - that wimp didn't deserve the honor of slaying Achilles. <br /> <br />I do think they could have developed a few more characters better. But that didn't detract for the pleasure of this movie and watching several good performances. <br /> <br />This is a movie you will want to see again. <br /> <br />Watch it. <br />Own it. <br />Buy it now.
1932100660|5.0|JayY is certainly vigorous in his attack on plant based diets. I wasn't looking to go this way, but when diagnosed with diabetes, heart & liver disease a year ago, I thought I'd give it a shot rather than injections and surgery. A year later I no longer have diabetes, or heart, or liver disease and all with no drugs and no surgery. Sorry JayY, the evidence continues to mount into a massive, undeniable body of evidence. Who are you and what is your motivation anyway? Are you a broke dairy farmer or something?
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Ok...if you're ever blue and need a jump start on a change of state, put this DVD in. This movie is well done. The martial arts are good. The villians, comical.  <br /> <br />And the story flows. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this movie and own it - I bought it INSTEAD of going to the movies and watching it first. There was something that just attracted me to it.  <br /> <br />I'm glad I wasn't wrong.
B000002GA8|5.0|\\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\" is a 40 minute or so live performance of a piece of music based around and inspired by Jules Verne's original novel. It's composed by and features Rick Wakeman, the keyboardist of Yes. It's a really interesting and enjoyable listen, I think. <br /> <br />The performance features an orchestra, a choir, a couple of lead vocalists, a narrator and of course a whole lot of keyboards and effects. There's Moog, there's clavichord, there's electric piano, all of which Rick plays in that unique, wiggly way of his. He has a way of evoking images with sound, which really helps make this recording special. I love the burbling synthesizers that illustrate the bubbling water from the rock, and I love the uneasy sound of the choir evoking the sound of a heaving ocean on the second side, for instance. Getting everyone to play a bit of \\"The Hall of the Mountain King\\" as the volcanic Mt Etna erupts is pretty cool too, and kind of funny. There's a lot of moments like this which are really fun to listen to. <br /> <br />As for the lyrics and narration, the wording isn't exactly \\"high\\" literature, but it's all definitely got Rick's personality on it. I can just picture him writing the lyrics on his sheet music by the piano.  <br /> <br />\\"By horse, by rail, by land, by sea, our journey starts...\\" <br /> <br />Being a live recording, there's a couple of imperfections, but that's all right by me. I'd recommend this to Yes and progressive rock fans and lovers of a good story. I'll have to see if I can get my hands on the sequel \\"Return to the Centre of the Earth\\", an album recorded in 1999 which picks up where this album, and Jules Verne, left off.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I accidentally ran into this series. I was surprised of how good it really was. The acting is superb and the writing - well, we know where all the screen writers went now don't we? <br /> <br />This is a big BUY for anyone who likes exception work - whether you are into scary stuff or not. It is SO well done that, well, I don't mind it being scary. <br /> <br />The season finale was totally awesome. This is the ultimate in character development of Good versus Evil - and the brothers are developed as real characters. <br /> <br />Love this show.  <br /> <br />The only question is: Can they keep up the surprises and twists in Season 2? <br /> <br />Buy it!
B0000844I8|5.0|Una de las mejores peliculas que he visto. Tiene un argumento muy novedoso pra los amantes de la ciencia ficcion, se puede ver reflejado en su secuela televisiva Stargate SG-1. La recomiendo ampliamente. <br /> <br />Saludos.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|I really can't understand why there isn't more of an uproar over this album (I know - no one calls them that anymore). I am a huge fan of MCR and probably have listened to \\"Three Cheers\\" semi-daily since its release. MCR's ability to stand out in a sea of mediocrity has shown a talent and a soul to their music that others just couldn't measure up to. However, if you are old enough to remember when Member's Only jackets were cool, you will listen to every track on the \\"The Black Parade\\" trying to figure out who they are covering on this one. Everything is strangely remininscent and obviously uninspired. Contrived, conforming and unoriginally boring. My friend has a theory it was label pressure and I hope she is right. In that case, maybe they can find their way back.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I usually don't take the time to review these things.  But this series is so special, I just wanted to add my 11 cents.  This series should not have worked.  Yes, yes, I know that any story line you can write for a horse opera you can use for a space opera.  However, I have never seen both horse opera and space opera in one film.  (The scene at the end of the 'Serenity' episode where they're riding horseback hell-bent-for-leather, back to their SPACE SHIP is GREAT.  Again, it shouldn't have worked, but it DID.  I mean, it REALLY DID!)  There isn't a beat that Joss Whedon and Co. missed.  Music.  Writing. Special effects. Casting(they had to have one of the most likeable casts since, maybe, MASH).  Directing.  Great acting.  They didn't miss a beat--except for the fact that FOX could never figure out how to market the thing.    Why FOX blew this, I will never understand.  Many productions have tried to compete in the Star Wars arena, but none of them ever actually did.  This series--and I'm talking every episode, here--not only competed, but was better than.  Nathan Fillian actually out Han Solo'ed Han Solo.  I fell completely in love with the female cast, with a special nod to Summer Glau who had to be both threatning, vulnerable, and somehow profoundly in need of protection.  Adam Baldwin, who seemed to be on loan from 'Pirates of the Caribbean', brought a smile to my face in every scene he was in.    'Firefly' is a tribute to what still can be done on television.  FOX is a tribute to every stupid network brass decision there ever was.    GET THIS SERIES.  It holds a special place in my heart and always will.
0307237699|4.0|Barack Obama is a good man and a great speaker. The ideas professed in the beginning and the end of his recent, \\"Hope\\" are leaning in a revolutionary and new direction for politics, yet this book is proof positive that a lot still needs to change for politicians to achieve a civil tone, to bridge the divide between parties, and to progress instead of fight.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Obama writes in eloquent, yet not too stuffy speech, as he describes personal anecdotes, his rise in politics, and his projection for what America should look like. He begins with an open approach to government from the perspective of a layman or a non-politician, but as he continues, explaining the campaign and some of his experiences as civil servant in a \\"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\\" way, a biased, un-opened viewpoint reveals itself.<br /><br />Obama's voice is clear and his message is populist, which may strike a chord with many voters out there who feel disenfranchised by the two main political parties. This voice is new and promising, but the ideas he writes about are old and played out. The author may sound like a novel thinker, but his concepts betray that: it's apparent that Obama believes that a large centralized government is the answer to nearly everything and the few political elites in Washington know better than everyone else in the country. For this, I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />In my reading, I was hoping to find a blueprint for way to get beyond the partisan name-calling and childish behavior in American politics, and with Obama's tone that happened, but I ended up hearing the same old partisan story: Republican policies are dividing the country into haves and have-nots and Clinton ushered in a great economy, end to class warfare, and peace on Earth. This dichotomy is based on some valid information and the author's point of view can be understood, but Obama is unaware of, or ignores some obvious data and some unique ideas that would probably change his viewpoint.<br /><br />Obama praises centralized government saying that governmental aid in the arenas of science and infrastructure have led to some important monuments (The Hoover Dam, The Internet, the Human Genome Project- which, coincidentally was completed in conjunction and competition with a private organization). He fails to recognize what monumental human achievements have been created without government intervention (computers, the world wide web, the skyscraper, the cotton gin, the iPod, overnight mail delivery, the bicycle, the automobile, the airplane, refrigeration, the telephone, eBay, plasma television, and the list is endless).<br /><br />Toward the end of the book, Obama explains reforms that will benefit our position in the global market, including investing in education and he goes on to explain how there could be a compromise between Democrats and Republicans on education. The author again misses the big picture here: education may help us prosper in the global economy, but only if we have students who want to learn. We will only have people who want to learn if we change our emphasis on consumption to production as a nation. If Obama thinks we should position ourselves better in the global economy, perhaps he would agree to change the tax structure from one that penalizes production (income tax), to one that penalizes consumption (sales tax). If the author wants America to compete in the world, perhaps he should reconsider policies that make it difficult to compete with Mexico, China, and India (minimum wage, strict business regulation, high business taxes). Unfortunately, the Illinois Senator promotes tired New Deal policies that make it difficult for business to provide work in America and easy for them to outsource.<br /><br />Obama blames Bush's tax cuts for the huge debt we have, but doesn't seem to think that the dot com bust, the 9/11 shock, two wars in Asia, or the $500 billion senior prescription drug benefit had much of an impact on the debt. He does later focus on defense as a major price in the Federal budget, but fails to acknowledge that Medicare and Medicaid together cost more than the entire Homeland Security budget ($481B to $473B). He also praises former president Roosevelt for his programs like Social Security, but ignores the cost of the program ($519B) when he speaks about Federal debt.<br /><br />He goes on to describe race relations and the need for Americans to continue the fight for equality. In this case, I would have like to seen Obama treat all races consistently, instead of labeling them by continent of origin, skin shade, or language (he describes races with titles like African American, white, and Hispanic). Further confusing the terminology, he considers himself an African American, though he has half European genes.<br /><br />With all of the ideas, perspectives, and facts that Obama fails to uncover (granted there are an infinite amount of these), the author of \\"Hope\\" makes a dramatic step toward unification in thought. When he speaks about religion, he proclaims that if someone is to communicate their beliefs, they must use a standard that everyone can agree on. This point is breezed past fairly quickly, but is a monumental concept, not only for religion, but for all avenues of discourse. All disagreement, including that between political factions, is based on simple misunderstandings. We can remedy these misunderstandings by finding common ground between two parties and go from there. Obama writes that the best we can do is to, \\"act in accordance with those things that are possible for all of us to know.\\" That is a beautiful point.<br /><br />Writing this book for Obama, with the controversial policies he promotes, is contrary to his above quote, unfortunately. Despite this, it is clear that he is making an attempt to bridge the gap between political factions and it is clear that his motives are good. It is my hope, audacious or not, that Obama is open enough to acknowledge options for a better America that are different than his, and may, in fact, be more appropriate.major price in the Federal budget, but fails to acknowledge that Medicare and Medicaid together cost more than the entire Homeland Security budget ($481B to $473B).

0743454537|2.0|This book sets up an ethical dilemma that gives a young girl and her parents hard choices.  The reader follows this through several hundred pages only to discover at the end that the young girl did not make this hard choice because of what she wanted, but once again, what her sister wanted.  So you are thinking the whole premise of the book was invalidated. And then, after understanding the revised motivation, before the characters can even make that hard choice you've spend a few hundred pages being debated, the whole scenario becomes moot. This was the easy way out for the author and the characters, a cheap trick.  I would have rather had seen the premise of the book be real -- the girl was acting on her own motivations and made her own hard decision to stop for her own motivations, one way or the other,  And then follows through with that choice and everyone grows up a little - whatever choice she makes. Instead we got a cheap plot trick.  I disagree with readers who say the author couldn't have ended this another way.  If you want to fictionalize a situation that demands a hard choice, then follow through and let the character make it for her own reasons, otherwise what's the point?  I can't see reading any more of this author's work because of the cop out ending in this one.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I was interested to see how this album would turn out with Jim Steinman not producing.. Other than \\"Monsters Loose\\" and \\"Its all coming back\\"  it was hard to find samples of any other tracks before the album was released.  I listened to this album all the way through as soon as I got it.. and was absolutely blown away!  Great to hear Meat do Steinman's \\"Bad for Good.\\"  Love the track \\"What about Love\\" with Patti.  My only complaint is that I wish there was more Steinman tracks on the album.. but overall I think Desmond Child did an amazing job.. especially considering the big shoes he had to fill..  I'd give this album 6 stars if I could!!!!!
0553583182|5.0|I must admit that I've never been into self help books or spiritual books but several months ago I was going through the kind of \\"low period\\" that we all go through at one time or another.  It was like a quagmire.  A few bad breaks and before I knew it, I was sinking deeper and deeper into depresion.  When you reach that place it's extremely difficult to erase the negative thoughts that plague you.  Quite by accident I came across this book.  It helped me climb out of the pit of negativity and into the relm of positive aura and energy.  It worked for me.  With my attitude change and shift in perception in a matter of weeks, solid,  good, tangible things started happening.  It seems so simple: You are what you think!  But it's true.  Every once in a while I find myself pulling this book out when I need a reminder or a refresher course.  It's been invaluable in helping me deal with dark moods.
0316096199|4.0|I had no idea of the style or subject of 'Lucky' until I started reading it: I'd bought it purely on the strength of Sebold's earlier novel, 'The Lovely Bones'.  <br />That being said, I found myself captivated by this remarkable account of Sebold's teen years and, of course, her rape - the cataclysmic event that has so shaped her present and, it seems, will continue to affect her future. (As I was reading, I was getting my daughter ready for her first year at college and this book has gone with her.) <br />Sebold deserves copious praise for her courage and clear-headedness, not just in having dealt with the rape all those years ago, and its effects on all who were and are still close to her, but also in dredging it all up again to present this ordered, sensible, well-written account.  <br />Particularly admirable is the no-holds-barred way she presents herself. It would have been so easy to slip into 'poor little me' mode, but she has avoided that self-pitying tone so successfully that at times I almost disliked her, feeling so very, very sorry for her all the while. <br />It's not a comfortable read by any means. But it is a strong one, and worthwhile, for Sebold's well-delivered perspective on the psyche of rapist, victim and what may well be a lifetime of shattered relationships.
B00004X01U|5.0|The fact that this is one of Madonna's lowest-rated albums here boggles my mind.  This may be Madonna's strongest album.  Paradise (Not For Me), Nobody's Perfect, Gone, and I Deserve It are four gorgeous, lyrical, haunting slow songs, the likes of which Madonna had never written before or since.  Take another listen -- these songs sound even better with age.
B000IFQLBE|5.0|John Fogerty has for decades made some of the best pure rock 'n roll music out there.  LONG ROAD HOME shows him at his finest--older and wiser, he knows even better the ins and outs of rock 'n roll, and exploits them to the max.<br /><br />This is simply a stellar concert.  From old Creedence favorites to newer, solo-Fogerty material, the fans--in concert and those of you at home--still want to hear John Fogerty play and sing...which is a good thing, considering he is still doing both incredibly well.  Aside from a few snide, unecessary political remarks (Fogerty at one point references \\"that other guy\\" on television that night, and how he's glad the audience isn't watching him), this is a concert of flawless, wall-to-wall excitement.  Two discs, one great concert, and one legendary rock figure--John Fogerty's music (and hopefully the man himself) will be around a very long time...buy this album and see why.
B00005JPBJ|5.0|As Jigsaw is laying on his death bed. His pupil is going through her troubles of life and her past, all a while taking out her anger on the good doctor who is trying to save jigsaw's life. In the mean time we find the doctor's husband is trapped by Jigsaw in the same building and is sadistically being made to decide whether to forgive the people who killed his son.  Everyone included had to go through very different expriences of sorrow and dispair.  Although in the end we find the good doctor and husband feeling a realise from this grief only to be snapped back into grief because of  jigsaw's way of forcing people to feel and face those fears inside them. A great ending! A potential 4th movies comes out the ending of the movie.
B000068TP0|5.0|My daughter love the songs and dance with this DVD. <br />Really a great production.
B000IONJJ2|5.0|This movie is absolutely, positively deserving of a double-dip. The first disc that came out was not only non-anamorphic, it was pan & scan. The movie should have never been released in that format to begin with.
B00000FC5H|5.0|It's a compilation, so you expect to hear all of the hits of one of the best groups of all time, and that's exactly what you hear on this CD.  For those like me that never replaced the EWF albums with CDs, this is a must have because you get the best of the best on one CD.  There are always a few songs that you wish had made the cut, but you will not regret owning this CD.  The EWF concert in Vegas in Sept. proved yet again that this is one of the best bands to ever grace the stage.  Thirty years later, they are still amazing.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|There are two schools of thought with this album, just like the previous two discs. If you didn't like either of the other albums, there's nothing here that's bound to change your mind. It's heavy-handed, overblown, bombastic, overwrought, overly dramatic, pompous, WAY over-produced, grandiose, damned near cringe-inducing and borderline laughable. In other words, everything you'd expect, and love to hate, from a Bat album. <br /> <br />On the flip side, the fact that it is so over-the-top makes the album work on its own terms, and make it endearing. It's everything you'd expect, demand and love about a Bat album. Indeed, there is nothing else like this Monster. <br /> <br />That being said, this isn't your father's Bat disc. Jim Steinman's involvement in this album is reduced, either by health issues of legal entanglements (depending on who you speak to), and replacement producer/songwriter Desmond Child (Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Ricky Martin) spends a lot of time trying to make it sound like a Jim Steinman production. Overall, Child succeeds well, but there does seem to be a little something missing. Still, Loaf and Child stack the deck with enough old friends (Bat I's original producer Todd Rundgren, drummer Kenny Aronoff, bassist Kasim Sulton and vocalist Patti Russo) and more-than-willing new partners (Queen's Brian May, Nikki Sixx of Motley Crue, John 5 of Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie's band, Steve Vai, Eric Bazilian, Chris Vrenna) to give a fresh perspective on the classic feel. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with the \\"title\\" track, opening with more than appropriate haunted sound effects (especially given its Halloween release date) before crashing into a ragged nu-metal riff with full orchestra in tow. Just as you start wondering what the hell is going on, Meat Loaf unleashes his voice and suddenly everything clicks into place. From there, it just plugs along, careening from heavy metal overload to stage musical dramatics, from Wagnerian blasts to fist-pumping rock anthems, giving you exactly what you'd expect until it's huge, Broadway-esque ending and \\"epilogue\\". Subtlety is just not part of the Bat world. <br /> <br />And suddenly your realize where both Evanessence and My Chemical Romance got their influences. <br /> <br />Along the way, Loaf manages to steal back Steinman's \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" from Celine Dion, and render it virtually unrecognizable, and far superior from its former MOR hell. Although it takes a bit to get past Meat, who is fast approaching 60, duetting with Marion Raven who is maybe 20, you do get past it. This is this album's \\"I Would Do Anything For Love\\" or \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\". <br /> <br />This is a heavier, darker album than the previous incarnations, almost to the point of being a bit TOO heavy-handed. This is the more \\"adult\\" version of the Bat saga. No teenage back seat affairs of \\"Paradise By The Dashboard Light\\" here. But again, Meat is near 60; cruising for chicks isn't part of the game plan anymore. Some of the humor associated with the previous works (the baseball bit from \\"Paradise...\\" for example) is sadly missing this time around, as are bits of dialog such as the \\"Hot Summer Nights\\" intro from the first album, and the \\"Wasted Youth\\" monologue from the second. You don't realize you miss them until they're gone. <br /> <br />The thing that holds this mess together is Meat Loaf himself, whose voice hasn't sounded this damn good since the first Bat album. It's obviously a bit more personal this time around, and he approaches every song like a Shakespearean actor. He lives and breathes this material, giving it everything he has. The music and production has to be this bombastic just to keep up with him. <br /> <br />In the end, we have a full disc length's worth of 6 to 8 minute songs comprised of total rock excess, just as before. However, the songs are far more cohesive than on Bat II. The tracks go somewhere, rather than just endlessly repeating riffs again andagain. Bat II could have easily lost 15 minutes and you wouldn't have missed anything. There is a shortage of obvious hit singles, \\"It's All Coming Back...\\" the one exception, and it does lag a bit toward the end, but the whole is better than the sum of its parts. Still doesn't measure up to the first album (nothing really could), but it is worthy of the Bat Out Of Hell moniker. In fact, I prefer to think of this at Bat III - the Apology, as I had some serious issues with the second album. Jim Steinman is the better rock anthem writer, but Desmond Child is the better producer. <br /> <br />Meat Loaf has said that this is the last Bat album, as well as his rock swan song. However, there are also rumors of a 4th installment due in a couple of years and a full reunion with Jim Steinman. While what is here, and what is missing, does whet the appetite for another batch of Bat songs, The Monster is Loose is a fitting endgame for an unlikely rock God. There is no one else quite like Meat Loaf. Thankfully. <br /> <br />Like a monster movie, Bat Out Of Hell III is pure guilty pleasure. You shouldn't like this stuff...but you do. Sometimes, just sometimes, monsters are good to have around.
B000059XUO|5.0|The truest tragedy will always be the fact that Brandon Lee died while filming. Had he not, he would most likely have become greater than he is now. But this movie is what keeps him alive today.<br /><br />Brandon Lee's performance was nothing short of phenomenal. He portrayed the character we all would seek in Eric Draven. The action was intense, but it was the emotion he applied that gave it such greatness. The story itself carries a uniqueness that is often-times doomed to fall short in the chaos that is Hollywood, but the Crow is able to keep it as it's meant to be, retaining its beauty.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|One session of listening to Howard Shore's breathtaking score for LOTR--RETURN OF THE KING and you instantly appreciate why he was repeatedly nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br />Sweeping orchestral pieces transport you to the epic battles fought, while softer instrumentals summon the characters' pains suffered and quiet triumphs obtained. <br /> <br />If you own the other 2 CDs in the series, this is a no brainer. If you don't, ironically, starting here gives you a taste of all 3 as Shore weaves together a final tapestry of the trilogy in an expert fashion!
B000GNOM78|5.0|Most anyone looking at a review of this already knows what it is. That being the case I just wanted to add that this version has the scenes included with the 25th Anniversary Editions and that the picture quality is outstanding. I state that because I had doubts about how well restored the picture could be and what effort would be made into transferring it from optical. <br /> <br />The audio wasn't lacking, but I didn't find it particularly remarkable either. It was clear and crisp, but I didn't notice any remix work for surround or anything like that.
B000E5KJF2|4.0|Very art noir. Compelling and somewhat casual flim making technique. Story is all over the place until neatly comes together at the end, only slightly predictable. Enjoyable and fun.
B000B8QEYC|2.0|The only nice piece is Amarantine. <br />The rest of the songs are very boring and lost some of Enya's \\"magic\\".
B00027JZ3E|5.0|What a film. Until The Phantom Of The Opera, this was Joel Schumacher at the peak of his talent. One of the best vampire movies I have ever seen. Check it out.
0440241588|5.0|As usual, I couldn't put one of Grishman's books down until the final page. Full of twists and turns... I loved it..!!!
B00000AFWW|4.0|Hole's \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is nothing like any of Love's other albums. That's just a statement of fact; don't buy this if you want to know what she's really about. Love is grunge and screaming and almost-vulgar honesty, and you don't get a lot of that on this record. But if you want to hear some high-quality, edge-of-mainstream music, then this is a good bet.<br /><br />\\"Skin\\" has, for better or for worse, changed Love's image. It was regarded by many Nirvana and early Hole fans as a sell-out, a betrayal of their earlier work. In the mainstream music world, \\"Skin\\" was a hit. It's now the album most people recognize when they think of Hole, and it had decently popular hits in \\"Celebrity Skin\\" (also known as \\"Make Me Over\\"), \\"Malibu,\\" and \\"Reason to be Beautiful.\\" Love has stated many times that her intention on this album was to make a pop record; she says that most musical elitists don't \\"get it.\\" She was sick of comments about her one-dimensional act (a howling product of drugs and promiscuity with a foothold in screeching guitars and raw lyrics) and this does showcase her versatility as an artist.<br /><br />What you'll find in \\"Celebrity Skin\\" depends on what you're looking for. If it's an extension of \\"Live Through This\\" or \\"Pretty on the Inside,\\" stay away. If it's your first taste of Hole and you're a little nervous about it, or if you think their other material is too loud and unpolished, this is perfect for you.<br /><br />But if it's your first Hole purchase and you think you're ready for the unleashed, Kobain-influenced Love, I would recommend \\"Live Through This.\\" Happy buying!
B0000017CA|5.0|This album just rocks.  It can't be grouped in one genre, it really is across the board.  Every genre that has already been mentioned is really present, from death to black to 70's rock to stoner to sludge to cajun etc.  The lyrics are well thought out, and actually pretty disturbing if you listen to them.  Not in a Cannibal Corpse, as much gore as possible sense, but in the sense of looking into the mind of a serial killer.  The album cover is great, just like everything else.  There's something on here for every mood.  Take the opening of Cheap Vodka \\"With my last five/got a cheap fifth of vodka/gonna kill someone/noone's gonna stop us tonight\\".  Just fun. <br /> <br />The highlights:  The Blue, Finger Paintings of the Insane, Scream of the Butterfly, Doctor Suess is Dead, and Cassie Eats Cockroaches.  I can't even quote a lot of the lyrics on here, but they are great throughout.  Interesting musical techniques, too.  My favorite:  soft acoustic guitar combined with double-bass kicking on Scream of the Butterfly.  Dax is one of the best vocalists out there.  He goes from the clean, melancholy singing straight into a face-destroying scream, but whatever he does fits in with the music.  All the instrumentalists are great:  they fit in perfectly with the feel of the album.  Nothing exceptional, but nothing bad at all.  This album has nothing bad about it, really.  I mean, sure, if you're obsessed with solos, there aren't a lot, but this isn't thrash.  This album is pretty much perfect for what it is.
0719561027|2.0|I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book might appeal to you.<br /><br />It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone \\"I'm better than all of you.\\"  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy \\"friends.\\"  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.<br /><br />I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!<br /><br />No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I originally watched this movie in the theater after it was released many years ago. To be able to own it and have it in my home to watch whenever I choose is awesome. I purchased three total so my Dad and brother could have their own copy too. This is the most life like racing movie and the romance that is going on in the background the entire season of Grand Prix racing is mesmerizing.
6304779356|4.0|The Lost Boys is a very under-rated teen vampire flick. Brothers named Michael (Jason Patric) and his younger brother Sam (Corey Haim) move into a new town. Michael falls in with a bad bunch because of a crush on a girl named Star (Jami Gertz). The leader of the gang named David (the awesome Kiefer Sutherland) gets Michael to drink something that Star warns him not to. Soon after Sam realizes that his brother has infact become a vampire. Two comic geek brothers played by Corey Feldman \\"in annoying Rambo mode and Jamison Newlander who's less annoying\\" tell Sam that he needs to stake his brother. Instead though they decide to save him by killing the head vampire who they think might be Michael and Sam's Mother's boss and potential b/f (Edward Herrmann).<br /><br />  After ruining a date with him and their mother by putting garlic in his food they think they made a mistake. So they set out hunt David and his gang of vampires. The result is a fun movie even if it does get a little corny in the end. It's also one of the coolest 80's flicks that you can ever see. The two Corey's almost turn the film into the Goonies meet Vampires but the older cast are in top form. This is certainly one of Jason Patric's more memorable roles. Same goes for Kiefer Sutherland who I think makes one of the coolest vampires I have ever seen. Especially when he has those weird contacts in that make him look pretty damn scary. Plus Joel Schumacher's direction is actually pretty good as well. If he made a Batman film this cool, this fun and with some darkness on the side then Batman & Robin wouldn't have been the joke it was. The film has some bad one-lines I admit but not as many as Batman & Robin at least.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is such a wonderful movie.  I loved this version with Keira Knightley.  There was such wonderful chemistry with the actors...all of them that it became my favorite version.
0743201140|5.0|\\"Finding Your Strengths\\" may be Marcus Buckingham's finest work to date. Buckingham and Clifton have succeeded in bringing to life an idea that is enormously practical and helpful.  Using themes as a means of describing one's gifts, Buckingham and Clifton have given me enormous insights about who I am and why I do the things I do. More importantly, they have taught me not only to accept my weaknesses but how to management both my strengths and weaknesses, so that, I can learn to be better than anyone else in my strengths.  Thank you Marcus and Donald.
0671449028|5.0|My 14 month old loves this book.  We read it to him every night. It's one of his favorites. If you're an admirer of Sandra Boynton books, get her volume two collection which includes this book.
B000051YEG|5.0|Melody Nelson didn't do it for me right away. I kept at it though and now I can't get away. This album has a way of creeping into your existence and taking it over. I live in New York City so i don't have a car but for all of you that do, buy this album, get into it, and drive. Melody Nelson was made for late night drives. If you like this right away, good for you, if you don't then keep listening.    UPDATE:  Since I wrote the above I have been entrapped by this album. I cannot get away from it. This is one of the greatest albums ever. You haven't heard music fully until you've experienced this. I don't know anything like it and I don't think I ever will. Wow. The eerie slow play between the bass, drums, and guitar. The meandering talking of Serge as he leads you through this strange 28 minutes of love and lust. The strings and chorus. Oh the strings and chorus! Ahahahaha! Sweet infinity! I can see this being the album that takes over me life and leaves me for ruin. If you don't have this album, I'm sorry. If you have this album, I'm sorry.   Why did it take so long for me to hear about this? What's wrong with the world?
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Let us start with the premise that V is an excellent movie and work from there. The idea behind the film is timely - in this \\"modern\\" age, it seems somehow unpatriotic to suggest that \\"governments should fear their people but people should not fear their government\\". The acting is overall good and sometimes approached excellent as well, yet... yet... I was left dissatisfied. The strength of a movie of this sort is the believability of the plot and to reach it's conclusion, V forces a slight bit of unbelievability into what has transpired as an otherwise strong cautionary tale of what can happen to a people to ready to surrender freedom for security. <br />Nonetheless, V had to be made, V has to be seen. And the message should be heard. I gave the film 5 stars - the plot is 4.5, sets and direction, 5, acting 4 and message 5. It is a film worth watching and film worth owning - while you still can. <br /> <br />Remember, remember the 5th of November....
1931788340|5.0|This is my new favorite book.  I found it by accident as I didn't know Stephen Shore.  The feeling, mood, and color in his images are so great.  If you're like me who like anything 70's, then you will love this book.<br /><br />His photography was considered very cutting edge at a time when all fine art was shot in black & white.  Mr. Shore has a gift to make the ordinary like extra-ordinary and beautiful.  If you love photography, you need to own this book! [...]
6305971935|4.0|Michael Paré(\\"Into the Sun\\"\\"Space Fury\\"), Nancy Allen(\\"Limit up\\" \\"Robocop\\"),two famous star in 80's, made this a five-star Sci-Fi movie. But no subtitle or Closed Captioned , so I will give it 4.5 star.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|There are not really any \\"big names\\" in Brick. The closest would be Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who, if we ignore his hand in 10 Things I Hate About You, is not well known as a movie actor but rather as Tommy on TV's \\"3rd Rock from the Sun.\\" Please do not let the absence of familiar names and faces deter you from seeing Brick. I thought it was a very clever and entertaining piece of work.  <br /> <br />Reading the synopsis provided with the movie (I apologize for not having it available) would tell you to expect an elaborate drug-related plot involving a bunch of high school students. I was drawn to the movie by the trailer from which I had little knowledge of the movie, just an unexplained interest in seeing it. I was hesitant from the synopsis, but it must not have deterred me for too long! What type of ridiculous drug plot could a handful of 16-, 17- and 18-year-old kids actually get into? How far fetched is this story line going to be?  <br /> <br />Forget all of that. What the creative team did was take a story that has essentially become cliché in modern cinema and breathed new life into it. A disinterested, scorned man receives a cry for help from his ex-girlfriend and avails himself of a few liberties not necessarily intended for private citizens under the law only to find the trail to her is long and ultimately leads to a drug king-pin. So far so normal. What was unique to Brick was the high-school setting. You have kids living with their parents trying to uncover conspiracies between classes. Sounds ridiculous, right? Exactly. It is ridiculous. So get over it and enjoy the movie.  <br /> <br />The way the teenagers related the drug plot to their pre-adult existence was well done and ultimately made the movie fun to watch.
B00005JPAM|5.0|This may well be the movie of the year. Helen Mirren, as just about everybody has rightly noted, turns in another wonderful performance, this time as the restrained \\"duty first, self second\\" monarch.  Her particular trial here is having to face a clash of civilizations, not between nations as during World War Two, but now within her own country.  A culture of heroes, of maintaining a stiff upper lip during crises and of \\"good show, flying colors\\" as the behavioral ideal, has slowly eroded and been replaced by one of vulgar celebrity and \\"letting it all hang out.\\" In the middle of this clash stands Tony Blair. He must induce the noble yet now unintentionally comic, because isolated, queen into an awareness of how her society has been \\"Oprahfied,\\" an insight that would not naturally occur to her since she sees Diana's death as calling for little more than royal privacy and a family removal to Balmoral. Herein lies the movie's subtlety. The high-minded, stoic queen, for all her wit, nonetheless values brute animals more easily, apparently, than she does people. She quickly sees, for example, the beauty of a glorious stag pursued by royal hunters, but has little sympathy for the beautiful Diana pursued by equally murderous reporters.     As regards Tony Blair, we have equivalent complexity. For all the film reveals of his political opportunism and readiness to take advantage of changed circumstances, for all the emphasis on generational differences between him and the queen, he is allowed by the well-written script to genuinely recognize the queen's essential fineness. His awareness here leads him in an emotionally charged scene to berate some of his own staff in private after they openly express their shameless glee at the queen's discomfort. At the same time as he recognizes that the \\"duty' agenda of the queen will allow him to talk her into doing what has become in present circumstances \\"the right thing,\\" he also reveals to us his clear awareness that something finehas been compromised in the process.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|not only is this cd great, but you can tell that Taylor really took the time to make sure her fans would enjoy EVERY aspect of the album. case-in-point? there is a \\"hidden message\\" inside the lyrics of each song. i noticed it (they are all the capitalized letters) when i was reading over the lyrics, before listening to the cd. they are: <br /> <br />1) Time McGraw: CAN'T TELL ME NO <br />2) Picture to Burn: DATE NICE BOYS <br />3) Teardrops on my Guitar: HE WILL NEVER KNOW <br />4) A Place in This World: FOUND IT <br />5) Cold As You: TIME TO LET YOU GO <br />6) The Outside: YOU ARE NOT ALONE <br />7) Tied Together With a Smile: YOU ARE LOVED <br />8) Stay Beautiful: SHAKEN BAKE <br />9) Should've Said No: SAM SAM SAM SAM SAM SAM SAM <br />10) Mary's Song (Oh My My My): SOMETIMES LOVE IS FOREVER <br />11) Our Song: LIVE IN LOVE

B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones, tone and vocals are exceptional. One of the best young smooth jazz artist. \\"Come Away With Me\\" classic  but also an instant hit. Keeep up the good work.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I have been a Green Day fan since they were unknowns at Berkley.  It was great to hear their sound evolve and mature in this album.  I look forward to the continued evolution of this band.
B000002O7C|5.0|I was only interested in Hymn to Red October but the whole cd turned out to be much better than I expected.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Another fantastic animation from Mr. Miyazaki.  In the 90's our love of his films started with Kiki's Delivery Service, and grew from there.  The great imagination of the animation put into the films is wonderful, and our whole family sits down to watch this movie over and over again.  It is a movie that makes our children think and become aware of our surroundings; and the damage we as a society do to nature and natural resources that we have come to need to survive.
0805047905|5.0|This is an excellent book to read to a baby. My son has loved this book so much we read it to him at least twice a day. One thing I love about this book is that it's so simple and caughts the baby's attention.
B000050XEI|5.0|From the starting track \\"A Day Without Rain\\" to the ending track \\"Lazy Days\\" the listener travels through a lyrical, mystical chorus of sound.  I love this album.  It is one of my all time favorites.  A definite Keeper.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|One of the selections you'd have to have in your \\"stranded on a desert island\\" pile.
B000AYQLX6|3.0|Some really nice tunes on here. #9 Dream is as good as anything Lennon ever wrote, but there are weak songs on here, namely 'whatever gets you through the night', which to me is a rambling, tuneless dirge and the awful 'ya ya'. Also 'what you got' is abslutely horrible. Still, worthy of a purchase, as there are a lot of melodic songs here, but I think Macca was better, particularly with his strong and more characteristic 'Venus and Mars' out around this time.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|First let me say, I am new to My Chemical Romance. I don't own any of their previous albums. What got me interested was the video to \\"Welcome to the Black Parade.\\" I loved it. And I have to say that I'm absolutely blown away by this album. The two best CD's that I've heard this year so far have been Evanescence \\"The Open Door\\" and \\"The Black Parade.\\" But this CD took me by complete surprise. They killed it. At first it does kind of appear like Green Day redux. And that would have been a mistaken identity, a superficial assessment. Because if you listen closely, it's an entirely different beast. Well, it will be obvious from the first song and as you progress through the album. If Evanescence is Goth Rock, then I suppose My Chemical Romance is like Goth Emo Rock. They're sort of an unusual hybrid of Green Day and Evanescence with the latter being at two different extremes and My Chemical Romance standing somewhere in the middle. I have to say that this is a very interesting an entertaining album. Lead singer Gerard Way is a fascinating character. And that is evident on a song like \\"Mama\\" where he's almost Danny Elfman like. Think Jack Skeleton in the \\"Nightmare Before Christmas.\\" It sounds like the song stepped out of a Tim Burton movie. But that's kind of the cool of it. And sometimes the album has more of a musical quality like on the hidden track \\"Blood.\\" At other times it reminds me a little of Queen. But in all, this is impressive. I didn't expect to like this or buy this. I think My Chemical Romance has a lot of potential. I'm looking forward to their next album. For those of you that like Green Day, Evanescence, or The Killers then I would definitely recommend this album.    Favorites: The End, Dead, This Is How I Disappear, The Sharpest Lives, House of Wolves, Mama, Famous Last Words
B000002MP2|5.0|This was the album that converted of my friends into Green Day fans.  I just dug up my old CD of this album and I still love listening to it today as I did when it first came out.
0930289528|5.0|I first saw the movie that was put out recently and i was taken in by the story and political aspect of the movie. I went in search for the book and found that the book in all ways was rich with brillance. The movie captures a portion of this, but the book really does justice to graphic novels. I highly recommend it.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|This film is based upon an old DC Comics theme and the screenplay is by the Wachowski Brothers, known for their Matrix series and others. Special Effects are of little importance as the plot and theme of the movie is the main attraction. This movie is about political struggle, social engineering and control. It builds upon one of the least recognized and least understood political concepts, being the power of the people and in a theatric way promotes revolution of the masses. Thus, I highly recommend this film.
0920668372|5.0|I am a mother of an 18 month old little boy.  My mother bought this book for us and I absolutely love it.  It is the best book to explain the bond between a mother and her son (well any child actually!).  I highly reccommend this book for any mother, but especially those that have little boys.  It would make a great shower, birthday or holiday gift.  ENJOY!!!!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I absolutely love this Album, From the sultry start of \\"Feeling Good\\" to the great \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\" duet with Nelly Furtado, the soulful \\"Home\\"; the energetic \\" Save the Last Dance\\"; the jazzy \\"Song for You\\"; and to a sweet finish of \\"You and I\\". I love all of them. I got most of my family and friends hooked on Michael Bubl&eacute; with this album.
B000003S5H|4.0|How did this cd bypass me? One or 2 songs can be a bit grating but overall a fantastic chillout cd.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|yeah....the quality is not great.  The reviewer before me has a point.  But, this brought my teenage years back in such a rush that I can't find too much fault with it.  It's worth what I paid for it.  Those one-note solos by Ace brought tears to my eyes.  Those songs are etched in my mind.  They might have spent a little more time on the sound ...  my only quibble.
0743298020|5.0|When I read the first five pages of this book, just over 36 hours ago, I thought that I've made a wrong choice of reading. I put it down and kept it away from my thought. <br /> <br />Hours later, at 3am in the morning, I thought of reading several more pages before going to bed. I almost didn't. I kept reading the books until my eyes could not take the stress. <br /> <br />The book is a tale about a tale. It was as if I was there as Margaret and was also there as the Angelfield twins. It was nothing short of mesmerizing. Setterfield wrote in such fluency that the convoluted plot of Angelfield's story is as clear as the blue sky. <br /> <br />Even nearing the end of the book, we were left knowing only pieces of the puzzle with the all-important link missing. And if there is anything to describe my feeling then, Setterfield described it only too well in the beginning as she told the tale of Margaret reading the thirteen tales, realising that there is only few pages left in the book and that she was only at the twelfth tale. I thought, like Margaret was left without knowing the thirteenth tale, I would be left without seeing the complete puzzle. <br /> <br />But Setterfield did not disappoint. She wrapped the book neatly and tightly around with just few pages left to satiate all my curiosity. She tied all the loose ends neatly, leaving me, even now, an hour after finishing my reading, wondering and fixing some seemingly insignificant pieces of the puzzles into its rightful place. Although the big picture was already etched in my mind when I finished reading the book, these little pieces uncovers more details and truths; they beautify the (finished?) puzzle. <br /> <br />I would not hesitate the least bit to recommend this book to all of my friends, and to you.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I love this Album, Pink definitely showcases more of herself in this wonderful album of self discovery.  I love her irreverence, her audacity, her strength that clearly shines thru.
1878424319|5.0|Don Miguel provides a simple yet challenging framework from which to live one's life.  Grasping the concepts in the book has helped me personally get beyond the \\"critical self\\" more than any other opportunities have ever been able to do for me.  It is easy reading, but tough doing;  the agreements themselves sound easy enough when first read, but implementation is a different story.  I believe that had I had this book in young adulthood I would be much further along in my progress toward reaching my full potential.  I recommend that this book be provided for adolescents to fulll grown adults.  It's never too late!!
B000GIWRIY|5.0|Yeah, I'd forgotten just how good this album was. Hadn't listened to it in a while. This remaster does it justice. It's a good one. I'm not one of the people who think Tull went up and down. I always loved Anderson and any variant of Tull. It's all good. It really is. But this is one of the better ones. Very good. Brings back old, old memories. All Tull fans (and even non-Tull fans) need this one.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|Well, let me start by acknowledging that this movie was not well received by the fandom and to state that I've been a fan since the early 70's so, I am qualified to express my opinion and this is that: ST:Nemesis is a very good  movie. <br /> <br />Spoilers ahead. For me this movie is special because it's the farewell to the cast of the ST: The Next Generation crew, it's their last movie and we have to mourn the death of Data too, but at the same time there is the promise of the survival of his personality thru the memory download to his 'brother' B-4. Thus, the sadness that one feels, immediately transforms into optimism when B-4 begins to hum the song that Data sang at the wedding of 'Mrs & Mr Troi' and then as the camera does a scanning shoot of the Enterprise-E in the space-dock and we listen to the Star Trek Fanfare, excitement takes you and, you applaud, at least this is what I did when I watched the movie in the movie theater. <br /> <br />I want to mention that the female Romulan captain results noteworthy, you first obtain the impression that she is just another weakling underling, but she is a strong woman and she has morale, that's why she alerts the Romulans of the error that they are about to do via the actions of Shinzon, and then she takes two Birds of Prey to go after Shinzon, and tries to stop him from using the 'Scimitar' against the Earth. I would have liked to see them both, Picard and she, having their toast. I liked this female Romulan. <br /> <br />Do not let the negative critics influence you, ST:Nemesis is highly enjoyable.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|My friend introduced me to this band with the album \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" and because I loved Green Day.  Since then I was hooked.  I love this new album for it's darkness and irreverence.  I look forward to see how this band matures and evolves.
B000E33VWW|4.0|The film was enjoyable and treated the subject with some depth rather than a standard Hollywood gloss.  The empathy Capote had with Perry Smith came across as a genuine synergy.  I found the issue of profiting from another persons misfortune, to the point of using the misfortune to advantage, while touched on, was not as deeply explored. <br /> <br />The most grating aspect of the film was Capote's voice, at times completely incomprehensible.  While Seymour Hoffman obviously strives for authenticity, the difficulty I had with hearing and understanding what was said, detracted from my enjoyment of the film.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This album blew me away! When I saw Gerard perform The Black Parade and Cancer on SNL, I was mezmerized. The album is brilliant, raw beautiful truth, and I love it! I teach eighth grade English, so I had my students analyze both songs in class, and then played the SNL tape. I am married to a songwriter (Tom Stahl and the Dangerfields) who is releasing his eighth CD next month, and I have a 14 year old son OBSESSED with music- The Mars Volta, Beck, Wilco, Radiohead, Bright Eyes, Neutral Milk Hotel, the Flaming Lips, Pearl Jam, Green Day, Racounteurs, Sonic Youth, Beatles, Bob Dylan,The Who, Replacements, Talking Heads, Elvis Costello, Ramones, Dead Kennedys, Queens of the Stone Age, Franz Ferdinand, Grateful Dead, etc. I have heard it ALL, and I believe this is the album of the year. This is their moment, and I hope they enjoy it. I hope they play Lollapalooza next August in Chicago, or come somewhere near Buffalo! Please!!! I also gave this cd to my four sisters, and they are addicted to it too. I can't stop playing it- especially \\"Teenagers\\" on the way to teach middle school every day! Gerard- you are a star, and the band are geniuses, and I can totally see you as Peter Pan. :)
B000AP04KQ|4.0|this movie is an absolute classic and holds up to repeated viewings. <br />I would have liked more extra features but all in all a great film and probably the first one to show Jennifer Aniston's fine touch with comedy - a dry wit that had rarely been seen prior to this film.  For those who aren't crazy about her, this is the film to make you love her.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I found myself squealing along with the crowd in the audience of the DVD.  Remembering how I felt when I saw Michael at Berkley, CA.  I love this DVD + CD set.  I now have a sort of memento of the concert that I attended and Michael sounds and looks even better in person.  SQUEAL! SQUEAL! SQUEAL! ;D
0553381407|5.0|I've read many books on dealing with parent issues and this is one of the best, mainly because the author explains why we do not have to \\"forgive\\" our parents. Sometimes it's impossible. There are good examples of toxic parent/child relationships that deal with emotional and verbal abuse, not just the more egregious sexual abuse. Reading about the lives of other people and their parents will help many people realize they are not alone and that they too can overcome any difficulties with their parents - either by developing a more mature and healthy relationship or just learning to let them go.
0689878451|5.0|This is a great book about diversity and acceptance. We keep it on the coffee table.
B00007K02F|5.0|I have seen every version of Jane Eyre available.  This version ranks near the top of the list, if not at the top.  One cannot decide whether to view a movie based on other's reviews, and some of which on this particular version were disparaging.  How disappointed I would have been if I had allowed those discouraging remarks to guide me in viewing the movie.  The principal players interacted on intimate levels, the photography was superb, the scenes flowed seamlessly into each another and the essential elements of the book were shown.  I enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br />
B000HWXS2S|5.0|This album is amazing...Slower but very epic!!You do feel like you're getting ready for battle.It's a very melodic album.     Valhall Awaits Me pumps you up, never gets boring.Every song is amazing.  Cry Of The Blackbirds in my opinion is the best song on the album.
0792164903|5.0|Although the story had been changed from the original, it was still wonderful to watch due to the amazing Johnny Depp.  He is a feast for the eyes.  The photography was wonderful and added tension to the story.  The combination of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp is sheer chemistry - hope they continue working together.  This should be in your collection if you are a Johnny Depp fan.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I really loved this movie.  The background notes especially tell the type of problems our country went through during the 1860s.  Daniel Day Lewis & the rest of the cast were just so true to life that I was in awe.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  I recommend this to all who are interested in the history of New York, from the 5 points perspective. Martin Scorsese really brought this to life.
B00005JPBP|5.0|Exciting piece, a thriller murder mystery sprinkled liberally with science fiction (or is it??) From Tesla to Houdini, these \\"magicians\\" fight each other for the stage spotlight, with consequences to themselves and those they love.  Revenge is a \\"dish best served cold\\" (Kahn-Star Trek II, Shakespeare.)
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Meatloaf has done it again.  It is a great album and fun to listen to.  It has something for everyone, rock and ballads and true to heart music.  A must buy for Meatloaf fans or anyone wanting to listen to one of the greatest singers of our time!
0812932293|5.0|I bought \\"Losing My Virginity\\" after reading and enjoying his latest book \\"Screw It, Let's Do It\\", which is a quick read... I wanted to know more about his life. <br /> <br />As with \\"Screw It, Let's Do It\\", he covers his life from early childhood to business mogul. \\"Losing My Virginity\\" contains a lot more details though. Although it is probably impossible to understand how hard Branson worked to get where he is, he does a good job of telling the story of how he started out, how he struggled in his early days, the many disappointments he had, and the successes they had that eventually snowballed into the business empire that Virgin is today. <br /> <br />By his own admission, Branson is not an academically brilliant man. He's just a regular guy who goes after what he wants with all he has. He doesn't let failures along the way derail him from achieving his goals. <br /> <br />This book is a great read that I highly recommend.
B000002GVO|4.0|This has 4 stone cold rock classics on it - Hotel California, New Kid in Town, Life in the Fast Lane and Victim of Love. For these songs alone the album deserves 4 stars. The rest I can pretty much do without. I'm not a big fan of the slower songs sung by Don Henley, such as Wasted Time and The Last Resort - he sounds much better singing the grittier rock songs. The guitar work throughout is amazing - i still get chills listening to the guitar solo on H.C. even after all this time. Felder and Walsh sound great together. I hear they're recording a new album for release late this year and it's a shame that Felder is no longer in the band. Anyone who plays guitar like he does is going to be missed, if not by the band then definitely by us listeners.
B000FMGTTE|4.0|This was a very good disk overall, but it certainly could have been longer with more of a musical expansion of the film. I still enjoy listening to the music of Superman Returns, but I do believe it could have made a second disk and expand the listening pleasure. Still, it's what we have and it is worth the price which is fairly easy on the wallet.
0440237688|2.0|I've been required to read this book for my reading class. We took quizzes on  <br />it and discussed the book. I really didn't enjoy reading what I read because it's <br />about the future with a perfect society. Why would someone want to live in that <br />kind of place? No competition, and you're assigned your future job, your child(s), <br />and your spouse. How Pathetic. What's the point in life if everything has to be  <br />perfect. No wars? No memories? I'm glad to have my memories and I don't want to <br />forget them. The only reason why I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 is <br />because Lois did a good job on descibing the characters and what's going on. I  <br />just don't like the storyline. Now, her other book 'Number the Stars' was fantastic <br />and I rate that a 5 because it's also based on true events. It definately <br />creates mood in the story of sarrow and pain. But 'The Giver' shouldn't have recieved <br />that award. But that's just my opinion.
B00005RFVL|5.0|A friend of mine gave me this CD and I never listened to it until one day.  I loved it so much I went out and bought it for a couple friends of mine.  It's just a great, fun CD.
0375831002|5.0|Truly one of the BEST books I have ever read!!  Loved how the story was narrated by \\"Death\\".  I was crying my eyes out at the end!! What memorable and lovable characters!  A wonderfully different \\"Anne Frank\\" perspective of Hitler, the Holocaust, and life in Germany during WWII.  I am recommending this book to everyone, and have already shared my copy and bought new ones for friends!  I'd give it 10 stars!!!
B000E1MTYU|5.0|I am a big fan of the terminator series. I think the story is one of the best ever concieved as it has alot to do with whats really going on in the world. Will artificial intelligence ever reach a point were it becomes self aware? Its a very interesting question and I think that is one of the reasons why it has been so successful as a series. This is also one of the only trilogys that I feel still has alot of potential for future movies. I think we really need a terminator film that is actually set in the future where the terminators live and with the recent announcment of T4 most likly being made, hopefully we will get just that.<br /><br />As for T3, it is without a doubt the worst film of the 3 but with that being said I still really enjoyed this film. Alot of the people that disliked it did so because they said it went back on everything that was established in T2. I am not one of these people and I really like the aspect of this film that turned around and said Judgement day is inevitable. Its without a doubt the single best twist to this entire story in my opinion because in reality it really is. Technology will continue to drive forward with computers getting better and better and no matter what you do to stop it, someone else will pop up and continue the research and development. Its basically where we are today with technology. There is no stopping the advancment that we see taking place on almost a daily basis. If one company were to stop develpment in a certain area, someone else would just pop up and take that companies or persons place.<br /><br />Anyways that is really why I liked this film so much. It took the series in a completly new direction by stating that there was no way to stop it while the first two movies focused on what to do to actually stop it. With that being said this movie had its flaws and it just isnt on the same level that T1 & T2 are on. Its still a highly entertaining action film with some great performances and a great ending that perfectly sets up the Terminator film that I am dying to see, the one set in the wasteland of the future. Hats off to Arnold as well who really busted his butt to get into killer shape for this film so he wouldnt look any different than he did during the first 2 films. He pulled it off without a hitch. Just another testament to that guys ability to work his body and get into killer shape.<br /><br />Anyways on to the HD-DVD...<br /><br />There were a few people on the HD forums that were disappointed in this transfer as it didnt show the amount of detail that some of the better transfers have shown. While it is true that this transfer doesnt have the detail present in some of the other transfers like Aeon Flux, Batman Begins and Sahara, it is still a great looking film and a big improvment overthe SD version. One of the thing you have to take into account is the fact that certain films just translate over to HD with much better results than others do. T3 was shot using Super35 and to sum up the Super35 process, it doesnt use as much area on the negative that regular anamorphic does thus you have a slight loss of detail compared to those that use standard anamorphic. With Super35 you also have to make intermediate prints to get the transfer onto a film that can be used in theatres. Everytime you make an intermediate print you lose resolution and detail. So to sum it up as I really dont want to get into a big technical discussion on Super35 and the other film processes. Super35 just does not have the image quality that regular anamorphic does period. T3 is a super35 film thus when you transfer the t3 film onto HD it just isnt going to look as sharp as a lot of the other films that arent Super35. Some of the main characteristics of Super35 are increased grain and less detail, both which are present in the HD transfer of T3.<br /><br />With that being said, T3 still looks great and is a vast improvment over the SD version. I am actually a fan of increased graain as long as it doesnt look noisy which in this case it doesnt. It adds a disticnt look to the film. As much as some people would love for every film to look like the Batman Begins of Aeon Flux transfer, its just a bad idea. To make evey film look the same would be like taking all of the artistic possibilites of film and throwing them down the toilet. Its good that films look different because it would be a very boring world of cinema if everything looked the same. Just image what Tim Burtons Sleepy Hollow would look like if he used the same film and process used for Batman Begins. It would have absolutly destroyed the film and would have taken all of the spooky atmoshpere away. He purposly used cross processing to make all of the colors washed out and to make it more grainy and more contrasty. That film also looks great on HD-DVD but like T3 doesnt have a transfer that shows as much detail as some of the other transfers.<br /><br />The sooner everyone relaizes that not every film is supposed to have incredible detail, vivid colors, & natural contrast. Films differ by the processes used to make the film and those differences in process equate to a difference in characteristics in a HD transfer. You have to educate yourself on just what processes were used for each particular film and only then can you make an educated critique of a particular films HD transfer.<br /><br />To sum this up, T3 is certainly not a disc you want to pop in when your trying to show someone just how much detail can be seen in a HD movie. It was filmed in Super35 thus it was never trying to be a film that had a crazy amount of detail in the print. With that being said, T3 is a great transfer that is accurate to its master print. Its a big improvment over the SD version and its a great film which hopefully leads the series to a 4th film which is set in the future. I know I wont ever be done with the idea of a new Terminator flick until that particular story has been told. Here is to hoping they get around to making that happen.<br /><br />OC..aain as long as it doesnt look noisy which in this case it doesnt. It adds a disticnt look to the film.

0743289412|5.0|Although it was a bit difficult to get into this book at the very beginning it was well worth it.  A great story with some very memorable characters.  Just like so many of Stephen King novels it pulls you in and takes you for a very memorable, exhilerating and, yes, rather strange, ride.   <br /> <br />Although some King fans might not like this book because it is a partial love story I think it is definitely one of King's finest works, right up there with the Stand and The Green Mile.  Having been a fan of King for almost as many years as he has been writing, and having read most of his works, I would highly recommend this book.  In fact, I just gave it to my daughter to read - she is slowly becoming a second generation King fan.  I am certain she will like this book as well. <br /> <br />I won't re-tell the story, as so many other reviewers have already done that here, however I do want to say that I cried my way through the last few pages of this book when \\"Lisey's Story\\" is finally revealed.  What a marvelous storyteller King is.  I really felt like I was there with Lisey under the tree and with Scott when he was ten and alone with his dad.  And to feel the love that Scott had for Lisey by telling her that story.......well, I just start tearing up all over again.  Ok, so it isn't the usual \\"I just finished Stephen King and will now need to sleep with the lights on for several nights\\" reaction that I have to the ending of his books but that doesn't make it a terrible book.  A GREAT book is one that pulls you into the story, one that you can feel happening while you read it, and that is what this story truly does.  I loved it!! <br /> <br />Well done, Mr. King.  Many thanks to you for such a wonderful and memorable story!!
B000E1MTY0|5.0|I purchased an HD-DVD player with this title in mind and it doesnt disappoint. This is by far one of the very best HD-DVD's on the market to date and even tho the brand is somewhat new, that is still saying something as there are a bunch of beautiful releases already. This is without a doubt a reference quality disc both in terms of the picture, Audio and in terms of extras and what the HD format can do that regular DVD's cant.<br /><br />First the picture and what a picture it is. It is a flawless transfer with absolutly stunning detail. The amount of grain is perfect with no noticable noise & no edge enhancment was visable throught the entire film. The skin tones are beautiful and the colors accurate. One of the most impressive aspects of the picture is the rendition of the color black. Black levels are perfect with plenty of detail seen in the shadows. The scene where he is spraypainting his batsuit with the black spraypaint has to be seen to be believed. I dont think I have ever seen the color black presented so perfectly in a home movie before and there are alot of dark scenes in this film so that is one of the reasons why this transfer is so beautiful. There isnt a single thing I would change with the picture. My hats off to the people that were in charge of this transfer, its one of the best I have ever seen.<br /><br />As for the audio, the Dolby Digital Plus track is amazing but the TrueHD track is where this baby really takes off. if you own the Toshiba A1 you need to update to the 2.0 firmware udate to be able to use the TreHD and its everybit worth updating. The Batman begins soundtrack is an awsome one in general, very heavy in bass it just a wonderful mix that adds an extra oopmh to the action scenes like any good soundtrack should. On the TrueHD track it sounded simply stunning. Dialogue was easily heard without sacrificing any of the other sounds and effects. Overall its the best TrueHD track so far and that again is saying something as Training Day had an awsome TrueHD track, it just couldnt beat out the power this soundtrack had.<br /><br />As for the extras, were presented with all of the extras from the 2 disc special edition plus the HD-DVD exclusive IME track (In-Movie Experience). There were some people who complained that this IME track wasnt as good as some of the others because some of the pauses between speakers were fairly long. I have to 100% disagree with this. When people on the IME track are speaking non stop and the IME track runs non stop you are never really given a chance to get into the movie as all of your attention is focused on the IME screen. With Batman Begins they made it so the IME track was active during the less important and less exciting scenes and inactive during the exciting and important scenes. What this did was allow you to actually get involved with the movie while at the same time get information from the IME track during the more boring and less important parts of the movie. They absolutly did this on purpose and you can tell alot of thought went into when the IME should be active and when it shouldnt. In the end it was unlike anything I have ever experinced before with a commentary track and when the movie was over I had felt like I had not only just seen the IME track but I had also watched the movie. It was awsome and really has me sold on IME. I thought that IME might be kind of gimmicky when Ifirst got into HD-DVD but it couldnt be farther from the truth. IME is the future of commentary tracks and there really is no comparison between IME and the old style of commentary.<br /><br />So to sum this up, Batmen Begins is a must buy if you own a HD-DVD player. Its one of the best super hero movies ever made and this HD-DVD transfer is the best it has ever looked. Put a big dose of amazing sound and a big dose of IME on top of that and you have what is arguably the best release so far for HD-DVD.<br /><br />Its releases like this that make me happy I got into HD-DVD rightoff the bat without worrying about the damned format war. as long as HD-DVD keeps performing at this level, I will be an HD-DVD supporter till the end.<br /><br />OrangeCrushD-DVD right off the bat without worrying about the damned format war. as long as HD-DVD keeps performing at this level, I will be an HD-DVD supporter till the end. <br /> <br />OrangeCrush
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is superb. It's not canned science fiction. It is intelligent, well written, and leaves you wanting more. <br /> <br />If you have not seen the Firefly TV series that this movie was based I highly recommend that you check it out as well.
B000003BEV|5.0|In 1967, EVERYBODY went psychedelic: Cream, Pink Floyd, Hendrix, Traffic, the Doors, and all the rest of them, including, yes, the Beatles and the Stones.  <br />So this is not the Stones \\"copying the Beatles\\".  <br />The Stones (led by Brian Jones) wore extravagant multi-colored trans-gender clothes when the Beatles were still in their trite Brian Epstein-imposed uniforms. They were into the ritual music of Jajouka, in the mountains of Morocco, a good 20 years before \\"World music\\" happened.  <br />This album is just an expression of what the Stones were about, and too bad if it does'nt fit the narrow clichéd commercially accepted limits of what's to be thought of as \\"Rolling Stones music\\". <br />Every song here is beautiful: great lyrics, great melodies, great arrangements, great playing and singing. <br />And the overall atmosphere is unique and extremely poetic, a kind of ominous futuristic World Music. <br />This is one of the Stones' 4 album masterpieces, right along \\"Aftermath\\", \\"Begger's Banquet\\" and \\"Let it Bleed\\". <br />(I know I'll get crucified for leaving out \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile on Main Street\\", but I'll stick to my guns.)
0618526412|4.0|Because I'd read all of McCullers works long ago, this was purchased for a young friend, unfamiliar with the author.   She found it profound,  enjoyed the unique characters and the way they were presented.
B000J10ERO|5.0|This movie was simply AWESOME!! I ((like many other people the world over)) am a huge Superman fan. I first met Superman when I was three years old when my parents introduced me to Superman:The Movie and the three that came after it. Ever since then he has been my bigest role model. And I had always been upset that I had been too young to witness the Superman movies on the big screen, so when I learned that they were finally bringing Superman back to the big screen...I became exteremly over joyed. I would finally get my chance to sit in a darkend movie theater and hear the Superman theme blar out of the speakers as I watched my hero save the world.  <br /> <br />And I was not disspointed with it at all...the speical effects were mind blowing, the story was heart felt and well written, all of the actors played their characters perfectly. And I quite enjoyed hearing Marlon Brando's voice once again as he uttered those famous lines he had said in Superman: The movie. I was both impressed and creeped out by how much Brandon Routh sounded like Chirstopher Reeve at times. There were parts that made me tear up and parts that had me shouting for our hero. I can not wait to buy this movie on dvd to add to my Superman collection. Great job to everyone who took part in making this movie a reality.  I'm looking forward to the sequal.  <br /> <br />Welcome home Superman, may you never leave us again.
B0002MJT0I|5.0|Got to be one of the best films in the past few years.I remember it got excellent reviews in the UK when it was released,but i avoided it as zombie stuff is a bit too icky for me.Was I missing a wonderful film! It is well written and directed,has a superb cast,it made me laugh,it made me sad,then it made me laugh again.I think i watched it a few times in as many days,which is a rare thing.How many films do you watch that makes you want to watch it again and you enjoy it as much each time you watch?  <br />If you liked the Bohemian Rhapsody moment in Wayne`s World (a classic moment of modern cinema!),you`ll love the bar scene with Queen playing and the gang trying to stop a zombie to the music. <br />If you`re bored of the supercool, macho hero who always knows what to do in a crisis ,this film is you`ve been waiting for. <br />The funniest film in years.
0385336691|4.0|i'm not sure why this character is so engaging.  but he is.  there are only a few authors whose books i buy in hardback rather than waiting for the soft cover but lee childs is one.  i wouldn't call this his very best reacher novel, but as always it's interesting, intense and a great way to pass an evening or two.

0060555661|5.0|Benjamin Graham's work is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who is serious about investing in the stock market.  The advice is timeless, but has nicely updated examples in the revised addition. I can see why Graham is revered by his former students and many others.
0618680004|5.0|This book is not simply a recapitulation of earlier works on the same subject.  Nor does it fail to take the subject seriously, as suggested by many of the (negative) reviewers on Amazon.  On the later point, Dawkins deftly iterates through a broad range of arguments both for and against the existence of God, beginning with Saint Thomas Aquinas back in the beginning of the last millennium. Dawkins clearly knows the subject well and has obviously put great effort into carefully handling each argument for the reader.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly, I found Dawkins far more entertaining to read than most, when dealing with this subject matter.  I will always hold Tom Paine dear to heart (and I recommend Age of Reason of course), but Dawkins is more of joy to read by far.<br /><br />This was an excellent book and the first in many months in which I have found intellectual enjoyment.
0684135051|5.0|This is an excellent book for someone who wants to break free of the \\"knitting pattern\\" mold and use their creativity to design their own seamless sweaters. Ms. Zimmerman's candid, humorous narrative and instructions are empowering and make you feel that there are  no \\"mistakes\\" in knitting. She give terrific, easy to follow guidlines that give you the freedom to put together whatever yarns, stitches or color combinations you can think up and make into a sweater that fits any size. Its perfect for someone who is an intermediate knitter and needs a little push to do their own thing. This book, plus a basic stitch pattern book are all you need to start designing whatever your imagination can come up with. Plus, if you have never knitted a seamless sweater, you will never want to knit a sweater in pieces and stitch it up again after making one!
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Meat sounds better than ever! Desmond Child did a spectacular job with the songwriting and the production, inmaculate! Just as most have said, it's a great final to the trilogy, can't say it's better or worst than Bat I or II, but it's definetly up there! A lot darker and harder, with lots more guitar solos, which i love! Having Brian May and Steve Vai is a nice bonus too!  <br />I've read people complaining it's too long, WTF?!?! Would you prefer a 35 min. album? With an album with at least 10 amazing songs and 4 really good ones, you can't complain!. <br />Great job Meat Loaf.
0743277708|5.0|2nd time I've read this beautiful novel.  It is captivating to the point of chores not getting done.  You're there in the warren and you've become one of the family.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Ignore the \\"color\\" designation that Amazon refuses to fix; the movie itself is indeed in black and white as it should be.  Moreover, it has been restored, or cleaned-up, call it what you will, an incredible improvement over the prior version I have (THX Artisan 2001).  Further I went right to the scene where George and Clarence get thrown out of the bar, then I watched the old one just to make sure; the \\"jump\\", or bad splice, whatever the issue was, is not visible to this viewer anymore.  Maybe they compressed it somewhat here, or some other computer trickery; regardless, it is now a smooth flowing movement!! One bad point, naturally Paramount HAD to contaminate this \\"Special Edition\\" with a preview of one of their other, completely unrelated movies- Shame on them!.  Everthing else- feature-wise, appears the same.  JUST FOR THE CLEAN VERSION OF THE MOVIE, IT IS WELL WORTH THE UPGRADE!!! BUY IT!!
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Dull, dull, dull. <br />If I could have submitted a review and given ZERO stars I would have. <br />Pointless.
0790729644|5.0|A realistic Western about a man that can never get over his past wild and wicked life.
B0000214F0|5.0|This movie is an excellent example of depravity and corruption during the days of the likes of Caligula and Nero it is very graphic film but I feel that for the mature film buff who is not a prude this film takes a look into the sleazy and violent side of history during the Roman days.
0790729369|4.0|Acting was great and the story was quite believable and natural. <br />It showed the conflicts that people go through trying to understand why a deceased person they loved did some of thing they did.

B000G73UEU|2.0|It was irritating to hear the singers butcher Cohen's poetic songs.  Like other reviewers I wonder why Bono had to be there?  It was nice that the singers paid a tribute to the man but it's unfortunate that they took it one step further by singing his songs.  Some of the renditions are simply BAD ... like Bird on a wire!  Please ...
B000FQ4M58|4.0|Bat Out of Hell III has been released and like a horror movie sequel which has to have more and more murders, so too has Bat III expanded from the 7 songs on Bat I to the 14 songs on Bat III. Perhaps without coincidence Jim Steinman has provided 7 songs for this installment but they are more of a mixed-bag than the 7 pure classics from the original Bat album.  <br /> <br />\\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" and \\"Bad For Good\\" are 2 of Steinman's best and Meat does a wonderful job of making them each his own. \\"Cry To Heaven\\" has nice moments but has the overall feel of a work still in progress. Both \\"The Future Ain't What It Used To Be\\" and \\"If It Ain't Broke Break It\\" are both just sort of loud and ranting and lack that certain Steinman lyrical style which exudes from his best stuff. \\"Seize the Night\\" sounds exactly like what it is - piece-meal (with the instrumental beginning of the Storm, intro of Come with Me and parts of Seize the Night) from the musical Dance of the Vampires. \\"In The Land of the Pig, the Butcher Is King\\" is the final Steinman song and although still a good song seems the most in need of the Steinman production refinement and is the only track upon which Desmond Child lacked a feel for the song. <br /> <br />Now the \\"other 7\\" tracks on Bat III. \\"The Monster Is Loose\\" is a good rocker that Meatloaf gets to really let loose on (pardon the pun). \\"What About Love\\", \\"Cry Over Me\\" and  \\"Alive\\" are all tracks to listen to once and then just skip over. \\"If God Could Talk\\" and the all-too-short \\"Monstro\\" are nice songs that help round out the album. The surprise of the album is definitely \\"Blind As a Bat\\" which is the standout track and is one of the few exceptions to the rule that other people should never try to write a Steinman song (seriously, how many times has Diane Warren tried to impersonate a Steinman song and failed?)  <br /> Overall a very good album with enough filler songs by quantity that hit on enough high notes (thanks Meat) to make a goodclose to the Bat Trilogy (that is of course if the 3oth anniversary Bat CD prove to be untrue). <br />

0792164903|4.0|The movie \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is aptly named.  While its characters are based on the those depicted in Washington Irving's \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\\" and the tale takes place in Sleepy Hollow, New York, the story varies greatly from the novel.  Tim Burton's approach gives a new twist to the tale, and the performances by the leading actors are remarkable.  The added features provide insight to the making of the film.  However, it is not for the faint of heart.  While the beheadings aren't over bloody due to the \\"power\\" of the horseman's sword, they are explicit and may not be suitable for young viewers.  Also, for anyone who is a stickler on details, while the panoramic views of the Hudson River at the beginning and end of the film are breathtaking, Sleepy Hollow is on the OTHER side of the river.  Overall I greatly enjoyed the movie and recommend the film to those who enjoy horror with a twist of \\"gallows humor,\\" Johnny Depp and Tim Burton films.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|THE ONLY COMMENT I HAVE OF JOHN MAYER'S NEW ALBUM IS THAT ITS IS HIS BEST COMPLETE ALBUM EVER!!!  YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS ALBUM.  EVERY SONG, INCLUDING HIS \\"BOLD AS LOVE\\" COVER, IS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL.  I'VE SEEN JOHN IN CONCERT QUITE A FEW TIMES AND EVERY TIME HE TRIED TO PLAY BLUES GUITAR, HE WOULD TOTALLY LOOSE THE AUDIENCE, BEGGING HIM TO PLAY HIS PREVIOUS STYLE OF MUSIC.  WELL, I THINK THIS IS HIS COMING OUT PARTY AND I REALLY LOVE HIS NEW BLUES STYLE GUITAR PLAYING.  I LOK FORWARD TO MORE OF THIS STYLE OF MUSIC FROM ONE THE BEST MUSICIANS OF OUR TIME.
0345451325|5.0|Halo the fall of reach takes place in the years 2525-2555 and is about, how a select group of you kids where taken away from there homes at the age of 6 years old to become a part of a top secret Military project, Codename Spartan. These kids where then taken into heavy Military training where they eventually became super soldiers. The story is mostly based around one Spartan in particular called Spartan 117(Jon)/(masterchief). Spartan 117 and his team have started a campaign against the covenant, and this book basically explains how he and his team overcome the covenant and what becomes of his team. This book is the pre sequel to the Halo combat evolved video game for the Xbox.  <br /> The Story line of the book is also very interesting it explains how the Xbox video game came to be and also how only one Spartan was left to be. There are quite a few interesting parts of the book, having to do with there first encounter with the covenant or the battles they have with the covenant. One of my personal favorite parts of the book is at the very end when the huge fleet of hundreds and hundreds of covenant ships are trying to destroy planet reach and Spartan 117 and his team must save planet reach from the covenant. And it also explains what happen to Spartan 117 and his team. <br /> Overall this book was very interesting to me and I would recommend it to any one who is in to action, Blood and gore and I would also advise this game to anyone who plays the halo series on the Xbox. This is defiantly a must read boo for anyone who likes the Halo video game and wants to get a better idea about the storyline. I would also recommend this book because of how well detailed and written this book is. Once you pick this book up you won be able to put it down. This book was the first book to show me that reading can be enjoyable even if you don't like reading. So overall I would recommend this book to almost everybody who plays the game, likes action books, and any one who wants to know more about how they started off with 50 Spartans and eventually ended up with one. Code Name: SPARTAN 117 <br />
B000063UR2|5.0|I found the prices, speed of delivery, and condition of my purchase to be very good. I had seen this movie as a teenager and remembered the awesome fx. After watching it now I still think the fx were excellent! A good story of \\"good and evil\\".
B00005JKN9|4.0|There's a common thread to most of the moderately positive reviews of this film, which tends to be that \\"Gangs of New York\\" is generally well-made and fairly entertaining, but where the hell does it get off being 2 and 3/4 hours long?  I hear that it was originally supposed to be 4 hours long, which is just baffling.  Perhaps at that length it had some elements which made it seem truly expansive, but now it just seems like a severely padded run-of-the-mill revenge story.  Now, mind you, I'm not inherently opposed to lengthy movies or anything like that, but the story here just doesn't seem at all suited for the epic format, as the final product clearly demonstrates.  However, I can't say that the padding isn't fairly interesting, and it's all reasonably involving.  The film looks terrific, has some very cool fight scenes, and the acting is generally excellent apart from DiCaprio.  (And DiCaprio isn't exactly bad here, and he's proven elsewhere that he is a good actor he just isn't given much of anything to do even though he's the main character.)  Daniel Day-Lewis, in particular, is a total hoot as Butcher Bill.  Not exactly the most believable character around, but he's certainly entertaining to watch.  Still, the story is only interesting as spectacle i.e. I never cared about or was even much interested in the characters, and though the film seems to think it's saying something about New York and America or whatever, I don't see it.  And, again, damned if anything actually happens in the middle section of the film.  But I was never bored, so I think it's worth a watch.<br /><br />Grade: B-
B000J10ERO|4.0|Continuity-wise, Superman Returns takes place 5 years after the events of Superman II (1981). Superman has just returned after years of searching deep space for remnants of his native planet Krypton. But, while he was gone, the world had shrugged and continued to spin without him. As Clark Kent, he gets his old job back as mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet. But things are definitely not back to normal. Lois Lane, to his dismay, has moved on. She's now the mother of a young, asthmatic boy and is engaged to Perry White's nephew Richard. She's even won the Pulitzer Prize for her article \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman\\" (ouch!). Lex Luthor, too, is up and about, released from prison due to a technicality: Superman didn't make his court date to testify against him. Lex's new master plan is to use Kryptonian technology to raise a land mass while simultaneously sinking much of the U.S. of A. After all, real estate is where it's at. He also has an ace up his sleeve with regards to the Big Red \\"S\\".<br /><br />So I went to see this movie in deep, hopeful anticipation. I wanted to be able to tell people that it did justice to the Christopher Reeve classics. Afterwards, I walked away somewhat with mixed feelings but, overall, leaning towards the positive. Superman Returns was certainly entertaining and filled with great f/x, but, no, I don't feel it lived up to all the hoop-la (but, then again, it would have to have been just about the perfect film to be worthy of all the monster pre-screening pub it got). While Superman Returns truly is an epic effort, it falls short of Superman I & II. Yes, it has its moments of sheer majesty and scope, but it lacks enough of those quiet, little personal touches that allow the audience to fully connect with the movie. Scenes with Lois and Clark, which, to me, were some of the hallmark moments in Superman I & II, are too few in Superman Returns. Routh should've been given more scenes as Clark Kent as he's the one that grounds Superman to reality and the one whom we usually identify with the most in the film. Also, one of the challenges in doing a Superman flick is ensuring that the Man of Steel has a worthy adversary. This time out, Lex Luthor proves to be a subpar opponent. And how many times can one introduce kryptonite as a weapon?<br /><br />Brandon Routh does a very good job. Yes, it helps that there's a vague resemblance between him and Christopher Reeve. And, yes, Routh channels Reeve in much the same way Ewan McGregor channels Alec Guinness in Star Wars. Routh ably captures Clark Kent's personal quirks and mannerisms, and even sounds eerily like Reeve at times. But Brandon Routh is no Christopher Reeve. Here's the difference: Reeve's Superman had an almost self-deprecating, straight-faced-but-with-a-wink attitude about him. We felt that, while Supes does have abilities beyond those of mortal men, there was still a humanizing element about him that enabled us to put ourselves in his place. But Routh's Superman is so aware of the all-encompassing mission his father had given him that he comes off as somewhat aloof and detached. Oh, he smiles and waves but there isn't that same warmth we felt exuding from Reeve. In Superman I and II, it was Clark Kent who was playing Superman. In Superman Returns, Clark Kent seems to be the disguise.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer goes to great extent in showing the audience what it feels like for Kal-El to co-exist with beings infinitely more fragile than him, and the isolation and loneliness of his unending burden. Singer employs recurring shots of Superman hovering in space, gazing watchfully down on his adopted planet (or sometimes with his eyes close, so as to better focus his superhearing for any plea for aid). Superman's own personal life, in his own mind, must ever take a backseat to his ongoing pursuit of truth, justice and cheesecake.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is not as good as Margot Kidder or Teri Hatcher here, but she has room to grow. She lacks that certain sassiness that is a hallmark of Lois Lane. Given, Lois now has a child and is engaged, and is probably thrown off-keeled by Superman's return. But, still, I longed for that smart-alecky gleam in her eyes. Ah, well. Maybe, next time...Frank Langella is not crusty enough as Perry White, while Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen is forgettable. Eva Marie Saint, whom I loved in North by Northwest, didn't have enough screen time as Martha Kent. Kevin Spacey is on and off as Supe's arch nemesis Lex Luthor. There is one standout scene, though, which takes place on Lex's cruiseship, in which Lex, in traditional villainous, braggadocious fashion, unveils his mad scheme to Lois and then taunts her about Superman's guaranteed inability to foil his plan - this time. Parker Posey as Lex's sidekick chick Kitty is very funny and steals some scenes.<br /><br />So, I do recommend this film: for its sheer grandeur, the sense of nostalgia it invokes, and its sincere striving to be great. The production values are excellent and will make you believe that a Superman can fly at supersonic speeds, wrestle down a space shuttle, and stop a bullet with his eyeball. And this is only Brandon Routh's first try as the Man of Steel and there are sequels undoubtedly planned, so I expect him to grow into this role. Welcome back, Superman. I missed you, man.he lacks that certain sassiness that is a hallmark of Lois Lane. Given, Lois now has a child and is engaged, and is probably thrown off-keeled by Superman's return.

0743298020|5.0|I'm giving this book 5 stars for writing alone ---- language, the writer's very eloguent use of it, the beauty of the words she chooses to tell her story.  <br /> <br />With a creative writing style similar to Sue Monk Kidd's, though a bit more reserved, and a story that reads at first like another book I enjoyed, Shadows of the Wind, this author sets up a gothic tale within a gothic tale - the loner heroine who prefers the company of books to people, the old house, the mystery, but this time without a hero/love interest/male. The love here is for words, stories, and the truth. <br /> <br />Thirteenth Tale can be, at times, confusing for the reader as it progresses. But the author does tie things together in the end, and readers with honed detective skills might be able to figure the mystery out. <br /> <br />Though I prefered the execution of the story over the actual story itself, I could not put this down. I looked forward to my meager reading times. This makes the book a five-star read and worth passing on to anyone who might listen.
B0001I562I|4.0|The flight of the Navigator; we begin our journey on the Fourth of July, 1978 with a Frisbee Dog Contest.  Our hero is your run-of-the-mill 12-year-old boy named David Freeman (Joey Cramer). He is there with his family. He's got a mother, a father, a pesky younger brother, and an unspectacular dog named Bruiser.  <br /> <br />That evening, our older brother hero, goes into the woods to find his younger brother so that the family can begin their Independence Day celebrations. Wandering in the woods, he looses his balance and falls into a ravine. He gets up, brushes himself off after what appears to be just minutes. But it hasn't been just minutes; it is actually eight years later. David hasn't changed in any way, but the rest of the world has.  <br /> <br />Now it's 1986. An older couple now lives in his house, his younger brother is now his older brother, and his favorite TV show, \\"Starsky and Hutch\\" is off the air! David doesn't know what's happened or where he's been. It's a mystery that fascinated specialists are more than willing to try to unravel.  <br /> <br />One of these fascinated specialists is Dr. Faraday (Howard Hesseman), who makes it clear to David and his family that NASA and it's top-of-the-line resources are their only shot at figuring out what has happened. David agrees to spend 48 hours at a NASA base, so that he can be tested by NASA's best people in a search for answers.  <br /> <br />At the same time Dr. Faraday and the NASA specialists are troubled by an apparently unrelated discovery of what appears to be a spaceship. This additional discovery causes Dr. Faraday to decide that David will need to stay longer than promised to finish his tests.  <br /> <br />David, unhappy with the delays decides to escape, and with the help of Carolyn McAdams (Sarah Jessica Parker), a friendly young intern at the base, he is successful. His getaway quickly takes him to Dr. Faraday's problem spaceship, and on his own he begins to make sense of the some of the strange things, dreams and voices, he has been experiencing.  <br /> <br />The spaceship is commanded by a robotic intelligence (voiced by Paul Reubens), who David names Max. Max needs help from David, specifically the contents of his brain. David wants answers from Max and to escape from the curious scientists. Their needs come together and they take off together on a unique and thrilling journey through space and time.  <br /> <br /> Flight of the Navigator is brilliant. All of its elements seem to work like a well oiled machine. The extremely clever premise is played to perfection, thanks to skillful crafting and flawless casting.. The film has an intriguing premise, and sets a fast and flawless pace that it never departs from.  <br /> <br />In the lead role, Joey Cramer has just the right amount of curiosity and charisma to make the protagonist fully likable. Supporting performances from the family members all seem to hit the right notes. The robotic character, Max, is a lot of fun. Once he acquires some personality from a mind-mining procedure, he begins to sound quite a bit like the very best of Pee Wee Herman.  <br /> <br />The films script and direction deserve highest possible praise. These and a great sense of humor helps to distinguish Flight of the Navigator from other strong science fiction films of the late '70s and early '80s. While its time-travel tale is a serious one, it deftly uses comedy to enhance the adventure and to crank up the entertainment value. In many of the best ways, the film calls to mind the perfect blend of Back to the Future, without feeling the least bit derivative. <br />

B000ENC6XM|5.0|Everyone knows the plot, but some maybe unaware of just how incredible the HD-DVD disc looks and sounds.  The bar has been raised and a standard has been established.  This IS the best HD-DVD transfer thus far.  When displayed over a 1080p television, I dare you to find a flaw in the transfer.  Warner Bros. has truly given CONSTANTINE a pristine transfer and a Dobly TrueHD audio soundtrack to boot!  I highly recommend this disc for anyone looking for a reference disc for their collection.  CONSTANTINE is perfect 5-star rating!
0451529065|2.0|First of all the subtitle has been wrongly interpreted.  Some creationists have decided to use this title to expose Darwin as a racists.  He may be, I have not read \\"The Descent of Man\\" yet.  The origin of species talks very little of man.  It is a book of observations and study.  It concentrates on how plant life, has by selection, brought forth all the species we see today.  The survival of the fittest through millions of years by gradual change.  Darwin covers his beloved pigeons in depth.  I agree with him that all the different types of pigeons we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon.  This is called variation of kind.  We see this in just about every living creature and flora.  The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird).  Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty.     There is no doubt there is a tremendous amount of work that went into his book.  It is a difficult read.  I would rather have read the dictionary.  One does need to know his enemy.  Darwin is not the originator of \\"evolution.\\"  There are many who came before him, since the dawn of time.  He was influenced by numerous men of his time, some being more radical.  Darwin was nothing new, he just made it \\"hip.\\"  What he started has turned into the secular humanism the world has adopted.  I don't think he meant for this disease to spread like it has.  From his writings I understand him as an agnostic, but doubtful.  I believed he struggled with the possibly of a deist.  It is safe to say it was his only ambition till his dying day to prove \\"evolution\\" as proof of our existence.  What of the missing fossil record?, he new they would be found.  He was a confusing man.     150 years later and there still has been no intermediate fossils found to prove the case.  In fact we are discovering more that validates creation.    The theory of evolution causedDarwin to loose his faith and his experience has been repeated in countless lives.  Evolution is an acid that eats away at the mind, a cancer.     One only needs to open the pages to Michael Behe's book, \\"Darwin's Black Box\\", to understand the futility of the evolutionary theory.  The engines of life at the molecular level are so complex that there leaves no other possibility than a creator of the universe.  There should be no excuse.     Wish you well,  Scott

B00014NE62|5.0|<br />One of the other reviewers of this film mentioned that this was important to them when they were struugling with issues relating to their own sexuality. I too have a belief that most lesbian and gay people have either a film or a book that is important to them in their formative 'coming out' stages - Maurice was mine. I sneaked into a late night showing in central London with the woman who was, and still is my best friend: and at that time there was no way it was going to be screened in working class South London where we were from.  <br /> <br />Essentially the film covers the gradual 'awakening' of Maurice (played by James Wilby) to his true - gay - self starting in his late teenage years and ending sometime one supposes in his mid-twenties. Maurice is from an upper-middle class family and is exposed to all the privileges that go with being from that background. At university he meets Clive (Hugh Grant), an intense, intelligent and handsome young man from the landed gentry. After a few clumsy blunders and misunderstandings the two embark upon a secret relationship (well it has to be). Clive though is unwilling to partake in a sexual aspect to the relationship - thinking that it would 'bring them down'.  <br /> <br />After several years of a close, but sexually unfulfilling relationship a mutual aquaintance of Maurice and Clive is caught soliciting a soldier outside a pub. At the subsequent trial he is essentially stripped of the reputation, career and status he enjoyed as a member of the upper class. This is a turning point in the relationship between Maurice and Clive, and Clive calls an end to the relationship in a particularly emotional sequence. Maurice gets on with life, existing from a day to day level, but emotionally his life is barren.  <br /> <br />Sometime later - one assumes a year or two has passed with no contact, Maurice receives a phone call from Clive who has an announcement to make. Clive and Maurice are reunited - platonically - but not reconciled. While staying at Clive's country estate he meets Alec Scudder, the under-gamekeeper, a bit of rural, working-class, rough trade who fulfills Maurice in the way Clive never did. The remainder of the film deals with Maurice and Clive dealing with new states of affairs and has as much to do with issues of classism as it does with homosexuality.  <br /> <br />The ending scene of the film for me is the most powerful - combined with the evocative music and the symbolic closing of the shutter windows it is very movingly done and always brings a lump to my throat whenever I watch it. Clive and Maurice bring a finality to their relationship at all levels, neither seems happy or satisfied, it seems that happiness for both hangs by a thread. Clive has sacrificed complete fulfillment in order to safeguard his position and wealth, Maurice has sacrificed position and wealth in order for a fulfilling relationship.  <br /> <br />Rent it, buy it, watch it once every 5 years or so when it appears on Channel 4. You may find it refreshing to see gay men who are not drag queens or dying of and HIV related illness or drugged-up, club bunnies.
1591396190|4.0|It seems like most businesses these days try to compete by \\"doing more\\" than the other guy.  Either sell for lower cost, or have more features, etc., etc., etc...  This leads to the \\"red ocean\\", a playing field marked by bloody battles and ever-decreasing returns.  But W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne propose that a business should adopt Blue Ocean Strategy, a way to redefine the playing field and stake out an area all to yourself.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Blue Ocean Strategy: Creating Blue Oceans; Analytical Tools and Frameworks<br /><br />Part 2 - Formulating Blue Ocean Strategy: Reconstruct Market Boundaries; Focus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers; Reach Beyond Existing Demand; Get the Strategic Sequence Right<br /><br />Part 3 - Executing Blue Ocean Strategy: Overcome Key Organizational Hurdles; Build Execution into Strategy; Conclusion - The Sustainability and Renewal of Blue Ocean Strategy<br /><br />Appendix A - A Sketch of the Historical Pattern of Blue Ocean Creation, Appendix B - Value Innovation - A Reconstructionist View of Strategy, Appendix C - The Market Dynamics of Value Innovation; Notes; Bibliography; Index; About the Authors<br /><br />The authors spent time studying companies that redefined markets to figure out what they did to create a \\"blue ocean\\" market for themselves.  Companies such as Cirque du Soleil, who decided that another \\"circus\\" had nothing to offer.  But by redefining the term, eliminating high-cost elements like animals, and enhancing the theatrical experience, they were able to pull in a far different audience at a much higher premium.  Better yet, there was no other competition in that area.  Such is the goal of a blue ocean market.  Another example is Southwest Air.  Rather than comparing themselves to the cost and value structure of other airlines, they measured themselves against the transportation alternative of driving.  In order to compete on that basis, they had to minimize things traditionally valued by the carriers (meals, lounges, large planes) and maximize things sought by drivers (lower cost, frequent flights, direct destinations).  By doing so, they were able to separate themselves from the rest of the industry into an area that has delivered profits far in excess of other carriers.<br /><br />The documentation in the book on the steps and processes involved in systematically designing a blue ocean market is presented well.  It's not all luck and chance, and following these processes would greatly enhance the chance of making that next big leap.  As in most books of this type, I think there's a tendency to examine things in hindsight, making bad decisions far more obvious now than they were then.  You could follow every step put forth here, and there's still no guarantee that it all works out right.  I was also surprised at how few companies make more than one blue ocean market in their existence.  Once others move into that area, it seems like innovation then becomes very incremental.  It's as if they become invested in their new status quo, and are unable to let go to move to a new area.  There are exceptions (think Apple's Mac and also their iPod), but it seems pretty rare.<br /><br />This is one of those books that most company leaders should read in order to figure out if their offerings are only meant to create more blood in the water, or whether they have the skills to swim away from everyone else in order to make their own blue ocean markets.meals, lounges, large planes) and maximize things sought by drivers (lower cost, frequent flights, direct destinations).

B000F6IOC0|4.0|What a great sequel to a great original.  Underworld - Evolution picks up, literally, right where Underworld left off.  Wonder what happened to the rest of the Coven?  How about Michael?  Still a little fuzzy on how the whole thing began?  Can't get enough Kate Beckinsale? <br /> <br />Well that is all right here my friend.  Every thing you want to know and see.  Beckinsale is wonderful yet again and Scott Speedman continues his strong performance.   <br /> <br />You definately need both movies as they truly compliment (and feed - no pun intended) off of each other.

B0009KA7BS|5.0|I am not one for things such as horror movies, action flicks with all action no story, demon possession type movies, etc... ; However, I LOVE this movie. What's incredible about it is that there is some really thought provoking material here. There is also some brilliant imagery, such as when Angela & Constantine are in the street as the winged demons are coming after Angela. There they stand in front of what looks to be a religious type store that's closed for the evening with a life sized virgin Mary in the window. There Angela stands in front of the virgin Mother, Mary's arms stretched out & Angela appearing right in the middle of her arms. Its not doctrinally or historically correct on many things, of course its a fictional story. There ARE some things, though, that are accurate or hint at the knowledge that is coming to light, archaelogically & historically speaking. They weave these things into the story seemlessly alongside the things made up just for the story. The ideas are interesting, the action is alot of fun, the artistry is beautiful, the character development is great, and the demons are downright scary (as they should be ! ) Its not a bubble gum type of movie. Its not just there to scare you. Its not there just to let you see things get blown up. You get these things, but you get alot more. One last thing I'll say is that there are a few things that I didn't get the first time around. It has \\"replay\\" value. You can go back to this movie again & again and always find something new, something you've missed before.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|At the time of writing, \\"It's Time\\" is still riding high (at #4) on the Billboard Jazz Album charts and this is after residing on said charts for 89 weeks. The album has sold over 2 million copies. Based on this feat alone I would encourage anyone to at least give this album a try. His debut was blinding enough but in my view, this one is even better. David Foster and Humberto Gatica have done another great production job on all but one of the songs. (Tommy Lipuma produced \\"The More I See You\\") Chris Botti joins in on \\"Song For You\\" and basically, what we have here is a jolly good set of familiar songs that are great fun to listen to.<br /><br />A lot of people, especially those into pop and r&b, feel that standard singing is easy. You only have to see how reality \\"talent\\" show contestants fail dismally whenever big band time comes around, to know how wrong they are. I still feel Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole and Tony Bennett are three of the greatest singers that ever lived and they did (and do) their business without the bells and whistles that many singers feel they need these days. Buble can consider himself a modern day peer of these greats, no question. His voice is just that good.<br /><br />The best suprise of this album for me though, was Nelly Furtado on \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\". I had no idea the woman could sing as well as she does here and the way her voice complements, blends in with and harmonises with Buble's, is just sheer magic.<br /><br />Great album. Even if you don't like jazz singing or easy listening, I think there's a great chance you will like this.
B000AA4IJE|1.0|Listen to this one at the peril of your very soul. Have a nice day!
B00004W221|5.0|A great movie for all ages. The ultimate movie about never giving up on your dreams and the sacrifice that comes along with winning.
B000002KCC|5.0|This is a great collection, derived from a difficult time.  After reading the biography \\"Shakey\\", I had a better insight into the music.  Loved it!
B00004Y7SF|2.0|Christina has already proven that she can sing.  And on this spiced-up, over-the-top holiday disc, it's almost like she's trying to hard to re-prove it.   <br /> <br />Christina adds her own spice to Christmas classics and new favorites, which actually makes for an interesting and pretty solid album.  The major, major problem with this album is that Christina tries way too hard on these songs.  These extreme vocal acrobats DO NOT work on standard Christmas classics, especially the slower ones with a more traditional accompaniment.  <br /> <br />Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to.  Christina's vocal gymnastics grind against a beautiful and traditional-sounding instrumental background on \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" like nails on a chalkboard.  The same can be said for \\"The Christmas Song,\\" which is almost unrecognizable due to Chrstina's singing.  And let's not forget that extremely awkward Lord's prayer in the middle of \\"O Holy Night\\" followed by a complete change in tempo and style as if halfway through the song Christina suddenly changed her mind about the way she wanted to record it.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, there are good moments on the disc as well.  Her cover of Diane Warren's \\"These Are the Special Times\\" is an enjoyable mid-tempo ballad  that Christina doesn't totally demolish.  \\"This Christmas\\" is pretty good, too.  Not as good as Gloria Estefan's original recording, though.  The two originals, \\"Christmas Time\\" and \\"This Year\\" are fun, too, although the latter has a beat and accompaniment that sound more like the suspense score to \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" than anything Christmas. <br /> <br />\\"The Christmas Song (Holiday Remix)\\" is better than Christina's original recording, because her vocals are more appropriate for this very uptempo version.  It gets kind of annoying sometimes, since she screams practically the entire last 2 minutes of the song. <br /> <br />The two best tracks are \\"Merry Christmas, Baby,\\"a blues cover of the classic with a guest appearance by the legendary Dr. John.  Christina sings the hell out of it, and it works here, though the song gets a bit drawn out towards the end.  \\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\" is the best song on the album.  Complete with a black gospel choir and a guest appearance by Brian McKnight, this spiced-up version of the traditional hymn works very well and makes for quite a memorable and very enjoyable cover. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a holiday album that had the potential to be a successful, unique collection of Christmas tunes.  It's a shame that Christina's over-the-top vocal gymnastics had to ruin this album.  Christina is a talented artist who's always coming up with interesting concepts for her records.  But on this album, she needed to chill out and just sing the songs. <br /> <br />Best song: \\"Angels We Have Heard On High\\" <br /> <br />The Good: <br />\\"These Are Special Times\\" <br />\\"This Christmas\\" <br />\\"Christmas Time\\" <br />\\"This Year\\" <br />\\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" <br /> <br />The OK: <br />\\"The Christmas Song (Holiday Remix)\\" <br /> <br />The bad: <br />\\"The Christmas Song\\" <br />\\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" <br />\\"O Holy Night\\" <br />\\"Xtina's Xmas\\" (this pointless and irritating interlude is the album's worst track and as disposible as used toilet paper)
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Up on top, it's nothing but gold teeth, big cars and big butts; trolling in the underground, you meet a lot of blind moles that think they know what \\"independent\\" means. Rise Against and bands of their ilk fall by the wayside in critical circles. Their music is somehow too abrasive for MTV but not nifty-keen enough for hipsters. <br /> <br />This critical hazing ritual has been enough to net them a \\"punk\\" badge in the past, but with \\"The Sufferer and the Witness,\\" these punks rise to bridge the gap with a fresh ear and a newfound knack for fusing fury with sensitivity-- without illicting jaded groans. Comparisons to The Who for their teenage angst (\\"Ready to Fall\\") are not without merit, but the caterwauling evocative-of-the-Pete-Townshend-windmill guitarwork is yet more appropriate. \\"Chamber the Cartridge\\" opens innocently enough with war drumming and the dire lilt of distorted electric guitar. Then everything goes to hell and back in just under 43 minutes. <br /> <br />\\"The Sufferer and the Witness\\" contains enough adrenaline to kill. The \\"Chamber\\"-\\"Injection\\"-\\"Ready\\" trifecta hooks ears, then Rise Against throws \\"Bricks\\" at us for a minute and a half. Anthemic riffing on \\"Behind Closed Doors\\" pumps the proverbial fist into the air, sitting twice as well next to the impassioned, Ginsberg-infused howl of singer Tim McIlrath. Things settle down only on the restrained, but surprisingly powerful \\"Roadside,\\" a duet with Emily Schambra of Holy Roman Empire which conquers the orchestral side of the coin in terms of emotional intensity and proves that Rise Against learned something from critics' response to the maudlin \\"Swing Life Away\\" (from 2004's \\"Siren Song of the Counterculture\\"). <br /> <br />\\"Survive\\" is a perfect closer. It's all over the map--sections supported by spastic hardcore punk drumming break into dizzying pedal tone riffs break into a swirling mass of driving harmony, concluding the record with hammer-to-nail finality. <br /> <br />The final word is pretty straightforward, really. Fans of Bad Religion, Social Distortion, and other long-running American punk combos will dig this record mightily even as naysayers dig its grave. In the end, it's just damn good rock music that takes no prisoners. If that doesn't count for crossover appeal, what does?
B000H305U0|3.0|I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned it yet, but FutureSex/LoveSounds has one of my nails-on-a-chalkboard-annoyances in it.  That is the inclusion of annoying Interludes/half-songs/skits/etc. that are included on the same track # as a full song.   <br /> <br />So if you want to rip a good song (say 'Summer Love'), your MP3 ends up including the annoying 'Set the Mood Interlude' on the back half of it.  It happens four times on the album!  They'd be better off just having the Interludes/Preludes as their own individual track #'s.  Then you could easily skip over them. <br /> <br />OK, other than that, the album is alright.  A lot of it sounds the same after awhile though.  It's all about at the same speed/tempo/beats so it's hard to get through it all in one sitting. <br /> <br />There are a definitely a few standout songs here which are sure to gain tons of airplay and bring Justin tons of fame/attention/girls.  I just can't see myself listening to this, say a year from now(?).
B0006399FS|3.0|How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is my least favorite U2 recording of their 30 year career.  There Ive said it.  I purchased this cd when it was released in 2004, and have given myself 2 years to let this album sink in.  Ive been a U2 fan for 20 years, and though my initial impression hasnt really changed, I wanted to give this cd some time to grow on me.  I felt I owed U2 that much, since theyve been a big part of my life for so long.    I really dont feel this is a bad album for any lack of trying on U2's part.  In fact, I feel that U2 are possibly trying too hard recently.  Trying too hard to achieve perfection, to be the \\"best band in the world\\", and losing their naturally creative instincts in the process.  Ever since the perceived failure of Pop, real or not, the band have entirely scrapped any thought of experimentation or pushing music in new directions, instead opting for a more straight-forward approach.  While this change shouldnt really be a concern in and of itself, the effect has had an oddly constricting effect on their creativity.    I would propose that on some levels theyre simply trying too hard.  For example, listen to \\"Vertigo\\", then listen to the song from which Vertigo evolved, namely \\"Native Son\\".  On Vertigo, Bono sounds rushed, the lyrics way too cluttered, like hes trying to get thru half a novel in under 4 minutes.  Watching Bono sing \\"Vertigo\\" live is almost enought to give you a headache, if you focus on the vocal.  In contrast, the vocal on Native Son has a natural flow, and is far more pleasing to the ear, and includes a fantastic vocal by the Edge.  In the way of the best U2 songs, Native Son is more like poetry, whereas Vertigo is something else entirely.  This is just one example.  There are others, such as the exclusion of the song \\"Mercy\\" from the album, which is probably the best U2 song youve never heard.  And theres another little gem of a tune from the Bomb sessions, that was oddly neglected when it came time to compile the cdtracks.  That song is \\"Smile\\", and is one of my favorite U2 tracks of the last 10 years.  Luckily it was released on the Complete U2 on Itunes or we would never have heard it.  For me, Smile is on a whole different level from just about every track released on the Bomb, particularly in respect to the relaxed and emotive nature of Bono's vocals.  Simple perfection, like U2's best work.  Decisions by U2 like the ones Ive mentioned here really make me wonder if they still fully recognize their brilliance when it bubbles to the surface.  It makes you wonder what other tracks have been abandoned on the cutting room floor, deemed unworthy of inclusion.    Even those who dislike U2 will generally admit that U2 are great songcrafters.  Theyve always had the ability to write incredibly catchy infectious tunes, many times wrapped in the most simple of melodies.  I have complete faith that U2 still have the ability to write songs that rival their best work in both creativity and sheer brilliance.  Sadly, for me, the Bomb as it was released is mostly devoid of such work, and that really makes me sad.      The songs on this album are by no means bad, they simply fail to reach the incredible heights of most of U2's past work.  U2 really are their own worst enemies in that respect, having a mind blowing back catalog of songs etched into the minds of millions of fans all over the world.    Favorite tracks on \\"the Bomb\\" for me would be \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Original of the Species\\", all of which manage to summon a fair amount of the U2 magic.  Least favorite tracks would have to be \\"Love and Peace Or Else\\", which is a flat uninspired tune that aspires to be the magnificent \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", and \\"Miracle Drug\\" which is U2 at their most bland and forgettable.  Oddly, had U2 included \\"Native Son\\" in place of \\"Vertigo\\", as well as the great tracks \\"Mercy\\" and \\"Smile\\", I would have given this cd 4 stars.  As it is, I would give it 3 stars.

B00005JPBP|5.0|Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale), along with Rupert's wife, Julia (Perabo), are assistants to a magician at the turn of the twentieth century.  Alfred causes a trick to go wrong, and Julia dies.  Rupert blames Alfred, and the friends become enemies.  They not only attempt to out-do each other on stage, but also attempt to actively sabotage and hurt each other.  Soon, Rupert is off to Colorado Springs to meet with Nikola Tesla (Bowie).  Tesla has created an integral part of Alfred's show, and Rupert is determined to get a similar device and top Alfred once again.<br /><br />The story is told with three storylines, alternating between the three.  Parts of one storyline that make no sense at first become clear as the other storylines progress.  Even the murder at the very beginning is not what it seems.  Christopher Nolan has once again constructed a fascinating tale, this time of obsession and the price that people pay for their obsessions.  The cast is solid all around.  Bale and Jackman, as the leads, own their roles and breathe life into their respective characters.  Michael Caine, as their assistant, steals just about every scene he is in.  Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall as the love interests both do credible jobs.  And finally, David Bowie makes Tesla into a memorable character.  This is a great, entertaining movie.  Christopher Nolan has quickly proved himself to be a great director.  \\"The Prestige\\" helps to solidify that.  I highly recommend this film.
B000002J1S|5.0|Wow! Is it any wonder Peter Gabriel left the band after this? How in the world could they ever top this? I'm sure Gabriel knew not even to try. <br /> <br />In an era of concept albums and rock operas (Tommy, Quadrophenia, Thick As A Brick,) this one outdoes them all. The album actually leaves you exhausted after listening too it, as so much genius is poured into every track. It's incredible that Invisible Touch and The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway were made by the same band. But they really weren't. This album was the end of the \\"real\\" Genesis.
6305949980|4.0|In Halloween Town, October 31 is the biggest night of the year.  Jack Skellington (Sarandon & Elfman), organizer of the festivities has got the blues.  He wants something different in his life, and while wandering in the forest, he finds a door to Christmas Town.  In Christmas Town, things are bright and cheerful.  It captures his interest, and when he returns to Halloween Town, he announces that this year, they will celebrate Christmas.  In fact, Jack will even replace \\"Sandy Claws\\" on Christmas to help spread the cheer.  He has it all planned out, but Salle (O'Hara) has a premonition that things will go terribly wrong.<br /><br />\\"Nightmare\\" has developed a following since it's initial release in 1993.  The stop-motion animation as well as the melding of Halloween and Christmas has captivated many, and Disney's decision to release it in 3-D is a welcome event for those people.  I think even a regular re-release would drum up some excitement.  The animation is top notch, and the story idea is an interesting one, but for me the execution of the story falls a little flat.  That being said, \\"Nightmare\\" is still worth seeing, especially in 3-D.
B000002J1L|2.0|Uneven, sometimes unlistenable, but definitely a preview of greater things to come on Foxtrot and Selling England By The Pound.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|Unforgiven is so good that its impression just might stay with you forever...that's the backbone of a real 5-star movie. Unforgiven is one of those movies that really deserves 5 stars among thousands that get it but don't deserve it. It deserved Best Picture of 1992 and rightfully got it.<br /><br />In my recent review of this year's (2006) horror slugfest Slither, I asked what ranking those who gave it 5 stars would then give a real 5-star movie like Unforgiven. Here's some email feedback I got (colorful at times):<br /><br />Someone said, \\"Well you gave 5 stars to Justice League, Bugs Bunny and Tales From The Crypt.\\" And I responded,  \\"Those weren't movies.\\" And someone else said, \\"Well Slither was 5 stars 'in its genre.'\\" And I said, \\"Okay. That's fair...I guess...as long as the reader knows that your system is broken out by genre.\\" And the next guy said, \\"Who are you to say what's 5 stars and what's not?\\" And I said, \\"Excellent point. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion.\\"<br /><br />I could ramble on and debate this all day.<br /><br />You see, therefore, in my humble opinion, Unforgiven is just one of those movies that has to make you question your own judgment on what you classify as \\"the best\\"; it makes you Monday-morning-quarterback your decision to give a five star rating to some movie that simply put you in a good mood for the weekend versus the next one that came along that really deserved 5 stars.<br /><br />Somewhere out there back in 1992, a reviewer's system was foiled that topped out at 4 stars. That reviewer finally gave in and added a fifth star to his system for Unforgiven. He upgraded a few pre-1992 movie's like Goodfellas and Silence of the Lambs with his new 5-star rating. But that silly reviewer is probably up to 10 stars by now in his system. So exemplifies the vicious cycle that we surely all want to avoid.<br /><br />So I suggest this, fair reviewers: Lest we not be so liberal with our stars so we don't end up needing to add more stars to the point system in order to do justice to the movies that should stand alone at the top.<br /><br />Unforgiven is definitely one of them.o the movies that should stand alone at the top.    Unforgiven is definitely one of them.
B000002J2D|3.0|The first album as a threesome. Not as good as Wind And Wuthering, but better than anything else they'll do in the future. With the exception of Duke, which I like more than this one, and the self-titled album, which I like a lot, Genesis has the unique ability of making an album that's a little worse than the one before it. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. This album has its moments. \\"Many Too Many\\" and \\"Snowbound\\" are hidden gems. Still a worthy collection.
B000007XUQ|5.0|There is more to producing an album that throwing a dozen songs together. Richard Carpenter always understood the need for an album side to flow naturally from one selection to the next. He also knows where to uses pauses and where to uses segues. On this spectacular Christmas collection you will find perfect examples of how ALL music should be programmed (Radio station music directors take note.)<br /><br />The occasional choral group adds a festive touch, but it is the sparkling arrangements that held make this collection so popular. You can play individual segments or enjoy the entire program.<br /><br />Karen Carpenter's sweet voice is ideally suited for both secular songs and the more traditional religious hymns and carols. Their first Christmas album was an annual best-seller. After Karen's tragic and untimely death Richard assembled a second Lp containing some previously unissued solos by Karen along with other orchestral and choral arrangements.  Both albums are packaged together here and make an ideal backdrop for an evening around the Christmas tree.
B000002J1O|5.0|If not for The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, which followed relatively closely after this one, especially compared to these days, this album would have been even huger. Today, Lamb would not have been released until 5 years after Selling England, and then it would have gotten its due. <br /> <br />The disc is incredible from start to finish. It would be unfair to single out specific tracks. This is one you have to listen to all the way through to fully appreciate.
1400062756|1.0|Although Carol Dweck is a women, I feel this book would do well in a college \\"women studies\\" class. Good stuff, but a little tuff on guys and pity for women. Maybe I am stuck in a \\"Mindset\\", but harps a little too much on women issues for me. I will be alble to utilize some material from the book, but would suggest it as a good read for women.
B000002J27|4.0|The \\"other guys\\" show that they were paying attention all those years playing with Peter Gabriel. Peter is barely missed here, although it is easy picturing him sing most of these songs (except \\"Robbery, Assault & Battery,\\" a sign of the mediocrity ahead.) This album is still 10 years from the \\"radio pop\\" of Invisible Touch, and 15 years from the embarrassing We Can't Dance. Genesis was still a force to be reckoned with here. <br /> <br />Most of the songs are top notch. The highlights are \\"Squonk,\\" \\"Entangled\\" and \\"Ripples.\\" A solid \\"debut\\" for the new line-up.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I heard most of the songs before the album was released, but I must say the Steinman songs are my favs on the CD.  Cry for Me is AWESOME and Meat sounds so good on all of the songs, but especially In the Land of the Pig, and Seize the Night.  WOW.  An epic and sure to be a classic.  If you don't have it get it NOW!
B000002J1M|4.0|A couple of clunkers take this out of the 5 star realm, but \\"Watcher Of The Skies,\\" \\"Get Em Out By Friday,\\" and, of course, \\"Supper's Ready.\\" make this an essential in any collection. \\"Supper's Ready\\" answers any Peter Gabriel v. Phil Collins debate definitively. Listen to Peter Gabriel's vocal here, then listen to Phil Collins nearly destroy the song on Seconds Out. \\"Supper's Ready\\" is that rarest of songs that cannot be compared to any other songs. It should go into a time capsule with the greatest music of the past 400 years.

B000002J2B|3.0|The last album with Steve Hackett. Genesis would become a trio after this. <br /> <br />Curiously, even though everyone always talks about the departure of Peter Gabriel, the band held it together very well until Hackett departed. It wasn't until Gabriel and Hackett were gone that the band's style and direction began to change. <br /> <br />There's lots of vintage Genesis here again. It's a notch below Trick Of The Tail, but it's still a worthy member of the \\"early\\" Genesis catalogue.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|Beowulf and Grendel DVD- First, let me state, that I liked this movie, four out of five stars.  If I had paid attention to all the reviews, I would not have purchased this.  However, I enjoyed this movie immensely. <br /> <br />Now, let me give you some pointers that will help you decide if this movie is for you: 1.)  It will help in your enjoyment of the movie, if you have read Beowulf.  2.)Also, if you have some knowledge and enjoy reading Norse myth, this will increase your enjoyment of the picture.  3.) If you can understand that animals use urination as a method to mark territory.  This is the point of the scene at the meet hall in the movie, when they show the troll urinating.  It is also used to embarrass the heroes. <br /> <br />I don't know if I agree with the portrayal of the troll as a sort of Neanderthal cave dweller, but I understand why they did it.  They did it so they could show Beowulf, one step up on the evolutionary ladder.  I also agree with their decision to use comprehensible English.  This opens up the movie to a much wider audience. <br /> <br />My favorite character in the movie was Selma, played by Sarah Polley.  She was the moral conscience of the film. <br /> <br />They filmed, the movie in Iceland, under extremely hard conditions for the filmmakers.  The audience can see this in the featurette in the DVD extras, and on the commentary track, for those of you that listen to such things.  The filmmakers have also included deleted scenes in the special features on the DVD.  They are interesting, if not informative.

Send it now! <br /> <br />Like another reviewer, I had just breezed through _Black Order_ and wanted something \\"meatier\\". I certainly got it. <br /> <br />This book was \\"unputdownable\\". I jeopardized my weekday job by staying up late and reading this book, it was that good. Setterfield teases out both Margaret's and Vida's stories slowly through the book, and I couldn't wait for more precious pieces of the puzzle to come together. <br /> <br />I am only marginally familiar with the great works of English literature alluded to in this book and the other reviews, so I can't compare the book to those (though I have read _The Woman in White_ and some of _Rebecca_). After reading _The Thirteenth Tale_ however, I can't wait to catch up with the Brontë sisters, and even to see those Yorkshire moors for myself! <br /> <br />Bottom line, this book is a great read. A final comment: the ending reminded me of the ending to a much different (but also as good of a read) book, _The Time Traveller's Wife_.

0307237699|5.0|What Barack Obama may lack in senatorial experience he does come across with his opinions on the issues facing America today such as the war in Iraq, education, religion, abortion, race, politics, and the Constitution.  To me he appears to have the refreshing beliefs of a uniter that are not the hard line of either the right or the left that are currently polarizing American society.  Regarding the war in Iraq Obama says that bin Laden realizes he can't defeat or cripple our country in a conventional war.  However, he can  inflict enough pain to cause an ill-advised American reaction in a Muslim country such as what we have in Iraq.  That, Obama says, is the plan for winning a war from a cave, and so far, we are playing right into his hands.  Obama does believe we have the right to take unilateral action against another country in case of an imminent threat to our security, but Saddam Hussein did not meet this qualification.  Barak Obama feels his life is too imperfect to consider himself qualified to serve as another individual's judge regarding moral issues.  How refreshing from the harsh judgemental attitude towards others we presently have coming from the far right today.  Our country desperately needs someone to unite our country, and Barak Obama appears to be one who could do it.

Sparks did something with these characters to bring them to life for me and I found myself getting to know them and I even found myself talking out loud to them as I read. There were instances where I would say \\"What??? NO!\\" or \\"Just turn around and walk away!\\" This book will tear at your heart strings and cause the tears to flow freely. It's an emotional rollercoaster. Great book!!

0446677450|4.0|I first read this book about 5 years ago, and have since re-read it several times, in addition to reading several of his other books.  Sure, Kiyosaki does have his share of detractors, as do most successful people, but his core message is solid.  Today's educational system does teach you more about how to be a good employee than how to take charge of your finances.  Since the schools don't teach that, you need to learn it on your own and Kiyosaki does a good job of simplifying the complex topic of managing finances.      One of the most common things that Kiyosaki and this book are criticized about is that the content is too general.  This book is supposed to be general - on page 19 of the hardcover, he even clearly states: \\"This book is about those...lessons, put as simply as possible....The lessons are not meant to be answers but guideposts.\\"  Even if he were to try to be extremely specific, the sheer magnitude of complexity in all the different approaches towards managing finances that exist would be far beyond the scope of one book.      I give Kiyosaki and Rich Dad, Poor Dad credit with helping me develop the mindset I have today.  I am now also an author and real estate investor, and am taking charge of my financial decisions.  My recommendation is to read the book, and look into what he's trying to teach you.  If you don't like it, read something that will help you. Just do something better than hoping that social security will take care of you.     David B. Wright, author of Get A Job!  Your Guide to Making Successful Career Moves, [..]
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I admit it took awhile for this disc to grow on me, but I absolutely love it. Definitely not a 'sophmore slump' here, Amy proves she has one of the best (and most powerful) voices in modern music. Eat that Xina Gaguliera! My fave is by far \\"Lithium.\\"
B000001DTM|5.0|It is still my favorite album. If you doubt buying this album, don't. It's one of those albums where EVERY song is catchy, meaningful, beautiful yet experimental and overall AWESOME!!! <br /> <br />This is my #1 favorite album of all time.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is a brilliant film! This is the first of what I like to refer to as The Disney Modern Classics (along with Beauty & the Best, Lion King and Aladin). A very touching story set to inspiring music makes this a true gem of cinema. Ursula rocks as one of Disney's most over-the-top and exciting villians!

Her voice is in top form and she gets extra bonus points for including my fave Xmas song...\\"What Child Is This?\\" I really wish she were doing a small, intimate holiday tour for this. It would be divine.

No matter what your \\"style\\" of photography, you will have a battery empty its charge at a critical moment. Having a back-up is essential.

B000J10ERO|5.0|Superman has returned indeed, and its great to have him back. Brandon Routh portrays the title character, and brings alot of weight and depth to the role. If only all superhero films were this good, we wouldn't have duds like Fantastic Four and Elektra.  <br /> <br />This movie has everything that makes great films great, a superb cast featuring Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, Frank Langella as Perry White, James Marsden as Richard White and Tristan Lake Leabu as Jason White. This film also fatures outstanding special effects, a great score, along with superb writing by Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty. <br /> <br />I won't go into any of the plot details, but this film hearkens back to the great epics like Gone with the Wind, Giant, and the original Superman film. This along with Batman Begins, is the return of the epic. Buy this DVD and you won't be sorry. The sequel is coming in 2009. Thank you Superman for returning.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|If I had to describe Taylor Swift's self-titled debut, I would say it sounds a lot like a cross between Lila McCann and Leann Rimes.  She has a very powerful voice, and exhibits a lot of range in her songs.  Most of the songs on the album are very lighthearted and deal with typical high school issues - boys, falling in love, bad relationships, etc.  Even though the themes are simple, the songs (all of which Taylor wrote or co-wrote) have some impressive lyrics and musical arrangement, which really gives her the ability to show off her voice.  I bought the CD for \\"Tim McGraw,\\" but as others have said, it is a mediocre song when compared to the rest of the album and I found myself moving it to the back of my play list to make room for new favorites such as \\"Picture to Burn,\\" \\"May's Song,\\" and \\"Our Song.\\"  Despite what you might expect from the song titles, most of the album is fast-paced and filled with catchy tunes, but still makes room for two or three \\"slower\\" songs like \\"Tim McGraw\\" and \\"Teardrops on my Guitar.\\"<br /><br />The album also comes with some disappointing \\"bonus media\\" in the form of the \\"Tim McGraw\\" video and Taylor's first appearance on the Grand Ole Opry singing the same song.  The clips are quicktime and small resolution, and the Opry video doesn't even show her actual performance, but a few minutes of her arriving to the theater and getting ready.  For anyone who's a fan of younger country female talent, I'd definitely recommend picking up \\"Taylor Swift.\\"
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This album has one of my favorite pieces of cover art, capturing wonderfully the theme of the album.  The gothic-style statue of a weeping angel reminds me of the weeping Lion of Aspern (Google it, people), and makes clear the overbearing sense of loss that pervades the album.<br /><br />Several songs explore the theme of dead lovers - - or the variations of a lover making the ultimate sacrifice for another, or a situation in which one lover is dead while the other still lives.  Those kinds of themes risk being trite, especially in a goth album.  Fortunately, Nightwish avoids that trap by exploring other themes.  Ocean depths and sirens appear in several songs, for example.  Dreams appear in \\"Dark Chest of Wonder\\" and other songs, while an inability to dream haunts \\"Nemo.\\"  The haunting sounds of \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" provide the background for a Native American lament, with John Two-Hawks joining the band to play flute and chant in Lakota.<br /><br />Speaking of haunting, \\"Ghost Love Score\\" is just short of wonderful.  It introduces and develops several musical themes, though the first third of the song moves too quickly through its themes without giving them time to develop.  As a result, the transitions between them are sometime clunky, and do not grow organically.  Matters improve in the middle section of the song, which slows way down, exploring textures and sonorities.  As the song revs back up, more organically this time, there's a time change and (ironically, in 6/8 time) the strongest rock part of the song.  It's also (briefly) a demanding vocal part for Tarja Turunen, which reminds me of the part of \\"The Nurse\\" in Richard Strauss's \\"Die Frau Ohne Schatten.\\"  (I guess that's why they call it operatic goth.)  She's up to the challenge.  After this, \\"Ghost Love Score\\" works to a conclusion, including an endless fade-out.  The fade-out is most notable for flipping an earlier choral part on its head, foregrounding Turunen in an alto range while the chorus sings high, whereas this theme was previously introduced with the choral part lower and foregrounded, with Turunen singing counter in the upper reaches of her range.  However, as in \\"Hey Jude,\\" the fade-out goes on too long.<br /><br />Speaking of Tarja Turunen, she is essential to Nightwish's success and it's hard to see how they can replace her.  She has a very sweet voice in the higher parts of her range, and it warms up very nicely in her lower range.  She can also hold notes well - - a skill that she shows off in \\"Ghost Love Score,\\" when she sings a soprano countermelody with long notes held for two or more measures over a chorus and bass/drum line played staccato below her.  She also gets to show off her voice in a beautiful ballad, \\"Kuolema Tekke Taiteilijan,\\" which made me wish that I understood Finnish.<br /><br />For the most part, the album abandons the death grunts of the European goth genre.  The major exception is \\"I Wish I Had an Angel,\\" where some grunts make up the male voice of a nice duet with Turunen.  I also appreciated the opening line of that song, introducing the chorus, in which Marko Hietala sung tenor instead of grunting it.  I have nothing against grunts and growls per se, but it's a musical weapon that should be used only when appropriate - - as it is here.  Hietala also sings a non-grunt duet with Turunen in \\"Planet Hell\\" that works well.<br /><br />This interplay between light and dark is characteristic of the genre.  It is developed to particularly nice effect in \\"Nemo,\\" which explores Captain Nemo's backstory (from Jules Verne's \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\").  The sense of loss, especially in the chorus, is conveyed very well, carried by Turunen's voice and a single-note piano.  That loss plays off against the harder themes played by the guitars and percussion, with a \\"metal\\" impression that suggests the mechanical elements of the _Nautilus_ and its journeys above and below the waves.<br /><br />In short, this is quite an album.  It achieves an impressive lyrical unity across a series of themes, succeeding where the band's previous \\"Century Child\\" seemed contrived and forced.  It is less successful in achieving musical unity, and the individual tracks do not flow well into each other.  I find myself constructing playlists in which I play with the order to tracks to \\"get it right.\\"  That said, if you like the progressive goth/operatic metal genre, this is a must-have album.um.

B00008DDHZ|4.0|One more film on this Bloody Sunday, will you say. Shot for television in 2001. What can we add to the plain fact of 13 people killed in cold blood by the paratroopers of Her Majesty the Queen of England without any clzear order to do so ? There is no excuse for this event, absolutely no excuse. The march should not have been banned and blocked in the first place. That was a total misunderstanding of the situation. And the English had never had anything to do in Ireland in the first place. The film though is not as effective as it could have been because the editing choice is pretty simple, not to say bizarre. Why try to produce a sloppy, amateurish and old TV documentary when everyone knows it is done on purpose by professionals in 2001 and with only filmed professional actors. It makes the film very chaotic and unsmooth. The only thing that is clear is that the demonstrators were pretty amateurish in their non-violent disorganized organization whereas the paratroopers were pretty good professionals at obeying an order that never existed and the army was very good at covering up the event. And we have to keep in mind it will take more than 25 years to finally start moving towards a political settlement. And it is still fragile and could erupt again any time even if the situation is improving steadily day after day. We are still far from the end. Keep in mind that 13 dead people in Londonderry is probably more than in Tien An Men if we take into account the respective populations of Northern Ireland and China, and even one casualty would have been too many. As far as I know there was no casualty when Martin Luther King marched in Washington DC, and we can be absolutely sure that Martin Luther King's Baptist dream was just as valuable as that of these Northern Irish Catholic citizens, and vice versa of course.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne

B00005JL78|4.0|The human race has always been obsessed by the future, which is probably one distinctive trait that makes it human and takes it out of animality. Humanity has to plan its future in order to survive, hence it has to predict its future needs. But humanity remains an animal race in many ways, including of course its survival instinct. So crime is part of the picture, what we call crime in our human ethics. But this is nothing but the individual survival instinct that goes against the collective survival instinct. Then the collectivity, human society decides to consider the individual survival instinct as being a crime and as deserving punishment. It is, and has been, tempting to predict what and which indidviduals will become cirminals in order to prevent that crime. It was for instance suggested under President Nixon to preventively take away into reform schools all the kids, aged six or seven, that had the « typical criminal » psychology before they realized their destiny which was considered as unescapable and necessarily criminal. This approach was essentially behavioral. Then another appeared, essentially genetic this time and some still believe that the DNA of any individual contains its destiny that is absolutely unescapable. So let us put away those who have the « crime » genes. Steven Spielberg deals with this dilemma but based this time on a modern  embodiment of the seers of old. Three people have been transformed by some genetic manipulation into seers of the future and their predictions are considered as absolutely infallible since they always seem to agree. Then the criminals are arrested before they commit their crime and put away. The effect is the disappearance of crime from Washington D.C. in just a few years. But Steven Spielberg goes further and demonstrates that there are several flaws in this theory. First the three seers don't always agree and there might be a minority report from one of them that is over-ruled by the two others and not communicated to the precrime police. Then this precrime police is a private enterprise and it was necessary to prove its efficiency to get the business. Little by little it appears that the founder of this technology manipulated it in order to prove his theory by arresting someone who was supposed to kill a woman just before he did. That one was paid by the inventor who then afterward committed himself the very crime exactly the way it was supposed to happen which enabled this second crime to be understood by technicians as a simple echo of the first one that was prevented and to be disregarded. The death of the woman only became a missing person. That is the flaw of the film : why didn't anyone investigate this « disappearance » ? But then he also had to trick his own associate, the main detective of this precrime police. He does that by getting the latter's son killed in such a way that the crime will remain unsolved. But this enables the boss to nourish in his aassociate a desire to know who killed his son. This associate's coming around to that knowledge will make him become a criminal and thus he will be neutralized and put away but after the crime is committed for reasons that are not clear. But a few facts were brought together and sorted out by this cop's wife and then she manages to get her husband free, which sounds quite iffy, and this triggers a full process of truth discovery and public broadcasting. The end is yours to discover. But this approach, with marvellous special effects and beautiful action, seems to overkill the point it wants to make : The future is unescapable and predictable, and yet the future can be tampered with and manipulated. The first principle is excessive and even wrong. The second is probably true. But both together are just absurd because contradictory. The point is then disproved by this very contradiction. But it is a great film nevertheless that reveals this question of the future and its possible prediction is essential to manand humanity.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonneand humanity. <br /> <br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne

B000065V42|4.0|This is a good movie for preteens and /or a good movie to sit and enjoy with your children.  I liked the story line, the visual effects and the sometimes corny humor.
0345409671|4.0|This one starts pretty slow compared to the previous four books of the Vampire Chronicles, but once it gets going it does not stop.  I suggest reading the previous installments but dont let that stop you from picking it up.  Rice rights them so you dont have to have read all of the series to understand it.  I recommend it especially if you have differing ideas about heaven and hell.  Overall, it is an excellent addition and should be a must read if you are a fan of the series.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Wolfmother have made a terrific album by just rocking out like they are capable of, instead of relying on outside sources to help them, Wolfmother cranks up the volume and takes you on a ride.  The opening track \\"Dimension\\" is a very upbeat song, a classic opener to grab the listeners attention, a very simple riff with very simple lyrics but it the simplicity is what makes it so unique.  Too many bands today are trying too hard to find that balance.  Wolfmother doesn't care what you think about them and that is another trait which makes them, and this album very good.  The single \\"Woman\\" is a wonderful song with an awesome guitarl riff, almost good enough to make you want to dance to its beating guitar and drums.  Their are other standouts on this album as well, I particularly like \\"Joker & the Thief\\" from Jackass 2 fame and soon to be their second single,\\"Colossal\\" a song that takes you on a journey slowly building to its ulitmate rockfest, \\"Love Train\\" has a pretty sweet riff, and \\"Vagabond\\" this song is not that impressive I just like the melody of the song.  If your looking for a good rock album without all the B.S. attached this is an album for you.

B0007OCG56|4.0|This movie has a couple of themes or leassons. It is a boy meet girl movie. The boy is John Clasky who is played well by Adam Sandler. And the girl is Flor played by Paz Vega who steals the scene even when not speaking. The two of them are great parents and who have the well fare of their children at heart. The movie is also one that also shows how imporatnt it is to be a good parent. John Clasky is also a very good and decent man.    Adam Sandler's wife in this movie is played by Tea Leoni whose nervous energy and fantastic acting brings this complex character to the screen. She plays a typical American woman who had a fantastic carrer and tried to be a mother as well. And as the movie shows that is not an easy task to do both, almost impossible. And her mother is played by Cloris Leachman, who has the same nervous energy of Tea. Which makes it very believable that she is her mother.    The movie starts with Flor who has recently immigrated to L.A. from Mexico, and is trying to find a better life for her remarkable daughter, Cristina played by Shelbie Bruce.

The movie is shown and narrated from the point of view of Christina. It is a drama that has humorous moments. The only thing that actually would have made this movie better for me is if I did not understand Spanish, for it then would have emphasized what Flor had to deal with. This movie is worth watching. This has all the actors involved at their best.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|Even though it is now more than 40 years old, this is still one of the best, if not \\"the\\" best movie ever made about auto racing.  The camera work is amazing, especially for the time, and the sound is great.  The story line is acceptable, but the real story here is grand prix racing from the years when the grand prix circuit was truly the epitome of world motorsports.  The seamless inclusion of many of the star drivers and cars of the era to the film adds a dimension not seen in other non-documentary movies and will spark the nostalgic yearnings of any fan of 50's and 60's european-style motor racing.  The cars driven by the lead characters, although not true grand prix cars, are so closely replicated that very few techno-wizard fans of the engineering of the era will be able to discern the differences.  This is one of the few racing movies that truly makes the viewer feel as if he is actually in the car with the driver on some of the most famous European road courses.  The extra features are superb, with stories galore.  Best of all are the comments from those associated with grand prix racing describing how the director achieved such complete access to the actual race courses, teams and events so filming could be done in conjunction with actual races in the various countries.  That access was enequaled for the time and no other movie producer or director has been able to achieve that level of penetration into the heart of a racing venue since.  One forgets what auto racing was like before commercial sponsorships, and this movie is priceless for showing the peak of grand prix racing before it succumbed to the modern system of commercial sponsorship.  Today's commercial sponsorship and its \\"big money\\" is the reason that no film is likely to ever again equal this one.  No production company could today arrange for or afford to purchase such complete and unrestricted access.  That is the primary reason that, even in an age of computer-generated graphics and special effects, it is unlikely that this auto racing genre film will ever be duplicated or surpassed, so race fans had better buy this one while it is available.
B000784WMW|5.0|The casting and performance of Timothy Dalton as Rochester and a stunning performance of Zelah Clark as Jane Eyre brought this Charlotte Bronte's romance right into my heart. I immediately purchased this film when it came out in VHS format (originally filmed for TV in 1983) after viewing it on TV over 15 years ago and never forgot it. I had seen all the previous productions, but they don't come close to the emotional depth this one evokes, including the newest version of a year or so back. (Was so delighted they finally went DVD this year!) BUY THIS ONE... it is definitely the BEST version ever produced! If you are a romantic, and love period pieces... this one is for you!

In listening to Neil for almost 40 years, this is one album I have never gotten sick of - it just brings a rush whenever I hear it. I recently bought the cd for the third time (lost one, last one started to skip)- and it never sounded better.    <br />Love and Only Love, IMO, the best song Neil ever put out.  Right behind it are Love to Burn, Over and Over Again.  Saw two shows in the Weld tour, and these songs were even better live (I'd give Weld 5 stars too) <br /> <br />

I quote it often in debates which can throw people off citing a Kevin Smith film in arguements on abortion (\\"A woman's body is her own damn business\\"-Jay) and faith/religion (\\"It not about what you have faith in, just that you have faith\\"-Serendipity or Rufus' explaination on why ideas are better than beliefs because you can change an idea, but changing beliefs is much harder.  or Bethany notes on what her friend's [pool boy] said about religion that its like a glass and when you're a child it's easy to fill but as you get older the glass gets bigger and the same amount of liquid doesn't fill it anymore.  Or what Bethany says about how when you're little you don't question any of [religion], God's up there and she's always watching you!) I could go on and on about how much I love this movie but anyway, I reccommend this film to anyone and everyone willing to watch it!  Even if you don't like it and think it to be some sort of hersey or adbomination to relion all together...I hope it at least makes you think about religion today, and how you feel about your own faith.

I can relate to the lyrics + great music <br />Like you: A slow song. But still it's great <br />Lose Control: Really nice song <br />The only one: Awesome song Nice beginning :P <br />Your star: Although it is more of a ballad Amy's vocals are SUPER in this song!!! <br />All that I'm living for: A wonderful song! <br />Good Enough: You will love it if you like My Immortal or Hello, I think its a real special song. <br /> <br />All in all, Amy's voice sounds even better in these songs but I think the lyrics are a bit weaker than before HOWEVER this is a magnificent masterpiece!!! Well done evanescence!!!
0618680004|5.0|With great verve and no small amount of comic relief, Professor Dawkins, without intending to, forever puts the \\"Creationist Myths\\" and \\"Arguments by Intelligent Design,\\" back in the box of ignorance where they belong.<br /><br />This book should be renamed: \\"Natural Selection: The Power of an Awesome Idea.\\"<br /><br />If Dawkins' purpose was to raise consciousness by implanting in the mind of the public how awesome an idea natural selection is, then he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. Not only does he demolish all of the (mostly) synthetic defenses for the existence of God, but more importantly he demonstrates in a much more relaxed way than did Sam Harris in his rather intense \\"The End of Faith,\\" that the need for an omnipotent creator is superfluous, counter-intuitive and just plain silly. No need to get all worked up about it.<br /><br />The idea that the most complex being imaginable is needed to produce less complex things gets the requirements of creation \\"bass ackwards.\\" Even those who do not believe in natural selection can agree that all available evidence suggests that the world has evolved from the simple to the more complex, and not the other way around. Yet, insistence on a single creator is to invent out of thin air the most complex thing imaginable, and only for the purpose of presiding over creating things that are of much less complexity.<br /><br />It was thus especially gratifying to see Dawkins demolish the (pseudo) argument \\"from probability,\\" which states that complex things could not come about by chance. As Dawkins points out, this argument sets up a false alternative between \\"chance\\" and \\"Intelligent Design.\\" Intelligent design is not the only alternative to chance. The graded ramp of natural selection is the correct and missing alternative. With small improvements and enough time, all complexity in the universe can be (and is) accounted for.<br /><br />I especially like his very funny suggestion taken from Peter Akins book: that for those who must insist on the need for a god, they might consider him as having been a very lazy supreme being indeed. One who would use his cosmic brain and intelligence to find the easiest possible way to invent a world that includes great complexity, including life.  Such a supreme being could do no better than to have chosen natural selection as the tool to do his dirty work. With natural selection as his tool, such a lazy god could have invented a living world without having to lift even a single finger.  QED. Five stars.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|This is a great CD!! My fav. song is \\"its all coming back to me now\\"
0345440900|5.0|I got this book after I had bought her other book \\"The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems\\".  This book explains the EASY routine in a bit better detail, but I found that I really needed both of her books to answer the various questions I had.  I found her books the most helpful, more so than the other books I bought (Contented LIttle Baby, What to Expect the First Year, Happiest Baby on the Block, and Healthy Sleep Habits).  While I haven't stictly adhered to her routines, I have been able to use them as a guideline and they really helped to get some organization back into my life.  Definitely recommend this for all new parents (or ones who don't want to make the same mistakes the second time around).
B00000C28M|5.0|Once again Gould takes us to another dimension.<br /><br />His version is absolutely romantic and unique.<br /><br />Always the musical establishment fails in how to recognize real talent!! Having this version dieing for more than 25 years, is a clear prove of that...
B000002W9Q|5.0|\\"Dirty Dancing\\" is still one of my favorite movies of all time.  It managed to have a plot and wonderful music.  You just can't sit still when this music is playing.
0679422714|1.0|Much like her other book, \\"Wild Swans\\", this is another piece of Imperialist-apology and anti-Communism that would make Joe McCarthy proud. <br /> <br />It reads like cheap fiction, and in the end, has little historical value.  <br /> <br />Read \\"Red Star Over China\\", \\"Fanshen\\", and \\"From Ike to Mao\\" instead.
0451204530|5.0|This review pertains to George Guidall's audio book reading. \\"Code To Zero\\" was my first book by Ken Follett, but it won't be my last.<br /><br />I'm shocked by the low consensus 3 stars that Amazon readers have given this dazzling novel. I was blown away by the storyline and the well-drawn out characters. The flashbacks were used to perfection. The little bits of technical info on America's first space launch kept the suspense humming.  I thought it was interesting how the role of communism in Ivy League schools was played out in the 40's and 50's.<br /><br />I don't give 5 stars to my reviews unless I can highly recommend them. I highly recommend Code To Zero.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Having just seen Roger Waters, and seeing this DVD when I purshased it, I'll have to say that the spirit of Pink Floyd is still there.
B000002I25|5.0|This album is a rock classic.  The first from Jim Morrison and company has some of the best music the band ever produced.  Light My Fire is still the best known song from this album but others such as Break on Through and 20th Century Fox are classic as well.  The 11 minute long The End doesn't get much radio play but it is also one the bands best efforts.
0060555661|5.0|A must read for anyone who wants to understand how finance and investing works. The real way to vet investments, not hot-cold info you get in from CNBC.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|this is it.  Sublime.  This CD happens to be sitting in my player right now because I play it so often.
055321263X|4.0|I had read somewhere that \\"The Woman In White\\"  was the original mystery novel and was the classic to measure all later ones by.  After a slow start I became very engaged with the subtle clues and flowery vocabulary.  The book is a chance to experience a Victorian past that adds a special touch to an interesting story.
B000002O4X|5.0|For me, one of the best music of last decade. Romantic, full of sense. Please give a listen at least <br />
0375422307|5.0|I never thought that a \\"comic book\\" would have so much heart felt information. My Israeli friend suggested I read this book as it had touched her with its depth of heartfelt storytelling. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who had any interest in life in Iran after the religious clergy took over and for those who are looking for a point of view of the Middle East that doesn't hit you over the head. A special book in this time of war, nukes and hate.
B00008EY9G|5.0|I really have enjoyed watching the movie...three times already and I can say that it \\"tickles\\" your mind and think a lot of things at the end of it.  <br />Dont judge the book by its cover they say .... and its correct.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|I just bought the record to complete my 'Bat' collection not really expecting much but it is really a good record and worthy as a 'Bat' finale.  Steinman's songs are wonderful and easily recognizable but the other songs work as well.  Meat sounds great and passionate as he always does.  The only song I was disappointed with was the title track which wasn't written in Meats proper (for him) dramatic range during the first part.  It gets better as it goes on.  Overall, really good album.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Great DVD. Worth buy and you will enjoy for year to come.
B0000025DV|5.0|I really like ELO's unique style, and Out of the Blue is my absolute favorite. I get tired of listening to their other albums - composed mostly of songs that simply miss the mark, or consist of too much Top 40 jello. This album is their most dynamic and I never get tired of listening to it. The mix of songs is just right, with real zingers like \\"Turn to Stone\\" and \\"Sweet Talkin' Woman\\" flowing into others with a different twist. And living around Seattle, the juxtaposition of \\"Standing in the Rain,\\" \\"Summer and Lighting,\\" and \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" is simply brilliant. Lacking a strong cup of joe, \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" replaces a jolt of [...]e anyday. Crank it, baby! Awesome. \\"Steppin' Out\\" brings a touch of melancholy that is so unusual in popular music. Wow - nuance!? Amazing!    Ok, the Whale is a bit much - unless I'm in the mood, then it is the greatest. This is a wonderful album and deserves a re-issue. The Amazon review is totally wrong-o this time around.
B00014TJ7K|4.0|the disc is the best that George Harrison has in his catalog. The music is great! I love all of the songs except for one of the additional tracks. Zig zag is a track that could have been left off the re-release of the disc. The other thing that this disc has going for it is the additional big name musicians that are playing with Harrison. They include: jeff lynne, Eric Clapton, and Elton John. This is a must have for anyone who loves Harrison's music.
0783240287|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie.  Donny Osmond is great as Joseph and the music is fantastic!
0618680004|2.0|It becomes increasingly amazing what people will pay to read...oops...that must mean me too.  Belitteling a belief system with Darwin is so much a stretch.  Current evolutionist have given up on Darwin's theory and looked under every rock imaginable, and some that aren't, to find something - anything except intelligent design that they can't see the obvious.  Or they just don't want to see the obvious.  Rule out a god and you rule out accountability and any stable morality.  Right and wrong then become a slidding scale, totally situational.  I will agree that there is intolerance out there, in fact most everywhere.  But it is not from religion, it is from individuals and cults that twist and misuse it, just as Dawkins has misused his gift of writing to minuplate  the readers conscience.  Makes one wonder what is he really afraid of?<br /><br />Two stars for effort expended.
6305633177|4.0|I saw Metallica open for Ozzy in '86 at the UIC Pavillion in Chicago and will never forget that they all piled into a beater car they dubbed the \\"Metallica Mobile\\" and headed to the local metal radio station in Highland Park for an impromptu interview and phone calls. What set this band completely apart from their competition was how in touch they seemed with their fan base, who were growing increasingly tired of the hairspray, spandex and special effects taking over once decent metal bands. Instead, Metallica seemed much like thier fans themselves. Seeing this video always brings back memories of that concert, for the footage of their opener, \\"Creeping Death\\", shows a view that almost appears to have been shot in the exact seat I was sitting in! It also reminds me of how powerful & raw these guys were, as opposed to the horrendous performance by Ozzy, who not only cut his encore because \\"Jake is sick\\", but looked like a bloated, Bea Arthur clone with his big hair and glittery Muumuu. Such a disappointment. The Ultimate Sin indeed. And who knew this would be my last chance to see Cliff Burton? He died a month or two later.      This enormously popular video, released two years after Burton died, was watched endlessly by Metal Heads at the time. It may be hard for younger viewers used to such high standards in DVD to adjust to the poor quality contained here. Part of the reasons for this are likely because Metallica was initially fervant opponents to video and any other type of \\"sell out\\" publicity. This, of course, made them heroes to their fans, but ultimately presented very difficult business compromises for them further down the road. At any rate, this ethic of theirs - while well-intentioned - turns out to be a real shame in hindsight; there may not be any professionally shot footage of them in their younger days.     What is here is largely fan-shot (i.e., illegally taped initially, but later released officially by the band) with some television stuff from overseas. Some of the earlier club stuff may have been shot by the band's management so the members could critique their own perfomance. The best quality comes from \\"Day on the Green\\" in their homebase of Oakland (For Whom the Bell Tolls) which alone makes this worth picking up.     Still, this release obviously hasn't been touched in all its 18 years. I'm sure the sound, for one, could be cleaned up considerably with better source material surely in existence someplace, and some original video masters (esp. of the TV stuff) could be tracked down and spruced up. It would be nice for Metallica to take a lesson from the recent Led Zeppelin & Kiss 2-dvd packages and root through their archives to see what would be suitable for a more comprehensive release. I'd hate to think that this is it for the Cliff Burton era.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|If you are a Matrix fan you must purchase this collection, comes with a brand-new flawless image transfer of the first Matrix, thats up to par with the recent ones. There is a cool green tint throughout the picture when they are inside the Matrix. Hours and hours of behind the scenes, tons of commentary's. And a really nice looking box set. This is thee set to own.

B0002YLC24|3.0|This movie was better than Before Sunrise.   <br />A little more action.   <br />
0761944524|5.0|It is a excellent book to guide beginner who may conduct statistics methods and run SPSS. A usefull book to have it.
B00002E224|3.0|I was amazed at how much dialog the main two actors had to learn for thie movie.  It entirely consists of them talking.  Got old after awhile.  If they had shortened it, it would have been great.  I fast-forwarded through some of it.  <br /> <br />Beautiful scenery.
0743298020|5.0|How amazing this is someone's first attempt at a novel.  What a pleasure to read!  I loved being kept in the dark until the very end and once the light shone in I wanted to read it all over again.  Loved the characters - had a whole movie going on in my head.  I was sorry to see it end and hope this author is fast at work on her next novel.
0736063684|5.0|Excellent manual for weight training. It walks you through the different exercises for the chest, arms, back, buttocks and legs and lays out in detail the proper form for executing the exercise. It also has excellent drawings showing how to conduct the exercise and the muscles involved.  It was money well spent!!!
B000E41MS6|5.0|If you loved the old Doctor Who show, you will be pleasantly surprised with this DVD set. My wife, who has never seen Doctor Who, is totally hooked on the show now. The Characters are great, the stories are engaging, and the acting is genuine. Christopher Eccleston has done a wonderful job, bringing more seriousness to the part while maintaining the whimsy and joy of life that all of the previous doctors had. The true stars of this show though, are the writers and production teams. The quality of the shows are extraordinary, especially if you're like me and remember the old Troughton through Davison episodes. I could go on all day, but I'll reign myself in. :)  The best episode in my opinion is \\"Dalek\\", really good, emotional (!) stuff.  There's something here for everyone if you're into Doctor Who, or Sci-fi in general. Enjoy!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This set of DVDs is for me, reminiscent of the Animals concert that I attended at Anaheim Stadium, Los Angeles, May 6, 1977.  It was like I was there again...The music is incredible, sound quality and everything about it is great.  The DVD really takes me away and gives me the opportunity to escape into my own personal, private concert any time I want.  A must own for any Pink Floyd fanatic like myself.
B000A59PMO|5.0|If you have not seen this show, get the first 2 seasons on DVD and see how great it is!  The writing is smart and funny.  The acting is great, and the characters really grab you.  Please help keep this gem on the air!  We need more shows like this one, and less reality tv.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I am continually saddened that \\"Firefly\\" is no longer on the air. We came to care for the finely drawn characters, and \\"Serenity\\" is an awesome sort-of ending for the series. Sit down, get comfortable and be prepared not to move or blink for the entire length of \\"Serenity\\" because it moves fast and furious to the end.
B00005JKC3|4.0|This is a good movie which explains exactly how the hulk came into being.  The casting was very good. My only complaint is that it takes too long before the hulk makes his appearance.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I love it!  If you like Panic at all, you will enjoy the disc, it's catchy and fun.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|How do you top an multimillion selling album like pyromania, one of the top ten of the 80's. Well hysteria was that answer. After 3 hits off of pyromania (rock of ages, photograph, foolin') and two others that did well on radio (to late for love an rock rock), def leppard cemented themselves as rock giants, but Hysteria made them rock gods. 7 singles released (Woman, Animal, pour some sugar on me, love bites, armageddon it, hysteria, Rocket), and the second best selling album of the 80's (behind michael jackson's thriller) .  This made def leppard rock gods. I happen to be a collector that has all 7 singles from this album.  This new edition give the rest of the world a chance to re-experience one of the best albums ever....With a bonus.  How can they do it, they added the tracks from the singles, as well as some live and extended tracks on a second cd.  I'll admit, I am not impressed by the Extended cuts of the classics, but I am always a fan of bonus tracks and even live cuts if done right, and def leppard can do no wrong.  If you have for some reason held off buying this album on CD (I'll admit it, i had only a cassette and a record of this album), now is the time to part ways with a few dollars and get this edition.  The book has great pictures of the band and the hysteria story in it as well. Enjoy this edition, for collectors and plan rock fans alike.
0393307050|4.0|There are books to enjoy, others to have light fun and other to find the origins of everything else. This book belongs to the last category, because the next books of war or sailors you read will have some ideas from this and you will know where everything starts.
0764574124|4.0|the book doesn't tell you everything, but it tells you what you need to know to get started and get some things done.  It is great resource to take you from zero knowledge to proficiency with the most commonly used VBA tasks.  However, a VBA beginner will quickly outgrow this book and need to move on to John's more advanced VBA books.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie is hilarious and family-friendly.  We all watch it over and over and laugh until we cry every time.  This is a new must-watch movie tradition during the holidays.
B000002WPI|4.0|This CD is for true followers of the Wu Trilogy of Asiatic martial arts productions for Hip-Hop. It provides a rich harmonic background and urban overtones for the listener's entertaining engagements.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I enjoyed the CD very much. My favorite track is \\"Walk of Life\\".I <br />recommend this CD to all DIRE STRAITS fans.
1881273156|5.0|I've known of this book for years, but hadn't actually read it until now.  It was amazing... and extremely helpful!  I'm not a good \\"nonfiction reader\\" but this one read very easily & quickly!  Now, if I could just get my husband to read it - or at least to read a couple of the chapters!  I heartily recommend it for all married couples -- regardless the \\"closeness\\" or \\"distance\\" in your relationship.  Particularly good for young couples just starting out.
B00005JPBJ|4.0|I was really suprised to walk out of the theatre and be as impressed as I was. I mean this is the third installment. But this is really nothing I can complain about. I can only shake my head and say, yes, they have done it again.  This time around though I would have to say that the traps and deaths are the best.  And this movie really does tie up all the loose ends. Even the ones you did not know existed. I hear tale that there is a four one in the makes but I hope this is not true. They really ended the series well with this one. I just do not feel another one would fit. <br /> <br />If you have seen and or like the other two go out and see this movie. It is well worth the money.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|We love watching the series...it's so funny and mostly true to life...we even laugh when we've seen the episode beofre..never tire of watching great writing and acting!!!
B000AMWIVM|4.0|This is one of those movies that is truly thought out. At no time did I know who the Jigsaw (the killer/mastermind) was.  I thought I did, but I was wrong!  And this  is also one of those movies that will throw you a loop at the end. All in all this movie took something that has been done before, though in slightly different form, and made it, it's own. If you like a well thought out though very bloody and demented movie that will keep you guessing till the end than this is a must see. <br /> <br />I went into the theater with low expectations and came out with a smile on my face!
B000FVQYZY|3.0|This album has some good standouts and moments of genius, like I would expect from these guys, but some moments are a bit over the top and melodramatic. That works for them sometimes, but not in the slower songs like \\"Soldier's Poem\\" <br />If you want their best, go for Origin of Symmetry or Absolution.
B00005JLET|5.0|I have a few friends who \\"don't like cartoons\\". I guess they were brought up on Hannah-Barbara drek and it turned them off of the whole genre. When I run into this attitude,I pull out Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoroto show them the beauty, subtly, and power of animation.
B000091A5V|5.0|On the 4th anniversary of \\"demontalented\\"'s 1 star review, I would just like to offer this shout out to him... <br /> <br />demon, you're an idiot.  <br /> <br />Thank you.
B000H7JCG4|3.0|I was in my late 20's when this was on so by all means didnt fit into the central group watching it but I loved looking at the pretty people and seeing what they went through. This was great if you wanted to see what to wear or how to grow your side burns and it made stars out of a lot of the teen stars. The show of course outstayed it's welcome by about 5 or 6 seasons and I stopped watching it, missing the last 3 or 4 years when hardly anyone from the original cast was even on anymore.
B000056BOR|5.0|If you like classics you will love this romantic comedy. I love Doris Day and Cary grant together. This will keep you laughing the whole time!
0792844882|1.0|I enjoyed the movie even though I was only able to watch it in segments. The first time I tried to watch it, after about 20 minutes, the screen went to digital gibberish and my DVD player hung up so that I couldn't even open the tray to remove the disc or turn off the power. I had to unplug the DVD player, wait, and replug the power cord to remove the disc. Overnight, I decided I needed to replace my DVD player. However, the next morning, I tried a different DVD and it worked fine. It still works fine on all my other DVDs. I complained to your customer service people and they were nice enough to send me a replacement copy of Showgirls. Unfortunately, this one has the same problem. It plays for several minutes and then goes to gibberish and hangs my DVD player. I gave up on the problem at this point and decided to just get through my life without Showgirls. I use my DVD player almost every day and it works fine except when I try to watch Showgirls.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I am not a fan of the 'new' punk.  Bands like (no offense to these specific bands) Good Charlotte, Blink 182, Yellowcard all sound exactly the same to me.  Panic! however seems very unique and refreshing.  They definetly put the punk back in punk, even if they aren't old school. <br />
B00000G3AZ|4.0|Casting is great.  Some silly moments when you want to say \\"Stop already\\", but finally I think Emma learns and still gets the prize.  The story is great escape fare and very entertaining.
B00004WF68|3.0|This review is only based on the ten original tracks, though there are some great bonus tracks (Paper Sun; Hole in My Shoe; Smiling Phases) that would've undoubtedly boosted the rating had they been included on the original album instead of a few of the dated psychedelic songs Berkshire Poppies; A House for Everyone; Utterly Simple; Hope I Don't Find Me There; and the album-closing jam Giving to You. Psychedelia wasn't Traffic's thing, they were better off playing jazz/folk/rock songs such as Heaven is In Your Mind; No Face, No Name, No Number; Colored Rain and that unforgettable title track, arguably the best song in the Traffic canon. Plus Dealer is a good song, on the misunderstood side - the title does spell drugs, but it's really about a card dealer. A bit of an offbeat subject, but this was 1968. At its best, it's the kind of English Folke that would later inspire Jethro Tull's best work; at worst, it's psychedelic excess vaguely reminiscent of the Rolling Stones' worst work. Thankfully, they would get their sound straight on the next, self-titled album, the latter of which containing several classics (You Can All Join In; Pearly Queen; Feelin' Alright?; 40,000 Headsmen). It's the better buy, but this isn't bad at all.
B00005JKG9|3.0|I first heard about this movie from a co-worker who compared the movie to \\"Office Space\\" for the sales world.  I was expecting a hillarious comedy.  When I watched it, I kept waiting for it to get funny, but it was more of a drama.  The all-star cast was great though.  Upon reflection, I could see points made that are good lessons learned in business -- points that I could make at work.  When I talked with some of our sales people about it, they had really enjoyed this movie.  So maybe it has a very special audience.  Just don't expect a comedy. . .  it's a drama with a few funny moments.
B000002GW5|3.0|I've never been a huge Jackson Browne fan, but Running on Empty isn't bad. The best cuts are the title track, You Love the Thunder, Cocaine and Stay. But songs like Shaky Town, Rosie & Love Needs a Heart are fillers. You've got to give the guy credit for trying something new with the live album, too - none of these songs had been released on a Jackson Browne album up until this point, and it's a concept album about life on the road. Not half bad, but I can think of better singer-songwriters (cough cough Joni Mitchel)
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Great movie, but if I was to buy this over again, I would only buy the single disc edition.  The behind the scenes feature and movie itself are both on disc 1.
B000002AP1|5.0|The Stooges have a thing for apt titles. Think about it - Real Cool Time is a cool song; Loose is positively unhinged. And this album is, well... raw. And powerful. Very, very powerful. Even the pseudo-ballads (classic Gimme Danger; I Need Someone) both are heavy on the rock. And, of course, there's Search and Destroy, an unforgettable punk anthem. The most brutal song on this album is Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell, a powerful put-down that is still a demanding, yet excellent, listen today. The title track also rocks, utterly simple but very, very effective. Also cool is the album-closing Death Trip, you can practically hear the group self-destructing here, just as you could hear the original lineup of the group self-destructing on L.A. Blues. Shake Appeal is filler, but that's it - though not as good as Fun House, Raw Power certainly deserves its classic status.
B00006I53S|4.0|I have always used third party lenses before but after trying this Canon I have to say I am impressed with the quality, it feels like a solid piece of equipment rather than a hunk of lightweight plastic.    I find my photos to be much sharper due to the IS and the lens itself. I have tremors in my hands and so was having a difficult time with a normal lens but the IS has helped tremendously for that.   I like the range of zoom as it is pretty much all purpose for me( have used the kit lens only once since i got this lens when i needed a wider angle). I could occasionally/rarely use a little more distance but nothing is perfect.  My only complaint is that the lens is heavy and pretty much doubles the weight of my camera( Rebel xt). You know it's around your neck after a few hours shooting.   I haven't had any focus hunting problems,which i had constantly with the 3rd party lenses. and the lens is very quiet which is imo a good thing.  For a reasonably priced lens it is well worth the money.    well i feel i have to edit this..shortly after the first review, my lens stopped focusing and would not allow me to take a photo, usually if i was bending over or using macro or in low light. Finally sent it in to Canon in Jan 2,20007...as of this date( march 20,2007 still do not have a lens that is as sharp as the initial lens. they replaced the IS and mother board, ( led me to believe they did that twice but i do not think they did so) clean adjusted set to factory specs but it is so soft i consider it unusable anywhere but around f8...so close to worthless. i am sending it in again after i run some focus tests but i think what ever they did ruined my lens and not although the lens will focus and the is is working, just not the same as it was initially. I wouldn't buy it given a second chance. I would compare it now to a poor copy of a cheap poorly reviewed sigma or tamron lens, worth closer to the mid $200 range
B000059T1E|5.0|Okay, maybe this is Traffic's best work. I'm not sure, it's a toss-up between this and the self-titled record. It's amazing regardless. The group's folk influence are in full flower here, as displayed on their cover of the age-old folk standard John Barleycorn, just one of the amazing tracks here. The instrumental suite that opens the album (Glad) is also cool, starting off as an uptempo funk song, before turning into jazz and then a folksy outro. Just as good is the haunting ballad Freedom Rider, an effective showcase for Chris Wood. Not to mention Empty Pages. The only misstep the album makes is Every Mother's Son, a rather pointless jam. But the rest more than makes up for that. For the record, Dave Mason had left the group at this point. Steve Windwood handles the guitars.

B000000XCH|4.0|Creedence was a singles band, and most of the best songs here are the singles - Travelin' Band; Run Through the Jungle;  Up Around the Bend; Lookin' Out My Back Door and Who Will Stop The Rain were all big hits, and they're all by far the best songs here. As for the worst? Aimless jam Ramble Tamble getsabsolutely nowhere; Ooby Dooby and My Baby Left Me are fillers. But their cover of Before You Accuse Me also shines, plus album-closer As Long as I Can See the Light has a nice sax solo and the long, murky, hoodoo cover of I Heard it Through the Grapevine is easily my favorite Creedence jam. It's no masterpiece, but it's a good record, highly recommended for CCR fans.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I ordered the set of BAND OF BROTHERS because I wanted to watch each segment again!  It turns out that my finance said they were too real and brought back too many memories of  warfare!       Yes, they are very real...authentic.   Speilberg and Tom Hanks did a marvelous job of producing   some fantastic footage about WAR, period.   More young people should be watching the series  since it might make them think more about what goes on with our government, why they should  VOTE, etc.   IF WE FAIL to pay attention to what OUR GOVERNMENT is doing, we may end up with  a \\"Hitler\\" heading up our goverment.   Scary thought.    I am looking forward to watching the six DVD.   I appreciate how quickly AMAZON.com   sends out orders.  I have since ordered a lot of items from AMAZON.com because of my  great impression how they handle orders.  No problems, quick, simple..DONE!  THANKS!

1592401791|5.0|Geoff Emerick's book is a watershed of insight into The Beatles recordings at Abbey Road.  From the beginning of text until the end the book hooks you and keeps you enthralled in the story.  I have read a lot of books about The Beatles, but this is a great read because its from the point-of-view of someone who was there and contributed to creating The Beatles unique sound and style.  Also, the story of Geoff's life is a fun read too. His story is fasinating and fun to follow.  For anyone who is a fan of The Beatles music I highly recommend this book.  Have fun and tune-in as the ride begins and takes you on a magical mystery tour.

The only area this book could be better in is descriptions of plants/animals. Wherever it was necessary to describe many plants, for example poisonous plants, the description were very brief and the \\"pictures\\" (really drawings) were quite bad. The same applies to animals. That is why I only gave 4 stars. Other than that, this book is really a great resource.

B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin is most known for 3 albums: Led Zeppelin II, Led Zeppelin IV, and Physical Graffiti.  They are all fantastic, but I feel like this album should be in the same class as the others.  Robert Plant's voice is at the height of its power (after this album, he never had quite the same range).  Jimmy Page is still a prominent figure at guitar and has some of his best solos.  John Bonham is always fantastic on the drums as usual and Jones continues to provide the band with great arrangements. <br /> <br />The first three songs are the most finished and really go well together.  \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" begins with Jimmy's fast, driving guitar, slows down, and builds speed slowly towards the end with an excellent climax.  \\"The Rain Song\\" is the album's ballad.  Jimmy's guitar does most of the singing here, with a solid 2 minutes of strumming away in the middle until Plant's soft vocals return.  It ends with Bonham and Jones adding their Drums and Piano work, respectively, to give the song intense emotion and power to finish.  My personal favorite, \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", ends out the three with driving force.  This is one of Robert Plant's most awe inspiring vocal performances along with one of the most complex arrangements the band ever had.  Jimmy, who layered an acoustic and electric guitar, arranges excellent guitar work for the solo to partner with Plant's singing. <br /> <br />The second half of the album is not quite as sharp and finished as the first three songs, but it still has plenty of pop.  They have fun with the funk-like song \\"The Crunge\\".  \\"Dancing Days\\" follows, where Robert reminices from times gone by.  D'yer Maker is a unique song with a Reggae sound, guided Jimmy's groovy guitar and Bonham's driving beat.  No Quarter is the song Jones is most noted for and delves into dark subjects. Robert needs to give his full range of abilities, not only with his powerful high notes, but with softer low notes.  The album ends with \\"The Ocean\\", which is a relatively simple rock song, but with Led Zeppelin's unique heavy yet light sound. <br /> <br />This album is the forgotten album between two greats.  The full range of Led Zeppelin's abilities is revealed and it is their most diverse album.  I'd say it needs to be in any rock collection just like Physical Graffiti, Led Zeppelin IV, and Led Zeppelin II already are.

B00005JLWN|5.0|This was a sleeper hit in my opinion. I discovered this movie by accident and just fell in love with it.  It is a brillant masterful work of modern cinema art.  A cross between the Matrix, 1984, and DarkCity this is one great movie.  It deals with a cold, emotionless, nazi like future society where emotion is outlawed and regulated by medication.  Sense Offenders are hunted down and killed along with horded art, music, and other precious antiques.  In one scene they burn the a very well known painting after confirming that it was the real deal.  A somewhat depressing movie at first grows into an exciting fun to watch drama.  The Gun Kata is something new and unique, executed in a brillant and fun to watch manor.  This movie bumped Empire Strikes Back off of my top 5 list.  That is how much I enjoyed this movie.
B00005MP58|5.0|This collection is the perfect embodiment of Jane Austen's novel.

Lovingly filmed with an eye to being absolutely true to the period in costume and interiors, without it becoming a costume epic.
B0000CDL93|3.0|As a whole the movie was informative.  But some very important information was left out.  The press conference film right after Kennedy was killed was not in the movie.  This press conference had the speaker talking about and showing the ENTRY wound to the right temple area of the head.  They also left out the bullet holes that past from the front through the wind shield and the bullet dent to the frame of the wind shield also from the front.   There are a lot more questions that went unanswered or were left out most likely because of the time constraints.  But like I said before, all and all the movie was informative.

B000000OPZ|1.0|When \\"Here I Go Again\\" comes on the radio, i always end up listening for a few moments just because I am baffled about how bad some songwriting can be.  Its hilarious that when you hear a line, you can predict the next one.  I dont think Coverdale means anything he sings...he just picked the words cuz it sounds good...to him anyway.<br /><br />In the Still of the Night is no better.  The music sounds as if they intended it to be some brooding rock anthem.  Its like they were trying to create some type of mystery and suspense building towards  some rock zenith ...but when you hear the lyrics....all they are saying is \\"Im horny...gimme some\\".  Hey, Im not opposed to songs about sex, but give me a break, dont pretend like you're telling me something brilliant.<br /><br />All in all, Whitesnake is exactly what Spinal Tap was making fun of.  I bet Whitesnake didnt even get the joke.
B000022TSH|5.0|Chinatown shows up in the Top Five all-time films of so many people, it's probably difficult to say what it is exactly that people find so wonderful about it. The absolute magnetism and deft performance of its emerging star, Jack Nicholson, is no doubt one of its stronger assets. While the story is brilliantly unique and quite interesting, it is not exciting, per se; it is dutifully structured in the detective genre, and aside from an occasional outburst of violence, is rather quiet and cerebral. Screenwriter and storyteller Robert Towne's scenes and dialogue are spare but sparkling, as is the cinematography and film editing.      Perhaps its greatest asset is its director, Roman Polanski who, with his art and set directors, magically re-creates Los Angeles as it was in the 30's. Whether staging scenes against bleached white adobe, a palm-lined street at twilight, or an office bathed in a venetian blind's shadows, Polanski gets a perfect, painterly shot in every frame.  He effortlessly guides all of his actors--lead and supporting alike--in subtle, but heartfelt performances.  This is one of those movies where the actors seem to believe that they themselves are in another time and place and that they are actually the characters they are portraying.  Add to all of this a moody, evocative score and its unforgettable love theme and suddenly the economical becomes expansive, filling the screen with dazzling movie-making at its best. The devastatingly powerful last scene is screen legend, rivalled, perhaps, only by Casablanca.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|A Wonderful Jimmy Stewart Movie <br /> <br />   This is Jimmy Stewart's best movie.  His timing and delivery throughout the film are superb and reflect his greatness as an actor better than any of his other movies.   <br /> <br />   The plot is also a classic -based on Christian moral values- especially as \\"George\\" is always willing to take on added burdens for his friends and family, no matter how much they conflict with his own desires to leave his small town behind in order to strike it rich in the big city.  The parallels to New Testament teachings are also striking, as the end result of George's faith and good works leads to his salvation and a tremendous outpouring of support from all his friends and family during what could have been his darkest hour.

0800177177|5.0|PLOT: The film begins in Transylvania in 1462. Muslim Turks have invaded Romania and one of the Romanians sworn to protect the Orthodox church from Turkish rule is Prince Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman). Dracula is a very skilled general and fighter. Sensing that something is wrong, Dracula returns to his castle to find his beloved wife Elizabeta (Winona Ryder) dead. A false letter sent by a Turkish arrow claimed that Dracula was killed in battle, so Elizabeta flung herself into the river below the castle. Dracula becomes insane with grief and vows to avenge her death. He renounces God and gains eternal life as a force of darkness. The film then jumps to London, England in 1897. An assistant real estate agent named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) is assigned to meet up with a Transylvanian client named Count Dracula. Dracula plans to purchase Carfax Abbey. Harker was assigned the position after his predecessor, R.M. Renfield, went to Transylvania and came back to London as a lunatic. Since then, he had been committed to Carfax Asylum. Once in Transylvania, Harker takes a coach to a crossroads area known as the Borgo Pass. After being dropped off, a mysterious coach, with an even more mysterious driver, meets up with him and takes him to Castle Dracula. Harker meets Count Dracula at the castle and is immediately very cautious around him. The count seems to be very old and very strange. After signing some papers, the count notices a picture of Harker's fianc&eacute;e, Wilhelmina \\"Mina\\" Murray. Something comes over him, and he immediately tells Harker to write to all business partners and loved ones and tell them that he remian in the castle for a month. Harker becomes more and more frightened by the count. Dracula even seems to be frightened by the crucifix that Harker wears on his neck. One night, Harker sees Dracula crawling on the side of one of the castle's walls. What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature in the shape of a man?<br /><br />COMMENTS: I feel that this film is probably one of the Top 3 best film verions of Dracula, along with Nosferatu (1922) and the 1931 version starring B&eacute;la Lugosi. Technically, its the film version that is the closest to Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. Unlike most novels, \\"Dracula\\" is written in the form of diary and journal entries, captain's logs, transcriptions of phonograph recordings, etc. This film is set up the same way. Several of the characters are shown writing things down in their diaries. Francis Ford Coppola did a superb job at researching the novel and trying to make his film as faithful to it as possible. Character's such as Quincy P. Morris, are usually written out of most of the film versions, but now we finally get a look at Bram Stoker's original vision. Gary Oldman is spectacular as Dracula; his accent is immaculate. I forgot several times that it even was Gary Oldman. Sir Anthony Hopkins was also a fine choice for the role of Dracula's arch-nemesis, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. The only major difference is that Coppola wrapped Stoker's novel around a love story. The subplot of Mina being a reincarnation of Dracula's deceased wife Elizabeta does not appear in the novel. In fact, Stoker never intended for Dracula the vampire and Dracula the historical figure to be the same person. In the original novel, the only connection that Count Dracula has to the real-life Vlad Dracula (a.k.a. Vlad the Impaler) is simply the name: Dracula. Other than these two differences, it is very faithful. Greg Cannom's makeup and special effects are marvelous. All of this plus the locations, the costumes, and Wojciech Kilar's unforgettable score make Bram Stoker's Dracula a must-have for any horror fan. Due to the success of this film, plans were made to make a trilogy of horror films based on classsic literature. In 1994, Francis Ford Coppola produced Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. The film, directed by actor Kenneth Branaugh and starring Robert DeNiro as the monster, didn't do as well as thefilmmakers had hoped. Plans for a film adaptation of H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man were later scrapped. Other Dracula films have been made since this one, but I don't feel that any of them are in the same league as this one. This DVD presents the film in the widescreen theatrical ratio. Unfortunately there are no DVD extras.had hoped. Plans for a film adaptation of H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man were later scrapped.

0790737345|4.0|Years ago I rented \\"Wings of Desire\\" after reading how wonderful it was. I'm sorry to say I was confused and uninterested from the start and did an extremely rare thing for me: I turned it off. It could very well have been wonderful, and had I invested a little more time in it, I might have become a fan of it. It's something I wonder about to this day--but honestly, not enough to rent \\"Wings\\" again.  <br /> <br />I knew \\"City of Angels\\" was the American \\"re-make\\" of \\"Wings\\" and I chose to see it anyway. I'll tell you this: my house may be been burgled or burned while I watched. I'll never know. I was drawn in by \\"City of Angels'\\" imagery, it's music, it's quiet and careful pacing, and by the understated performances of Cage and Ryan. It is one of only a handful of films I can think of that I couldn't get out of my mind--for days!  <br /> <br />The out of this world fantastic subject matter of an angel falling in love with a human and contemplating relinquishing his immortality could make this movie a bit of an eyeroller, but the filmmakers respect both the story and their audience and they make it work. This is a quiet, romantic, and melancholy film. It is almost like a dream and it is likely to draw you into it's unusual little world.  <br /> <br />DVD features: Nice additional behind the scenes interviews and music videos (from a soundtrack that is equally familar and challenging and ultimately, rewarding).  <br /> <br />
B0000041TD|5.0|A long time ago, my father was driving my teenaged self somewhere as he listened to a cassette of \\"Pavarotti's Greatest Hits\\" on the car stereo. During \\"Che gelida manina\\", he tried to enlighten my ignorance as to what was special about it. \\"This is one of the great moments in opera,\\" he explained. \\"The man sings this beautiful aria. Then the woman sings something even more beautiful. Then the two of them sing together and it's even more beautiful than that.\\" I grunted in assent that it must be a whole lot of beautifulness and then returned my attention to whatever science fiction novel I was reading at the time.  <br /> <br />Many years have passed since then. My father is dead, and I probably know more about opera now than he did. But, perhaps because of that conversation, the end of Act I still defines \\"La Boheme\\" for me. [Moral of the story for parents of teens: Keep sharing yourself with your kids, no matter how much they grunt at you. There's no telling what will stick.] If a performance doesn't convey Dad's Guinness-Book sense that opera really doesn't get any more powerful or moving than this, I have to consign it to the \\"Not Quite\\" file. Sorry Tebaldi/Bergonzi and Callas/di Stefano. <br /> <br />All of which is to set up my claim that Freni/Pavarotti are the ones who truly deliver the goods in this virtually impossible-to-sing scene. While di Stefano's voice has a marvelous bronze gleam and crisp pronunciation, he simply doesn't have the sheer tone power to compete with the strength of Puccini's melodies. When Rodolfo sings \\"In te ravviso / Il sogno ch'io vorrei sempre sognar!\\", the heroic notes demand that the tenor produce a sound that you would follow into battle. Here Pav unforgettably brings da noise - and \\"Yes, Giorgio\\" is forgiven all over again. <br /> <br />Freni is equally virtuosic in the soprano's milieu, somehow managing to convey a waifish bohemian as she robustly full-lungs her way through some of the most cruelly exposed high notes in the music. And how euphoniously their two instruments mesh in the duets! How confidently they surf the surging waves of Karajan's conducting! <br /> <br />I don't know what else to say except that it's all here. Every component of the recorded operatic experience - composer, conductor, musicians, and singers - exercising mastery at world-class levels. There is nothing to impede the plucking of your heartstrings until they fray and snap. If you can listen to the final offstage \\"Amor!\\" with dry eyes, there is something dead inside you - I'm sorry to say. I'm verklempt now just thinking about it. <br /> <br />So, yes - all the raves here are true. This is not just the best \\"Boheme\\", but one of the best opera recordings ever made. You know what to do.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|Aside from the fact that Wagner is one of the greatest geniuses to ever grace our planet, this is his magnum opus!  And done with such great respect and care for the score by Mr. Levine, the MET and the amazing cast.  Yes, Hidegard Behrens is just past prime (but still great) and Christa Ludwig hides her age with vibrato... but it is a monumental production!  James Morris and Matti Salminen might as well be dipped in bronze and set on top of Bayreuth!  Mr. Morris, or 'Butters' as I like to call him is so amazing that it isn't fair...  He is the reason that this DVD and CD set are at the level they are.  He develops the character, Wotan, to be a little more human than his predecessors and has a touch more legato in his phrasing, which heightens the music...  although people have criticized him for this.  Well, they do this because, he is better than what they are used to and, in order to justify their auditory inadequacies, defile and defy what is simply better (or should I say Butter).  Tempos are perfect...  A little slow on the entry of the giants (Rheingold), but that's my only complaint.  Great sound quality and Brian Large makes it an experience, rather than a task.  I can't say enough about this ring...  It brought me to tears multiple times. Years of fun await the owner of this great masterpiece of human accomplishment!  After seeing Barenboim's ring on DVD and Boulez's ring on DVD I must urge you to get this.  This is the true ring!  See my reviews of the other ring cycles to compare...

1577314808|5.0|This book is a radical wisdom teaching. The premise is simple - that the only reality is to be found in the present moment, but the realization of this changes the way we look at and react with the world. I've read the book twice: once to understand what he's talking about, and again to see how to apply it. I have given it to several friends. The best thing about the book is the question-and-answer format, which deals with most of the problems that come up. I also liked the references to Buddhism and Christianity. The book is especially valuable for people who deal with depression and/or anxiety. A lot of the reviews of this book are negative; as Tolle points out, the ego has a lot invested in its survival.
B0002J54KA|5.0|Bob Dylan accepted Christ as his Savior in 1978, and right away, his newborn faith became evident in his music.

The song itself is about taking on the mind of Christ, thinking the thoughts of a Christian rather than the thoughts of the world.<br /><br />There are also songs about the Golden Rule (Do Right to Me Baby), and the Garden of Eden story (Man Gave Names to all the Animals, a good children's song), and the closing number \\"When He Returns,\\" probably the greatest song on the album, a stirring gospel tune that looks forward to the return of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />I also like the song \\"When You Gonna Wake Up,\\" a blues rock song where Dylan challenges us to wake up and accept Jesus.<br /><br />Dylan's singing is a little strained at times, maybe because he was caught up in the emotion of the songs.

0743289412|3.0|I'm a big King fan, and -- unless I'm dead broke or just plain dead -- will always read his new novels as soon as they come out, but all in all, I'd have to say \\"Lisey's Story\\" is not one of my favorites.  It's not bad, exactly; there are way too many beautifully written passages to even consider calling the book bad. <br /> <br />However, I think that the book was badly in need of some editorial intervention at some point.  I'm not referring to the book's length (though it IS too long, probably by about 300 pages), but rather to (1) an incredibly excessive use of silly language and (2) too many different threads of plot that don't manage to fully connect. <br /> <br />In terms of the silly language . . . well, \\"silly\\" is patently the wrong word for me to use.  Here's the deal.  The two main characters, one of whom exists only in recollection by the other, are a (formerly) married couple who have a sort of private language consisting of certain phrases (\\"Strap On Whenever It Seems Appropriate,\\" for example) and words (replacing \\"afghan,\\" meaning the sawhl. with \\"african,\\" and so on).  This is nothing revolutionary; it's the same thing as an inside joke, and everyone I know, in each significant relationship, has a few of tthose that get tossed around until they do in fact become a sort of private language.  But here's the problem with that in a novel: it kept me at a distance the entire time.  I think it was designed to bring me into the interior lives of these two people, but it had the exact opposite effect on me, and at a certain point in time I began to get actively annoyed every time this sort of thing appeared.  And it's used A LOT.  Less so toward the end of the novel, but it's incessant in the first 200 pages. <br /> <br />My second major problem is that there's just too much going on, and some of it I can't quite manage to care about.   <br /> <br />One plot is about Lisey taking care of her mentally ill sister Amanda, and this storyline, while well told, just doesn't come together.  Amanda's story has no resolution; she's only there so that she can back Lisey up in another element of the story, which she fails to do with any weight -- so, in a sense, she's a pointless character. <br /> <br />Another plot deals with Lisey's attempts to clean out her husband's many papers, which leads to an increasingly dangerous series of encounters with a stalker who could have walked straight out of King's \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\" (King even acknowledges this, in a way I'm sure will be lost on all but the most ardent King fans).  This part of the plot allows Lisey to be an active character (in other words, it serves to actually give her something to do), but I don't buy it for a second.  It seems incredibly forced, and not at all relevant. <br /> <br />The third major plot element involves Lisey remembering -- through clues Scott left her before his death -- certain things about her husband's life (and their life together) that she has sort of been repressing.  This element of the novel works almost entirely, and if the rest had been jettisoned, it would rank as one of King's finest achievements.  This part of the story is a beautifully told love story with additional touches of divine fantasy and brutal horror, and it's pretty much sublime.  The problem is, it's told haltingly, with many interruptions from the other parts of the plot.  It's a shame, because the svelte form of a classic dark fantasy have been rendered into corpulence by material that ought to have been exluded. <br /> <br />Ultimately, it's a novel that's well worth reading (it's about one-third brilliant), but I personally can only classify it as a big-time missed opportunity.  Still, mediocre King is better than most writers when they're on top of their game.

0060922583|5.0|The ideas in this book are so alien to someone who hasn't seen them before that they seem almost crazy.  But virtually everything presented in the book makes perfect sense and seems logical after it is explained.  I couldn't put this book down.

The simplicity of the story and the illustrations are soothing to both my son and me.

B00005JMYI|2.0|One of the labels for this Anchorman DVD labels the edition as \\"uncalled for\\", and I couldn't agree more- this movie was completely uncalled for and unnecessary.  In an edition of GameInformer magazine, Reiner and Joe recalled a conversation they had in which it took them several hours to \\"regain normal higher-level brain functions\\" after an unfortunate run-in at the movie theaters between them and Uwe Boll's Bloodrayne; I hate to say it, but I feel the same way about this movie. This movie literally made me feel stupid- but not so stupid as to continue watching it past about half an hour.  The part I did see, however, made me think of movies in which Will Ferrell was actually funny- movies like Elf, my personal favorite from Ferrell, or more recently Talladega Nights: The Story of Ricky Bobby. Anchorman really wasn't that interesting, I laughed at maybe one joke in the movie, and overall I hated the experience.  Good thing I watched it at a friend's house and not at the theaters- otherwise, I'd have to demand my money back.

0425188809|5.0|I will say upfront that WATCHERS is one of my favorite books, and certainly my number one among all Koontz's works.  That being said, I suppose I am not a real fan of the \\"hyphenated\\" genre - in this case horror/action-thriller. I find them a little schizophrenic, as in split personality.  I could easily have dispensed with the hitman and his whole backstory, as well as Nora's stalker.  Instead, I would have liked more about and from \\"The Outsider.\\"   <br /> <br />But that's just a quibble,and this is a terrific story!  The opening pages, for example, will stay with you for quite a while.  If you're a backcountry hiker, they may pop up in your mind more than you might like...

6305212112|5.0|There are films that linger in memory for the warmth they exude and the impression they leave.  So it is with the now 15 year old film FRIED GREEN TOMATOES based on the novel 'Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe' by Fannie Flagg and arranged for the screen by that author. This is a film that explores racism, feminism, respect for the elderly, women's rights, and so very much more in a manner that is infectious to watch repeatedly and defies forgetting.<br /><br />Told on two levels, the film is narrated by the elderly Ninny Threadgoode (a luminous Jessica Tandy) who idles away her hours in her nursing home with stories about her childhood she shares with the sad, obese, emotionally fragile Evelyn (Kathy Bates) whose life of misery is slowly corrected by Ninny's tales of how two women in the past overcame impossible odds.  The story she tells dates back to Alabama in the 1930s when a young upstart Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson) is calmed by a frightened but solid Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker) and how their partnering results in a series of events that involve murder, racism, and some very strange events.<br /><br />The cast is superb, the script is delicious (!), and Jon Avnet directs with aplomb not only the fresh talent mentioned above, but also such fine actors as Cicely Tyson, Chris O'Donnell, Stan Shaw, Lois Smith and a large cast of supporting actors.  The re-creation of the Old South is palpably well focused as is the hilarious and touching stance from the contemporary standpoint of the nursing home and house of the chameleon Evelyn. It is a choice bit of filmmaking and one that deserves a place in every film lover's library.  Grady Harp, November 06
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This show is now my favorite musical of all time! It's definitely the best thing to come along since Jekyll & Hyde. The songs grow on you the more you hear them, they are wonderful.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|It was nice to sit down and have a good laugh and forget about things going on in the world for a few hours.   It's a good movie to sit down with your children and grandchildren and have quality time.   I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys laughter.
0385040253|5.0|Before opening this book, few people would have known how well developed the subject of knots is.  This \\"tome\\" exhaustively covers nearly every kind of knot from the decorative to the practical.  It includes historical background on the origin of each knot and detailed instructions on how to tie them.  The book is very well organized sorting knots into families and by type of use.  The illustrations are clear, comprehensive and easy to follow.   <br /> <br />Whether you are interested in the history of knots, or in need of the right knot for a specific job, this book is filled with a wealth of information to suit your interest.  This version appears to be essentially a facsimile of the original 1944 publication, which gives it a bit of a historical quality.  This only adds to its charm as this book is so well presented that it is every bit as relevant today as when it first came out. <br />

B00005JPAJ|4.0|I suspect most people will either love or hate \\"Babel\\", the new film from director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the director of \\"Amores Perros\\" and \\"21 Grams\\".<br /><br />This film sort of slipped under my radar. I have seen the trailer a few times, but that is about it. No advanced press or information about it, something I found strange considering the film stars Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Gael Garcia Bernal. After watching the film, this makes sense. The film is being positioned to be one of those \\"conversation starter\\" films, films that create buzz and then earn some Oscar nominations. The smaller it looks, the better its chances.<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" is a very good film. It has some flaws, but I am willing to overlook most of those due to the power of the story and the acting.<br /><br />A Moroccan goat herder buys a gun from a neighbor; he wants to keep the Jackals away from his goats, to preserve his cash flow. He gives the gun to his two sons, who take the goat herd out every day. The two boys, alone and bored, decide to test the statement of the neighbor who sold their father the gun; can the bullets reach 3 km. One of the boys is adept at using the weapon, the other is not. Finally, a tour bus makes its way down a barren road below them. Taking aim, they fire. After a few moments, the bus stops and the boys run away. An affluent California couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are traveling through Morocco on the tour bus. It is clear they have some problems in their marriage and perhaps the trip is a method of patching up the relationship. Dozing off to sleep, the wife suddenly gasps in pain; she has been shot. The husband asks the Moroccan guide where they can go. He says that his village is nearby and there is a doctor there. The other tourists are frightened, but the woman is losing too much blood. Back home, the couple's nanny is waiting for their sister to arrive and watch the couple's two young children. The husband calls; his sister can't make it. The nanny is expected at her son's wedding the next day in Mexico. Her boss says \\"Cancel the wedding, I'll pay for a better wedding when I get back\\". She decides to take the children with her. Her nephew (Gael Garcia Bernal) shows up to drive and they are off on an adventure. In Tokyo, a confused teenager (Rinko Kinkuchi), who is also a deaf mute, is having difficultly hiding her anger; her mother died a few months earlier and the relationship between she and her father is strained. She is also very anxious to have sex and many of the boys treat her as a freak when they find out she is a deaf mute. So she teases them and other men, in an effort for some release.<br /><br />Now, you might say to yourself after reading this synopsis, as I did while watching this film, \\"What connection does a deaf mute Japanese teenage girl have to the rest of the story?\\" And the answer is \\"A very tenuous one.\\" For a film like this to work, a film containing elaborate, multifaceted stories, everything has to be connected and work well together, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Everything else fits into place nicely and works together, which makes the Japanese story stand out all the more. The connection is just too small.<br /><br />That said, the story is interesting, unusual and worth watching.<br /><br />Over the years, there have been many film and television projects following the course of one item through the hands of multiple owners. And there have been other projects exploring the consequences of one action through different stories. \\"Babel\\" is a little of both.<br /><br />The gun passed down from one farmer to the other causes the beginning of the film, but the other elements are connected to this American couple and the gun, allowing the story to branch off from two different places. This is ultimately what makes the film as a whole better than the mistakes of individual parts. Because Inarritu is taking us in many directions, he has to create a compelling and interesting story. He has done that. In spades.<br /><br />As the American couple wait in the small Moroccan village for an ambulance, the rest of the tourists become antsy. It's hot and the driver won't turn on the air conditioning because that will waste gas and he can't stop at a corner gas station for a refill. The tourists are also frightened because they are in a small village where they believe anything can happen. A local brings them a plate of flatbread, because they must be hungry, yet they avoid her. She could be a terrorist trying to poison them. The Mexican nanny is clearly devoted to the children in her care, but her family obligations require her trip to Mexico. She decides to take them along and because they have grown up with her, they are completely at ease. Once they arrive at the wedding, these shy children have a great time, meeting new people, learning new things. The Moroccan boys hide the gun when their father comes home and states an American tourist was shot. Naturally, they are scared and don't breathe a word of the incident to their dad. The Japanese girl finds it difficult to find a companion. She and her friend are introduced to another friend's cousin, a handsome boy who doesn't seem to mind they are deaf because he has grown up with his cousin and he even understands some sign language. After an afternoon of drinking and partying, they go out dancing. As she moves in, she finds the boy kissing her friend. Heartbroken, she wanders the busy streets of Tokyo.<br /><br />Because each of these stories has many layers, the filmmaker holds our attention to the very end. Yes, some of these stories have problems, but in the end, I suspect that is probably what he wants to get across. It makes them seem more real, more life like, because life isn't neat and tidy.<br /><br />If you have seen either of Inarritu's previous films, you will recognize this film as his own. In \\"Babel\\", each of the stories is connected, but the timelines of each story are not synced. For instance, we first meet the Moroccan man and his family, learn about their life and watch as the neighbor trades them a gun and bullets. Then, they teach the sons how to use the gun and the boys take the goats out and do a little target practice. Then, a tour bus appears in the distance. The film cuts to a home in California. The Mexican nanny rushes to answer the phone. On the other end, Pitt is calling from Morocco, distraught, but he explains that his sister will be flying in to take care of the kids. The next day, he calls again to let the nanny know that the sister can't make it, she will have to stay and watch the kids, cancel the wedding. Then we watch as Brad and Cate sit at a makeshift caf&eacute; in the Moroccan desert. Cate is very unhappy, uses sanitizer on her hands and won't drink a coke with ice because she doesn't know where the water came from. Later, she is shot by a stray bullet. The next day, the nanny's nephew comes to pick them up and take them to the wedding. All of this happens within the first fifteen or twenty minutes and we pick up some stories before other stories start, shifting between the timelines of each with ease. Near the end of the film, you realize some of these story threads start much later than others. Because of this, some of the stories are the consequence of other actions in other parts of the film. Inarritu plays with the chronology of the film; it looks like we are watching things unfold simultaneously, but later we learn the secret to this story and how everything fits into place.<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" will not be remembered because of the acting, it will be remembered because of the storytelling. Clearly, these actors wanted to be involved because of the director and the story; each of the actors is playing a character we meet in mid story. They aren't allowed to have full character arches because the director only wants us to see specific things at precise times. As a result, much of Cate Blanchett's screen timeis spent depicting her character's suffering from the gunshot wound she has received. Most of Brad Pitt's, the anguish of a husband unable to stop his wife's pain. Bernal's character is the driver for the nanny and her children, to get to her son's wedding. He acts as a facilitator, getting the children acclimated to their new surroundings, but then he has a good time, along with everyone else, during the festive ceremony. It doesn't even matter that these characters do not develop very much, they are there to serve the story and the story is what is important in \\"Babel\\".<br /><br />That Japanese story. I keep coming back to that. Because the connection is so tenuous, you would expect it to provide greater illumination to the overall theme of the film, to help us see what the other stories are trying to portray. But it doesn't. The story is interesting and unusual; I can think of few depictions of Japanese teenager's on film, even fewer depictions of deaf mute teenagers and no previous portrayals of deaf mute Japanese teenagers. We are immediately drawn in and the character is interesting, perhaps the most fully developed. But she has very, very little to do with the Moroccan farmers, the American couple and the Mexican nanny. During her journey, Inarritu experiments with the sights and sounds of her journey, trying to make us as disoriented as she must feel. But this can't be the sole reason for her inclusion in this story. Can it?<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" is a well-made, complicated film depicting four very different groups of people who are all connected by circumstances created by others.

I loved most of it, and thought it was a great love story, and could not put it down just like everyone else.  I was for some reason really disapointed though.  I think i am ready for him to make a happy book.  The past two books to me have turned out poorly and i am ready for a happy ending such as The Wedding!

B000FQ4M58|5.0|For a \\"Bat\\" album lacking the direct involvement of Jim Steinman, Bat out of Hell III is nothing short of impressive. This isn't to say that I lowered my standards while forming my opinion of this CD. It is truly an excellent album both for the Bat series and in its own right. The 7 Steinman songs covered here are predictably very good, but huge credit must go to Producer/songwriter Desmond Child, who does a remarkable job replicating Steinman's style. His songs are every bit as enjoyable in my opinion, though often darker and more modern sounding.  <br /> <br />The musicians are all of the highest caliber, which is clear even upon a casual listen. Numerous guest musicians such as Brian May and Steve Vai bring their own signature styles to the music, while a full orchestra blasts away in the background. The featured female vocalists are uniformly excellent, and all very different from each other. Marion Raven's duet with Meat on \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" is a big highlight, even though I don't normally enjoy long ballads. However, even with the presence of past \\"Bat\\" collaborators such as Todd Rundgren, it is clearly Meat Loaf himself running the show here. I really can't praise his performance on this album enough. This is a man who is nearly 60 years old and still singing with more power, passion, and intensity than just about anyone else in rock & roll. It is his best vocal work since the original Bat out of Hell. <br /> <br />On the whole, Bat III is everything you could really want from a Bat album. It is waaaay over the top in every way, with roaring rockers and endless power ballads (I mean that in the best way possible). It's definitely better than Bat II, although the 1977 original still reigns supreme. Critics have battered it over the absence of Jim Steinman. Although it probably would have been better with his participation, I don't think that's worth dwelling on. This is a great album. Plain and simple. So just go ahead and enjoy it aight?
0743289412|3.0|Everything I've been reading here by the readers has made me feel tremendous relief! I thought I was going crazy or getting Alzheimers or worse. This is the first time I ever started a King novel and ... just sort of got lost. On the PLUS side, a little voice recently told me to re-read \\"The Dark Half,\\" the only book by King I thought I never liked. The second time was MUCH better. A lot of what Lisey thinks about in the first few chapters certainly EVOKE George Stark, but that would be a spoiler! I'm REALLY having a hard time with this one, but I'll keep plugging away. Some things I've come to think about King: He reveres women and mothers; he hated his biological father; he really IS scared of some things; he is one of the very few male writers. living or dead, who can write in a male AND \\"female\\" voice, and be truly believable.

0743455967|5.0|While this isn't the best book in the world for writers, it is one of the homiest, most honest, most down-to-earth one you will find.  While King may have developed verbal diarrhea in many of his later novels, this book is very focused and has that one-on-one feel that King is so famous for.<br /><br />There's much more to this book other than \\"how to write a story\\".  King touches on his personal life, his struggles as an adolescent, a college student, a young husband and father, and later his struggles with addiction to alcohol and drugs.  What emerges is a highly personalized, conversational account of what it took to make Stephen King what he is today.  You will feel as if you are sitting on his back porch, sipping tea or perhaps a beer, and conversing, as two good friends are apt to.<br /><br />King also touches on his near fatal accident in 1999, when he was struck by a vehicle while taking an evening stroll.  As one who has spent time in a hospital, his accounts are vivid and extremely well told, and commendable to him is how lightly he treats the suffering that he must have gone through.  Also commendable is that he neither blames nor exonerates the person who struck him, he simply relays his perspective on how it effected his life as a writer and as a human being.<br /><br />When King does address writing, he is brief and to the hard point of major problems, mainly passive form and overuse of adverbs.  The heaviest reference he uses is Strunk and White's 'Elements Of Style', which every serious writer already has a copy of.  Also for the writer, there is one overt challenge and many hidden ones that King presents, so put your pen to paper and follow his lead.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book that will entertain fans and encourage writers.  Stephen King is one of the best 'yarn spinners' in the business, and 'On Writing' takes me back to the good ol' days when King spun tight prose and homestyle dialogue that captured the hearts of millions.  Me included.  Enjoy!luded.  Enjoy! <br />

6305558167|3.0|I wasn't pleased with the selection of the character of young Arthur in this film. No charisma, imo.  He looks too much like a modern teenager and often acts like one too.   The best characters were Merlin, (loved him)  Morgan (great as usual in everything)  and her son Mordred. (very interesting)  The rest of the cast was quite good.  Liked the music and the dance by Guinevere.   Direction was very good in some places but very confusing in others especially parts of the 2nd half of the film which left me confused and sometimes a bit ill at ease.      Still my favorite film about King Arthur.      Wish they'd do one about the Mary Stewart Trilogy.  Those are my favorites.
B0006212Q8|5.0|I fell in love with \\"Black & White Night\\" when I saw it being played at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. I had to find it when I returned to Canada. Now that I have found it it's never far away from my CD player. There is also a DVD recording of this concert. When you start to watch it you won't be able to take your eyes off of it. Every sense is satisfied. Once you finish listening to this CD you'll want to listen to it all over again.
B000J10EQU|5.0|I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. They did an excellent job of honoring the original Christopher Reeve movies while also creating their own fresh, modern take on Superman's story. Though it struck me as an odd choice to cast Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, there's no doubt that Brandon Routh was perfectly cast as Clark Kent/Superman, and Kevin Spacey did a respectable job as Lex Luthor. The story of Superman's return to Earth, why he was gone for so long, as well as the twist at the end of the movie, were all well done. I also like that this movie didn't go the obvious route of yet another version of the love story between Superman and Lois. There was so much more to this movie that their relationship barely factored into it. Lois had moved on to someone else and was still completely oblivious to the fact that Clark is Superman. Maybe they'll focus more on a Superman/Lois romance in the next film. I would only suggest that the sequel be a little shorter on time. This movie could have used a bit more editing, but it was still exciting to watch as well as heartwarming. Highly recommended!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Though the idea of having to watch a 90 minute 'slide show' on a difficult subject may sound boring, it is not! <br />Al Gore knows exactly what he is talking about and yes, to make his points he needs to use some sophisticated presentation techniques. <br />But the delicate balance between switching from the presentation to facts about his personal life and back, is very well done.  <br />For those who don't want to believe the facts : it is like using a veto => it puts an end to any discussion. <br />Some people have an attitude of dealing with problems at the time they occur.  <br />But in this case, this attitude will result in being too late, much too late. <br />At least, too late to create 'human' solutions to the problem. Because at that time, for many of us, the question will no longer be 'How do we live?' but 'How do we survive?' <br />And if you look at how e.g. animals are dealing with survival, their actions can be very drastic in order to survive (are we prepared to sacrifice the life of our own children?).     <br />Preventing a fire is better than firefighting. <br />If we can prevent having to end up with a struggle to survive, by all means, let's do it now! <br />Thanks to Carl Sagan for having that picture taken of Earth from a 4 billion mile distance; and thanks to Al Gore for showing it to us. <br />I hope history will be able to tell in the not so far future that another similar picture taken then, will still show that tiny pixel size earth being true blue! <br />In short :  'An inconvenient truth' is highly recommended!

079073804X|5.0|After thirty-four years, 'The Exorcist' remains nearly as shocking and horrifying as it was upon its release in 1973.  Back then, it was a movie event, and news pieces showed that 'The Exorcist' did to post-modern times what 'Dracula' did back during its debut.  Near hysteria came to some, but the masses were at least electrified by what is unabashedly called \\"the scariest movie of all time\\".<br /><br />The key element of this hallmark is that 'The Exorcist' is so convincingly real.  Reinventing horror, it relies on revealing the nature of a possessed demon inside of its innocent young host, Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair).  The way the drama unfolds is not unlike an investigation, complete with medical exams, psychiatry, and a police detective.  All of the inquiry gives the whole horror a plausible presentation.  For who would not be struck by the contrast between the skepticism of the modern world--including from Catholic priest, Damien Karras (Jason Miller)--in all its attempts to explain an irrational phenomena?  The demonic revelation sneaks up on its main players as well as the audience with a tension that only increases over time.  Needless to say, it doesn't rely a whole lot on the element of surprise with terrible malevolent beings jumping out at once.  As expertly as the sound and special effects are rendered, there is little for the audience to guess at what times terrible things will happen.  The presence of the demon inside of Regan makes its menace present to the audience as well.  We can feel the full force of the ordeal.<br /><br />'The Exorcist' takes place mainly on the Georgetown campus where Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is lead actress for a film she describes as \\"Walt Disney meets Ho Chi Min\\".  She has three helpers, including two German immigrants, and her director, Burke Dennings, provides an important part of the plot's direction.  Her loose connections with the priests at Georgetown provide some needed solidarity.  It is mostly Chris's story, and her struggle to find some solution to her daughter's developing problem, but it is also the story of two priests (including, the exorcist, Fr. Merrin [Max Von Sydow]) whose determination and struggles give more meaning to the main plot and how it remarkably develops.<br /><br />'The Exorcist' was directed skillfully by William Friedkin who has a host of classics under his directing belt, including 'The French Connection'.  Based on William Peter Blatty's modern bestseller and a screenplay adapted by him, 'The Exorcist' is still a masterpiece of modern horror meant to make one look for a reality beyond the senses.<br /><br />(The \\"version you've never seen before\\" doesn't do much to help or harm.  A couple of added scenes provide some poignancy; some of it is extraneous, but none of it really ruins the effect.)e to find some solution to her daughter's developing problem, but it is also the story of two priests (including, the exorcist, Fr.

1401307450|5.0|I didn't see this autobiography of Anthony K. as another drug crazed rock and roll idol, I saw it as a very intelligent journalist and book writer putting this book together in easy to understand chapters of his interesting life.  Most rock stars are predictable and after reading several of them they start to all sound the same.  Drugs, bad parents, more drugs, hookers, band practices, drug networking, band networking and eventual fame and fortune while doing mass quantities of drugs.  This guy is a master book writer and I'm surprised he isn't a writer instead of a rock star. He did write another book for Dave Navarro and there just wasn't enough interesting material to make Dave interesting no matter who wrote the book.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to read about an intelligent rock stars' life starting from pre-teen to present years and being very interesting and page turning the whole time.  I was never bored.  Keep writing Anthony!

B000002N3J|5.0|This Collection of Madonna's Ballads is much better than you think it is. (well if you never heard the songs on it). <br />I couldnt have imagined it would turn out to be so great, infact A Masterpiece!  It Really proved to me that Madonna is not just a pop star. <br /> <br />This album contains her best ballads from 1985 to 1995. Songs like Crazy For You and Live To Tell are very Popular, But other songs like the Powerful You'll See and the Acoustic One More Chance are album versions and they are nothing but Classics!. I'll remember and the #1 This Used to Be My Playground were songs for Movies and are only Featured on this album for Madonna. They are Fantastic too!. Take A Bow is the albums best track in my point of view. This is RECOMMENDED for everyone who like Ballads, You will like it even if you hate Madonna!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006L7XQ|3.0|This disc is worth the price of purchase for the first two tracks alone - When The Man Comes Around and Hurt - if you don't already have them.   <br /> <br />After that, however, there is a sharp dropoff.  The production by Rick Rubin is top-notch, providing a solid yet spare backing for Cash's inimitable style, especially on songs like \\"I Hung My Head\\" and \\"Personal Jesus.\\" <br /> <br />If you're a Cash diehard, it's a must-have.  If you're a Cash fan, it's a should-have.  If you're new to the Cash experience, there are better places to start.  It's good, but not great; certainly not the caliber of American V.

0446530573|5.0|As far as cookbooks go, this is one of the most fun.  Filled with stories and excerpts from the show it's an entertaining read on top of an informative cookbook.  Yes, the recipes are basic Italian, nothing too hard or too involved, but for the average cook this is a great source of Italian cooking.  If you anything like me, and absolutely love to cook, then you'll enjoy this book very much, especially if Italian is what you're craving.  Filled with pictures (always a plus) to show you what your dish should look like, as well as easy to follow instructions that for the most part include ingredients easy to find I really don't see a downside to this addition to your cookbook collection.  I've tried out a few, not all (I don't general use cookbooks, just own them for a quick idea), of these recipes and they sure do taste good...
0066620996|5.0|I read several business books. Why? I want to compare/contrast the last few with this one... Freakonomics gave me a new way to analyse events and situations. Even the most unbelievable offered \\"cause\\" for an event should be considered. Look at the whole picture. The World is Flat was exciting, but our company is doing everything in it, has been since 1998... the whole time, quite often, others thinking we were weird. They didn't understand. They still don't. I think often in America, we want to think that the world revolves around us and that the rest of the world is far away. It's like God bless America. How about, may God bless the world, while you're at it? Now, Good to Great... of all 3 books, this one hit home to me and my company. Some of us at the top tend to want to micro-manage and be the \\"icon\\". Read this book and discover ... that it makes total sense that micro-managers who want to be the HERO, the ICON... their companies won't succeed for long. Their \\"staff\\" who wishes it were his team that he was a part of... will leave for jobs where they can be on a team of creative thinking/hard/smart working people with a \\"boss\\" to match. I love this book. It made me analyze myself for improvement. I have the audio and print version, will listen to it over and over.
B000002WYT|5.0|The great thing about Dave Matthews is that he is a far cry from your average generic run of the mill musician.  Dave is truly a talented soul, a lover of everything that is music, and it shows in any number of songs that he puts out.  `Crash' is probably one of his most well known albums, the success due in large part to the hit song `Crash Into Me', and it rightfully deserves the praise that it's rendered again and again and critics and fans.   <br /> <br />Dave offers us a bit of everything, from soft and affectionate tracks like `Crash Into Me' (probably one of the greatest songs ever written) and `#41' to throw down drag out fun like the infectious `Too Much' which I'm sure everyone has heard at least once (or more). <br /> <br />`So Much To Say' starts off the album on such a great note.  It's one of the best songs here, showing off everything that makes Dave Matthews not just a great band but a unique and memorable one.  Now you have my attention, the trick is to keep it.  `Two Step' truly does keep it, for it's fun, fresh and beautifully orchestrated with some amazing musicianship on all parts.  It's just a fun song and one that easy to get into. <br /> <br />`Crash Into Me' is one of the most beautifully written, sung and produced songs I've ever heard, regardless if it's a love song or not.  Dave's words, his pleadings, his voice is so sincere that your drawn into the song and become part of it instead of just subject to it.  A true expression of art at it's finest.  `Too Much' is as fun as it is loud and boisterous.  One of the first songs I ever heard from this band it immediately lets you know the fun side of this band, for it's such a sharp contrast to their previous hit `Crash Into Me' yet it doesn't lose any of vigor and sharpness in the transition. <br /> <br />`#41' is such a beautifully arranged track, soft and delicate and flows so well, following in the footsteps of `Crash Into Me' as far as melody and overall feel, and it flows right into the next track `Say Goodbye' with the use of a flute.  `Say Goodbye' has such a funky vibe, it makes you want to dance in your seat.  Great overall feel to it.  `Drive In, Drive Out' is one of the heaviest tracks here and it's a nice change of pace with some great guitar work.  Here Dave shows that his voice fits more than one type of music, that's for sure. <br /> <br />`Let You Down' has such a calm and peaceful vibe to it, very laid back and relaxing.  Dave also capitalizes on his smooth voice, giving us yet another brilliant track.  `Lie In Our Graves' is one of my favorite tracks here, brilliant musicianship that switches back and forth from soft and delicate to fun and spunky.  Great track.  `Cry Freedom' is a very deep track, lyric-wise, and it does show off the more serious and moody side to Dave Matthews.  It's beautifully played and sung, almost inspirational like, and further proves that Dave Matthews will never be typecast. <br /> <br />`Tripping Billies' opens strong with the horns and then breaks out into another funky, groovy musical experience.  It's songs like this that make you want to see him in concert, I mean, this track alone lets you know it be a great experience to say the least.  `Proudest Monkey' closes the album on a great note, starting off very soft and delicate, with some odd sounds accompanied by guitar and Dave's vocals, singing about bouncing from tree to tree.  Then about half way in the song breaks out and they let loose and we see just what a brilliant musician and musical genius Dave really is. <br /> <br />He's created such a wonderful experience for the ears here, such a treat, something that we all can enjoy, appreciate and praise.
B000G73UEU|4.0|I was prepared to fly to the other side of the country when I read about the performances of Came so far for beauty at the Sydney Arts Festival in 2005.  Unhappily all seats at all shows were sold out in about 45 minutes of the sales opening so I was delighted when this album was released.  There are some very good tracks on it and some not so good so that I wonder why they bothered (interpretation is flat and uninspiring compared to the original - an unfair comparison, really.  Nobody gets near...).  I've now ordered the DVD of the film, the visual performances might make a difference.  Still, the good stuff outweighs the ordinary, putting this album in the highly recommended category.
B00005JLSE|5.0|`Chicago' is one of those films that, while not my favorite, captivates me from start to finish every time I sit down to watch it.  It's flawlessly directed and executed, brilliantly acted and otherwise advertised and comes off as the whole package, flawless from just about every angle.  Yes, some of you have mentioned that the lead actors voices aren't the greatest, and really, other than the magnificent John C. Reilly and the superb Queen Latifah the singing is below par as far as you would expect Broadway to be (Zellwegger and Gere have nothing on 2001's Kidman and McGregor).  But that's not really the point, because all the glitter and glam and attitude that drips forward with every word you begin to forget the fact that these people can't really sing. <br /> <br />I for one felt that the entire cast (Gere aside) did an outstanding job, and yes, even Gere did fine, I just felt his Billy Flynn was a bit miscast.  Renee did an outstanding job as Roxie Hart, a girl dreaming of the big lights who murders her lover when he refuses to give her that.  She's imprisoned for it and its there that she meets Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones in her Oscar winning role) who is currently serving time for offing her husband and sister.  Through Matron `Mamma' Morton (Queen Latifah in the role that should have given her the Oscar) Velma has been set up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn, the best money can buy, and Roxie wants him too.  Left to pick up the bill is Roxie's loyal if not albeit naïve husband Amos (Reilly in his Oscar nominated role...great year for him by the way) who seems to be being used by everyone. <br /> <br />The film of course revolves around the court case and Roxie's determination to work the crowd, work the judge, the jury and the world in order to not only be released of all charges but become a star.  She of course has obstacles every step of the way, between Velma's jealousy, Billy's fleeting interest and her husbands growing distain.  The real shiningareas here are of course wrapped up in the musical numbers, the shimmer and grace that lines every word, every scene, and every number.  Numbers like `Cell Block Tango' and `All I Care About' get the star treatment (and look wonderful) while songs like `Mister Cellophane' and `When You're Good to Mamma' shine brighter than the rest based on the voices alone.  One of my favorite numbers though is Catherine's `I Can't Do it Alone' just because of her sheer determination...she's wonderful. <br /> <br />`Chicago' arguably deserved the Oscar (I'm still on the fence) but regardless it deserved to win or not, `Chicago' is still a brilliant musical that any fan of the Broadway play or fan of the musical in general will enjoy.  Rob Marshall did deserve that Best Director Oscar, I will say that.  His direction here couldn't have been better.  `Chicago' is a film that will never grow old, never grow tired and never leave my collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can NOT believe they took this off the air!! How stupid of the network! My daughter got these for me and I have so enjoyed them! The Western/Sci-Fi is very unique and entertaining. The use of Chinesse/English is fasinating and a relief that I don't have to hear the curse words in English (I'm so tired of that) but I got the point even in Chinesse. The actors and the characters they portrayed have become favorites and a series that I watch over and over again...and I HIGHLY recommend this series!!!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I believe that if this version of the movie had reached the theaters, it would have ranked with GLADIATOR (Scott's Academy Award Winning Movie). Other reviewers have said that it's a different movie and I absolutely agree so I won't belabor that. Read their reviews because they said it better than I will.<br /><br />The movie moguls who carved up KINGDOM OF HEAVEN need to have their heads (metaphorically) put on a pike in front of the studio. The director's cut deserves very high marks. I own the theatrical release and it was good (maybe a B or a B+) The director's cut gets an A in my book.<br /><br />Ok, I'm cheap. I didn't want to spend more money to buy another version of Kingdom of Heaven because I did enjoy the theatrical release and bought the movie. A friend recommended I buy this version (Director's Cut) and I have thanked him for the advice because I had the opportunity (after buying this version) of watching a balanced, developed, thoughtful movie where the characters were developed, where their actions made sense.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

Serenity is very entertaining even if you haven't seen the series, but even more delightful if you have. I would strongly suggest this movie!! The Actors and the Characters they portray will keep you coming back to watch this again and again.

0393327655|1.0|This is a disturbing book principally for its ignorant tirade against Moslems. As an atheist myself I had hoped for something more rational and informative given the enormous popularity of this book in the U.S. but find Harris here is too often little more than a mega-mouthpiece for Western (read American?) ignorance of Moslems and the Moslem world outside the U.S. borders. I expected to read along with a like-mind since I also see religion and religious faith as a net negative left-over from our evolutionary past that needs to be eradicated just as acceptance of rape as a natural means for reproduction has been eradicated. But I found points of agreement only at a superficial level. It is bad enough that he blames religion as the principle or fundamental root cause of suicide terrorism: he says it was religious belief, belief in a blissful life after death, that enabled the 9/11 hijackers to commit their atrocity. What rot. A slight amount of reflection and simple logic would inform him that if religious belief were the root enabler of suicide terrorism then we would surely have had suicide terrorism for as long as we have had such beliefs in any religion. Pape's \\"Dying to Win\\" is a scholarly research work that amply demonstrates that suicide terrorism is a function of national identity humiliation brought about by foreign occupation and that perpetrators of this form of terrorism since the 1980's have included both the religious and non-religious and secular, Christian and Buddhist as well as Moslem. Pape's research pulverizes Harris's ignorant diatribe. <br /> <br />Harris also makes the tired old moral comparison between \\"collatoral damage\\" and \\"wilful terrorist acts\\" meant to sanitize western belligerent responses to 9/11, and in so doing becomes a supporter of the very actions that are dooming us to more war and increasing terror. Again deeper reflection would enlighten one to a more accurate comparison that brought the two much closer together than Harris wants to admit: imagine a police officer opting to open massive firepower into a house where murderers are suspected of hiding knowing that that firepower would also inevitably wipe out several other houses sheltering innocent families that (unfortunately!) happened to be in the general path of fire! The balance is thus not that the terrorist wants to kill civilians while \\"we\\" regrettably unavoidably kill civilians; it is, rather, that the terrorist wants to kill civilians while \\"we\\" don't care if we kill civilians. (Disagree? Then why do \\"we\\" say \\"we don't do body counts\\" if we really do care and truly regret?) <br /> <br />But the book is more disturbing than this because it would appear to me to be fanning ignorant prejudice and inhumane policies against Moslem peoples that can only guarantee a deepening of the problem he thinks will be solved by the eradication of religious belief, especially Moslem belief. He writes point-blank on page 133 that if Moslem societies prospered they would more than likely threaten and harm \\"us\\" even more and therefore the best thing for \\"us\\" is that those societies stay undeveloped! He writes that millions of Moslems (suggesting the majority) want to set up a Taliban-like society over \\"us\\". He equates Hammas with a terrorist outfit pure and simple. The only hope in the book to balance such ignorance is his pleading for a rationality that is open to new evidence (p.235). One can only hope that Harris is open-minded enough to seek out and embrace evidence that will surely to be new to him -- evidence about the truth of the majority of Moslems and Hammas that is freely available in western societies like his to any who care to seriously inform themselves.

My book group read this for October, and everyone (very rare) Loved it. What a gifted writer. I look forward to reading her other books, starting with *Stern Men*.

0790731452|5.0|This is one of the great SciFi cult film ever. It has all the makings of the classic 50's and 60's scifi movies with some comedy thrown in. You must have this movie in your collection if you truly love SciFi.
B000002IMG|5.0|Every now and then i forget how totally awesome Testament is, only to rediscover how much i love every single song by them. I'm sitting here trying to think of any flaws and with the band, there just isn't.  Great singing, great riffs, great basslines, great drums, great solos, great harmonies, everything. the only one thing i could MAYBE say that isnt so good about the older Testament cds is that the recording quality is very...80's.  But if you're into metal as much as you should be, then you should be into all sorts of old 80s bands with not so great recording. <br />buy this cd people, and every other testament cd while you're at it. they're all pretty much best-of's. you need all of them. you will not be dissapointed.
0553381407|3.0|I have not had the chance to read this book cover to cover yet, but so far this is a good book to use in your personal life or to debate in a psychology class.  This is not a book for people who refuse to believe this could not possibly include them, simply because they will spend more time arguing with themselves and sink further into denial then learn or benefit even a little.  I was shocked to see some similarities with my own parents and own family. I am definitely recommending this to other friends and thinkers.

1401302378|5.0|Simply put it is detrimental to your survival for you to not understand \\"the long tail\\".  I'm not talking about marketing, selling, consuming ... I'm saying without understanding \\"the long tail\\" we as humans can fail to live in a way that propagates an intelligent lifestyle ... .... hmmm ... how to back that statement up? well ... <br /> <br />Chapter two says it all.  It's a short read.  If money is an issue, do what I did before I bought the book. Go sit in a store and read ten pages that should change how you view your capabilities and your responsibilities in this world. If you can't handle ten pages ... read the last two pages of Chapter Two.  <br /> <br />If we do not understand what is being used against humanity, we cannot understand how to protect humanity ...  <br /> <br />_More_ we cannot understand that we -- as individuals -- are capable of protecting and growing an intelligent society. <br /> <br />Who am I to say these things?  I am just a middle-aged white woman who hates politics and refuses to watch television because it is stressful. I do not work outside my home. I don't have large sums of money. I use my blog to show off my photos and write little stories about goofing off with my husband and my dog on hikes on the Appalachian Trail.  I am someone who read Chapter Two.  I am having to rethink my \\"unimportance\\" and my excuses for ignoring this fact: I am not without influence.   <br /> <br />The power of the influence of one individual has shifted in ways that has never been possible before today's society and, as individuals, can we afford to ignore that? <br /> <br />Maybe it's not a news flash to you ... but I think far too few people get it the way that Anderson lays it out and sums it up ... Of course, to get that it doesn't just apply to marketing, business, etc ... you'll have to let those last two pages take you outside the money box and leave you there. <br /> <br />Read it. Think about it.  Decide what you are gonna do with your power.Or not. <br /> <br />enjoy! <br />pam

0786890932|3.0|and this was like that. I wanted it to over long before the last letter was opened. Some of it was very touching, yet other parts of the book were not very realistic. I would have liked to see the husband's character developed more. I would recommend this book. It is not a sob story yet it does tug at the heart strings.

0060012358|5.0|Pratchett keeps his keen edge when writing for a young audience. In this book he's created characters who are relatively complex people trying to shape a society and find meaning in their lives, and oh yeah, they happen to be a colony of rats, led by an alley cat with con-man tendencies.  The book is imaginative and engaging, with an adventurous and sometimes creepy story line. Great stuff.

B000J10ERO|5.0|I want to start off by saying im a die-hard comic book fan!I have thousands of comics i've collected over the years.Whether its Marvel Comics,DC Comics,Image Comics,Dark Horse Comics,etc.,I enjoy them all!Superman Returns is a really amazing movie,that's greatly narrated!The character Superman himself is pretty faithful to the comic book version!The things around him are slightly changed though.The actors all give wonderful performances!This movie is story-driven and has a minimum amount of action(but there's enough to please fans).The action scenes are superb and the special effects are truly a work of art!There's a lot of people who would assume that because this movie is based off of a comic book character,it's suppose to be loaded with action.Obviously those people must've not taken the time to pick up a comic and read it.There's action in comic books,but there's more story-telling,if anything.Superman Returns is pretty much an updated sequel to the original Superman and Superman 2 films.But this Superman is much darker than any other Superman movies before it.Im not going to compare this with any of the Christopher Reeve films,as it stands out on its own.It's no secret that Bryan Singer made this movie in honor of Richard Donner and in memory of Christopher Reeve,because of some of the movie similarities.Since those movies,tv shows,etc.,is all based off of the comic book,i'll judge it on those merits.This movie is my favorite comic book adaption,right up there with Batman Begins,Spiderman and Spiderman 2!If you're a fan of the comic,the earlier Reeves films or you just like an epic romantic story,than you'll love this movie!
B00005ATZT|5.0|<br /> <br />'THE FUGITIVE' REMINDS ME OF 'NORTH BY NORTHWEST' - THE 'WRONG MAN' THEME GREATLY ACCELERATED  <br /> <br />'North by Northwest' featured Cary Grant who had been a huge star, especially at the box-office, a lot like Harrison Ford, the star of \\"The Fugitive.\\" Instead of the bi-plane that flies into and causes the gas tanker to explode with Cary Grant racing from the scene, we've got the mother of all train wrecks which Harrison Ford literally leaps from a nanosecond prior to impact!  <br /> <br />THERE IS A LOT MORE TO 'THE FUGITIVE' THAN JUST CHASE SCENES <br /> <br />Richard Kimble did not kill his wife. We knew that when we entered the theatre because we had all heard of the TV series by that name and some of us even saw the hourly mystery program when it ran in the 1960s. We knew about the one-armed man, the conviction of Dr. Kimble, and his quest to prove that a one-armed man had committed the horrific deed.  <br /> <br />'THE FUGITIVE' DELIVERS SURPRISES + SUSPENSE & RESOLUTION TOO  <br /> <br />Somehow this seemingly very tired theme came alive and grabbed my attention very early. Although I found the opening sequence a bit lurid and disturbing, it was captivating nevertheless. With an obvious sense of pacing, the trial of Dr. Richard Kimble was as rapid [on-screen] as a disclosure of the basic facts of Mrs. Kimble's murder allowed.  <br /> <br />From Kimble's conviction, we are jettisoned to the biggest and most visceral TRAIN WRECK sequence I have ever seen on film. More importantly, it established sympathy for Kimble as he not only barely escaped death, but he saved one of the guards in the process. This incredible action sequence led directly to the introduction of Tommy Lee Jones as Deputy Marshall Sam Gerard and the unbelievable chase scenes that followed.  <br /> <br />The action sequences and suspense are so genuine that even the mundane scenes, like when Kimble was going through the one-armed man's private papers, were intense. No matterhow many times I watch this film, I am amazed by how enthralled I am with the action and characters, despite knowing the complete storyline. I dare say that even the Master of Suspense himself couldn't have done better!  <br /> <br />----- THE ACTORS -  <br /> <br />Harrison Ford - Dr. Richard Kimble  <br />Tommy Lee Jones - Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard  <br />Sela Ward - Helen Kimble  <br />Joe Pantoliano - Cosmo Renfro  <br />Jeroen Krabbe - Dr. Charles Nichols  <br />Julianne Moore - Dr. Anne Eastman  <br />Andreas Katsulas - Sykes \\"One Armed Man\\"  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE DVD: SPECIAL EDITION - WIDESCREEN - DIGITAL TRANSFER  <br /> <br />Digital transfer in Widescreen. So much better than the original Video from 1993 and the original DVD from 1997!  <br /> <br />DVD Features:  <br /> <br />I must really like this film, because I zipped through every one of the excellent special features and really found myself wanting for more.  <br /> <br />Commentary by: Director Andrew Davis & Tommy Lee Jones  <br /> <br />New Digital Transfer  <br /> <br />New Introduction by the Film's Stars & Director  <br /> <br />Two Featurettes:  <br />----- Derailed: Anatomy of a Train Wreck  <br />----- On the Run  <br /> <br />----- Awards List + Bios for the major actors  <br /> <br />IN THE END -- <br /> <br />A very compelling film to watch and watch and watch. The DVD is much clearer in both the audio and video than the VHS release. <br />
0060589469|5.0|I'm compelled to write this review after browsing the others, because something has to be said about book that isn't being pointed out for someone who is interested in the book for the first time.     At this point, this book can be found on the front table in your local bookstore. Other philosophy books can be found in the philosophy section either collecting dust, or being perused by someone intensely interested in philosophy who is well versed in debates that have gone on for centuries.     I have listened to the author, Robert Pirsig, being interviewed, and it seems that he did, in fact, intend for this book and its premise of \\"Quality\\" to be the great, all encompassing philosophy, presented in a straightforward, readable manner. However, despite Pirsig's intention, that is not quite why this book has become so famous.     This book is famous because it fills a perfect niche in that it introduces some very complicated philosophical questions in a form that the common reader will find interesting. Pirsig is attempting to create a practical philosophy and sets the book against the background of actual experience to make the questions he ponders real for the reader.     With that in mind, if you are not clamoring for a debate with someone else who is knowledgable on the ins and outs of Kierkegaard and Spinoza and are simply looking for a readable book that makes a real attempt of answering the big questions in life, this book is for you.     What I find interesting, and somewhat disturbing, is that many choose to deride this book because it doesn't agree with their notions of philosopy, but fail to grasp that the people who are most likely to read this book won't even be at the table to understand their objections to it unless they read it.     Probably no book has ever been more successful in interesting people in philosophy in the first place. So why are people who are interested in the subject eager to send them away because it disagrees with something they readin some banal tome?    Bottom line, if you ran across this book at your local bookshop or had it recommended to you by a friend, you must read it. It is an awesomely thought inspiring book and asks questions you never thought to ask or at least didn't know how to put your finger on. It's both a good novel and a great introduction to philosophy for people who have an interest in greater questions but not all the time to pursue them. I don't think you should worry about the fact that someone with a Masters Degree in Philosophy, or an equivalent knowledge, is bothered by the book. Also, I wouldn't be thrown by the title. The book isn't trying to sell you a newsletter or convert you to any church (despite the use of the phrase \\"The Church of Reason\\") and is only using a bit of Zen philosophy as a grounding for its premise.     Pirsig's premise does have a tendency to never be overtly stated, but I believe that he does this because he doesn't want it overly simplified in the way I'm about to do it.    Pirsig's premise is that we live in a world of both the \\"Classical\\" and \\"Romantic\\" or, as I'll simplify it, \\"function\\" and \\"form\\", respectively. Pirsig sees the problems in our world as the result of an overemphasis on form, when function is more essential. However, pure \\"function\\" has problems of its own. For example, our bodily organs carry out the function of allowing us to live, but one doesn't really desire for our skin to be translucent so we can watch these functions. In fact, we would have a revulsion to such a thing. Therefore, we have a combination of both of \\"form\\" and \\"function\\"; our organs work very well without our having to see them. This is the desirable state. This desirable state is called \\"Quality\\". Good \\"function\\" seems to bring about its own desirable \\"form\\". May the decorative towel be damned. That's grossly oversimplified, but there it is.    Finally, one shouldn't be thrown off Pirsig's premise by the fact that, quite frankly, he tends to be an impatient father and not very easy to get along with. While reading the book, it becomes apparent that Pirsig is sharing this with us because he is oblivious to it himself. He makes it obvious that he doesn't understand why no one is pondering the philosophical implications of repairing a motorcycle or why his young son isn't arriving at all of the conclusions he is, despite the fact his son is eleven. He seems to be trapped in the context of his own view of the world.    So, if you want to wade your way through all of the pontificating, please take the time to read \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\". If you really, really like it, you'll have to read Pirsig's other book \\"Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals\\". Though \\"Lila\\" takes a narrative approach that's a bit less readable than \\"Zen and...\\", it gives a more comprehensive view of Pirsig's philosophy. Read both. Then you can debate with the philosophy majors.
020530902X|5.0|This is a classic, must have book for anyone who writes anything!  One of the most longstanding and venerable books about the specifics of writing.
0375703861|5.0|This is probably one of the best books I have read in this century. We, elderly readers, have usually fair memories and can stack one writer against the other. By every comparison, Ms. Smith winns hands down. Her language is original and refreshing. Her characters very much alive. If they suffer from common falacies she can treat all of it in very humane and understanding way. The story she tells is fascinating,well conceived and even better executed. The resolution is unusual in any case.Of all the young writers publishing in English currently (and I've read a few) she is my favorite. <br />P.S. Re next question - I'm 85 years old.
0312323867|5.0|I have now read \\"Something Borrowed\\", \\"Something Blue\\", and \\"Baby Proof\\" and I just loved them all. They just hit home on so many points. Anyone can relate to something in these books. <br />I just can't wait for Emily Giffin to write some more. I'll be the first one in line to buy.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|For a price, you get to pick your favorite, and dispatch them from the face of this earth, all tools and devices supplied for your execution pleasure.  But...where do you get your favorite?  From the recruiters of course!  They take care of everything and get your favorite handcuffed to a chair in the chamber of your choice.  From there, you get to indulge in the utmost of human debauchery.  The Marquis De Sade would have loved this concept. <br /> <br />This is an excellent film.  Well directed, great plot, good musical scores.  You all know the plot from the previous writers.  Or you may have seen the film. <br /> <br />Yes there is gore, however the way it is presented is what got ones attention.  Actually the gore is quite tame considering similar movies like Mark of The Devil, or even, the most recently released Elizabeth I on HBO, which depicts executions and mutilations much more brutal than this film. <br /> <br />This is an excellent film, and I read that Hostel II will come out next year, showing more emphasis on how everything started, with 3 new victims of course!  I will be looking forward to the release. <br /> <br />
B000IOM0YM|5.0|This is not a 3 disc set! It is a 2 disc set with (in the first pressing only) a bonus disc. There are 3 different bonus discs. Which one you'll get depends on where you buy it. This should help those who don't feel liking buying this thing 3 times, and those who want to make sure they get all 3. Here is the deal on what you'll get and where.<br /><br />Bonus Disc 1: Cobo Hall, Detroit 1976. AVAILABLE AT \\"BEST BUY\\" ONLY! This was the first of a 3 night stand in Detroit. You already get the second night in the regular 2 disc set. The only difference between the 2 nights is that on night 1 (bonus disc) they do \\"Laidies in Waiting\\" in place of \\"Parasite\\".<br /><br />Bonus Disc 2: Madison Square Garden, New York 1977. AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE EXCEPT \\"BEST BUY\\" AND \\"WAL-MART\\". I got mine at \\"Virgin Records\\". While not the entire show, it's still very nice to have 7 of the songs from Kiss' first appearance at the place they'd always dreamed of playing.<br /><br />Bonus Disc 3: Largo, MD. 1977. AVAILABLE ONLY AT \\"WAL-MART\\". My favorite of all 3 bonus discs, because out of all this material, this is the only footage that I've never seen before, and it is awesome. It's almost the entire show. Just a few songs deleted.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|This is the cd Meat Loaf fans have been waiting for.  A great selection of bigger than life Meat Loaf songs.  His voice is as strong as ever and the song selection is great.  This disc is a rocker!  The writing and production is perfect.  Meat can still rock out with the best of them.  Listen to \\"In The Land of the Pig\\" and you will see what I mean.  I can't wait to see this show live.  Florida welcomes you with open arms!

B000FQ4M58|4.0|I'll be completely up front and say that I was expecting a complete tee total disaster with this album.<br /><br />Being a huge fan of the 1st two Bat Out of Hell albums, I was especially worried back when I found out that genius songwriter Jim Steinman wasn't going to be involved at all in the production/arranging of this album like he had been on Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell (which is my personal favorite of the 3).  Of course, everyone knows that Steinman also wrote all of the tracks on the 1st two Bat albums all by himself anyway with genius Todd Rundgren producing the 1st release..<br /><br />Sure, 7 of his tracks were going to be covered the Meat Loaf on this release but the rest were going to be written/co-written by producer Desmond Child who is known more for being the type of producer who just resurrects aging artists' careers.<br /><br />But lo and hehold, when I wound up picking up the 3rd Bat CD and it turned out to actually be a really strong album.<br /><br />Is it as good as the 1st 2?  The answer is a simple no.  Without Steinman's guiding hand, the album just lacks that theatrical thread that permeates the previous 2 Bat albums.<br /><br />But viewed simply as a collection of songs, the album succeeds in really strong fashion.  It is easily much stronger than Meat Loaf's 2003 release \\"Couldn't have said it Better\\" and 1995's \\"Welcome to the Neighborhood.\\"<br /><br />As to be expected, the album's strongest points are the 7 Steinman penned tracks (4 of which have already been recorded by other artists).  But the big surprise is how well the Desmond Child penned tracks blend in and stand up almost as strong.<br /><br />The album's biggest weak point is the title track \\"The Monster is Loose\\".  Co-written by Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx and ex-Marilyn Manson guitarist John 5, this track finds Meat Loaf doing his best to sing over a pretty bad nu-metal sounding track.<br /><br />But once you get past that, things start really looking up. In fact, the 2nd track \\"Blind as a Bat\\" by Desmond Child is one of the best things that Meat Loaf has done.<br /><br />In fact, he has probably never sounded better than he does on this album.  There's a couple of tracks that don't quite work as well as they should, and he also has 3 duets with female vocalists on this release as well instead of just one like on the previous Bat albums.  They could have maybe pared the duets down on this a bit.  Also, some of the songs lack a bit of the overwrought orchestrations that Steinman gave to the 2nd Bat album. Desmond Child does his best though and the album does have one of the best sounding mixes around.<br /><br />But overall, this CD is a really good listen and a must have for fans of Meat Loaf. It does stand up well to the 1st two Bat albums and musically sounds right at home with those 2 other classic releases.<br /><br />Now let's see if Meat and Jim can reconcile their differences and do a 4th Bat album with Jim at the helm!e best things that Meat Loaf has done.

B000002UJQ|5.0|It's been said many times before but OK Computer is one of the best albums ever.  I've never written an Amazon review but I feel compelled to share my opinion with others.   <br /> <br />On every level the album works - musically, lyrically, sonically, thematically, even the album art is a brilliant interpretation of the themes of the album namely isolation and helplessness, existance in an world of media/technological excess, yearning. <br /> <br />To those who have tried and just don't get it you probably never will.
B000255LIY|5.0|I have read many reviews stating that this remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968. Granted, that version is marvelous.  <br /> <br />I have bought both versions and love them both. OK, it is difficult not to compare when watching.  <br /> <br />BUT I can't help wondering: if this version would have been the first I or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version, if people would have been complaining about that version? <br /> <br />I can have different versions of Vivaldi's four seasons can't I? Actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all (and I do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other). We would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version, would we? I have gone to the opera numerous times and watched Don Giovanni three times. Every time with different performers. Remake? Absolutely not. <br /> <br />I think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it, because is such a great play. So, logically this would not be a remake! <br /> <br />Why can't we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other (splendid 1968) version when doing so?  <br /> <br />That done, I must say I understand why Alais is in love with king Henry. Patrick Stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses  very well. He is a  very good match to Close's queen. I did not care for Richard, I thought he was not commanding enough, bit whiny. I think John is a difficult part to play to say the least and I didn't care for him either, too much the idiot. Geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good. King Philippe: too much a boy, although he has moments when the interaction with king Henry makes him interesting. Alais:good enough.  <br /> <br />Which of the versions do I prefer? that is difficult. I have highly enjoyed both. I think the 1968 version hasa sharper edge because of Hepburn and I prefer her to Close. This version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic (Alais and Henry) approach.  <br /> <br />I definitely prefer Stewart to O'Toole, who seemed too young for the role. I liked the way Stewart made us see Henry's  self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming (that is, until the end, when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart). O'Toole had a very serious approach all the time. <br /> <br />On the other hand: Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton were both splendid. I think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast.  <br /> <br />Which of the versions I watch, depends on the mood I am in. I think they are both good in their own way. <br />

What you're seeing is so horrible, yet you can't look away. This writer has style, wit and insight. I loved the ending. Definitely caught me off guard. I am eagerly awaiting book number two.
B000EQHHJW|5.0|I have had this on VHS for some years, and have now replaced it with DVD.  My opera viewing buddies and I have all enjoyed it several times.  Pavarotti not only sounded great, he really looked the part -- which is not often the case with his performances.  With the increased scope possible with a film version, the opera becomes much more gripping and believable.  It's a great way to get a new slant on an old favorite.
B000E41MRC|5.0|Although the star of this film is among the most controversial men of the XXth Century, Leni Riefenstahl made a film of unprecedented power in 1934.  The techniques she used are often used today, but the simple employment of camera angles and vistas combined with mesmerizng music tell the story that Hilter wanted told.  It is spectacular as an historical document and in its comparative simplicity it is a extraordinary opportunity to see how films, lenses, and proportion can be used to tell a story or spin a tale.  For me, it is the crystal ball that demonstrates how easy it is for genius to influence the masses and how this medium of visual imagery and music can persuade people in the millions to accept the leadership of a demagogue.

1401207138|5.0|DC people made an excellent work with both the oversized printing and the sturdy, slipcased hardcover binding.<br /><br />An absolute classic story in its own, I'll spend no words on it, too much has already been written!, it deserved such a treatment.<br /><br />I couldn't almost find a single flaw in this edition, if it wasn't for the quality of the surface of the slipcase and cover, which has a very nice feeling, but is somewhat delicate and easy to damage.<br /><br />The extra material is very interesting; the new coloring is very beautiful, even if affectionate readers might have preferred to retain the old one.
0743289412|4.0|At first blush, LISEY'S STORY is not your daddy's Stephen King. To be sure, there are initial hints of things that go bump, but it's not like THE SHINING, SALEM'S LOT, or even CELL. If, as King has said, MISERY was his love letter to fans, LISEY'S STORY is a love letter to his wife, written from the perspective of his death. This is not an easy concept to get your head around at first. But if you're willing to invest time and attention to what King seems to consider his penultimate work, then at the very least you will encounter a beautifully told tale that is worth your time, energy and money. <br /> <br />There was a point very early on when it looked to me as if LISEY'S STORY was going to be King's major attempt at non-genre fiction, and I almost stopped reading. There are two protagonists herein: Lisey Debusher Landon and her husband of a quarter-century, Scott. In the \\"now\\" of LISEY'S STORY, Scott, an award-winning author, has been deceased for two years, and Lisey has multiple balls in the air: her relationship with each of her somewhat batty sisters, pressure from a pushy academic type to gain access to Scott's trove of papers, and her own grief. As I started to set aside this weighty tome, I thought, \\"More John Irving than John Saul, aha!\\" There's nothing wrong with books of domestic matters, of course; they're just not my cup of tea. <br /> <br />But I didn't give up, and as the novel progressed, I discovered that there is much more to LISEY'S STORY than domestic drama. A great deal of this tale consists of flashbacks concerning the long course of the Landons' courtship and marriage, and we ultimately come to know Scott, who is much more than a wonderful husband and wordsmith. Scott has secrets, not the least important of which is his ability to \\"heal quick,\\" his \\"books\\" and his love for Lisey. Maybe the latter isn't much of a secret at all, because Scott --- even before his untimely death --- saw things coming for Lisey and set about providing for her. <br/> <br />What did he see coming? Well, it's not a clown under a bridge or a pyrokinetic teenager or even a nasty disease transmitted over a cell phone. No, it's something much worse: a living, breathing nightmare made of flesh that is out there right now, a walking waste of skin looking for a victim even as I type. And it is after Lisey. But Lisey has help, and not just from her deceased husband. She will have to go to some immeasurable lengths in order to obtain it. <br /> <br />LISEY'S STORY is perhaps allegorical in some ways and deeply personal in others. Scott bears no small resemblance to King's template, and there are no doubt some other real-world comparisons to be made between this fine work's characters and people in King's life. I will leave the deep analysis of this to others more informed than myself on such matters. As for LISEY'S STORY, I am glad I kept reading. What higher praise is there than that? While it is not my favorite King novel --- that remains MISERY, for personal reasons --- it is probably his best written. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
6305622914|5.0|Great movie about when life throws you \\"lemons\\", you make \\"lemonade\\".  A wonderful story about a man not letting anything get in his way of raising enough capital to pay back the back child support that he owes in a very ingenious way.  A modern take on the old fashioned notion that family means everything.  Deals with the subject of the terrible emotional effects of unemployment, and how it erodes one's sense of self-esteem in a very positive manner, showing the characters reacting to their situation in a constructive way.
B000077VPU|5.0|Queen, lead by Freddie Mercury, has a unique and incomparable sound.  From the first time I heard \\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" I was a dedicated fan.  This concert pays tribute to the body of work that is Queen.  The artists chosen to perform were excellent and the perfomances were inspired.  I particularly enjoyed Roger Daltrey, David Bowie and Annie Lennox, Robert Plant, and Axl Rose who managed to supress his own distinct persona and immerse himself in Queen.  I watch the concert regularly and frequently.  I also have two DVD's of Queen's greatest hits which I also enjoy immensely, especially the special features.
B000BPFBVW|5.0|The DVD has a lot of extras and the CD is excellent quality. A great buy.
B000002KO1|5.0|If you are new to owning Pretenders recordings, then start here. If you like Tom Petty and the Clash for the guitars and beats and are a fan of the Divinyls vocals, then you will love the first Pretenders album. <br />Really, if you are interested enough in the album that you are reading this review, just go ahead and buy it. It really should be part of your collection.

076790592X|4.0|This book made me think how much I wish it were around 10 years ago or so when my mother was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. As a person in my early twenties then, I was unprepared for dealing with a family member with a terminal illness. My mother, too, though she suffered from many health-ailments in her life, was also unprepared for death and dying. Often, she would send me to the bookstore, searching for some type of diversion or something that might give her solace. I usually returned empty-handed or with books that made her feel worse. (The only exception was \\"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff\\" which she did get some comfort from.) Morrie, I think, would have been just the thing for both of us back then. Unfortunately, it wasn't there, but it is now, so if you know a family going through a difficult time, I think this is just the book. One doesn't need to know suffering to appreciate this book and get something from it. Don't let the fact that this is a book about death deter you from picking it up. It is much more accurately a book about living.

0966638328|5.0|I found this book to be very useful in designing my own websites and in teaching multimedia writing.  The descriptions of the colors are very concise and informative.  It is not an in-depth look at the psychology of color but an overview.  I think this is why my students did not groan and actually appeared to have read the materials.   <br /> <br />The sections with color combinations were what really made it worth the money.  I've used these not only for media designs but in choosing the colors for my wedding.  I can see using this book to color coordinate in a room or home. <br /> <br />However, I wish I could give it 4.5 stars because the color section gives the pantone color codes and not hex or RGB versions of how to achieve the colors.  This did leave me guessing with a few software programs.
B000002J1O|4.0|A great album, although I'm not sure it's deserving of the legendary status some prog rock fans have given it.  I may be a little biased, though because this is one of the first two or three albums I ever owned.  Yes, I remember when Firth of fifth got heavy radio play in my hometown of St. Louis (KSHE).  The three strongest songs are Firth of Fifth, Dancing with the Moonlight Knight and Cinema Show.  Highlights are the guitar pieces in the first two and the keyboards in the last.  I can see where someone could get bored with Cinema Show.  Musical tastes have moved away from this kind of keyboard indulgence.  Still these three songs are among Genesis' top 10 in my book.   <br /> <br />One gripe I have - I seem to be the only person to find I Know What I Like to be only mediocre pop.  It's so simplistic.  After the Ordeal and Aisle of Plenty can also be skipped.  Like the lady said, \\"There's no \\"there\\" there.\\"  The Battle of Epping Forest is a little long, but with good humor and some interesting musical tricks.  I love the little keyboard bit after \\"here comes the cavalry.\\"  More Fool Me, with Phil signing lead, is a good song, very much in the manner of some of his better solo and Post-Gabriel Genesis work (little though there may have been).  Well worth paying full price for if you're a prog fan.     <br />

B000002J29|5.0|There are several very solid of early Genesis favorites and a few that just blow me away.  I would say this is a good introduction to the band if you're into prog more than pop.  The first few songs are more or less loyal renditions of their studio counterparts.  They did a nice job with Firth of Fifth, one of the bands best songs originally sung by Peter Gabriel.  Nothing really added from the studio version, if anything, the loss of piano brings it a tick down.   I actually kind of like the little medley at the end of I Know What I Like - brings back some strong hooks from a few of the oldies.  A strong version of Lamb Lies Down, a highlight of this album for me.  Unlike others, I love the Phil Collins version of Supper's Ready.  Why? Because I saw this version in concert in '76, then bought this version and got to know it before I ever heard the original...if you've never heard the original, you'll consider this prime prog.  If you're like me and grow to love this version first, you'll find the original to be clunky and silly. Tony's keyboards here are much more fluid and professional.  Apologies to those of you who grew to know the original first...I realize this is Genesis fan sacrilege.  The last couple of songs are also strong - the two most interesting songs off Trick of the Tail.  What a great album side this was.   Drum solo makes it outdated by today's standards, but it was a lot of fun watching Phil and Chester go at it together.  Don't let anyone tell you Phil can't drum.
B000FS9MZQ|5.0|I found this to be an idea package.  I had heard a little about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but that did not prepare me for the wonderful piece of cinematic art.  Good lighting, solid story (although a bit quirky...but that's good right?) and Jim Carrey not being the on-demand buffoon.  Glad to have it in my collection. <br /> <br />Now...the Mountain.  Hollywood had this right \\"the saddest best love story that will probably never be made\\".  But contrary to belief, it was and THANK GOD.  Just infuriates you at the thought of how much someone will sacrafice to keep up appearances.  It's a journey that just wrenches all the compassion out of you.  A moviing story that truly focuses on l-o-v-e.  The fact it's two men is irrelavant, the unnecessary loss of love is this film's focal point. <br /> <br />Pick both up when you get a chance.
B00005JPAD|5.0|I loved this film!<br /><br />THE DEPARTED is an intense cops and gangsters opera with an all-star cast, including Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg. Jack Nicholson, as sociopathic crime boss Frank Costello, is excellent as always. Leonardo DiCaprio's role as Billy Costigan, going straight from Cadet to undecover, in my opinion is his  best performance yet. As for Martin Scorsese, this film will stand alongside MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS and CASINO as the director's best work.<br /><br />Set in modern day South Boston, involving the Irish Mob and the Massachusetts State Police, THE DEPARTED is a tale of two young guys entangled in that old Irish-American dilemma of love and respect for both outlaw and cop, the two often freely intermingling within neighborhoods and families, blurring identities and allegiances.
B00005JOSS|2.0|have always been a fan of both Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. So much so, in fact, that I have come to tolerate silly, waste-of-film-money-and-time efforts from both of them, trusting that their next effort will probably be better and that even great actors (which neither of them is) have participated in 'dogs.' In this particular film, which I found to be slow to the point of truly boring and resolved in a way not used by convention since ancient Greece, I find myself feeling less hopeful about either of their futures as serious actors - at least about their judgement in choosing material!<br /><br />The Lake House has been much written about, so there is probably no need to detail the plot here. Suffice it to say that there is one house (on a lake) occupied by two people at two different times (one in 2004 and the other in 2006) who manage to correspond through a mysterious, unexplained time portal (the mailbox in front of the house.)<br /><br />Kind of a silly premise - but, in and of itself, not sillier or with less merit than many other movies made and seen by tens of millions of people around the world today.<br /><br />The pace is painfully slow as the sketchy plot - relying largely on the mailbox gimic- unfolds. I actually fell asleep twice before the final fifteen minutes which were, in my opinion, simply unforgivable.<br /><br />WARNING:<br /><br />DO NOT READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH UNLESS YOU WANT THE ENDING 'SPOILED'... A BIT OF AN OXYMORON ACTUALLY. BUT THERE IT IS!<br /><br />Had the film ended with the Bullock character finding out that the Reeves character was dead - I might have come away feeling differently. However, it doesn't. The director and writer choose, instead, to add on ten - fifteen minutes of gratuitous footage which I can only characterize as a Deus-Ex-Machina attempt to tie together, explain and resolve senseless premises and actions.<br /><br />OK TO RESUME WITH THE ENDING ESSENTIALLY UNREVEALED.<br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar with the convention: In ancient Greek theatre, the writers would often write themselves and the actors into a corner of complexity so severe and twisted by the end of the play that logical solution was not possible. So, a convention was developed called \\"Deus Ex Machina\\" - literally, \\"God in a machine.\\" At the moment of unsolvable complexity coinciding with the end of the audience's patience, an actor wearing the mask of a god would be lowered from the 'rafters' by winch (the 'machine'), stand center stage and simply explain away all the unresolved elements of the show. Then it was over. Everyone went home. The convention was fresh and useful thousands of years ago - but has little place in a drama meant to be taken, to some extent, seriously here in the 21st century.<br /><br />My least favorite waste of time in recent months.ith the convention: In ancient Greek theatre, the writers would often write themselves and the actors into a corner of complexity so severe and twisted by the end of the play that logical solution was not possible.

B000F4RHB6|5.0|\\"Back In Time\\" is not only one of the great songs you'll find in this compilation, it's also the name of the journey you get to take while listening and watching Huey and the gang. Huey says, in his commentary in a booklet in the package, that watching the old videos made him laugh. Well it put a smile on my face as well. Very enjoyable.
B000002J1S|5.0|When I was a teenager, this my favorite album by far.  I pulled it out for another listen and the best songs on here really hold up over the years.  Be warned, though, there are some real downer and dirge-like songs on here (people who suffer from depression may want to stay clear).   <br />The great songs are truly great, though, and even though I like Selling England a lot, I think with this album, Genesis really took the next step into a more polished and professional prog classic that almost makes it's predecessor seem kind of stodgy - stronger hooks, some dramatic pieces ala Firth of Fifth and a some excellent musical ideas that are a nice follow up to Dancing with a Moonlit Knight.   My take on some of the highlights:   <br />   <br />The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.  A prog rock classic, although it's almost more straight out pop rock.  I guess the classical style piano intro and the time signature change in the middle qualify it as prog.  Tony Banks and Peter Gabriel just excel here.   <br /> <br />Broadway Melody Of 1974.  A cynics fun look at the 70's.  Pop culture references way before Quentin Tarantino made it cool. It's executed as a dirge, but catchy.  My favorite lyrics in the entire Genesis catalog. <br /> <br />In The Cage.  Maybe Tony Banks' best effort in the entire Genesis Catalog.  If you enjoy keyboards, this one deserves a listen.  It got a strong emotive feel, picking up where Lamb Lies Down left off.  This one is not pop, though, it's prog all the way.      <br /> <br />The Grand Parade Of Lifeless Packaging.  A really fun song that sounds like it came from a broadway musical.  I could see Rex Harrison singing this one, except for the somewhat macabre lyrics, that is.  <br /> <br />Back In N.Y.C. I like this song better than some others.  The song variety continues here - this is Genesis' version of heavy metal - heavy synthesizer, I guess.  The feel is closer to Metallica than Yes.   Offbeat but still a great hook, and Gabriel belts this outlike no other song on the Genesis catalog.   <br /> <br />Interjection:  There is an unbelievable variety in the first 7 songs - Through to Back in N.Y.C.  What other band can go from pop rock to dreary dirge to prog to broadway musical on one album side?  Jethro Tull is the only other band that could pull this off.  This could also explain the lack of commercial appeal - how many listeners enjoy all these styles?  <br /> <br />Counting Out Time is a funny pop ditty.  Seems very out of place here to me (where did Rael get this sudden sense of humor?) - it would have fit in nicely on either of the first couple of Gabriel solo albums.  <br /> <br />The Chamber Of 32 Doors.  An interesting, very dramatic take on growing up. I love the metaphors of the chamber and that last line - \\"I'd give you all of my dreams if you'd help me find the door that doesn't lead me back again.  Take me away\\"  I get chills just thinking about it.  This song is structured and executed for maximum emotion.  <br /> <br />Lilywhite Lilith. This one is right in the vein of the opener - a catchy pop rock song.  Nothing prog about it.   <br /> <br />Anyway.  This is another very catchy song in the manner of Lilywhite Lilith but more dramatic.  What a great melodic guitar solo in the middle - is it two guitars?  I'm not a player.  An essential piece for this album.   <br /> <br />The Colony Of Slippermen. I'm very irritated by the two minute intro to this song - kind of a seudo-Chinese background music thing.  Why Chinese?  Why stick this in?  I wish it was a separate song so I could skip it (same with the drum solo on Thick as a Brick)..  HOWEVER, after that this song is a great prog rock classic in my opinion.  Not sure if I like the scary voice of the slipperman, though - creepy and disruptive. <br />Ravine. Boring.  <br /> <br />Riding The Scree.  I love this one.  I like the playful bouncy intro and the crazy but fun synth bridge that leads into the dramatic hook.    I especially love the cascading synthesizer behind the lyrics.   <br />  <br />It. Ends the album on the same strong note as the intro.  Can't really call this prog - just good pop rock.  Excellent guitar work here - one of the few songs on this album where Hackett really shines.  <br /> <br />
B0000CFW87|5.0|Compelling work!!!  The whole CD, from start to finish, is absolutely amazing.  From Oceano to Il Postino, to the bonus track She's Out Of My life, every song soars with Josh's incredible vocals.  Two songs in particular are my favorites:  Remember When It Rained and You Raise Me Up.  The former is poignant and bittersweet, and builds to an almost surreal, spiritual-like crescendo while the latter brings tears to my eyes.  My mother just passed away recently, and this song reminds me of how inspiring and powerful she was to myself and so many others.  This is not merely for listening.  It's an experience.  Pick up this CD.  You'll be glad you did.

After seeing this title on best seller lists, I was certain it would be great.  Well, for whatever reason, it just didn't do it for me.  It wasn't the page turner like I had hoped.  Reading how God works through difficult situations has always intrigued me.  There were sections that kept me going, but it seemed to fizzle towards the end.  I finished it mainly to be able to call it a wrap.
0451525884|4.0|I use an audio copy of P&P when teaching it in class - we read through important passages together without the loss of my voice. I previously owned a tape version - horrible because you had to FF to whatever parts you wanted. In fact my player ended up eating 2 of the tapes. This CD version is much better and I would highly recommend it, except... Normal audio CDs have tracks that correspond with the chapters. Not this one. The tracks were in random places (in the middle of a paragraph, even in the middle of sentences!) so trying to find the right chapter to start on required some detective work. If you're just planning to listen from start to finish, however, this is an excellent version- the reader is splendid.
B000G2YD3C|4.0|When is Progressive Rock not Progressive? When it's Pure Reason Revolution. The band doesn't really break any new ground here, but they produce an able auditory experience all the same. The most prominent theme on the album is lifted straight out of the lyrics to Pink Floyd's \\"Echoes\\": \\"...a million bright ambassadors of morning...\\". There are many \\"echoes\\" of past prog bands contained within the album: Opeth, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Radiohead, Dream Theater, more. Perhaps the combining of these elements could be considered progressive? Perhaps.<br /><br />Much has been made of PRR's vocals. There are subtle harmonies, and the layering of the male and female vox is striking at times, but the lyrical phrasing is redundant and boring. There's an almost chant-like feel to it, a very plainsong styled approach. The phrasing is so similar from tune to tune that a certain sameness sinks in, defeating the effect of the instrumental artistry. Singing across the instrumental phrase, not along with it, might help next time. And, please, vary phrasing song to song!<br /><br />The problem for me was that the band had been hyped by the on-line progressive rock community, perhaps to an unrealistic degree... maybe there was no way they could have lived up to the created expectations.<br /><br />Still, it's listenable, new, \\"progressive\\" rock, and if you enjoy the bands mentioned above, you may enjoy PRR.

But after reading this book, I feel more confident in my belief in a Godless universe. I realize to a greater degree how much faith harmed my life in the past, and I appreciate even more the natural beauty of the phenomenon known as the universe.  <br /> <br />Dawkins book is a great read for theist and atheist alike. It will challenge your premises, and make you critically examine some of the deepest beliefs you ever hold.  <br /> <br />If you are a theist, you should read this book to help you understand why atheism is growing so quickly in the developed world. You may lose your own faith, or you may even find your faith strengthened. Either way, knowledge is power, and this book will definitely increase your knowledge of the current God/atheism debate that is raging across the world.  <br /> <br />For atheists, this book will better prepare you to share your skepticism with others. It will help you better understand and express your reasons for believing in a natural, material existence. And it will increase your appreciation for the wonder that is the universe.  <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended to all.

B000EULJLU|5.0|This CD is just as great as their other albums, people just built up their expectations waaaaaaaaaaaay too high. True, it does have a few recycled riffs, but even Led Zeppelin ripped themselves off too.  <br />  The main thing you have to keep in mind when listening to this album is that it is an album. Not singles. Album. Every song is part of a larger picture.  <br />  10,000 days is a little softer than Lateralus or Aenima, but it's still very good. It's a little bit of a grower too, so if you don't at first like it, keep listening to it and you'll eventually come around. <br />  This is definalty a bass and drum masterpiece though.

B000E1155E|3.0|The few songs that are heard on the radio are the best ones on the CD.  Quite a few of the other songs are OK at best and others are not worthy of a demo tape.  Do yourself a favor and listen to the samples before buying; it might be cheaper to get just the songs you want rather than buying the whole CD.
B000001E7T|4.0|The Amazon clips here do not do this album justice. For years, I rejected the thought of buying this album because the parts of the songs I heard here failed to interest me. Then one day, I heard \\"Down By The Water\\" on the radio, and I knew I just had to try it. None of the other songs, much to my disappointment, were much like \\"Down By The Water,\\" but most (I don't care for the strident \\"Send His Love To Me\\" or the prosaic \\"C'Mon Billy\\") were charming in different ways. \\"To Bring You My Love\\" is a bluesy track that sounds like what Fiona Apple was going for on her second album, \\"Meet Ze Monsta\\" sounds at once tough and bouncy, \\"Teclo\\" is haunting and lovely, and \\"The Dancer\\" is just plain fascination with its flamenco touches. If any of this sounds appealing, you should buy this before \\"good sense\\" changes your mind...

0307237699|4.0|This is a heart breaker for anyone in the moderate majority.  I made the mistake of reading this book and then watching the author on \\"Meet the Press.\\"  In the book, Sen Obama comes across as a thoughtful, moderate, gentleman who can bridge the huge political divide in Washington and I drink the kool-aid.  He rarely takes \\"hard\\" positions on many issues in the book, but neither did Clinton, Lincoln, or T. Roosevelt and they were great centrist .  Then Tim Russert spoils the day by showing the truth about Sen Obama's very divisive votes on Supreme Court nominations, homeland security and how he is already back-tracking on promises he made earlier this year that directly conflict with what he writes in the book.  Maybe it is more a testament to the power of Washington than to the quick fall of what could have been a very special politician.  The point is that this book should be read as a set of great ideas from the author, NOT the true beliefs of the author.
B000001FI7|5.0|This album is one of the few that you can listen to without once touching the \\"skip\\" button (unless of course you want to hear \\"Sour Times\\" or another favorite song again). I was surprised by how substantial the songs were; there was always something to the songs other than mere fluffy prettiness (the spy overtones in \\"Mysterons\\" and \\"Sour Times,\\" the lyrics in \\"Glory Box\\" and \\"Roads\\", the palpably tentative start to \\"It's A Fire\\").  Maybe it isn't very persuasive simply to call an album \\"beautiful,\\" but after feeling how this one turns dull, stressful afternoons into enchanting memories, I can't find a better adjective.

1401207138|5.0|Much has been said elsewhere about this groundbreaking story that hit in the mid 1980's (including 'groundbreaking'), so there's very little I can add to that part of it overall.  Suffice it to say, this is not a comic book hero story for the kiddies, but one for the now-grown-up kiddies, particularly those who came of age in the 1960's or 1970's, or at least have a good grasp of World & U.S. history from World War II through the mid-1980's so as to better appreciate the 'alternate history' that this story ultimately ends up being.<br /><br />As for this 'Absolute Edition,' the reader really benefits from the enlarged format, especially in regards to the artwork by Dave Gibbons.  There are many little details that he filled into the panels, and the larger size of those panels makes it a little easier to find & appreciate them.<br /><br />The other bonus feature in this edition is the detailed 'behind-the-scenes' notes, sketches, etc. that are included at the end.  It's fascinating to see how the story evolved over time once it became clear that Alan Moore would not be given access to the old Charlton Comics characters (Blue Beetle, Captain Atom, The Question, etc.) as he had originally planned (DC Comics intially gave the go-ahead, then decided they were going to integrate these characters into their mainstream - apparently, the idea of a non-continuity storyline happening at the same time the characters were being added mainstream was thought to be too confusing to the readers...we are frequently underestimated in this area).<br /><br />If you have any of the (many) prior collected editions of this story, and you don't care for the larger format or the additonal process info, then you don't really need to pick this up.  However, if you don't have any of the collected editions, this is a fine volume to add to your collection.

0152023984|4.0|This book was wonderful, the moral being there are simple treasures in life, and not to focus on the stresses we encounter. Reading it a second time was even better for me, you can appreciate how the author combines the desperation of both main characters (the little prince and the pilot) in  one particular situation when the prince is asking if sheep eat roses and the pilot thinking its an unimportant question (when we all know in this book it was the MOST important question) the pilot is frusterated struggling to fix his plane and running low on water in the desert, and he snaps at the little prince who is distracting him with his talk of roses and sheep, not knowing the desperation and discontent the little prince is feeling over his worry of the rose he loves on his planet. fixing that plane was everything to the pilot, and protecting that rose was everything to the prince. great book! you wont look up in the sky after this without wondering about that rose.
B00005JNEI|5.0|First, I give this 5 stars because of the subject matter and the subject matter's importance, AND the supplemental interviews and DVD extras; but not for the quality of the documentary filmmaking.  More about that in a moment...   <br /> <br />The subject matter is very, very, deadly serious.  Easily the most important subject matter of this decade and certainly one of the top issues of the last 40 years.  Regardless of whether you consider yourself in one political camp or another, or neutral; you should know that the documentary looks at both individual, very personal concerns such as a mother who lost her son in the war, and also examines much broader, political and economic aspects and questions that deserve attention, and intelligent, calm discussion.   <br /> <br />****  Even if you have seen the film and disagree, you should WATCH THE DVD SUPPLEMENTAL footage.  If you miss these additional parts, you are missing 50% of the information.  Please see #2 below <br />And if you are critical of the main documentary's viewpoint, you may welcome the fact that the supplemental material is largely unedited, running footage devoid of any particular viewpoint from the film's authors.   <br /> <br />This documentary well deserves the praise for being one of the first to approach this subject at a time when virtually the entire Western world media would not (or could not) go near this topic.  When national fever is high and any questioning of the war effort is considered \\"treason,\\" \\"unpatriotic,\\" and \\"morally wrong;\\" our constitutional rights such as free speech and free assembly are in serious danger.   <br />The documentary portrays this, but (unfortunately) only in a sidelight fashion (one of many problems).  In fact, I'm not sure the filmmakers realized this was one of the greatest overriding issues.  If common citizens were better informed, the insane actions and atrocities would have never happened. <br />Yet, the documentary displays this serious, national problem of the absentee press graphically and without any possible misinterpretation.  Both within the US and in other parts of the world, censorship and denial is taking place.  But it doesn't make the points strongly or clearly enough. <br /> <br /> <br />Because this film and its issues have been seen now by tens of millions, it is part of our culture and that effect is growing.  To dismiss it without seeing it in its entirety (plus the supplemental materials!) is going to cast doubt on anyone who tries to discuss the documentary but doesn't know firsthand how the information is presented.  Basically, you can't attack the documentary's ideas unless you watch the documentary.  Hearing about it from your uncle or coworker will not be an acceptable working knowledge. <br /> <br />Furthermore, since these are gigantic political and life-threatening issues, every citizen has a duty to be as informed as possible.  We can't have a country that goes to war, invades another 2 other countries, kills and permanently maims tens of thousands of its own soldiers and tens of thousands of citizens in the other countries, puts another 20,000+ in jail for six+ years, commits acts of torture by the thousands, and then has a substantial part of its own population refuse to consider this as right or wrong, and refuses to spend 2 hours of their time watching a easily available documentary that might shed new light or viewpoints on this situation. <br /> <br /> <br />That being said, Michael Moore's and his filmmaking team's documentary skills and decisions are sometimes good, but other times quite poor. <br /> <br />This documentary has several problems, and these have nothing to do with facts being correct or other content issues; this is strictly about the documentary filmmaking *process* and the decisions made in the creation of this work. <br /> <br />-- Big Problem #1: <br />If you have a film titled \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", don't start the film discussing presidential election questions and/orirregularities.   <br />Any filmmaker knows that every minute, and every second, of their footage is precious, especially the first 10 minutes.  A documentary on our nationwide election problems is just fine.  But that's another documentary; maybe a really good one, but I don't think it should have been included, except perhaps at the end.   <br />By starting off with material not directly related to the 9/11 attacks, Mr. Moore has given his critics ample fodder for criticism and rejection in the beginning, even if the reason for that rejection has flaws.   <br />This decision was a huge presentation blunder, and stole precious resources that could have been used to set up and structure the rest of the material, and prepare the audience for what was ahead.  In its final form, this information is irrelevant to the next 90 minutes and barely remembered after it's all over. <br /> <br />-- Big Problem #2: <br />As mentioned above, the filmmakers did not appear to have a good grasp of the subjects they were documenting, and there's no strong sense of what is important and what's not.   <br />The results are missed opportunities, a barrage of information, and a lack of clarity.  The information is not well organized, and it's not summarized or reviewed at times when a new viewer needs time to catch their breath.  This is a problem with editing and pacing; and understanding how a viewer or audience will mentally keep track of everything. <br />That doesn't mean the material is incorrect or faulty, it means it's assembled and presented poorly.  As a comparison, I'd say it was like reading a book by starting with the last chapter, then backing up one chapter at a time.  Sure, you read the book and all the words, but the people, information, story, and connections are going to be a lot harder to put together with that kind of approach. <br /> <br />We see a lot of really important information.  There's no doubt about that. <br />But what are the most important points?  Youmight name 3, but someone else might name 3 completely different ones.  And both would be right!  However, this shouldn't happen if the documentary is well made. <br /> <br />-- Big Problem #3: <br />The film doesn't possess a good structure. <br /> <br />It's not a particularly linear piece, neither does it follow several simultaneous information or storylines. It doesn't have a \\"scientific\\" approach or any other good format.  Instead it's an assembly line of data but fails to add up to a finished product, and following this analogy, some information falls off the assembly line and is easily forgotten.  Again, this doesn't mean the data is wrong, this is a mistake of filmmaking; and in all fairness, it's the sort of mistake one would expect from someone not well skilled at creating documentaries.  It's not amateur, but it's not tight and coherent either. <br /> <br />The material is both dense emotionally explosive, and hard to digest, especially if you aren't familiar with all the facts.  But the presentation doesn't work to help the viewer through this, and connect the many pieces of information or give time for pause and review.  Instead, the presentation is relentless and has a zigzag structure which takes away from the power of the material rather than combine it to something stronger. <br /> <br />For instance, we see critically important censorship and denial on the part of the media, but it's not brought into sharp mental focus amongst all the other information and data, and neither are the implications of this media black hole.  This needed stronger, more focused presentation. The great crime that a war for \\"freedom\\" has denied \\"freedom of the press\\" is very likely lost to many viewers. <br /> <br />Add to this a seemingly never-ending series of musical jokes and segments, which I can't even guess at their purpose.  Here we are watching this [literally] deadly serious material, and suddenly we have silly rock music and images, like some low-grade music video.  This type of decision is truly amateur and pathetic; and just as shameful as the people being being joked about.  If the documentary filmmakers don't treat the subject with seriousness, how can they ridicule other people? <br /> <br />But this documentary shouldn't have jokes.  In fact, no \\"true documentary\\" would ever take this lunatic approach, and this behavior easily opens up the entire subject to ridicule.  It's incomprehensible how any documentary would be created with this type of approach.  Shame on the producers, distributors, and anyone else involved with the production for not stepping forward and \\"telling the emperor he has no clothes.\\"  This juvenile, dimwit approach disgraces the production and insults everyone who has suffered from the craziness of  \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\".  This should never have happened. <br /> <br /> <br />-- Big Problem #4:    Every moment of the film should be about runaway crazy \\"Fahrenheit 9/11,\\" but it isn't. <br /> <br />As an example, President Bush bangs the podium and exclaims the usual nonsense about terrorists hating freedom and hating American goodwill.  So why not show the real reasons?  Like the fact that the United States sold arms to Iran and Iraq as they fought each other years ago, creating immense hostility throughout the Middle East towards the US?  A little information, to either remind or inform the viewer of the real reasons for the hatred goes a long way to proving how we received an endless stream of lies and misleading information about the entire situation. <br />Better yet, since you are doing a documentary, why not ask a variety of experts on the subject, and have them explain and agree or disagree with \\"terrorists hate America and freedom\\". <br /> <br />Instead, precious moments in the documentary are stolen with largely dead or irrelevant material, such as when Michael Moore stands outside the Saudi Embassy with Secret Service coming to ask questions.  It's interesting, but belongs in the supplementalmaterials section.  That is not something that qualifies as national hysteria or \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\".  And it opens both Michael Moore and his entire team to criticisms of grandstanding and trying to be performers and part of the story instead of good documentary filmmakers. <br /> <br />Here's one of the most important things you should know: <br />In the original film documentary, we see a US military raid on a civilian home suspected to harbor terrorists  <br />To my utter dismay, we see in the supplemental materials this is part of a much larger story with 10 times as much impact, with disgusting, barbaric and outrageous disrespect for ordinary citizens by our soldiers.  Unfortunately this is lost and jumbled in the original cut.   <br />The Swedish reporter with the US military unit tells us that no one, including Swedish media, would present this shocking and horrifying behavior.  Furthermore, only the supplemental material lets us have an idea of the type of documentary footage Michael Moore and his team had to work with.  In this well-documented sequence from the Swedish journalists, we see one of our military units invade an ordinary family's home and our soldiers physically and mentally abusing and terrorizing ordinary citizens, including tormenting a crippled old man. Apparently they didn't understand its importance. <br /> <br />THEN!  ... we find out that one of the soldiers was drunk, and soldiers hit the old man's penis repeatedly, and this all happens with the commanding officer watching calmly to the side.  Why on earth wasn't this included in the main documentary?  This isn't as bad as Abu Ghraib torture sessions, but it's dynamite material nevertheless.    <br /> <br />And then we are told this is not anything unusual; in fact it's commonplace! <br /> <br />Showing our military behaving like this is extremely important footage, and shows why people in Iraq and the Middle Eastern world have learned to hate the United States more and more each year.Yet, this crucial segment is poorly presented and largely lost in the original documentary. <br />Compared to some of the segments mentioned above, this is clearly more important.  But, it was cast aside.  I cannot understand this. <br /> <br />It's hard to speculate, but if this was left out, we have to ask ourselves what other material has been discarded?  This is, unfortunately, just plain bad decision-making in the documentary process, a real lack of comprehension about on the part of the documentary filmmakers; and poor workmanship compared to other documentary work. <br /> <br />-- Final thoughts: <br />At this point you may think my opinion of the documentary is poor and maybe not worth viewing, so let me avoid the film's mistake and summarize this: <br />This is an exceedingly serious and important documentary, and I recommend it along with the supplemental materials to anyone who considers himself a good American, of moral conscience, or anyone who has interest in American politics and actions.   <br />You don't have to agree but you should be familiar with the material and see all of it. <br />That's why it gets 5 stars.  You need to watch this. <br />However, I'm very critical of the documentary skill, or lack thereof, and a much better and threfore less controversial documentary could have been created from the same materials, and might have had a more positive impact and received wider acceptance. <br />     Even so, this needs to be seen.   <br />And if you are confused how I can give five stars to something with this many problems, let me repeat that just delving into this subject in the national, political environment of the time of its release was breakthrough and revolutionary.  It would have been \\"great\\" in the hands of others.

I have been meaning to call or contact you but I dont know how this will work out.  I would greatly appreciate an e-mail or some type of contact to try and rectify this situation as you will clearly see that this happened when the disk was being developed or when the graphics were added to the top.

B00004ZD69|5.0|Music like this is so rare.  Music so mapped out, so layered, so etheral... This album is an experience.  It isn't a collection of songs.  It's a series of movements that form an orchestral piece.  When listening to it you feel as if you're in another world; a barren landscape plagued by destruction and an impending apocolypse.  Yet, despite this, there are still areas of light and hope.<br /><br />When listening to this album, do it all at once.  Don't start on track 2 of disc 1 or track 1 of disc 2...  Play it all in succession.  This is the best way to fully appreciate what you're listening to.<br /><br />Also, this album may take a little while to sink in.  But when it does, it will be one of the greatest things you've ever heard.

B00005U11Z|5.0|Many people can't get past the separation between Steve Perry and the rest of Journey. My suggestion to these folks is to catch the Behind The Music show that VH1 did a few years ago after Steve Augeri joined the band. The truth of the matter is, if you're a band like Journey and your biggest hits are songs like Open Arms and Faithfully, you're going to want to prewsent those songs with someone who has the vocdal range to do them justice. Steve Augeri is that singer. He even thanked Steve Perry for inspiration in the credits of the band's \\"13 Red\\" EP a couple of years back. I've always answered the critics who've said Journey isn't Journey without Mr. Perry by asking them who they'd rather hear singing those songs if Steve Perry isn't there...someone with the right range, or the ZZ Top vocalist who sang \\"La Grange\\"? Journey's drummer Deen Castronovo said it best when this concert aired on DirecTV...\\"People came to this show thinking, okay, guys, impress me...then when we started out with Separate Ways, their jaws dropped to the ground and they believed us after that!\\" This show proved to me that Journey was always Neal Schon's band from the beginning (Perry didn't join until their FOURTH album) and I've seen them five times, twice with Perry and three times with Augeri... <br />and will go see them again anytime! This was the definitive return of this band and was truly a magical moment to see them not only come back but set the stage on fire in the process! You won't regret this if you're a REAL Journey fan.
B000H30B2C|1.0|OK, its only 3+ hours and maybe the opening credit sequence, recreating a depression era New York, is redeeming, but still this is by far one of the worst movie experiences I've had in a long time. I'm not liking the stylized, digitally rendered world of modern movies, and this is the epitomy of digital moviemaking. <br /> <br />Where to start? Why watch this movie?  <br /> <br />Do you like digital monkeys fighting several digital dinosaurs for fifteen minutes at a time? To lighten things up, every now and then for emotional gravitas, a shot of a passionately concerned Naomi Watts who is in love with a large, killer monkey makes for a good laugh. This monster is killing people, you two don't make a good couple, enough with the theatrics. In the original, the woman is terrified, and she should be. At this point I'm dumbfounded by the movie. A fat Jack Black is jogging under a dino's belly while carrying a large, depression era movie camera. No, I'm not exaggerating or lying. Him and several other people are running under the belly of a dino. If it wasn't ridiculous enough, it looks like a videogame. No realism in the look or the actions of the people. And to make it worse; some sort of strange made-for-tv blur effect, that is completely out of place with the production style and is used at some of the strangest times.  <br /> <br />To be honest, somewhere in the middle of the island scenes I went out for a breath of fresh air and to listen to some music in my car. I missed how they catched the large monkey and how they managed to drag it to NY.  <br /> <br />Oooops, I almost forgot to mention the most inane set of throwaway characters in film history; The Men of the Boat! If the entire boat sank midway into the film, not a single amount of concern would be registered by the filmgoers. But the ultimate throwaway character is The Boy Who Can't Read. He is reading \\"The Heart of Darkness\\". What is great about this - is when bad acting young boy asks shipmate about book,it provides metaphors for Jack Black's obsessed character, which is actually providing metaphors for monster ego director Peter Jackson. This was done so clumsily I laughed out loud several times, \\"Why does he keep going up the river?...\\" now I'm getting looks from the audience; nobody gets my humor!  <br /> <br />Even Andy Serkis, he of Golumn fame, gets in on the act. From voicing/acting Golumn to this throwaway character, what next, spokesman for Wal-Mart? Oh, the end? The monkey and annoying wanna-be actress get married and have three darling little apes, who grow up to run the family business. But really, you want big sweeping shots? Great, can't stand a screen-full of CGI? Tough, you're going to get big old sweeping CGI scenes. No dust, grain, or any sense of reality - you're watching a rendered scene for you to respond with rendered emotions. Digital shots of digital monkey. Cut to; Naomi Watts in horror as her 1,000 pound digital lover kills left and right. Its all so touching. <br /> <br />In closing; <br />* Nice Depression Era Intro <br />* Throwaway characters <br />* Jack Black miscast <br />* Overdramatic Naomi Watts (enough with trying over and over to create sympathy for Kong!) <br />* Strange blur effect and editing choices <br />* Scenes on the island over the top to the point of being ridiculous. Hanging from the mouth of a raptor during a fight taking place hanging from vines??? Huh! Then the running of the dinos and it only gets worse from there.  <br />* The rescue of Naomi from Kong and the capture of Kong both ridiculous. The hero climing up a cliff-face and later him jumping off said cliff with her, etc. Apparently being a screenwriter give one superhumans powers. <br />* The whole over the top, sweeping digital ending. <br /> <br />I'm in my 30's - I'm the only one in my group of friends who braved this movie. Never heard much about it - Kong seemed to disappear from the map quickly and deservedly. <br /> <br />As much as I liked the LotRseries - I would be unlikely to bother seeing a Peter Jackson movie in this lifetime.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw the movie Serenity and fell in love with the characters.  I love the witty humor that flies by so quickly between them.  This is not a series for kids.  It is a highly intelligent fast paced adventure story with a lot of relevance for our world today.

B000000YNZ|5.0|I like stripped down jazz combos and piano, bass and drums is about perfect for well crafted and performed compositions with the kind of space in the music that makes it inviting yet unobtrusive. Bill Evans has a reputation in this field so Moon Beams is a reliable entry into his catalogue if you were intrigued from only hearing his playing on 'Kind of Blue'.

0385474547|4.0|I read this book for my book club.  It was a very interesting read and an enlightening look into life in Africa as well as into the male psyche and into human nature. I think one reason I found it slightly lacking was that it is on Time's 100 Best Novels; I don't know if it warranted that and that made me expect more. I would still highly recommend it if you want something different and interesting to read that is also a fairly easy read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I know my title seems a little...well ok over the top but I'm serious. I don't really watch many TV series anymore because they have gone down hill. Latley it's just been movie's. So I had a friend recommend a movie, Serenity. I thought the movie was pretty good and my friend explained that the movie was based off a series and all the original characters had been used. So he said if you like the movie you love the series. He was right. I saw all four DVDs in one weekend. One right after another. Once you get to the last DVD you'll get a little sad. So my suggestion \\"Buy this box set\\". It's the perfect combination of action comedy and drama.
B000002A46|5.0|I don't understand why anyone would give a damn about its cover. It is true that the cover of CD may look somewhat deceiving and disturbing and I can truly relate to this problem. However, just listen to the CD when you are coming up with a valid opinion as to how great/horrible this CD is. <br />For me, I think this may be one of the best Christmas albums. After all, this is sung by Mariah Carey, who is undoubtedly one of the best female singers of our century.

B000GFLAI0|3.0|I actually enjoyed the music, hearing some old classics done in the Dylan style along with the new tunes...but my complaint is when I read the liner notes and saw that Dylan took credit for writting all the songs! Please, tell me he is not that hard up for money that he does not want to give the true composers their royalties...granted they are no longer among us, but their families are! J.A. Lane [Jimmy Rogers]& McKinley Morganfield [Muddy Waters] must be \\"Rollin' & Tumblin'\\" in their graves...or maybe saying \\"That's  All Right\\" Bob, \\"Someday Baby\\" we'll meet again...
0060934719|4.0|This is a fine piece of work by a talented author.  In essence it is a fairy tale for adults, written with some of the best prose I have ever read- smooth and flowing.  However, read Gaiman at your own risk.  His topics, sensibilities and \\"shock value\\" vary a great deal from book to book.  His books illustrate why some authors need to use pen names, so you can tell one type of writing from another.
B000000WFZ|5.0|Its hard to put into words what Morricone accomplished on this soundtrack. He simply touched the divine. This is a master of his craft in top form. He manages to capture the essence of what the film was about in such a way that it transcends the film entirely.<br /><br />This is one of those rare cases where the score elevates and propels the script of a film to heights unaccessable by the film alone.<br /><br />A true masterpiece.
B000000W5H|3.0|The albums the Stones were releasing in the mid '70's weren't as great as the \\"fabulous four\\"- \\"Beggar's Banquet,\\" \\"Let It Bleed,\\" \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" and \\"Exile on Main Street.\\" <br /> <br />The band basically gave up the ghost after \\"Exile,\\" an album regarded by many as their \\"masterpiece,\\" but recorded under the worst conditions imaginable.  By the time of \\"Goats Head Soup\\" the group was definitely floundering due to Keith's heroin habit and a general malaise in the inspiration department.  \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll,\\" the follow-up to \\"Goats Head Soup,\\" is more energetic than its predecessor, but still uneven.   <br /> <br />There are some great songs on \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll.\\"  One of the Stones' best songs of all time, \\"Time Waits for No One,\\" being reason enough to buy the album.  But the album shows Mick in artistic control.  Keith is still in the wings due to his chemical romance.  Keith's MIA status is sorely felt throughout the album. <br /> <br />Probably the most amazing musical highlight of \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\\" is the wonderful guitar playing of Mick Taylor.  This is Mick Taylor's last album as a member of the Stones.  His leads are beautiful.  The interplay of his lyrical approach blending with Keith's strong, forceful rhythm playing was incredible!  The Stones lost a great deal of musicality when Taylor left the group.  Taylor's guitar playing was responsible for much of the quality on the Stones' best albums- \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile on Main Street.\\" <br /> <br />\\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\\" is worth adding to your album collection.  Just don't forget to buy the \\"fabulous four.\\"

B000H0MKGK|5.0|I've never been a big fan of John Mayer, though i certainly liked \\"Daughters\\" and \\"Your Body is a Wonderland.\\" I heard \\"I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You) and was completely blown away by the lyrics and its \\"Marvin Gaye/Maxwell\\" soulful feel to it. Wanting to hear more i headed to the web and previewed the album on itune. All i can say is \\"WOW\\", i cannot stop playing this album. The  lyrics, the voice, the level of  maturity this dude has reached is incredible. Nothing outthere today comes close to the superb artistry, songwriting, poetry, and just plain awesomeness of this album. Every track is pure magic and could stand on its own.  <br /> <br /> <br />The socially concious \\"Waiting For The World To Change\\" and \\"Belief\\" get to the heart of why we're in so much trouble in the world today. I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)\\" makes you wanna fall in love with that girl  you saw at the mall today and whose name you don't even know- (Marvin Gaye would be proud). \\"Gravity\\", \\"Stop This Train\\" And \\"In Repair\\" send chills through my spine; each song lyrically rich, emotionally deep and full of hope and redemption. \\"The Heart Of Life\\" is another amazing track full of optimism and belief in the human spirit. \\"Slow Dancing In A Burning Room\\" is one of my favorites and probably one of the deepest songs about love gone wrong ever written. \\"Don't you think we oughta know by now, don't you think we shoulda learned somehow.\\" Simply put this album is a modern classic!
B000HEWEE4|4.0|`The Lake House' is a Hollywood remake of Korean film `Il Mare' (The Sea') made in 2000. Though the filmmakers have changed many settings, the basic plot line remains the same, which is about a mystical exchange of letters between a man and a woman. The point is, the man, Alex (Keanu Reeves) lives in the year 2004 while the woman, Kate (Sandra Bullock), lives in 2006.  <br /> <br />This is a love story, and a very romantic one. The communication between Alex and Kate, which gradually develops into rapport, or something more, is carried out through a time-traveling mail-box standing before the curious glass house by the lake. Like `Somewhere in Time' or `Frequency' you need suspension of disbelief to enjoy the story, which looks less plausible in a modernized city of Chicago than in a seaside house in Korea.  <br /> <br />The script is skillfully written so as not to make us realize the implausibility of the film's situations, and though some (or many) would notice where the story is going at the earlier stage, the film all in all succeeds in keeping us guessing: `Can they meet each other?' The chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock is a genuine one even though we know their `conversation' is physically impossible and there is one romantic scene that is accompanied with an equally romantic Paul McCartney song. And the reference to one Jane Austen novel is clever and intelligent. <br /> <br />`The Lake House' is a wildly romantic film and is impressive as such. Still, the sub-plot about the shaky relations between Alex and his father (Christopher Plummer) fails to interest us. Actually no supporting actors, even Shohreh Aghdashlook, are memorable, but you know this film is made for Keanu and Sandra. And I referred to the `implausible' plot, but implausibility didn't bother me. Still I'm afraid the idea of moving the location to Chicago is not a good one because the two-year lapse does not seem a big difficulty to overcome with this background. (Alex, why not e-mail instead of waiting?)

B00012BD0S|5.0|Symphony X - simply they rock, and this is a must have disc. <br /> <br />For any review to be honest you have to give the good with the bad, so lets get the bad out of the way first. The guitar tones get on my nerves after a while (borrowed straight from Diamond Dave). There is only so much my ear can take of that extremely heavy tone, it would be nice if it was mixed up a bit. Second - Like most bands they tend to take a rif or two, or an idea that has already been done before and make it theirs, For me not a big deal but worth mentioning in a review. <br /> <br />Now the good - Even with my previous comments I think they deserve a 5 and I believe this CD is a must have for anyone serious about their progressive metal collection.  <br /> <br />The Vocals are that perfect blend of hard edge without that stupid (Grover) growl crap. This guy can actually sing. In my opinion he is one of the better metal singers - up there with the likes of Dio and the late Carl Albert (Vicious Rumors).  <br /> <br />One of the things that makes this band so great is their compositions, with great use of each instrument, a good balance of going outside of the metal box with their use of symphonic instruments and even a hint or two of some modern Jazz. They are one of the better bands when it comes to mixing the Classical with the Metal (thus their name Symphony X).  <br /> <br />This is one of those bands like Dream Theater where each of the musicians are top notch. Once this disc reaches your player it will stay there for a very long time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00005QW5X|5.0|John Cameron Mitchell's creative prowess is unquestionable: his screen adaptation of the play, \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" is a spot-on effort for the young filmmaker. <br /> <br />The DVD has plenty of supplemental material to garner the interest of the newly exposed viewer as well as the cult-member/fan. <br /> <br />The film looks good; the cover art itself jumps out at you.  I recommend this film for everyone interested in good cinema, and anyone interested in what is widely considered the greatest rock musical of the twenty-first century.

1558908382|5.0|Gotta be the funniest, wittiest, fastest comedy out there.  I can't stand not to watch this one.  I probably see it twice a year.  It's that good.  Every line is good, every scene is good.  Never predictable, never dull or formulaic, despite being an outgrowth of Cusack's prestigious 1980's lexicon of light comedies.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|V is a great movie.  It has a compelling story with a pace that keeps you interested between really good action sequences.  It's well-acted, with a particularly good performance from Stephen Rea, who plays a cop investigating the \\"terrorist\\" V.  I'm not going to rehash the plot.  I merely want to urge people to watch it for its entertainment value, and even its emphasis on democracy and freedom (even if this element was changed drastically in the story's movie adaption), and ignore those who claim that it glorifies terrorism.  It does not.  The government that V fights is a fascist dictatorship, one which Americans would be compelled to fight themselves if we are to believe in the principles established in the Declaration of Independence.  He seems to take care in limiting his destruction to the regime that has taken power and, as you'll see in watching it, made him what he is (it is, afterall, a comic book movie).  Watch the movie and enjoy it.
B0007PAMBK|5.0|Some brilliant directors only make a few movies. Herk Harvey made over four hundred -- but sadly, he only brought his astounding talents into one non-educational movie.<br /><br />That one brilliant movie is cult horror flick \\"Carnival of Souls,\\" a nightmarish tale of a young woman who is lingering on in the world of the living -- and is pursued by the dead. Made for a piddling seventeen thousand dollars, this little gem is as eerie now as it was in the 1960s.<br /><br />Three young women decide to drag race a car of young men -- and their car goes off a bridge into the river. Only Mary (Candace Hilligoss) staggers out of the water, seemingly undisturbed by the accident. The next day she travels to Utah for her new job as a church organist, but on the trip she keeps seeing a grinning, corpselike man watching her from the road.<br /><br />Mary tries to distract herself with shopping, dodging her lecherous neighbor, and playing the organ. But she keeps seeing the corpse-man), having strange moments where nobody can see or ear her, and also finds herself drawn to a run-down former carnival pavilion. As the dead close in on her, Mary runs from them... but she can't escape from them forever.<br /><br />A simple plot, but Herk Harvey handles it with brilliant skill. There's a goofy moment here or there -- at one point Mary turns around to shriek into the camera lens. But most of the time, Harvey keeps the atmosphere piling on, with relatively little dialogue (the most memorable lines are usually shrieked ones like \\"I don't want to be alone!\\").<br /><br />In short, Harvey had the ability to inspire something a lot rarer than fear or shocks -- dread. Mary's confusion, fear and denial are almost palpable as she wanders through the town. By the climax, it has transformed into a sort of nightmarish maze that Mary can just run through, with the dead people just a few steps behind her. And there's that creepy organ music all the time.<br /><br />The ending is not so much a twist as the inevitable answer to all the bizarre events that came before it -- and it's a brilliant, bittersweet ending. It was also the ending that has inspired creepy horror movies ever since. Suddenly the \\"invisibility\\" moments and the dead faces make perfect sense, and we understand what it is that Mary is really running from.<br /><br />Mary is also not your typical early-sixties heroine -- she's sharp-tongued (\\"Thank you, but I'm NEVER coming back here\\") and kind of spinsterish by nature. What's more, she is completely detached from everyone around her, since she is not meant to be in the world of the living. Hilligoss (who only made one other movie) is absolutely amazing here, with her distant attitude and frightened eyes.<br /><br />This version doesn't have the loads of extras the Criterion one has. But it does have a well-colorized version, as well as the original black-and-white. The icing on the cake: Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 does the commentary, which is the same sort of mockery they had for other such movies.<br /><br />Brilliant and creepy, \\"Carnival of Souls\\" is a deserving cult classic.

B000FS9FCQ|3.0|The movie stands up nicely to the graphic novel. The film isn't in the team photo with \\"Bladerunner\\", \\"Brazil\\" or even \\"5th Element\\" for that matter.  <br /> <br />As a comic book interpretation,  \\"Sin City\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\" blow it out of the water. Alan Moore's distancing himself from the product speaks to the writer's self indulgence of being a writer.  He also knows that all of us that grew up on comics expected more. The movie still works.  Natalie Portman's performance is the spirit of the film. Disc Two, corporate management ringing the gong of \\"Comics are important!\\" (Pease read/buy more!) <br />Give it a rest boys and girls.  Make better product. and retain a PR firm to tell the story, like you did in the documentary/promo for  'Superman Returns'
B000FQ4M58|4.0|From the moment I heard the first few chords of \\"The Monster is Loose\\" on the trailer for Bat III, I was hooked...and that was months ago.  I always look forward to October 31st, but I have been counting the days until the release of Bat III. I had a lot of expectations about this album and let me tell you....it did not disappoint.  There is something on this album for just about everyone.  Chugging guitars, Meat's operatic vocals, haunting orchestration, beautiful piano work, ballads, epics, duets, and freakin' BRIAN MAY & STEVE VAI!!!! I am a huge fan of many musical styles and Meat delivers most of them in this one album.  \\"The Monster is Loose\\" is one of the heaviest songs Meat has ever committed to album.  It's hard to top \\"Life is a Lemon (And I Want My Money Back) from Bat II, in my book, but \\"Monster\\", \\"In the Land of the Pig, the Butcher is King\\",  and \\"If it Ain't Broke, Break it\\" are arguably some of the heaviest songs of Meat's career.  \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" is a great rendition of a Jim Steinman classic.  I'm glad Meat decided to make it a duet.  Meat's duet with the ever talented Patti Russo, on \\"What About Love\\" is wonderful.  Duets with newcomers Marion Raven and Jennifer Hudson are also worthy of praise.   <br /> <br />Now for the reason my review is a four star review.  If one was to get technical, there are some very noticeable problems with Bat III.  One Jim Steinman's production is completely absent.  Some may say that is inconsequential, but that is not the case.  The first thing I did when I got this album was listen to Bat's I, II, and III back to back.  I soon noticed that Bat III lacked the signature production of the first two albums.  Desmond Child is an extremely talented producer in his own right, but when it comes to producing a Bat album, he falls short.  The second flaw with this album is that it seems like a veritable hodge-podge of sorts in relation to the songs chosen for this album.  It's quite uneven and that can be ablessing and a curse.  To the average listener, it may be an uncomfortable experience initially, so it may take some time to warm up to, but for someone like me who likes a little metal with his \\"pop stew\\", it's a blessed hell-ride.  So, whether you are a 'Meat'head, a casual listener, or only know Meat's work from \\"I Would Do Anything for Love\\" when you heard it on the radio back in the day, this album is for you.  It will appeal to any person who has any interest at all in Meat Loaf.  Buy this album...you won't regret it. I promise.

While quite a few of them deserve such encomium, quite a few of them do not.

He left to posterity many examples of this (Rapsodies, consolations...), but his transcription of Beethoven's colossal simphonic works are astounding. Katsaris masters this sometimes hellish pieces with an admirable command and ease. The sound he manages to produce is so dense that it's a wonder that it's achieved with only two hands, a foot and a piano. There are so many passages in this set to remark, that this review would become a speech, if I put them all here.

Bright colors, simple pictures, an easy storyline for toddlers to understand and words that lend themselves to an easy almost sing-song cadence...it was the last thing my children heard every night before they went to bed and a welcome part of their night time routine.
