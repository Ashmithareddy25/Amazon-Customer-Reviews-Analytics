B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Fun for the whole family from my 4 year old boy to 8 year old daughter.  Both my wife and I had a blast too.<br /><br />A few scary moments with the animals but overall very safe for the whole family.  Even my 2 year old watched some of it but he's a little too young for the scary moments(big animals chasing the Croods family).<br /><br />The movie is a comedy at its heart but plenty of action to keep you interested for young/old, boys/girls.<br /><br />This movie streamed well in HD without stopping or stuttering. (but this may be variable based on your internet speed!)<br /><br />Great one for movie night with your kids!
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|This is the best!!

B00498YZH8|5.0|Great movie. She talks the talk and walks the walk. No doubt about that.  Good cast great acting and great director.
B00EJYGQFG|4.0|I love the song thought it was the CD lol but that was my bad - it's a great song
B002E0JL86|5.0|Funny ang full of Wisdom. Robin Williams is hilarious. The movie itself is full of wisdom and is a wake up call to our health care system.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|probably actually three and a half stars. Great movie just a little cheesy at times. but it was fun to watch.
1250038820|5.0|I love this book,. Why, because I love New York and miss all the action and all the People, when I am away from it.  I love walking the streets of the city, taking the subway, taking the bus and walking different neighborhoods. This book fills that void.  This book shows those people and it tells a bit about each encounter or something the people said at the time of the photo.  It makes me miss the city a bit less.  It makes me feel like I'm there.  I love this book and look forward to seeing other cities through Brandon's eyes.
B005I3PAUO|5.0|anything by David baldacci is good, he could write about old shoes and I would still go for it, so don´t miss this book, its as good as it gets!
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|This game actually made basketball fun. Never could get into watching it. Just a lot of running back and forth. Not enough action and physical contact for me like football. Anyway... I wasn't into playing video games either until I got my kindle and tried them out, so this is the first time I've played a video B BALL game. Maybe the 2nd, but don't remember that one too much. So nothing to compare it to but at first it was a lil hard to control the players and shoot. Took me a minute but after you get the flow of the controls and can pass and move the players around easy on the court it's the next best thing to playing bball for real.<br /><br />GOOD<br /><br />Good graphics (for a tablet game)<br />Realistic gameplay (player and crowd reaction)<br /><br />BAD<br /><br />Hard to control until you get it down<br /><br />No online multiplayer (just bluetooth). People still use bluetooth??<br /><br />Little hard to beat teams that have better overall averages than you. So depending on what team you pick you'll probably just end up losing or winning depending on whatever overall average that team has.(I think I beat the Spurs with the Kings). If the Kings average is lower than the Spurs than I'm wrong. The game mode might fix that too. Rookie... Pro... All Star.<br /><br />But for kindle this is the best you'll get. Had to wait until this came out to even get any basketball game worth downloading on Kindle. Haven't tried NBA Jams by EA but the set up looks more like a cartoon than real gameplay.<br /><br />UPDATE JUNE 20TH 2014:<br />Love this game. Play it everyday. I went from not looking at basketball at all and thinking it was corny most of my life to betting on the Spurs in this years Final Four and winning a whole lot of money because the players and game on this thing are so life-like. They play (and look) exactly like they do in real life. Different skills that some players suck at and others don't, that match the exact players skills in real life (like speed or no speed, dunks, blocks, passing, steals). It took me a good amount of tries to beat the spurs on this game and none to 1 to beat the Heat everytime. Since the only player they really have is Lebron. Parker, Duncan and Ginobilli are hard to beat (on pro and up levels). So I figured they play in real life just like they do in this game, since the gameplay is so real, and bet on it in the Final Four. And they came through easy just like I knew they would. I used to beat the spurs a lot easier before I made some trades off my BK Nets team but after the trades they were hard to beat. So figured I could make some money off of them when they played the weaker Heat in the final four. And yep the team played on the court just like they do on this thing. The gameplay on this thing is that good.<br /><br />Best BBall app out I'm a lil addicted.no speed, dunks, blocks, passing, steals).

B002MQYOFW|1.0|VIOLENCE!  AND ALL INVOLVING CHILDREN.. Kids don't need that encouragement these days.  It's all around us.  I know I'm definitely in the minority.
B006N57PXG|5.0|WOW!What a great book, the plot only thickens from the begening.This definitly is one of the greatest books I have ever read.
0446343129|5.0|want to know why you are sick? feel badly? tired? or want to understand how sugar is really killing us and want to kick this sweet habit? read this book. You wont be sorry, it's packed full of not only history but information that can save your life. My naturopathic doctor (years ago) got me to read this and it was life changing.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|Bought this for my twin grandsons and they absolutely love it!!<br />They are almost 3 years old and they sit there so intently and watch this movie!!!
B00E9A656K|4.0|Awesome game but I get tired of the crew leader's talk carp about your car.<br />I hate the gas meter that's why I give it four stars. Other than that it is the best game ever.
1400049628|4.0|This book was very interesting.  Made me think how unprepared I am for anything.  I will not make it. Not a good thing
B006YTTVHO|5.0|My mom Marta verlezza love's this cool and funny and interesting book.  And Among the Hidden.  This is a great book and was so cool and interesting.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|Great movie. Better than the first one. I found it funny and entertaining. If you like Mr. Bean you'll love Johnny English.
B003LQMZS0|4.0|I have hung it on my son's play yard and he loves it. Probably he forgets that it is the same toy he has been playing since the last 2 months, but everyday he is exploring all its parts. Good to keep the baby interested. Only drawside is my baby's tiny hands gets stuck in the red plastic loop.
B00DY951RQ|3.0|Two corners at the bottom of the box are damaged. Otherwise I had it in a very short time and that's good

B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a very exciting book, however I wish Katniss could organize her feelings about Gale and pertaining. It frustrating not knowing the main characters feeling solidified in this book either.<br />I hope book 3 present answers pertaining to her emotions.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love your app because it helps me find the answer to all kinds of problems.I think it's a great app for everyone of all ages.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|The cleanmaster 4000 is great. It removes junk files and almost 'magically' finds space and memory. Thank you cleanmaster! You saved me from full memory! Get it! Save yourself!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|THIS APP IS GREAT IT HAS EVERYTHING in it that the old game real steel did not. You can pick a paint job for your robot and upgrade them too. Their are lots of good new robots tho pick from that are fun to use. In all it is a great game and works great on the kindle Fire H.D.
B005IVU6XM|5.0|Wow, Just wow. I started with Temple of Shadows and thought what they did on that album was insane. Then I found Aurora Consurgens and had my mind blown again... Well, I'm pretty much a functioning vegetable now.... Mind = blown.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush. Thanks Amazon for finally getting it. :-)<br />It works great! No problems at all. Except for that the fact that I'm stuck on this level. Lol
032147404X|5.0|All the tips and info found in the book are absolutely wonderful.  Gives you a tremendous heads up on things that otherwise one would have never thought about.  Easy read for everybody, although it requires for you to know the basics of your camera in order to find what Scott (the author) is talking about.
B005PK553C|5.0|This series is absolutely intriguing. I didn't think I would like it cause its not my type of shoe but I absolutely am addicted.
0552168548|5.0|This book really let you know the REAL McFly. No one truly knew what they'd been through before this book. Hearing all of their individual stories brought together by one band was amazing. In the words of Dougie Poynter, that book brought a tear to my eye and a.....well, you know.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the beautiful, touching story of 16 year old Hazel Lancaster, who is dying from lung cancer.  Hazel meets the stunningly gorgeous cancer survivor Augustus Waters at Cancer Kid Support Group.  The two of them bond over their struggles and a book that they both love.<br />Hazel does not want to get in a relationship with Augustus, though.  She knows that any day could be her last, and doesn't want to hurt Augustus by her dying.<br />This book is written in first person from Hazel's point of view.  She is kind, insightful, and wise  beyond her years.<br />The Fault in Our Stars will make you smile and laugh out loud.  You will fall in love, and you will cry in pain.  DO NOT MISS THIS NOVEL!<br />Note: Do not be deterred from reading this book if you didn't like Looking For Alaska or Paper Towns by John Green.  I didn't like either of them, but I loved An Abundance of Katherines and The Fault in Our Stars.<br />I have never cried so much while reading a book as when I read this one.  So, once you get to about 60% through, you do not want to read this in public.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love the game but would like to no if you can have neighbours other then Facebook friends? Some help would be great but love the game. Only just started playing a couple of weeks ago.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I got this app recently and I didn't look at it until this morning. I have been playing it ever since.<br /><br />***updated later**<br /><br />While the facebook bug is annoying, I am STILL playing this silly little game and having a blast. :)
0307476073|4.0|Fun read.  I've given it as a gift several times.  It's hard to believe how unprepared she is.  Her self-reliance is amazing.
B004G606K8|3.0|Definitive Dungeons and Dragons, I know. Part one of...457 or something so the characters can fill out a little and gain a little more depth, I also know. So I'm giving it an extra star on faith. But it was kind of bland high fantasy fare. Now, that may not be its fault. It's a pretty old book and the premise has been repeated so often that perhaps the original has become trite. So, I'll hold out and soldier on and expect the tale to really shine as the greater story unfolds. For a few more books, anyway.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is by far my favorite adaptation of Emma. I think Romola Garai's portrayal of Emma's intelligence and naivete is second to none, and her chemistry with Jonny Lee Miller is fantastic. All the characters are so well drawn and loveable (right down to Tamsin Greig's Miss Bates) that it makes watching it like greeting an old friend.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this adaptation highly enough.
B008JFUR10|3.0|It is not a good sign when a film spends ten minutes up front explaining its premise. The reality within which the film exists needs to emerge and be discovered. The world of the film should be revealed not be presented like a plot summary. If you like end-of-the-world movies with lots of masterful CG, this film will not disappoint. However, I found it choppy, uneven, and predictable. I also found it quirky and odd, but not in a good way. The people who worked on this film worked very, very hard to make something special. It's unfortunate that their efforts did not come together.
B008Y6YCB0|3.0|This adaptation of Emma is fairly popular, and though capturing the humor of the novel quite well, I find it falls flat in terms of character. It's so cartoonish and silly that it cheapens whatever authenticity the original story had. All it really has going for it is that is is quite possibly the most quoted Jane Austen adaptation ever.
B00E6X4GAW|4.0|Malala's  story is an anazing one and I was engrossed when I could hear Malala's voice.  Sometimes though the story was related by somone else and was dry history.  Malala's voice needed to be allowed to shine through.  Blessings to malala for what she has born and acheived.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Currently only Netflix and Chrome are supported - but works well. Was pleasantly surprised to see that iPhone and Android phones are supported.
140006922X|1.0|I expected a much more full and nuanced account of the historical Jesus. The author dismisses a lot of the Jesus tradition as just made up after the fact by his followers without trying to present any real historical evidence of that. I am not an historian, but I can appreciate when someone has a particular historical axe to grind. Neither am I religeous Christian. Just wanted some history and not personal opinion.<br /><br />Just finished this and wanted to add that it was disappointing even to the end. Aslan cites the Gospel when it serves his purpose and when the Gospels don't serve his purpose, he dismisses them as \\"made up after the fact.\\"  Aslan presents his own conclusion as accepted fact. He makes value judgements about people and motives all through the book that only reflect his own prejudices with no basis in historical documentation.<br /><br />This is basically an example of personal opinion which has the window dressing of a few historical facts.<br /><br />The only positive thing about this book for me was it made me want to read the Bible and other sources of early Christianity to learn more.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This app used to be better until they put in the ads that force you to completely exit and restart to get back to the game.  STOP IT!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|This was an exciting adventure, with a great ending. I enjoyed it very much. Denzel never disappoints in any role he takes on..
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it and the whole series. It made me laugh  and cry and think about how my life is so much different
B001CTGQBK|5.0|This movie is such a classic. Enjoyable from beginning to end, even though most of us could recite the dialogue along with the actors.
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|Would have given it 4 stars because it's a fun game...but it just stopped working.  I uninstalled and will be reinstalling shortly.<br /><br />It could use more alleys / characters but presumably those items will be added in the future.
B00280LYIC|5.0|When I started reading this, I wasn't sure what to think of it, but by the time I was half way through, I loved it!  The second I was finished, it became my favorite book, and I had to read the rest of the books in the series!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game.  I love it.  It is very challenging when you get to the higher levels.  I really enjoy it.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|A book of real life and the complex emotions involved. Honor and character and the sacrifice of being female are the same in any era
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Good Lord Almighty in Heaven - I am on the Travis Maddox train and I DO NOT want to get off!<br /><br />Okay, I have to admit, I waited WAY too long to read this. The book had so much hype around it and I always kept hearing about Travis Maddox, but I had never read it and just thought \\"Well, I'll get around to it.\\"<br /><br />I could SMACK MYSELF IN THE HEAD for waiting so long! But, luckily for me - books don't change, no matter how long you wait to read. So, I got to experience every painful, beautiful, gut wrenching and heart melting moment between Abby and Travis. BTW, I'm not trying to convince my husband to call me \\"Pigeon.\\" ;)<br /><br />If you're torn on whether to read this book or not, I always leave my reviews spoiler free but I will tell you this - I have read COUNTLESS romance novels, and this book is in my top 5. It is FANTASTICALLY written, and the characters are all so easy to relate to. Not only that, but McGuire throws you into two different worlds that are so unique and fun to learn about - fighting and gambling. If you're tired of the same hum drum stories where nothing happens but a bunch of making out and angst, well this has both of those things but so - SO - much more.<br /><br />Trust me. You'll love Abby, you'll love her crazy but devoted best friend America, you'll swoon after Travis and you'll also probably have a crush on all his brothers and maybe even his cousin. There's heartache, I won't lie about that, but in the end - you'll be satisfied.<br /><br />I give this book five HUGE stars. Amazing, amazing work. I'm telling you, get this book NOW.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Awesome Movie! Best Superman! Henry did a great job playing superman. Can't wait to watch it again with the whole family this weekend.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is fun for the whole family. I used to have this game on my phone but then I bought a Windows phone that doesn't suppose the game but now I bought a kindle fire and have reconnected with the game....I am now happy.
B008Y212PI|4.0|The first level is way to easy, but the next two get increasingly challenging. Last level was a lot more challenging and enjoyed the most. Would recommend.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent! Worth every moment of viewing. Downton Abbey is truly a Masterpiece Classic. The writers and producers of this show knew exactly what they were doing when they produced this &#34;Masterpiece&#34;.
0891419063|5.0|This is the greatest description of combat living and dying I ever read.<br />Starts of a little slow, but then it gets to the real descriptive stuff.

B00DGXGUSY|4.0|Viking Metal!!! - Not a bad song on the whole album.  Just saw them this week in concert and they translate very well to live performance.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|The fabulous fabulous Van Morrison!!!  Two great CDs with some that I hadn't heard before!  Not a single one that wasn't great.  LOVE IT.
B00BRYDKM8|3.0|I was familiar with some of the  content - but it was enjoyable. A previous book had been taken off the kindle list. I cannot remember the name - just wondered why!!
B000KIPT30|5.0|It is durable and basic design, and easy to use, affordable.  Everybody can adjust their headphone audio level according to their desire.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I have this on my kindle fire and my phone. it is simple to use, and it is customary to anyones needs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|totally addictive, but also a good conversation starter with nearly all my friends.  some levels require the online level suggestions.
B00EJYGQFG|5.0|Lady Gaga continues to wow us with her newest single, Applause, that is sure to be a club anthem for years to come.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's sort of cool, but the features haven't really materialized yet.  There's pretty much only Netflix and the Google store available, and if you aren't using a real computer (versus a tablet), you can't mirror the browser onto your TV.  I'm sure these problems will be fixed soon enough, but they aren't yet.  Also, there's no battery, so the adds are misleading when they just show people plugging it into the TV and it working....it actually needs to be plugged into an A/C adapter all the time! Kind of lame.<br /><br />That all being said....at $35 it's basically free.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Loved this book but boy did it leave me with heavy heart.  The author's writting is so superb I was transported back in time to feel the pain of the characters.
1594202273|2.0|This is an &#34;Oh, my gosh!&#34; about potential nuclear accidents that have occurred since the late 1940s due to the loose control of bombs and/or the problems with unanticipated detonation.  It discusses a lot of serious stuff using the (fuel) explosion of a Titan Missile in Arkansas as the back story.  However, most of these incidents were not close calls but just plain accidents.  A bit overblown, if you ask me.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I laughed out loud, cried, and really enjoyed this heartwarming movie.  DIdn't expect to -thought it may be cheesy and not funny so was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed. Definitely a chick flick and not sure my husband would have laughed as much as I did (or at all!).
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use this app every day & consider it one of the ones that won't get deleted when I get low on space!  Very easy to navigate &  makes checking my email very easy!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|Shows album covers inside vinyl record format, great graphics, adjustable fading/ transitioning , etc. Better random selecting than other DJ app. Works great on my Fire 2nd gen. (non-HD) and up; however it won't install on my Fire 1st gen. :( My favorite music player! Makes me realize I missed the visual of revolving vinyl and turntables (yes, I'm *that* old lol) :) Get it, it's the best; I tried several.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this story . He wrote a beautiful engaging book that had all elements of joy, sorrow , etc. I gave highly recommended this book.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|I love this movie as its main theme of inspiration (&#34;Anyone can cook&#34;) is supported by a myriad of colorful characters who go through trials and tribulations of their own maturation processes.  I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages.
0606267263|2.0|So slow.. Not an amazing read like the others.. this is the filler book with lots of walking and talking but not much more. The first few chapters are so slow its almost not worth reading them. Ive enjoyed all of the other books and have re-read them a few times but im not sure where Martins head was at here...
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I work a lot and don't have much time to spend watching movies.  Nice to find one that lives up to it's reputation.  One of my new favorites. I absolutely love this movie.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I am a huge fan of authors who care about the characters as much as the \\"story.\\" Tartt made me think about these people when I wasn't reading. I have only really ever experienced it to this depth while reading Lonesome Dove. I loved this book period.
B000007492|1.0|Middle-aged man rage.  I purchased this a few years ago for a song that I liked, and forgot about it. I found it in my trunk and listened and it's awful.  Can't stand to listen to their whining.  Don't know what possessed me back then.
0767919408|5.0|Historically accurate and enlightening, yet written in an easy and sometimes humorous narrative.<br />Valuable to high school American History teachers.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|There were a few lines that made me cringe but overall it was a really fun and good movie! Would I recommend it, yeah I would.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|I've loved this movie for a long time and am so thrilled to have it on DVD now!  The beautiful story line and the music is just fantastic.  I'm also a fan of &#34;extras&#34; and enjoy the introduction by Liza Minelli.  The trolley song is my favorite in the movie
B00CATSONE|5.0|its small book doesnt have enough details BUT it gives you  a push to do something in life and  be active.<br /><br />i recommend it if you are looking for something new in life or looking to invent something that you dont know how.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|it works perfectly. it came in the correct amount of time. I have used it many times. it was what I needed.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Needs more action,when there was action the special effects was great. I like the way the plot was rewritten as how lois Lane and Clark met.I like a movie with alot of action wich is why 4 stars.But over all not a bad movie.
B00EWCV7QS|5.0|I like this move so much. I order it from time to time to see it again.  I remember it from my younger days
B00CL0J99K|3.0|It was ok, but lacked something. I am going to watch it again to see if I was just not feeling it,
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Please make more books like this I just really  liked this book yell yeah love it love it love it
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|An awesome rendition of the familiar Star Trek tale. The casting was right on. You could tell who everyone was by looking at them
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This is a masterfully done album. Something for every taste. I think Susan could sing the phone book and it would be great. Her wonderful voice is used to the max in this one. Don't miss it.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have long appreciated John Grisham's writing skills and Sycamore Row doesn't disappoint.  Having spent my working years as a probate and estate planning paralegal, the subject matter of this book was extra appropriate even though I was never involved in probate litigation.  Fabulous read.  I finished it in two days!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|LOVED IT! Great book, beautifully written.  I couldn't put it down.  Finished it in less than 3 days!  Which for me is quite the record as I am a busy, busy person.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|These are some of our favorite DVDS, we were so glad to get them in Blue-Ray  If you like Sy Fy kind of movies these are very well done as well as have a relational story going on.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Whoever buys this and doesn't love it - isn't an NCIS fan, it's an excellent show, excellent quality. Overall good to go DVD collection.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My kids love Minecraft and Lego's, so this item makes a perfect gift for them. Minecraft is one of those unique concepts that works perfectly to the Lego universe. These two brands are perfectly suited for a partnership. The only problem is that the price is very high for some parents to justify purchasing.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Every American needs to see this documentary.  I am not a math person and have no knowledge of Economics.  After watching this film closely I know understand how our economy crashed and who caused it.  We all need to understand what happened and how to prevent it happening again.
B00005JSGK|5.0|I love John Wayne movies and this was one we had years ago and our young grandson would come and stay and this is the movie he loved. He called it elephant and monkeys. What great memories it bring back.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Great final book of the dystopian trilogy.  Margaret is able to be contemporary with futuristic themes.  The future looks bleak if we keep going in our current direction.
B0041D843M|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is serious about educating themselves on eating healthy and solving the yoga diet problems that most people are having. People need to look at eating in a new light, not as being on a diet but as a new life style. The obesity problem in this country is partly blamed on the Fast food industry and lack of self control. That may be part of the issue but it's  much bigger then lack of self control. The reasons that people back in the turn of he century and prier to it did not have a weight problems is because people walked everywhere and most people worked in their gardens to grow their own crops that were not genetically modified and sprayed with all kinds of pesticides. Their cows were not injected with growth hormones or sprayed down with chemicals to prevent flies biting the cows, because they cut the cows tails off. The growth hormones effect the hole cows and when people eat the beef you end up consuming those growth hormones that could make you gain weight, not to mention the chemicals that the cow is sprayed down with could possibly cause cancer. The dairy industry is all in favor of us drinking a couple glasses of milk every day and eating a large amount of cheese. Change is a difficult thing for most people but if you want to prevent cancer and stay fit you need to stop listening to people that are financially motivated to tell you what is healthy for you. People in the 1800's didn't exercise like mad to stay fit or just to be able to prevent their bodies from becoming obese, the fitness industry is a multi billion dollar industry as well as the diet industry, they have a huge financial interest in keeping you on the yoga diet and making you feel like a failure when you did not exercise enough or you didn't stick to your weight watchers plan. The government needs to do a better job at listening to the people and stop accepting bribes from corporations that have a financial interest. Government officials are hired to represent the people not corporations. The government needs to put an end to the unsafe practices of corporations like Monsanto and the use of growth hormones in our food. Everything we consume should be organic and natural not contaminated by all sorts of unsafe chemicals. Most people don't grow their own food anymore so it's our elected officials job to set regulations for corporations to keep our kids safe from unsafe chemicals whether it's in the milk or meat people choose to consume or the plants. The biggest problem  with weight is not the lack of exercise or self control, it's education on nutrition. The idea that you need to be on a diet or you need to join a gym to stay fit is false. Staying healthy is a life style choice not a diet. Exercise is good for you but if you eat unhealthy no amount of exercise will prevent you from getting cancer. Your genes are not the biggest factor whether you stay fit and healthy.The power is in your hands to make the right choices.

B007PVHMCG|3.0|Wow, how expensive for something that ends up to be about 5 inches by 5 inches when it is assembled.
B00EEN7CAK|5.0|Great movie, especially if you live in los angeles. It reminds me of when I was 20 and partying in LA clubs next to Paris Hilton and Linsday Lohan.<br /><br />I watched the reality show &#34;Pretty Wild&#34; when it aired years ago and was highly entertained, but what I missed from the reality show was actually getting to see the kids stealing and partying in the rich celebrities' houses. And Sofia Coppola showed us that in The Bling Ring. And it feels very real. Here's what I recommend: watch The Bling Ring, then watch Pretty Wild (on Netflix), then watch The Bling Ring again... then watch Pretty Wild again. Awesome entertainment.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Amazing, smart and well done from start to finish. Kept me thinking and on the edge of my seat. Will watch again!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The person I bought this for loved it very very much. It is a great live movie. It plays perfect.
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|It was clever but the story line just was not as interesting for me.  Didn't keep my interest for a long period of time.  But still fun for the kids but adults may want to pass.
B00640UICA|4.0|I previewed the game before letting my 7 year old have free reign.  Its a cute puzzler game, and good for killing a little bit of time.  My 7 year old enjoys playing it!

B000YJ6736|5.0|Short and true.  A beautiful book about the complexities of relationships.What happened? why  did these two young newlyweds end up in this bitter side of love? The author takes you there, to understand and wonder.
B004XISI4A|2.0|I found the book to be drawn out.  Did not enjoy reading it as much as the first book.  The book looses its intrigue.  Will not be buying the other two books that follow on Dance of Dragons.  Will rather watch the TV series Game of Thrones.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|This show might as well be called &#34;If DC did Green Arrow in the style of Assassin's Creed&#34; and I LOVE Assassin's Creed as much as I love DC, so PERFECT!!

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Best ever hands down. Wonderful graphics and you don't have to pay a lot of money to play and buy guns. The fact that I am even writing a review is a sign of how much I enjoy this game.
B003DXSXCI|5.0|This movie is quintessential Steve McQueen. This movie has arguably the best car chase scene in movie history. Fellas: don't watch this movie with your old lady, because there is no way in hell you will ever be able to match up to Steve McQueen. She WILL leave you. My best girl up and left me in search of her own McQueen. I said, &#34;baby don't leave, he's been dead for like 50 years&#34; and she replied with the slamming of the door. This movie has ruined my life. 5 stars though.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I  read this book because I want to see the film when it come to tv and I wanted to know what it was all about.  In a roundabout way it is a love story and quite well tole.

B0052RE4MQ|5.0|It such a good book! I can't wait to read the next one. It's such a cliff hanger!! I love it!
B00BEIYM42|5.0|The great Vanessa Redgrave heads an outstanding cast in this sad story of two elderly people coming to terms with death and dying.  Vanessa is wonderful as Marion, sick and dying, but determined to live her life to the fullest until the end.  She is part of a chorus of elderly people at a senior center who are preparing to enter a competition.  Her group is led by the young and enthusiastic Gemma Atherton, Elizabeth in the film.  Marion's husband Arthur, again in another fine performance by Terrence Stamp, is a bit of a curmudgeon.  Arthur sings quite well himself, but would prefer to hide his talent and instead stands sternly in the background watching Marion and the chorus.<br /><br />At home Arthur cares tenderly for Marion as we watch her slow decline.  She never gives in to her illness or gives up living as fully as she can.  The great power of this film is that we quickly come to care for Marion and Arthur.  They are good people who have been dealt a difficult hand and they play it as best they can.  At first come our tears when the inevitable happens to Marion, but then we watch with joy as Arthur learns how to resume living.  Encouraged by director Gemma, who hears him sing and recognizes his talent, Arthur joins the chorus.<br /><br />Some will say that the ending is predictable, but I didn't care.  I cheered for Arthur and was happy for him as he put his life back together after a devastating loss.  The story starts out as an \\"Unfinished Song;\\" Marion did not get a chance to be with her mates at the chorus competition.  But when Arthur is standing on stage singing his heart out, we know that this story ends with hope and courage.  Yes, death claims everyone in the end, but as Marion would say, it is how we live each day that counts -- never, never giving up.  Laughter and tears, hope and despair, life and death are all part of the \\"unfinished song\\" that is everyone's life.  See this film; you won't be disappointed.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham has become one of the world's best-selling authors of crime and suspense novels, not by creating a continuing series based on the exploits of a quirky hero-investigator (think Michael Connelly's Hieronymus \\"Harry\\" Bosch, Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski, John Sandford's Virgil Flowers) but by writing stories based on a fresh cast of characters nearly every time around. But even Grisham couldn't resist the temptation to revisit the world of Jake Brigance, the cocky young lawyer at the center of the action in Grisham's breakthrough first novel, A Time to Kill.<br /><br />Published nearly a quarter-century ago and set in the early to mid- 1980s, A Time to Kill was a sensational courtroom drama about race in the Deep South during a time of change. Jake defends a Black Vietnam veteran, Carl Lee Hailey, who executes the drug-addled rapists of his child on the steps of the courthouse in a small Mississippi town named Clanton. The Ku Klux Klan surges back into action, and the town soon is roiled by controversy and violence.<br /><br />Sycamore Row follows Jake Brigance through a trial three years after his high-profile success in the Hailey case. A reclusive old white man whom nobody in town seems to know has hanged himself on a tree on his farm and left a handwritten will leaving the bulk of his considerable estate to the Black housekeeper and caregiver who has worked for him for the past three years. The will turns up in Jake's mail a day before the old man's funeral with a note naming Jake as attorney for the estate, with explicit instructions to prevent any money going to the old man's money-grubbing family. Soon, racial tensions are reawakened, putting Jake at a disadvantage facing a jury that consists of two Blacks and 10 whites.<br /><br />Grisham rolls out his story with a sure hand, building suspense as nearly a dozen other lawyers pile onto the controversy and their investigators turn up unflattering information about both the deceased and his would-be beneficiary. The author's spare, no-nonsense prose relentlessly drives the reader forward through the unpredictable twists and turns of a tale that reflects the changing reality of life in the Deep South. Sycamore Row stands as both a worthy sequel to A Time to Kill and as a fine contribution to the literature about race in America.e beneficiary.

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|A great read. A fast paced roller coaster with a few twists thrown in. I am hooked on this series and an Anthony Ryan fan!
B00G32TD98|3.0|Better than most of this type of devil possession film.  A bit of a &#34;Exorcism&#34; knockoff, but the film script and direction managed to make it a new experience.  Worth the three or four bucks to stream from Amazon.
B0094K1K8I|1.0|Boring. No plot and took forever to get moving.  I turned it off 1/2 hour into it.  Just did not keep my interest.
B009178OQA|4.0|This is a beautifully crafted exploration of culture, business, family and food. Done in a style that reflects the thoughtful, deliberate and careful strategy of a master sushi maker and his sons, this film is like walking through a meditation. It will leave you craving sushi and rethinking your business plan.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I enjoyed her story, but anticipated that she faced lots more &#34;wild&#34; in the wild than she actually wrote about.  Still, her journey was an amazing feat, and detailing it in a book is an even more amazing feat.  It was interesting to read about something I would NEVER consider doing - EVER - and this book only confirmed my choice.  No wilderness hiking for me!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Stellar acting and superb story lines across multiple characters, each interesting in their own. Just love Michelle Dockery and her Lady Mary character. Can't wait until season 4
B003LXXEFG|4.0|The cure is one of my favorite 80's alt rock bands and this album is one of their best.  If you enjoy a sullen melodic tone that will drive you to consume copious quantities of alcohol... I mean it is quite good, even after 20+ years.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|These guys are so very talented and make classical type music a blast to hear and watch.  They have been a sensation on u-tube, but it's great to have them on DVD & CD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A western, about pirates, in space! Doesn't get much better then that.<br /><br />This is a show for anyone who loves the work of Joss whedon.  One of the best written and most creative television programs in many years.  It is a shame that it didn't make it past the first season, but this set is a fine tribute to the show.  Nathan Fillian, Summer Glau, and Adam Baldwin played unforgettable characters that help to make this such a great show.  In addition, the movie Serenity is based on this show.  It is hard to believe that its been off he air for 10 years but it still holds up as one of the finest scifi shows ever created.
B00B4804KS|4.0|I loved this movie when it came out and it is amazing that they can retro fit it with 3D.  Seems to have been a very good job.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|I gave this as a gift, only watching it once but it was alright.  In the vein of You've Got Mail and Sleepless in Seattle I guess.  Good movie for Mom's and girlfriends.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a free app in the Amazon store.  It sees each and every Wi-Fi spot, and gives you a nice graph of all the signal strengths.<br />I was surprised how many it saw in my neighborhood!  Its a good tool.  It seems to pick marginal WANs where my iPhone doesn't see them - I wonder why.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|It is not a movie that I would have paid to see at the movies.  It definitely wasn't a typical Will Smith action movie, but I don't think it should have been.  It was more of a story about the struggles of the son and his relationship with his father.  I would watch it again.
0375869026|5.0|loved this book about kindness. also it helped me to put my own problems with appearance into perspective. a must read for everyone!
B00C68JXAW|4.0|Sean Connery is still the best Bond around. This together with David Niven's Casino Royale together with my Bond 50' completes my Bond Collection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I totally love this game, it is so addicting!  It is now on every phone in my house, my whole family is hooked.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I truly loved this game and can not wait til more levels come out...I would recommend it to all my friends..oh maybe not they have no patience
B00BY7NK96|4.0|The book provides inspiration to women as they seek to find their way through to leadership roles. Examples, strategies and helpful reflection come thick and fast from Chery Sandberg. While recognising that systemic and structural dynamics hold women back, the book's tendency to put the pressure to succeed on women's shoulders alone may, in the longer term, lead many women to feel dispirited and disappointed. Changing the conversation may need more than the will of a ' few good women'.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book just gets better and better. Only 4 stars because the author is repetitious. Other than that it is great
B0019IB0II|5.0|Very informative. It helped me understand what and how even the TIA my husband had was affection his speech and actions. With understand come the absents of fear. We both benefited from the books descriptions of what goes on inside the brain. I would recommend this to others who have had a loved one go through this.
1400052181|5.0|I actually got this for my sister and she couldn't put it down.I don't know why I need more words I said it was great
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this book to prepare for the movie with Harrison Ford.  It has an interesting plot and does not at all feel like a tween book.  I like the philosophical questions it raises, of which there are many.  Happy reading!
B004JK61K0|4.0|So far. So good have not had long so no fifth star. But so far it is working just fine.
0142403873|5.0|A very clever and witty book with fun illustrations.  This book continues to be one of my 4 year old's favorite bedtime stories.
B003B02O14|5.0|Thoroughly Grisham ! Fast read and<br />Intriguing enough to make you read on to find the conclusion --not a book that<br />You can put down and come back to!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever  try the minecraft demo version of minecraft first just to be shore and if you like I suggest you buy minecraft if not just use the worst version of minecraft ever made no change at all well what ever you think is what matters
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I have read several of her books and I love Liane Moriarty's writing style; she's so relate-able. and she tells a very compelling story!
0061015725|5.0|Great Read. Just kept me thrilled all the way to the end. Then makes you wonder just what are people cooking up in those labs out there an just how much time do we have left before the genius morons finally unleash what can not be put back in the bottle?
B000003TAW|5.0|Good music, catchy lyrics, sweet CD.  Originally recommended by my nephew, it quickly won over my brother and myself.  I would recommend its purchase.
B004LUS390|5.0|Ever since I got my kindle I have been downloading different sketch books and drawing apps, but this one is the only one I've been satisfied with. It literally has everything I was looking for in  drawing app, plus a little more. It includes layers! I am constantly on this app, and everyone is impressed by the quality in this app.
0316322407|5.0|This book is beautifully written, very personal and from the heart.  The young author is also able to convey the history with its injustices of her land to give context to the present situation there.  I believe this is an important book and hope high school students, young adults, and anyone who cares about justice will read it.
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Beautiful graphics and nice music. Made you think for sure, good thing because there are no hints...way to go echo lake can't wait to play more of these. Keep them coming.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I really loved this movie. When I first put it I I had no idea it was basically a love story it's one of my favorites now.
B006L9B6TI|4.0|It is amazing the tjings i have been taking for granted. The book has helped me have a better outlook on my sutuations and has taught me how to bring a more positive outcome to my goals.
B00D3J2QKW|3.0|Great idea and definitely works but the book itself is too repetitive. I think once you understand The One Thing principle you can simply skim through the rest because it's often the same sentences rephrased over and over again.
B001BANK32|5.0|I'm re-reading it...and Stephen King never disappoints.  Refreshing myself to read Doctor Sleep!  The movie is good too, but you must read the book first since they are different.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|I love this bluray. The band sounds fantastic and the crystal clear picture is great too. Wish there had been even more extra songs. They put on a great show. I really enjoyed it.
B005EVVPUE|5.0|This is one of those DVDs that you never get tired of watching. It is a historic concert and makes you wonder what Queen might have been had Mercury lived on.
B00F1W1SS0|4.0|Its a 5 star concert and band BUT the sound was horrible on my blu ray copy. Theres a loud popping noise throughout. Also the sound  is mixed way to loud. This ruined my viewing experience. But its a great set list and looks great. Whens its not popping it sounds good too. Im having to return my copy. The bonus features also had some popping noise too.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|The story is fascinating and the cinematography should win an Academy Award!!  A totally entertaining film...what all films should be.  Just great!
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|Love Gaga's voice normally.  But, there isn't but a few songs where her voice hasn't been digitally altered in some way.  Disappointed.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Exciting.  Intriguing.  Compassionate.  One of his best.<br /><br />The continuation of Jake's life in the complex times of the 80's gives us an insight into a different time and place that really is not that far in the past.<br /><br />Great read.
B00005K3NR|5.0|What can I say but this is a classic.  I bought this to watch before I went to see the Musical Carrie.  Needed a refresher because it has been too many years since I last saw it. Musical was done by Ray of Light Theater in San Fransisco and was an awesome presentation by the way!
0553801473|3.0|This story line could have been wrapped up a lot quicker than it has been.  I'm actually starting to find it tedious to read it.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I've just started watching this show recently, and this surpassed all my expectations, by far! From script to execution, this show delivers a quality punch and is one of the best shows I've seen in some time. Too bad it was yet another victim of the dreaded Friday night timeslot, and another botched decision by Fox to cancel one of the best shows in recent memory (Firefly, etc.).<br /><br />This show takes James Cameron's 1980s Terminator mythos and raises everything up a notch. This is a direct sequel to 1991's Terminator 2 (the other movies are conveniently bypassed). Some of the ethical quandaries in this show are very thought-provoking. For instance, is it 100% inevitable that mankind will eventually create a machine that is capable of creating even better machines? Is it ethical for mankind to forbid this? Does that make machines nothing but a slave-race?<br /><br />In short, the Sarah Connor Chronicles presents ethical dilemmas that would make Trekkers proud. Match this with lots of action and a very well-assembled cast, and you have an excellent show that was cut way before its time.
B00BB8VSXS|5.0|Excellent movie. Great streaming! We enjoyed this movie with the family.<br /><br />We saw this movie from xbox  Amazon app and it worked very well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|love it, love it, love it!!!  This is the best written and well acted mini-series in the history of mini-series.  I became obsessed with it and can't wait for Season 4.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Finally Iron Man is unmaksed a little, and it makes for a fantastic movie. I admit that I sometimes enjoy action movies just for action, but Iron Man 3 has that stronger story line that makes it something more than just an action movie. It doesn't dissapoint for those of us who want to see everything blow up, but this movie has fantastic cohesion and great character development. Well done!
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Lady Gaga came out with a new album and rocked it!! ...well if you're not impressed I just ask you give it a second chance. Initially to me, the sound on this album was very unexpected and I wasn't sure about it. I thought maybe she had gone too far \\"out there\\".. But lo and behold I got sucked back in to the Gaga-ism, I love this record very much. It is so different and new and edgy. Yes its not chewing gum bubble pop music but it is still fun. Maybe more grown up or a little evolved- lets say.<br /><br />If you don't love it then I swear you didn't listen to it enough.<br /><br />My husband and I are both fans. His favorite song is G.U.Y and my favorite is Swine. Not sure what that says about us but it's probably just a coincidence.
B00G6RK0VU|5.0|Antoine wrote it so well, he actually makes you think it really happened!  It is such a beloved story.  If you read it, you made a good choice.
B00FQPHOPI|2.0|I was all for a superman reboot with more action and fighting scenes. Didn't expect the movie to be chalk<br />full of CGI. They tried to incorporate so much into this film, that it could have easily turned into a 10 episode<br />TV series. The scenes felt rushed and the supporting actors were dry and nearly emotionless.<br /><br />I enjoyed the flashbacks into Clark's childhood and the beginning of the movie when Clark worked on a fishing vessel. The bar scene also added some realism. It would have been more realistic if Clark would just take out the truckers tires and damage the engine. The truck dangling in the air was a bit much.<br /><br />It would have been more authentic ( real ) to see Clark's father pass away due to natural causes; instead of a boring and predicable scene full of CGI.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Gave it only for stars because there are glitches where we spend souls.  It won't let me attack the largest one in the sword category
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great fun and fun on any day of the week. Candy Crush Saga is fun, fun as candy be sweet to play.
0061122416|5.0|Excellent story, have read it many times.  It is also a great book to give as a gift to others!
B0091W7K6K|2.0|not like a Dirty Harry moviedidn't have the same bite,not enough action and the pot was weak.the character bullet was lackluster
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|Love this app. My kids are learningwhile they think they are just having fun. I was worried about it for my 10 year old gifted son but bought it since he is the oldest of 5. He loved it!! It's worth the price!! Buy it!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed this story as much as his other novels. I'm sure this too will be turned into a movie.
0316322407|5.0|This should be required reading in schools, and for anybody aspiring to become a teacher.<br /><br />This young woman makes me feel good about our future.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I usually don't read these types of books, but I am so glad I read this! I was pretty confused in the first few chapters due to the people changing, but once I got into it- that is all I could think about. It is so profound to think of what secrets we have & what secrets others have. I am still pondering what I would do if I found out my husband had killed someone. Could I move on as if I didn't know that information? Could I make him turn himself in, or could I turn him in? The questions raised in the book really do make you think deeply about relationships and the depths of them as well as making you realize that sometimes fate happens & the choices we make are for a reason. Enjoy what you have while you can. This is such a great book!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Such a great movie, I can watch it over and over again. Its great to watch with the whole family.
1400032717|5.0|Empathetic insight into autism through a story line which follows an autistic 15 year old \\"detective\\" to solve the \\"mystery of  who killed the Wellington poodle (\\"not the small poodles who have hairstyles but a big poodle,\\" Christopher John Francis Boone informs us.) He discovers the dog \\"leaking blood\\" on Mrs. Shear's  front lawn and the story sets out from there.<br /><br />At heart, mysteries are the story of something gone terribly wrong, but righted by by someone with the courage or complusion to restore the world to right order. The \\"detective's\\" unbearable confusion at being lied to by adults dealing with their own desperately disorderly personal world leads him to take a dangerous journey in which he attempts to put his world right through the use of the same mathmatic intelligence that ultimately distances him from humans who are themselves only human.<br /><br />Mark Hadon's graceful writing so puts the reader into the point of view of the autistic detective that by the time the book ended, I felt too into the experience of autism and so overwhelmed by an overload of stimuluous that I was quite anxious to leave Christopher John Francis Boone's world.(and quite gratful that I could!)<br /><br />Nothing I have ever read made me understand how little I understand about autism and the children and families for whom autism is a world from which there is never any escape.<br /><br />Although I must say that afterwards, when I took a second look at the book's orange cover, I discovered that I too had an irresistable urge to turn the dead poodle right side up! And I wanted to comfort Christopher John Francis Boone but I knew enought not to because he finds so much stimuluous unbearable and he screames when people touch him.<br /><br />Maybe just a simple high-five and some respect would do?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I actually like playing this version better than on my laptop. It loads faster. However, I can't get past Level 70, WTH??!?!?
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|It was a good movie to watch.  So sad to think that this really happened.  So sad that so many had died.  I'm glad that I saw it.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|This is as great as any Dexter season. Every episode and every season is great, including season 8. I will miss Dexter.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I read the book and gave myself a break before watching this movie.  I think the movie didn't do the book any justice.  You're better off just reading the book or just watch the movie.  You can't do both.  If you want to, then watch the movie first.  Each actor/actress owned their character on screen, but the chemistry with each other was very lacking.  I'm not just talking about the main characters, but even supporting actors with the main... the chemistry was just lacking.  I don't have any particular interest in watching this movie again.
B0012ELMEG|5.0|This is a must have disc.  A quintessential work from the late 70's; a perfect mix of rock and punk.  Don't hesitate!!
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Good action movie.  Jeremy Renner is a great actor for action movies.  I like the Hansel/Gretel story line with a twist.  What happens when they grow up?  This movie will tell you.  This movie isn't meant to be though provoking.  This is just an movie that is meant to entertain, much like Van Helsing was meant to entertain us.  Not the best action movie EVER, but I don't think it was a waste of my time either.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A compelling story. No actors…just real people. Great (original) music played and sung by the artist. Don;t miss this one. One of the best films of the past decade.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great movie adaption. This is the 3 rd time we watched it. We wanted to watch it before we saw Thor 2
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is a wonderful story about friendship between two men. That the film is based on a true story, makes it all the more compelling. It feels like you are watching two lives in real time, rather than watching a movie. One of my top films of the decade.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|There are plenty of reviews here about the movie itself, especially considering the fact that they started getting posted a day or so after the movie came out, so I'm going to review the blu-ray. I got this at Target, a special Target exclusive offer. And I can say without a doubt that it was so worth it!! The special features are well worth it. It comes with a sample of the book that came out that documented the movie with behind the scenes pics. The special features are amazing!! There are plenty of behind the scenes featurettes that show certain scenes cut down. Best of all on the special features extra blu-ray disc from Target is the classic Zack Snyder commentary. It's just like the commentary from Watchmen with tons of behind the scenes stuff from cast and crew. I thought all of that on the extra disc was enough, but I put in the movie disc and there's EVEN MORE that I haven't had the chance to watch yet. This movie was fantastic, and if you want to know more back story of Krypton, and just see all of the ins and outs of how they shot the movie, you should absolutely get this!!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|i read this all the way through thinking it would get better and my over all experece was &#34;MEH&#34;, i wont sit here and say i hated it but im not going to say that i lived it......if i book can keep my attation but this one didnt do that all that often for my liking
B0054W4JQK|4.0|If you want to be kept guessing, then this is a good book to read. It was an enjoyable mystery and had a few good twists woven through it. Daily amnesia is a great story line and it has been really cleverly portrayed in this book. I'd recommend it!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|if you love the movie. Then you would love love love the book. It goes greater into detailshan the movie
1932100660|5.0|This information is provided by a top nutritionist with unquestionably high references and standing in the scientific community. I'd always thought I was a &#34;healthy eater&#34; but this book turned me into a vegan overnight six years ago. No regrets, and no illness!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham did it again; highly entertaining! two thumbs up; maybe this one will get made into a movie since he is long overdue.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Love this series. It's one of those that you will have a tough time putting down. The mix of fiction & history is addictive.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|this is an awesome app, all it needs is it to be longer and more challenging, other than that, one of the best apps

B009AMANH4|5.0|Brilliant acting by all those involved, vivid and rich atmosphere. Hits the sense of time and place perfectly. A joy to watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVE this series.  Was a wonderful way to watch and catch-up online while I was in the hospital for a week.
B00CEF014E|5.0|The suspenseful plot of this book is evocative of the classic movie \\"Gaslight\\". Is Dana really crazy, or is someone trying to make her, and everyone around her, THINK that she is. If it's all a conspiracy, then WHY are they plotting against her?<br /><br />Dana has every reason to doubt herself, yet she has to find the inner strength and resources to persevere, in order to defend herself and discover the ultimate truth.<br /><br />This book will keep you guessing till the very end, as the plot twists and turns like a snake. You're going to want to keep the lights on for this one.
B000002KGT|5.0|This is classic Fleetwood Mac, the FM of my college days, strong harmonies, great instrumental use by talented professionals, strong intriguing lyrics.... Won't find music like this much today.... sigh
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Arrived ahead of schedule and was in perfect condition. I have watched it 2 times already. It is quickly becoming one of my favorite all time dvd's.

B007SGM084|5.0|This was a nerve racking, hot intense story! You cannot help not be interested & fall into character with Anastasia & Christian. My only wish is that this is not the end. Very well written with the most detail oriented story.
B007FLHW3K|4.0|Awesome product.  It is really bright, very visible, and the patterns are fun.  Though it doesn't replace a front light, I think it definitely gets people's attention.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Ethereal is the only way to describe this album.  It takes me to a beautiful place. Something I will listen to over and over.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Good story, good characters, and well written. Not much more you can ask for in a light mystery novel such as this.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|I've followed HONY on Facebook for a long, long time. Glad to have Brandon's pictures is a book AND  on my iPad!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|A great book with an interesting premise - I was drawn in almost immediately. There's also enough hinted at that there is plenty to explore in future books.
B005PK1G76|4.0|Works well- would be better if it closed over the top. Sometimes I would like to place my phone and wallet there and be able to close it. Like the cup holders.
B007HEOTHC|5.0|If you like to dabble in older movies, you won't be let down with this one. In my opinion this is the best of the late Billy Wilder's films. Just watch it. It's rating is through the roof for a reason.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|Bought it for my niece. She loves it! Keeps her attention the entire time. She dances with happy feet now!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|A great read that makes a lot of valid points.  All men should read this - especially men in the industry.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This movie is totally kick ass! This movie is one of the best movies period! Everyone should for sure get this movie for your collection!
B00BWQW73E|4.0|Really insightful book about Amazon's creation and specially about Jeff's vision of building a company aiming the customer. Lot's of successes cost lot's of failures that's a part of the process that not so many afford to trail.
B008JFUR10|3.0|We had a hard time receiving it in the order. Once we were able to fix the problem and we have been happy with it ever since.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|really a good movie Natalie Wood is outstanding actress so very sad she died so young like to have her do more acting
B00APACSJG|5.0|Cryoburn was as usual well written with enought twist and turns with in the various  plots to keep you interested with a liberal sprinkling of humor that Ms. Bujould does so well. A highly enjoyable read. I have read and reread all of the Miles Vorkosigan series. I have really enjoyed them and  eagerly await her next book.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|this movie stayed very close to the book and was very interesting kept you watching for all the details really like Nichols Sparks books

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|There are several of these types of games available. It's fun to get on every day and add to your collections. I like the content of this better than any of the others. It either seems easier to collect things or I am getting better at it.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Like the occasional chick flick, Bossypants was a refreshing read. Tina Fey's honesty and self-deprecating inner dialog are relatable and humorous. I might not be smarter after reading this, but I do have a sense of calm... Like someone gets me. Pretty sure Tina and I will be lunching together when Amy Pohler is unavailable.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|[[VIDEOID:moA8VCKQNQRR2F]]Comparing the Withings Pulse against other wearable health gadgets I own was easy to do.  While the basics are the same they all have certain features that make them selling points for different individuals.  The Pulse is a strong contender for someone that has normal activity and wants to add features like sleep pattern tracking and resting heart rate monitoring.<br /><br />The application (for iOS and Android) uses Bluetooth to sync the device.  I ran the device many days without doing a synchronization to see if I lost any data and none seemed to be missing.  They are always doing app updates for new features and bug fixes. Once you sync the data to the app it is also pushed to the web for viewing there.  You can set goals and view trends.  For sleep patterns the web interface was better.  For simple heart and activity, the mobile and web interface are fine.<br /><br />The clip for the device is sturdy but I worry long-term about the rubber gasket that holds the Pulse in place.  Over time I can see the edges cracking or tearing.  I wear the Pulse inside a pocket for protection as I discuss in the video.  The backing seems sturdy and fits snug on pockets and clothes.<br /><br />The interface is easy to use on the Pulse itself.  A small power/screen switch button on the top, a charger port on the bottom and the heart sensor on the back.  Clicking the power button changes the screen for information or function.  It was easy to see the steps taken, estimated calories burned and distance climbed/walked.  The app attempts to know when you had more physical activity and highlights it.<br /><br />Sleep mode, either wearing the clip or the included soft velcro wrist band, was simple to activate when going to bed and deactivate when waking.  That is also the time to take your resting heart rate.  Once the data from sleep syncs you can see how long it took you to fall asleep, deep sleep times, awake times and general restlessness.  I learned some trends over time and actually solved a sleep riddle.<br /><br />Battery life was not the time they state in my month long test.  I actually received about 7 days max. I do check it a couple times a day but nothing heavy. I am not sure if activity has anything to do with it but I noticed shorter battery when I had weeks with heavy activity trends.<br /><br />You can choose to use the add-on apps and products to further strengthen the value of the Pulse.  I still wear it daily and plan to keep doing so!rends over time and actually solved a sleep riddle.<br /><br />Battery life was not the time they state in my month long test.

B000RLH2VM|5.0|Well Acted; exciting plot that moves quickly; keeps you on edge. Superb acting by Rober De Niro. Highly recommended to all adult audiences (PG 13)

B00985E3UG|5.0|Exceptionally well researched from immpeccable sources deep in the industry. This is primarily a fascinating account of how processed foods evolved into what they are today. It also includes some very interesting information on the neuroscience of why these foods are so rewarding.  I believe the author might be a tad generous in choosing to &#34;blame&#34; our reliance on processed foods as a cultural/behavioral shift rather than a physical addiction to these foods even though the science in this book clearly makes a strong case for addiction.<br />Having read Michael Pollan and Mark Bittman, the overall framework of this book will not surprise you if you've read these authors. However, Moss' account provides a deep understanding of how processed foods are formulated and thus, why they currently are (and will continue to be) so very unhealthy. It is so well researched that it stands as a must read for anyone who cares about food.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This movie was touted to me by my friends as only being so-so and I should really just be expecting action only. I have to say, I think they were wrong. I felt like the characters developed well and that the action was great.<br /><br />I enjoyed the roles that were played, I don't think they were over done yet delving deeper into characters back stories wouldn't be a bad idea in later movies.<br /><br />If you are a Sci-Fi fan you'll love this movie.<br /><br />Now we need Robo-Jocks' re-made
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Compelling performance by Denzel Washington.  Having worked with alcoholics, I appreciated how he portrayed the downward spiral of one who lets their addictions get the best of them.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites.  I love historical fiction with real heroes!  &#34;The righteous are bold as a lion, but the wicked flee when no one is pursuing&#34;!  Surely, Father O'Flaherty is bold and daring and totally unnerves his evil enemy  Has cliff hanger suspense, a wonderful, surprise ending,
B005PK57NU|5.0|Extremely well-written with plenty of interesting cases while maintaining a very intriguing and compelling internal storyline. One of the best TV dramas that I've watched.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is fantastic app. It makkes every thing easy for me. I bought two one for me and one for my friend.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I'm in love with this app. It's really  easy to use. Since I haft to wake up really early in the morning it's  perfect. Nicole Long  is OUT.  :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I loved this book it was sad but heart warming at the same time.it was a book that made you think more about somethings you probably don't usually think about. It opens new parts of your mind.
B00BHMF578|5.0|If one lived during the period of the Iranian hostage crisis, the film footage portrayed the period in a way that stirred the memories of the time.  Certainly the details of the movie were not exact to the actual occurences, but hey, it's a movie.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I've always loved games like this and I love how you're actually able to play the game without spending money (unlike some other games I've played). Overall, it's a really great game and I'm glad I found it.Pp
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King reminds us how he is the greatest storyteller of his generation. The details in Doctor Sleep make you feel like you are actually there. Bravo, Mr. King, and thank you for reintroducing us to Dan Torrance.
B000SVZIR6|5.0|With out a doubt it's the best I Have seen since The King and I the musical and it's better than that Chow Yun Fat and Jodie Foster bring drama and emotion to the movie screen in bringing Anna Leonoans diary to life.
B009HEMW4W|3.0|Great Flix but I hate the download format which requires me to cloud store and re-download each time I wish to re-watch. It's a waist of my DATA allowance.
B00GLMNIMI|5.0|This show is so smartly written and well acted. I can't believe it's on CBS. You can watch some episodes for free there, but they take them down after a while.  I like to have these episodes saved so I can watch them again later. Every episode has a different case, but the underlying backstory is the same.  It makes it more rewarding for you to watch from episode to episode.  You can see character development.  The dialogue is sharp!  I like the observations and subtly in the dialogue.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Love It as I do all Star Treks. Not the original by far but this altered time line remake has it's own greatness especialy in effects. With time and good producers I think it has a future.
0345803485|3.0|b/c the book was not what I expected. It was in great condition and I am was happy with how fast it came to me. But the book it's self is not what is made out to be
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Good read. Not Rollins' best work but after Map of Bones who could do better. Get it, read it, ejoy it, as I did.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy to set up, great integration with Hulu + and Netflix on both iOS and Android devices. I really like it. The only issue is sometimes choppy video playback, but that may be a bandwidth issue on my network.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This follow up takes the lead and holds to the theam of twisting the timeline of the original. No con here, get it and love it too.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|Great popcorn flick, good action, some cheesy lines, the dynamic between Channing Tateum and Jaime Fox excellent and believable.  Overall worth your money.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|Have always loved the boks and I have to admit the movie kept cruise in character. I'd probably give this movie a 4.5 if I didn't dislike Tom Cruise so much although I have to give it up to him for this performance. I could almost buy him as the 6 foot plus Jack reacher.
B008XG1X18|5.0|AWESOME APP. Works great. I can get lost in this app for hours!!! Great Awesome Fun Addictive!! Get lots of great stuff off Pinterest!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The built in PDF reader does not work well when the Kindle is on the side (landscape).  The built in always fits the width and never the height.  You can zoom in but not out to fit the height.  I often use it to view PowerPoint presentations.  This PDF reader works properly allowing proper display in any orientation.  It also deals with folders so you can organize files.  In all the default reader every thing must be in the document route folder.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works just as good as on my laptop or my android smart phone....no complaints with the app or facebook. Great
B009C7JS14|5.0|This is a beautiful app. Very easy to use with up to date accurate weather information.  Used in conjunction with my alarm clock app, both are wonderful.
B005GSVFBE|5.0|I got this because of my adoration of the film to begin with, so I'm TOTALLY biased. But since I love it, and know it well, and since I just built a 3D rig...and because I learned that they actually took all the original models, textures and lighting and re-rendered the whole thing in 3D, I figured it would be a good baseline standard for tuning my system. WOW!<br /><br />The packaging is what I expected, I'm not really into all the fancy collectible stuff anyways. The disks were in perfect shape...What the heck is the thing with the industry calling the version you can install on a device a &#34;Digital Copy&#34;? Is this as opposed to the Analog version on my DVD?!? But I digress...this film lends itself to 3D nicely, especially once they get outside of the house. I don't know that Kids will really appreciate the 3D, but if you are a big kid, as I am, you will love this film all over again.
B00821OX98|3.0|It is okay so far.  Good Cast, and the story is progressing.  I might have given it higher ratings if I had gotten further along in the series.  (Only on episode 4) And it is still a little slow.
B0053TMP24|5.0|ndndndndnnndndmdndnndndn hdhjjdndndnkdndnjzjndndn jdjkdndndndnn+d. dndjjdjjjdjddndn ndndndndnnndndmdndnndndn the same time's a good day too bad I don't want you to YouTube and the table of a sudden rip rail line is right on record of just a little while you can see it on your own a little while you can see iiiiiri
B002CIMKHO|2.0|The story was boringly predictable.  The acting seemed stiff, not natural, both from Eastwood to the other characters. Based upon the ratings, I was hoping for a better development of characters and the acting to be better.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Disappointed with the ending but overall a great book. The first two books were definitely more compelling than the last.
B00CE0BJQ8|5.0|So amazing! Easily my new favorite cd. I bought the cd for one sing and fell in love with every single one. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes good music.
0805047905|5.0|My baby loves this book! The pictures are bright and bold and retain my baby's attention. The size of the book is perfect for her and she enjoys turning its pages while I'm reading it to her.. The length of the book is just about right too so it's neither  very short nor gets boring for the baby. We love this book!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Work great with my Samsung phone,I air play with my phone and other device as well I like that Raj
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|After first hearing the first single, APPLAUSE,  I could NOT wait for the album to be released. Then after hearing the snippets and later releases of the songs, I knew I had to have it. While I am not a huge fan of rap, I am actually enjoying \\"Drugs and Jewels.\\" DOPE is another song (ballad) that I think many people can relate to in many ways. DO WHAT YOU WANT with R. Kelly has had me hooked from the first time I heard it.<br /><br />IN MY OPINION----let me stress OPINION----- You do hear elements of some of her earlier songs from THE FAME, and that is perfectly ok by me. She has said in the past that she doesn't care about charts. It's the music. Sure, some will bash this album, mainly in part of being Anti-Gaga. If you are a true lover of music, and enjoy seeing one evolve, then this is one to have.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was ready to be disappointed after reading some of the other reviews! Thankfully, I never let any one else's opinions stop me from reading anything, and this was one of those times I was glad I didn't listen. Yes, it was different from the first two in the way it was written, but that's not a bad thing. I liked the first and second books, but always felt like there was just something lacking, as if they were just a little bit flat at times. Not this one. I thought the ending fit not only with the storyline, but also with the characters' personalities. I will not post spoilers, so I will not say anything else, but this one was my favorite in the series.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I absolutely love this show!!!  I missed a couple of episodes last year and before I knew it I was so far behind and just couldn't find the time to catch up.  Thanks to my Amazon Prime account I'm able to watch an episode during my lunch break each day and I'm almost all caught up.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really like the Divergent book. I loved getting to know the characters and falling in love with Tris and Four. The second book was definitely more action and I liked that one as well.  Was so excited to finally get Allegiant. Thought it was great! Loving catching up with characters, loved when they got to leave the factions and ventured out in the compound and to the fringe. Absolutely 100% hated the ending of the book! While I'm not always for the happy ending, in this case, there was so much loss and death already that Tris and Tobias deserved to end up together with everything they had been through. She was a tough cookie, there is no way that she would've just allowed herself to get taken out like that, especially by him! So, so, so disappointed!
B005LAIII0|5.0|It was clear and a pleasure to watch the movie! It was almost like being at the movies!! Watch it on Blu-ray ;-)
B009KCUX3S|4.0|A solid entry into the series. I love how they take the boring side out of language based literature. There are a lot of examples, and the instruction tends to be project based. It's a  decent fundamentals exploration.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|It's a great show. The quality of the picture was excellent. I enjoy the excitement and drama of the series.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|Good storyline, not for everyone, had some junk, nudity, vulgarity it didn't need to have. I don't know why<br />there has to be crude language in every show anymore.
B00EI2Y4MQ|2.0|****EDITED REVIEW****<br /><br />After playing with it some more, I realize there is another GLARING error - no clear button. This makes it very difficult to stop one equation and begin another. As a result, I reduced the stars to 2.<br /><br />******The original review follows here*******<br /><br />As a basic four function calculator, this one is rather good. It does follow the order of operations, even when the equation has the operations in a different order. I also like the fact it will multiply numbers next to parentheses. It recognizes (8)9 = 72 when some apps see this as an error without the multiplication key.<br /><br />You are also able to edit previously computed problems. Using the arrow keys and the BS (back space key, but rather poorly named) key, you can change one problem and have the app recalculate it. The results will be on the next line.<br />The only problem with this scrolling is that you can't see the original problem. For example,<br />5 x 4 =<br />-------------new screen<br />20<br />5 x 3 =<br />15<br />Displays on the calculator correctly AS LONG AS you use the up arrow to see the original 5 x 4. Otherwise, you only see the answer from the last version. This may not help if you are comparing receipts or needing to check the differences of the problems. It does, however, store the equations and solutions so that you can use the up arrow to see them.<br /><br />The 00 button seems redundant since, if you are computing money amounts, you don't need to input the 00 after the decimal point and pressing the 0 key twice is not much more hassle than pressing the 00 key once, if you happen to have a number with two 0's next to each other in them.<br /><br />There is a vibration feature, but I don't use it since I'm on a Kindle Fire. I'm also not sure why a calculator needs a vibration feature.<br /><br />My biggest problems with this app, though, are the TAX buttons. TAX - seems to be calculating 4.78% of the amount you have and deducting that from the original. TAX+ seems to calculate 5% of your number and add that to the original. I did not see any way to modify the % used for tax. This means two of the buttons are useless. Given that there are only four functions + TAX buttons, this is greatly reducing the usefulness of this calculator.<br /><br />So that everyone is aware, although the screen shots are displaying keys in Chinese, the buttons for TAX are in English on the app. There are some rather poor spelling errors throughout. However, I'm not using this for spell check, so I didn't reduce the app's stars for this.<br /><br />Overall, a decent 4 function calculator with very few permissions (yay!) but buttons and features that are not useful. If you have no other 4 function calculator, this works, but otherwise, no need to add it to a phone or tablet.

B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I started watching The Walling Dead during the 3rd season so I had to catch up to know what was going on. I totally enjoyed the first season , meeting the original characters and finding out how &#34;it&#34; all began.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|So i first saw this game on my dads phone which he randomly downloaded, so when we were at a store, i stayed in the car to play it. IT BLEW MY MIND!!! i started off just doing the really easy level at the bottom of the map screen. but as soon as i got used to it more, i went on to some harder ones and i did great but i also noticed the amazing models for the white stag and so on.the main reason for this comment is how amazing this game is. you can start getting better and moving along while also recieving enough money to keep up with the pace.long story short, best hunting game ever!my only regret about the game would have to be the energy system. if that wasnt there, you could spend hours on end playing this game.except for that, once again, best hunting game ever!<br />p.s. there was a comment in which a guy said he wishes there was a stampede mode and there sort of is! if you go down to the easy level i talked about, and play it a few times, it will eventually get a stampede of deer coming.unfortunately your goal is to only kill three but you win some you lose some right?
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This is a Great show really liked it I would recommend this to young kids Jenna is one if my favorite characters
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Nice to have to refer to when you need it.  You don't need to carry a Bible to church you can have it on your device.  It is nice for looking things up anywhere.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great examples that truly explained his concepts. I loved the style of the book and give it a five star rating.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|This is Gregory's masterpiece and his finest outing to date. One for the ages. Painted on  Canvas, Real Good Hands, On My way To Harlem. Need I go on? The folks at the Motema label hit this one way out of the park. With its release, Gregory becomes immediate heir apparent and the best male jazz vocalist to come along in 30 years.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga …..<br /><br />This is a fun, challenging game!  Keeps a person guessing…. Each new screen has a surprise.
B003D5X3VM|4.0|A brilliant debut that signaled the coming of one of the greatest vocal Jazz/Soul artists of our generation. His 1960 What! is a revelation, with musical and political ties to Marvin Gaye, Gil Scott-Heron and Curtis Mayfield. Guy's an amzing vocalist with a cooking band that knows its way around a melody and a lyric. Doesn't get much better than this.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Attached to my Peg Perego Si stroller for some extra storage.  I like to have my cell phone and a drink with in reach while buzzing around town.  Fits nicely on the bars with the adjustable velcro straps.  The organizer is compact and foldable to stay out of the way when I fold the stroller for storage.  Nice to have some extra space without having to use my giant &#34;mall&#34; stroller all the time.
B00CKOZ8QA|4.0|GREAT FOLLOW UP:<br /><br />A great followup to Be Good, his masterwork to date,  Liquid Spirit, Free, I Fall in Love too Easily and the remake of Ramsey Lewis  In Crowd is worth the price of admission. Could have been even better with a bit of judicious editing. Seems like there's a little too much filler here, but once the CD gets rolling and he hits his stride with charts like Brown Grass, one is instantly reminded he's the best of the best.
B005LAJ1H2|4.0|very interesting to see how things were back in the day. love steve buscemi character and his interactions with the others gangsters.
1401938906|5.0|This is the best one of them all.  I laugh every time something is manifested for me through my thoughts.
B005HMHPGI|5.0|This was a perfect gift.  My old VHS tape finally broke due to use and this one was in perfect condition when I received it.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Not what I expected was was very hard to understand what was going on. I didn't like the ending. Not my kind of book.
0060899190|3.0|Interesting post cards.  Some of the content is disturbing.  Not a book you want to leave lying around the house for anyone to browse.
B00BKZUVGM|5.0|We'll where to begin, when I read the product reviews for the finale of this series I thought &#34;have I just wasted my money?&#34; as they were saying it was the worst ending to a series ever etc...however I was pleasantly surprised, it was nice for a series to end on a slightly different note than expected. The best part was that the book didn't abruptly end after the climax with a 1-2 page happily ever after, but continued for a good chapter that allowed for closure of all characters and allowed for am understanding of the changes. I was not at all disappointed with this finale and I salute Veronica Roth and her amazing writing ability because I don't feel that there is more to be said it was a fantastic closure to an amazing series and I know that I will read this one again and again!!!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Saw the movies...had to own them!  Pow!!!  I have watch them numerous time with the same delight.  Shazam!!!!  This is the trilogy every made for super heros.  Noland directing, Bale, Ledger and the rest of the casts were outstanding. Holy Acting, Batman. I look forward to enjoying them for many years.
B00AAIHAGO|5.0|Classic for its genre. Sets, music, acting all blend together too create greatness. Restaurant and final scene are my favorites.
B001KMB6X2|2.0|Only bought this because I saw it with my wife when we were still dating and we couldn't get over how terrible it was. When we saw it for cheap on Amazon we had to buy it just as a keepsake.<br /><br />When we ask each other how we liked a movie we compare it to this.<br /><br />Watched it twice, still couldn't tell you what it's about.<br /><br />You're better than this Vin!
B001O1O71C|4.0|My 12 year old son read this book for school.  He liked it, but didn't like the ending.  He was engaged with the characters and story and I didn't have push him to read it.  This book is about the Holocaust and opened the door for conversations about what happened and why.  I liked that it made him think.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. It has brought peace and organization to my whole life. thank you!!!!!! if you want way to organize your phone download this.
B005R32L66|5.0|This is a great tool for communicating with others with a visual.  I continue to be amazed at clearness Skype provides.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|I enjoyed the  story and meeting the girl with a pearl earring. It's hard to think of living conditions of that time.  We take so much for granted. Well written book.
B00B2166BS|4.0|It charges my tablet faster than the microUSB.  The only thing that would make the product better would be to make the cable longer.  Maybe another 1-1.5 ft would be ideal, I think.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|It took me months after reading a sample to finally buy the full book. Perhaps, as a native Bay Arean, the local references and computery backdrop felt too precious, too unlikely to hold a story that would pull me in below surface level.<br /><br />I'm glad I finally decided to give this book a try, though, as pull me in it did! Far from the superficial tale I expected, Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore proved to be a layered, genre-bending delight, with elements of mystery, adventure, romance, sci fi, fantasy, and more, plus local &#34;in jokes,&#34; a likable protagonist, and a lot of humor. Unexpected twists and turns kept me reading late into the night, when I really ought to have been sleeping--always a sign of a good book!<br /><br />And as a calligrapher, book artist, and lover of letters and craft bookbinding, all of the references to type and books were an added treat.<br /><br />I'll be looking for more Robin Sloan titles, for sure!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great mystery keeps you guessing with twists and turns throughout the book. Easy read. Plan to read more of Gillian Flynn novels.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|I have purchased G5 games before &amp; loved them but not so much with this one. It has too much pop up conversations &amp; you stay on a scene to long finding objects. It just didn't flow &amp; was slow moving
B00F880BWG|5.0|This is a great season.  It started off taking no prisoners and has continued to do so.  It may be their best season yet.
B000WCDBKM|4.0|Interesting story, good suspense, but the ending was incredibly vague and didn't answer a lot of the questions I had formulated over the course of the movie
B00EMIE0CA|5.0|Spyrogyra has produced great music for decades. This album is no exception. This work has their signature sound but yet is new and invigorating.
B00BFV1K2A|5.0|I read it in a weekend, couldn't out it down...was teaching it to year 8 english and wanted to see what the fuss was all about...It's hard to pretend to be effie when you don't know who she is!
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary app is multi-functional.  It is a dictionary, a thesaurus, and a translator into French, Spanish and German.  It also gives the origin of words.  And it's FREE!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book<br />I really enjoyed this book. Full of excitement. Can't wait to read the next one. Hope it's just as good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|BUY THIS APP. YOU WILL PLAY IT FOREVER. It is kinda like bejewled but 100% better.  You have to get at least 3 of the same candies together to play the game. This is also a great game for all ages. This game is so awesome, if I had to I would totally pay $5.00 for this game. BEST GAME EV-A
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Hilarious! Every time I watch I can't help but laugh. Great for music lovers. One of those movies that stay funny every time it gets watched.
B00E6X4GAW|4.0|Malala's story is well told, and most importantly informs me that this young lady is a person of great substance, judging by her work and respect achieved by such a young person. I am better able to understand why the taliband consider her such a threat. They are right, because she brings infinite common sense where none exists in their thinking, if we can call it that.<br /><br />Malala is indeed a very special person who has a mission to raise up all women in Pakistan, and while she is at it, she needs to raise up the taliband as well.<br /><br />May she have the very best of luck and support. She is the new Benazir Bhutto.
B00G32OER4|5.0|It will make you start going to church again! I don't normally jump at horror films or anything really scary because every film is so predictable, not this one.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|this game is so great for my daughter who is 9 years old. it teaches her about creativity and imagination!  its also so much fun for her. even I tried it and she had to take her kindle away from me!
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Hilarious! I usually hate sequals or prequals but this movie was like no other. Grear story line and awesome cast.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love it. I use it every day and it has not failed me once. It is simple to use and set up and the price is amazing. I can't think of one complaint. Honestly don't know what I would do without it now
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The concept of deceiving those that have wronged a man was done well.....revenge is truly sweet.  I enjoyed the &#34;tricks&#34; of the trade.
B0019N94X6|5.0|classic movie.  I love the metal case and booklet.  The movie is high quality video transfer.  It looks good, well worth the money.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Inspiring!  To just live in the now and not be afraid.......is this possible.  A big ugly monster made to destroy humanity is approaching, do you control the fear or hope he's got a cold.
B00G8P2B4E|4.0|Very cute and well done. But, the first remains the gold standard. There's no beating the first - it's my favorite animated film.
B00DU74U74|3.0|It was ok.  Wanderer was an interesting character with a lot of humanity!  It reminded me of &#34;Batteries not included&#34;
B00196YNWU|4.0|My five year old loved it!  It was the perfect movie for her because she loves music and the movies.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Really needs to have the API opened up to developers! There are a lot of features that need to be implemented (well), like streaming files from a computer to the Chromecast, gameplay, etc. Stuff that opening up the API would create the opportunity to be made by third parties.
B0002YN376|5.0|Every year I try to get a christmas ornament that reflects something of that years experience. Since this was the year my little one was old enough to discover My Neighbor Totoro (her favorite movie) and Kiki's Delivery Service (second favorite -- she was Jiji for Halloween, my wife was Kiki and I dressed as the baker) I thought to get a Ghibli related ornament. Looking through the options of key chains and phone fobs that I could repurpose it was clear that making a decision between getting a Catbus, Totoro or Soot Sprite ornament was going to be tough. Then I found this set and ordered it right away.<br /><br />I ordered from a seller that was fulfilled by Amazon rather than one that ships from Japan and they arrived quickly. I must say these figures are smaller than I expected. That being said, they are great looking pieces, posed nicely and seem very well made. If I had to pick on any of them I would say the smile on the Catbus looks like it may detach someday, although it would just as easily be reattached with a dab of glue or a little whip-stitch. Also take note that the chains they are on are good for dangling but are likely to light for tugging, so they'd probably have to be changed if used for zip pulls and the like.<br /><br />The whole lot of them are just fantastic and I can't wait until we go to decorate the tree and my little one gets her first look at them.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|My husband's favorite movie and I wanted to make sure we had a Blu-Ray version.  He was so excited to watch it in HD when he got home!  Just an all around great family movie!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|But I was expecting more applications support, right know there are very few, I hope it began adding more soon.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|If you love Bruce Willis, this is a great movie. We have watched it over and over and can't wait for Red 2 to be available on DVD!!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I might never fly again (haha!) but enjoyed the suspense, the drama and the well-progressed story line.  Writing was strong, acting was stronger.  Denzel Washington didn't disappoint.  John Goodman is a delight in a despicable way...I just have to smile every time I see the man no matter what his role is.  Excellent movie!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|My youngest is a budding body builder and loves Arnold. Watched part of this with him and gives a good look into Arnold's career as a professional body builder and that of some of his competitors. I  must admit, for $5 I thought it might be lame, but my son loved it and I thought it was good as well.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|I gave this a shot when It was the free app of the day.  Glad I did, it was challenging and a lot of fun.  Just wish there were more levels to play.
B000002ADT|5.0|BECAUSE THERE &#34;ONLY&#34; FIVE STARS!  WOW...I TRULY ENJOYED THIS CD 1O GOLD STARS WORTH! I CAN NOT BELIEVE I MISS THIS ONE OVE THE YEARS.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When the best and the worst of what makes us human is dissected and put under a microscope, it is the task of the writer to allow the reader to see just enough as to recognize others, but not so much as to be disgusted by ourselves.  In the characters of innocence, apathy, rage, determination, defeat and calculation, Collins crafts believable people dealing with unbelievable circumstances seemingly out of their control, and expertly evolves each to a realization that their destiny has yet to be decided.  Easy read, which is why the trilogy was mistaken for a limited genre, much like Watership Down what just a book about rabbits.  As in all novel to screen conversions, substance and nuance is lost, so it should be read, and re read.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Who doesn't love solitaire?  And the golf theme & commentary make me miss televised golf a little less at this football focused time of year.
B00275EHJG|3.0|definitely not a classic Disney movie<br />kids like it okay but it's a little too much for young children with all the meanness
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Not enough levels without paying another $1 inside the game to unlock more. Either they should have given you more levels and free updates. Or just charged $2 for the game in the first place.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|love this movie; great price on amazon too<br />this is a classic Disney that we wanted to have for children and grandchildren and since we no longer own a vcr we bought the dvd
B009VSW15Y|1.0|The app isn't bad. It gets a bad rating on principle because you can't use the tablets built in camera without and extra app purchase.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this bingo game it is so much fun. It keeps you wanting to play more and more. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone!!
B000002H38|5.0|Anita did a fantastic job on her first solo album, the vocals and the music become one, flows so smooth.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|My kids love these movies and I enjoy them too! They are pretty funny. I would say they are geared toward ages 8 and up. My kids also enjoy the books.
0307454541|5.0|I read this whole trilogy and the writing was so awesome.  I don't know what to say other than if you haven't read this trilogy you are really missing out on some awesome writing, and story telling.  The characters are above and beyond well written!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|love to watch everything as discribed plays great brand new love deff buy from again perfect love it great quality
0553582011|3.0|It is not easy  to read.  Martin has killed all my favorite characters.  A bit disappointing.  Yet, Martin remains a prolific story-teller.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|love to watch everything as discribed plays great brand new love deff buy from again perfect love it great quality
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|my kids LOVE these cartoons! totally recommend its funny, entertaining and cute! good for all ages and it was taken off of Netflix.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|I was so excited to find this in 3D. My husband insists on buying every 3D movie he can, but I couldn't find this one in stores. We love the Iron Man movies, and this did not disappoint.
B00G9B1MEM|4.0|great game very fun and very good but I played it on my cousins phone and the ball had color and mine on the kindle fire is black. just a minor bug please fix:)
0553384775|4.0|Very entertaining read.  Ignore the negative comments on this book.  We read to be transported to another time/instance and this book does just that.  Great memoir.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|A compelling tale well written, full of action.  It mirrors the ideals I strive for.  It takes me away from my frustrations with this world and shows a hero that contends with his.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It makes me take my time thinking about all the little choices<br />I make to clear the right pieces without blocking the tiles I will match soon.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Great movie, great music, great great great. Most people like An American in Paris, but I think this is Gene Kelly's shining glory. It remains one of my favorite musicals and one of my favorite movies of all time. Donald O'Connor is a treasure as Cosmo and Debbie Reynolds is both adorable and full of spice! 5 stars, always!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|To all the people who have an error playing the game, the company that made OMGPOP (Zynga) has abandoned the site and shut it down in August. It was a great game and we were all excited to play it. You can blame Zynga for it, they made and shut down the system. If you have this app, delete it, because it is now shut down. Don't ask me why, I don't know.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Giving this game a four star because it could of done with more levels but I did enjoy playing it all the same.
B008B68IV8|5.0|It was what  my daughter wanted for Christmas. I love the fact I didn't have to run all over ever where to find it. It was also cheaper then buying at the store.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Simple, easy to use, quick set up. No going &quot;Oh my God, how do I do this?&quot; You don't need anything else.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|Great movie my kids love it so much I had to buy second copy. It is a great family holiday movie
B002P5XXR0|5.0|I LOVE THE MOVIE AND THE COLOR WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD. AND I ENJOY THE STORY LINE TOO. I AM A COLLECTER IN MOVIES
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Love this cd it has my favorite song on it you and me.  Love michael Buble his music it has old yet modern charm.  I would recomend thiscd to anyone.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|LIKE I SAID, I LOVE THE MOVIE. I LOVE THE STORY LINE, THE COLOR, THE SOUND TRACK, AND HOW IT TURN OUT. I HAVE BEEN HUNTING THE MOVIE AND I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN I COULD FIND ANYTHING I NEEDED ON AMAZON.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|eminem is a very talented artist he speaks from the heart keeps it real and legit what he has to say is always relevant and I appreciate what he's been through and how he's continue to fight for his fans and himself most of all
B008JEJN8O|5.0|my husband wear 9 in all shoeas so I ordered the same size, he keep them, but he seems to be ovver two snow boarding lol, so i recomend to ask for a number down your size.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I'd forgotten how many good songs there are on this DVD, since I hadn't watched most of it previously, except on various YouTube snippets.  But the price would have been well worth it just to get the live performances of Queen (which many experts consider their best live performance), U2 as they were first shooting for super-stardom, and Elton John for being a show man for the ages.  What really made me smile is remembering how many songs from this period in music (roughly late '70s through the mid 80's) are on this disc.  Such as Simple Minds \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\", Dire Straights \\"Sultans of Swing\\", and Boomtown Rats \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\".  (Yes Virginia, Bob Geldorf was a musician first, before he became a legend by bringing together so many stellar musicians.)  The Who put on a very energetic performance, reminiscent of the times I saw them in the '60s with the late and great Keith Moon.  And then there was continent jumping Phil Collins, rocking on both sides of the Atlantic.  Plus the Band Aid and USA for Africa finales on stage and in the recording studio are great reminders of not only how great artists can work together but also serve as reminders for what the entire purpose of this concert was.<br /><br />Felt that Duran Duran and Sade didn't seem quite up to their usual performance standards.  And I'm not particularly fond of Judas Priest, but those are personal tastes.  But I am wondering why the sleeve of this DVD set includes Tears for Fears, Wham! and the Temptations, yet there were no performances by these bands in the set, although George Michael did a song in Elton's set.  As much as I would have loved to have seen Led Zeppelin's reunion, apparently technical issues occurred during their act, and they therefore did not want to be included in the final cut.<br /><br />However, all in all I'm thrilled with this set!  So glad I bought it instead of borrowing it from a friend.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Loved it. I played a lot of sports growing up and i was above average at  most of them.  This book helped me see that business on no different from sports - be the best athlete our businessman you can and go out and best you're opponents.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Best show ever!!!! The storyline is unbelievable and addictive. I would recommend this to everyone. Jessica Lange is mesmerizing. Wonderful!
B00EF9339M|5.0|If it works, its life changing. If its doesn't, it still will make a huge difference in your life. Boom
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so good. The only thing is I want more<br />animals like just some fish, and storms but<br />they can't catch stuff on fire. If you are<br />thinking about buying this do it because<br />it is so worth it! (And in a lot of ways it's better<br />than survival craft)
B005V5WBFG|1.0|The Icon I selected said the program was free.  It turns out to be an 11 day trial with no way to uninstall it.  I dislike being tricked into trying products.  McAfee was very deceitful and should not be allowed into the Android community.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A Time to Kill has always been my favorite Grisham tale. Now Sycamore Row is right up there with it. Well done, Mr. Grisham, well written.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Wonderfully written. I highly recommend this book. I laughed and cried. Loved the relationship of Eleanor and Park. Made me look at teen love in a new way.
1577314808|1.0|Seriously... this is a book that tells me nothing... \\"Stay in present (NOW)\\" keeps repeating over and over and over... One page would be enough.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|my nephews (7 and 10 years old) love it, it keeps them busy for a long time and it never gets old.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|The songs were great, as usual.  Such a pleasure to listen to Jack's talent.  I ordered 2 additional cds; one for my daughter and one for a friend.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|FOR a non medical person there were many things very technical.<br />For a medical person there was much unnecessary information that did not pertain to the book.<br />I was interested in his experience during the coma and not all the background of his medical profession as well as<br />his father's medial profession.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I didn't know how to play the piano but with this I have learned to play a few songs. Its fun, trust me!
B009PXNFQE|5.0|I love it!  Every song on this cd is amazing!  I cannot stop listening to it.  The best cd that I own.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Best one I've found for easy use and volume.. use it often, easy to see without my glasses as well. Delightful!......highly recommended<br />For any age
1476727651|5.0|This is one of King's best works. It reminds me of his earlier writing style. I read this in 1 day. Could not put it down.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I think its a little unfair because I personally HATE minecraft but just...wow its bad and they better stop with minecraft becouse its the WORST!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I sent this s a gift for my 85-year old Dad who broke another automatic I had sent him a few years ago. He absolutely loves it. It is on the smallish side for a modern man's watch 37mm wide, but that works great for him. Very easy to read black face with light hands, so he sees it really well. I have the beige face version SNK803. You can see my review of the watch there.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|These are great little automatic watches, 37mm wide, for the price. Band is somewhat bland colored. The band can be easily changed out for another better looking one- 18mm size. Looks very nice with a green NATO band or a brown leather band. Otherwise, no hesitation here. These watches can be adjusted to keep very good time. The movement is rated -30/+45 seconds a day, which seems a lot. However, mine has been within 5 seconds a day out of the box, so I have not had to adjust it. Remember this is an auto and needs you to move to wind it. It does not have a hacking function or crown winding; it only winds by moving the watch. It is also not a watch to swim or shower with as the water rating is only 30 meters- which translates to splash resistant, not truly submersible.If you understand what you are getting and how it works it is one of the best value watches out there- a true Seiko classic. Final thought- make sure to follow the instructions as to initial setting and day/date changing. Changing the day/date from 9 pm to 4 am can mess up the movement.
0920668372|5.0|This book makes me cry every time I read it to both of my children. I didn't realize that the author wrote it for his stillborn child, which makes it all the more meaningful since I have had multiple losses myself. Beautiful book.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Lyrical genius. Emotion is front and center in this album. The beats are unique and combinations of classic rockAnd classic rap
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Very Good!  Why it was called a WAR is beyond me.  Dale & Kathy both liked it! Brad Pitt was excellent
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I love the descriptive detail it kept me hooked and I could not drop the book because it kept me so entertained!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|It's a classic. Who doesn't love the Rocky Horror Picture Show? Didn't we all grow up seeing it? Watch it.
B000006045|5.0|this is an awesome CD. we are belly dancers and have danced to several of these songs in class. thank you.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|i give it a 3* because how long you gotta wait to play again after the timer or gotta pay or get a friend to help ya out.  it stinks that way.  plus how many turns ya got after a while.  but i could see why.  ut payin for more lives and or ask a friend to help kinda sucks.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|ARTPOP is the coolest experience. Listening all the way through the album takes you on a journey and into the world of Lady Gaga. It's a pop masterpiece. Also, the limited edition physical CD with the foil is stunning. Way to go Gaga!
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|The actors/actresses are great.  Like the story too.  Best of all there is no commercial interruptions and I can pause and replay the scenes when I want to.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Completely awesome! Reacher is the new bad A of all bad A's This is where it all started and what a launching pad it is.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I have no idea how to get out of the first room - not very good instructions. Glad it was free - what a waste.
B008602KQI|4.0|Stuck to my seat, would watch again. Full of action and a great story. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch and Stanly Tucci as Caesar Flickerman excellent choices.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Family movie night was a hit with this classic! My 9 year old twins girls thought it was hilariously funny!
B00EI2Y4MQ|5.0|this may be a simple calculator but it does give you order of operations, a handy tool for any math calculations, and I give it five stars due to being free today, had I paid for it I would have expected more bells and whistles, not sure yet if it's worth even 99&cent; but free it is well worth the money.
B000F0V0LI|5.0|The Searchers is my favorite movie of all time. It's truly a classic. So happy to get the Ultimate Collector's Edition.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one of the all time Christmas Movie Classics.  We watch it every year and always seem to find something we hadn't noticed before.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg! What a amazing game, I love it and never get tired of playing it.So many levels and guess what its very addictive.I love it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is the real deal.  I cannot recommend it enough.  Well written with great characters, pacing, and plot.  The sense of mystery the author creates drives you on, deeper into the secrets of the silo.  Be careful though - if you find out too much you may find yourself cleaning...
B00GLMQREE|5.0|So far, Season 4 digs its way out of the bad comic book nonsense that was most of season 3. I think Scott Gimple's talents as showrunner are immediately visible as he seeks to fix and improve on the weak characters, and floundering, lost story arc under Glen Mazzara's watch. I'm on episode 5 as I write this and this is the tightly written show that I remember from Frank Darabont's original vision of the show. Considerations of their hellish situations are contemplated and that drives the action, rather than having characters do stupid things just to make action happen. If they can continue on this path, then we can all pretend like Season 3 was just the bad dream that it was.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|Easy portability of console. Only needs its own power source, or combine console and screen into one plug. Recommended for transporting system, but not much else,
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I couldn't wait for this to come out on Netflix, so I purchased season 4. It is so good, but it is so bad.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|It is blade runner on bluray.<br />you will either love it or not.<br />there is not a lot of middle ground with this movie.<br /><br />great bluray transfer. Great special features. If it made me forget Prometheus is technically in the BR universe now, it would be perfect.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was an fun, easy read. I enjoyed the characters, and the plot. It really got me thinking, what would I do in the same situations.
B00E9PXI3S|1.0|Simply aweful. Script and plot are painfully contrived. Characters are unbelievable and acting is obvious. Watch the trailer instead - that has all the essential parts. Wishing I could refund.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I have to say that I really did enjoy the simplicity of this story about a man who had survived one of the Magdelena orphanages to grow up still feeling lost, unlucky and ill-equipped to handle his own solitude. The dark flashbacks to his life are truly harrowing and moving, while the story of his present-day attempts to find a woman through the Lonely Hearts section of the newspaper are laced through with gentle humor and loveable, memorable characters. It was an engaging, pleasant read that really does create its own world of Irish busybodies and simple, good-hearted people to contrast with the hopeless nightmare of the orphanage passages. Jaime and Lydia are sweet characters to root for, and I've read books that are far less moving that bore the stamp of \\"literature\\" that are not as satisfying as Christina McKenna's unpretentious<br />novel here.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn always has a way of keeping you on the edge of your seat! Great read. Couldn't put it down.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|It was exactly what my daughter had been looking for!  And the price was great! She has been busy making everyone bracelets :-)
B008IJTFYW|4.0|The one l only reason I didn't give five stars is because I can't turn off the screen while playing. My son and me have server insomnia and this app knocks us out in twenty mins. Best part, it's free!
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|I am a female and I am not a big \\"action\\" movie, but I actually really enjoyed this movie and so did my husband. We both were not expecting it to be as good as it was. I'd recommend it! :)
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|Just another pay-to-actually play game. Stamina and micro-purchase based. Horrible controls too. If you like paying a lot of money in small increments, get this game.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Beautifully written! It will engage you, taking you to nazi germany as lived by a young german girl. Highly recommended!
B00001ZWTT|5.0|I love to shop amazon its easy safe and quick<br />Always got a good product plan on shoping there again
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game! I definitely recommend it, just be prepared for possible addiction. If anyone needs a neighbor my ID is FAUKQHI.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|works excellent just wished Google allowed true streaming from your devices own video files. other than that works as advertised
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Of course I give this book a five star rating. Absolutely love the hunger games trilogy. Recommended this book to all my friends
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I check facebook each day and the kindle is an easy way to do it without opening the large computer unit.
B006M4F67A|1.0|It is terrible, the Shanghi dynasty I have on my computer is nothing like with you gave me.  I would like to return it to you as I will not use it.  How do I remove it?
B0063GORYU|2.0|Not what I am use to.  It's all together a different version. I play it but just not the same.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a great game enjoyed very much especially when you are trying to beat your friends lots of fun
0553384775|3.0|I must confess that \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" was offensive, opprobrious, deeply deplorable, ham-fisted, tin-eared, climatic, anti-climatic and undeniably FANTASTIC AT EVERY TURN. What a character this Jordan Belfort is. So realistic, so tautly conceived is he, that I'd half-believe he's as real as the author himself!<br /><br />As the titular character, Mr. Belfort takes the world of stocks and bonds by storm, only to become the subject of a vicious, litigious witch-hunt by the fédéràlés of the US government.<br /><br />I recall that I had a similar run-in with the law back when I wintered in the mystical port of Miami. Having invested a considerable fortune into a small Columbian import business, I was accosted by federal agents whilst en route to Cuba. We were transporting a rare and expensive herbal remedy made from the powdered bones of aboriginals called \\"cocaine.\\" The powers that be threw a very real book at me, and that was the last time I invested in anything but reading lights and high-density sluice gates. But that's neither here nor there. My apologies, fellow Amazonians, I digress.<br /><br />If you seek a sweeping tale about the evils of greed, lust and `ludes, \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" more than fills the ticket. After, you might wish to experience mine own take on power and corruption, boldly titled \\"The Spoils of Babylon,\\" airing this January in its epic mini-series glory on IFC. Set against the backdrop of every major event in American history (some yet unwritten), \\"The Spoils of Babylon\\" is one part tearjerker, two parts jaw-dropper, and all parts mind-blower. Just imagine if \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" took place in reality and starred the likes of Dirk Snowfield, Lauroeighiya Samcake and the legendary Sir Richard Driftwood. Yes, that Sir Richard Driftwood.<br /><br />With great admiration,<br /><br />Eric Jonrosh, author of \\"The Spoils of Babylon,\\" set to air on IFC this January 9th, 2014
B0014BY72Q|2.0|The story line is too obvious and so impractical it continually reminds the viewer that this is a made up movie.
B00C2C637I|5.0|Chilling and uplifting, this book is one to read and reread, both for its suspenseful plot and its lyrical writing. Read it in October if you can!
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Excellent  cast, great story. Anyone who has studied the history of how LA gets its water will see the implications in this movie story line.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|Perfectly adequate movie.  Lots of violence, but terrible plot.  No common sense apparent, no 'safe' houses, no security plans; if it wasn't for crisi management, MI-6 would have no management.
B001MM28JG|4.0|Very unusual casting however the story line pulls it all together. Great special effects and Sigorny Weaver is simply sensual.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I feel this version of Emma is the BEST! I so enjoyed the characters in this program compared to the movie version with Gwyneth Paltrow. The interaction between Emma and Mr. Knightly was so much more entertaining. I love the story and the production!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I found myself reading at 3:00 am because I couldn't put Sycamore Row down.  It was such a pleasure to read this book and to reconnect with the familiar characters of A Time to Kill.
B000RLFJQ2|3.0|My husband enjoyed this movie more than I did, I fell asleep. It was O.K.! I've<br />seen better Robert De Niro movies.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Great movie when i was a kid and now my kids like it too. Classic kid movie that the whole family can enjoy.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|I have already listened to this double CD a few times now the days after the release . Firstly whom ever is going to buy this CD will more than likely already be a Beatles fan. So the debate about the music and how great it is , is not necessary. What strikes me the most is that goosebumps feeling you get while listening. A sound that can't be duplicated, can't really be discussed, but felt. You step back into time listening with a clarity though with imperfections, that allows the listener to understand what the fuss was all about. These young men created a new sound that literally changed the world. This give you a glimpse to why. We rarely get to hear the Beatles live without the screaming. This is how they sound as a real band without being in the studio. For those who appreciate this kind of listening experience, You will be rewarded immensely. There are other bands who have played more sophistically or with more complexity over the years but none match that quality of greatness or not sure how to put it in words, inner comfort, inner beauty that is felt when you hear The Beatles like this. Raw and stripped away with all the production that is now common place. For Beatle fans this set is a must. I was going to write my highlights, but the truth is they are all fantastic including the comical banter they have with themselves and the announcers.
B0093QE37S|5.0|The interactions between the characters is always fun to watch. An all-time classic. Jimmy Stewart's drunk scene with Cary Grant is one of my favorites.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Detail historical research by Stephen King and descriptive narration. Makes you feel like you are time traveling during the late 1950's and 1960's.
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|Easy to play and lots of different characters as well as easy to understand how to play. Loving the game as well much to do any THE story line is so great.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|I quite enjoyed this book. Not entirely convincing, but entertaining. I will tell my friends about it. I have run out of words!
159184617X|4.0|I was excited to see a book on Jonathan Ive, the head of Industrial Design at Apple. He is a living legend – with the Queen’s knighthood no less - with the string of runaway hits Apple has had. Stories abound of how the finer things in life from forging of samurai swords to examples from marine biology influence his design thinking. Author Leander Kahney summarizes his enduring legacy with this comment “(Ive) introduced the concept of fashion to an industry previously preoccupied with speeds and feeds”<br /><br />I was also a bit concerned Kahney would fall into traps authors often fall into when they profile tech executives as I wrote recently – speculation without direct access to the subject, and a chronological version of the subject’s life. Kahney does but it does not affect this book as much. He focuses more on the huge product hits – the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone and iPad and uses his long term watching of Apple (he publishes the Cult of Mac) to use alumni and other contacts to weave enough of Ive into the descriptions. And unlike Walter Isaacson with Steve Jobs, he does not focus much on Ive’s youth other than to show the influence his dad and his consulting days in the UK had on his aesthetic sense.<br /><br />There is plenty of detail to savor – like the Daler Rowney sketchbooks preferred by the ID team, Bondi Blue translucence of the first iMac and Ive's minimalist stamp on the new iOS7. Apple fans will particularly relish these details of two decades of products they have enjoyed. Personally, I liked the design culture Kahney describes that Robert Brunner, IDEO, frog and others brought to the Valley in the 90s that have reshaped so many of our devices since. I also liked the fact he invokes anecdotes from auto, furniture and other product design from Italy, Japan and elsewhere.<br /><br />I would have liked to seen more on the “industrial” part of ID. The marvel of Apple is it can scale to millions of units within weeks of launch of what appear to be complex, lovingly man-made products. He talks a bit about the Unibody manufacturing process and the Foxconn contract manufacturing role but the majority of the focus is on individual product features.<br /><br />I also thought there is some hero worship where he describes Ive as irreplaceable at Apple, even more than Jobs was. Apple is a multi-dimensional phenomenon with its retail store experience, its massive apps ecosystem, its impressive supply chain and memorable marketing all as important as the product elegance.<br /><br />Overall, though I found it an enjoyable read. He fills in some of the gaps in other recent books about Apple. This comment in the chapter detailing the super secret ID studio is telling: “Walter Isaacson was given a tour (of the studio) but he only described the presentation tables in his biography of Jobs”
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|I have been getting back into Pink Floyd lately -I remember hearing the guitar solo from &#34;Comfortably Numb&#34; back in the 80's and then when this album was released, the ominous &#34;Dogs of War&#34; sold me. Yeah, this ain't &#34;The Wall&#34; or &#34;Dark Side of The Moon&#34; and yeah, Roger Waters isn't on it but this is still a great release by a band that went out on top and released some of the most eclectic and excellent music ever.
1619491370|5.0|I really like the book Pollyanna  because  it is very interesting, and the characters were very interesting too. The character that I liked the most is Pollyanna because she is very friendly and nice. I also liked Jimmy because he is also a good character. All the other characters were good too, but Pollyanna and Jimmy were the characters that I like the most. The book is very well-written, and the words used explain the story very well. Whenever you start reading it, you won’t want to put it down. I recommend reading this book and don’t forget to recommend it to others after you read it!!<br />Tziporah, 9
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movies was truly unpredictable which is a rare occasion in movies these days.  I was engaged and entertained throughout the movie, trying to figure it out.
B005SJIP2S|1.0|What a rip! The band was incomplete - Jon Anderson was not present on the tour, due to some vague illness and was not well enough to tour with the band. Instead they hired some guy from a Canadian 'Yes Tribute'  band who, in my opinion was simply not up to the task of replacing Anderson. Also, none of the other previous keyboard players that we're all familiar with were present either. Instead, we were treated to the keyboard stylings of none other than Rick Wakeman's son. Competent, but juuuust barely. None of the fiery and fluid lines of his father, not even the percussive stylings of former band member and 'Buggle' Geoff Downes. The whole concert was just limp and tired sounding, and lacking in the showmanship of the old band as a unit. While I understand that the band is aging just like the rest of the world, but even the youth of the current frontman and Wakeman the Younger couldn't seem to breath any new life into the old arrangements. Don't waste your money.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book keeps you on your feet. You just can't put it down. There are some parts I disagree with. Bu other than that it was great!!!!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Very good reimagining of Star Trek II (my favorite ST movie). Acting was very good and action was very good as well. Highly recommend.
B005PK56TA|5.0|great suspense show. they have great writers.definetly going to watch season 2 and 3, highly reccomended for sure. you;ll get hooked.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|It was very interesting and eye-opening. You don't think of what goes on behind the scenes when it comes to the food on your plate, but this movie really makes you aware of the industry.  I recommend everyone watch this and make their own judgement and decisions about what to eat and not eat.
0767919408|5.0|I was thoroughly engaged in this book! I felt like it brought me right to the era that my parents grew up in, and told me the stories that they only glazed on: in fact, I bought a copy for my Dad (who is 90, and who then bought copies for his elder friends!), and it was the talking point to pull out the stories from him that I have longed for. It also becomes profoundly clear through Bill's writing how history really does repeat itself. Seems to me it should be on required reading lists with the bonus: it is entirely wonderful to read! It's incredible to me how much has happened in really so short a time: aviation, television, and so much more. I would tell my friends: &#34;Can you believe that the first stop light had just appeared in New York City in the 20's?&#34; and it goes on and on from there. I so wish it were longer! (Now that is an indication of what a good book it is).
B00AIBZJLG|3.0|I was sold by trailers I've seen, but was disappointed in this DVD .  I showed this to my senior citizen movie group and nobody sat all the way through it, so I wasn't alone in not enjoying it that much.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Was on a roller coaster. The guys point of view was good. Different than most stories. I enjoyed. It really is a must read.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|One of the best documentaries I've had the fortune to watch.  superb photography and good narration.  This is bound to receive an Oscar nomination for best documentary.
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|so campy it was funny!  Tim Allen was really funny and then some and I believe that Alan  Rickman is very under-rated - he is remarkable in any role he plays.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This is a delightful update of one of the greatest classics of all time.  It's easy to say that if you loved the 1939 movie,, you'll love this just as much.  A great touch was the homage paid to the original by having a black and white introduction before we're plunged into truly vivid and wild color.  Your kids and grandkids will love this and so will you.
B001O7JHVG|4.0|Old time favorite and it was just as good as I remembered it.  Stallone plays a very different part in this move - except, of course, for his physique.....  Kurt Russell is not hard on the eyes, either.  This was a chance for him to show both his comedic side and his acting ability - although this is not a deep move, it was fun to watch.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|This was just plain good from the opening scene through the final scene.  Oscar competition looks strong this year, but I'm  hoping for this to be up there with the other nominees.  If you like the classic STAND BY ME, you'll love this one.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this amazed me when I saw this bewildering app in the store just the other day so get the app its super coolest
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|I couldn't pass up this movie, but it was disappointing to see what was basically a revision of the best of the original STAR TREK movies.  I kinda would be okay with just forgetting trying to revive the series and let us relish the older ones.
B00CNGA1PS|2.0|Interface is not easy to figure out & very little podcasts can be found on it. I have a hard time navigating the app which makes it frustrating.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I was originally turned off of ths, not caring for zombie films.  However, this is surprising it is really good Special effe cts are awe inspiring.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Tries to copy Men in Black and fails. Tries to copy Ghostbusters and fails. Jeff Bridges needs to<br />get rid of his poor fitting dentures now, and get some decent dental implants; he was hard to understand<br />and it hurt the movie. Great effects, but this comic book just did not translate well to screen.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|This shows just how great animated can be.  I show films to senior citizens, mainly women, and this really went over well with the group.  And I definitely consider it the main contender for an animated film Oscar in January.  Even if you don't think you like animation, give this one a try.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A Great book. I thought it was Awesome that John ah. Tied this book to such an early work. Truly loved it !
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is a truly great film, targetted especially towards cultured senior citizens.  Maggie Smith especially shines in this, but when doesn't she?
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is a cheap and bad casting device. I guess you get what you pay for. Very disappointed Google! The video cats copy on TV and the function is not robust. Sometime it just doesn't work for no reason.
B008JFUQZ2|3.0|It's OK as a monster vs robot film, but is below the director's artistic capabilities.  His touch does make this a good film for teenagers, and the special effects are splendid.  But it's not for more mature moviegoers.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really wanted to give Roth the benefit of the doubt with this one. But after reading the book twice, it's just not good, and a really disappointing way to end what was otherwise an engaging and fun series.<br /><br />First, the switched perspectives are impossible to tell apart, as others have said. I thought Four would be more reserved, stoic and provide an interesting look into his and Tris's relationship, but it's really just a lot of the same with a different name. The plot twist I would have loved, if it hadn't been done so poorly. I didn't even know anything had really happened until a few chapters later, at which point I had to go back and re-read. There's a way to do shocking and interesting but it needs to be meaningful. Roth's shocking felt like it was there for the sake of shocking people, rather than for the sake of a good story.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't terrible but it's not on par with the series and it's not a good way to end the book. I really expected more.
B00DJYJPLO|5.0|One of the best movies of the year.  I'm sure it will get some Oscar attention.  It would help though if you have seen the earlier movies.  Anyway, I highly recommend this.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Started watching this series last year & I am hooked. Glad I have a chance to see it from the beginning. Just got started on season 2.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|You'd expect this jazz age movie to have some good jazz in it.  Guess again.  Hip-hop music in the party scenes is wildly disconcerting and wholly inappropriate.  The director had a vague feeling that it would provide a bridge between our age and the age F. Scott Fitzgerald was writing about.  Bad feeling indeed.<br /><br />Leonardo's acting was a plus, and the film had an opulant look to it.  If only the powers that be used common sense in the music.
B000FBJHZS|3.0|I like his Robert Langdon books better. They have more symbology. This book did keep me wondering for a while; but then I guessed the ending. Also, the 'love story' was unnecessary.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|This is Superman as I always envisioned him.  I found this to be truly a super film and arguably the best film visualization of the character yet.  We've come a long way from the Superman seriel Columbia gave us around 1950.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great Re-read its like a scavenger hunt with a goal finding new things in every page that make the story that much better...
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This wass a true scary film without a lot of blood and gore.  It has lots of the true creepiness that good horror should have.  I showed it to my film group, basically senior women, and it was truly liked.  Highly recommended to all looking for honest horror.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved The Shining and have read it many times over the past 30 + years.  I feel that Stephen King did a wonderful job maintaining the closeness I felt to the little boy Danny to the man that Dan became in Doctor Sleep.  I didn't find it as scary as The Shining<br />but the Ghostie people certainly had Evil covered.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|Enjoyable animated film, worthy of an Oscar nomination.  This is a great follow-up to the original and will appeal to both kids and to parents.  Highly recommended.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|My kid enjoyed it, Me, Not so much. And I generally like this kind of movie. I did enjoy some of the special effect though
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Generally I don't play games but I wanted to try something new so I took a chance on Dear Hunter and I'm really happy that I did. I wanted a game that takes advantage of the kindle fire HD graphics, is fun, and free and this game is a clear winner. The graphics are excellent and the game is really fun. Thank you to the creators for making such an awesome, free, app.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Predictable but a quick read....was hoping for a little more for the sequel to A Time to Kill but it moved at a quick pace and worth a weekend read....
B00FQ272ZI|4.0|Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.<br /><br />Working with only one actor and his own 32 page script, director J. C. Chandor (\\"Margin Call\\") creates an unusually effective version of man vs. sea.  Our man (no name used) is Robert Redford and other than an opening letter to family that he narrates, he only has 2 lines that I can recall.  One is a frustrated F-bomb and the other is \\"Help!\\"  Even with no dialog this may be Redford's best performance in a long career of good ones.<br /><br />We have no explanation for why our man is sailing alone in the Indian Ocean, but we soon learn that he knows what he's doing.  Waking one morning to sea water lapping up against him, he finds a huge cargo container full of sneakers had run into the side of his boat.  Enough water had entered the boat that his electrical system and radio were severely damaged.  Using some ingenuity he manages to patch up the hull and head to the nearest shipping lane, hopefully to be rescued.  A violent storm makes a difficult situation nearly hopeless, but our man preservers.<br /><br />Great actors are able to use more than well written dialog to deliver the goods.  To watch Redford work here should erase any doubts that he is on an elite list.  Even mundane scenes like eating a can of beans or taking inventory of his supplies will draw the viewer into his predicament.  Perhaps even more remarkable is that Redford at 77, or thereabouts, performed all the physical activity and stunts in this movie.  The only stunt men I saw in the credits were safety divers.<br /><br />If I have any issues with the film, it has to do with how remarkably close a couple cargo ships came to our man's life raft without seeing him.  Even with him waving his arms frantically and shooting off flairs, the ships just keep on sailing.  Seemed unlikely.  Some might quibble with the ending but for me it was just perfect.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have found this not entirely useful. Since Google has locked out the API it doesn't really do a heck of a lot that I would want to do now that people can no longer write code that will stream to it from other apps that Google hasn't officially sanctioned, which at this point is just Chrome and Netflix. I found that trying to stream to it using the Netflix app on my iPad has some problems. If you start a movie, close the Netflix app, and then return to it, requiring the Netflix app to reload, it loses affinity to Chromecast, and you no longer can control the movie. It will just run until it is done. The fact that it will broadcast a Chrome tab is a novelty only IMHO. Also, when There are practically no controls for this thing other than for setup. I was hoping for Plex support to come out but it hasn't happened yet, so I just got a Roku 3 instead and couldn't be happier with it. This is now gathering dust as I hope that some day Google will change their tune so this is actually &#34;neat&#34; again.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|I saw them in concert then bought the album. This is OneRepublic's best album in YEARS so I was eager to buy it and am very satisfied with the audio quality.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I admit, the first quarter of this book was difficult to get through.  I guess I expected more than just the rumblings of a highschool boy, but after I got to know the character, I really began to appreciate him.  It makes me think of the masks that we all wear, especially in Highschool.....and of the ones we sometimes drag out later in life.  And there are always those people who never remove their masks.  I feel most sad for them, that they feel like they have no one safe to talk to, to show their real self to.<br />This book was about some very sincere friendships, and towards the end, an astonishing realization of why this kid had so many emotional problems.  It leaves me feeling a sense of hope.
B00F3VOL38|4.0|What I came away with was this feeling that, while it's full of fine performances and definitely a recommended addition to a Beatles collection, it honestly wasn't quite as interesting or necessary for me as Vol 1, given that the other collection had the superior selection. It is worth mentioning that \\"Lend Me Your Comb\\" is included here where it belongs (not Anthology 1) and \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" is also great to have.  Unfortunately, we are denied 'A Picture of You', 'Besame Mucho' and 'Dream Baby', all of which are from 1962 and feature Pete Best's last recordings with the band (it may have been a legal complication).<br /><br />I must say I think the biggest and best surprises, other than the cool pictures in the book, are the interviews at the end of each disc.  If you have 10 minutes to interview each Beatle, Brian Matthews did them right.  No trivial petty questions about \\"your type of girl\\", these are revealing and serious interviews, especially for their length.  For me, these are the gems.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|What this story is &#34;saying&#34; is really important, but it gets tedious sometimes wading through Mae's various tallies and measurements.  It is well worth reading and considering its implications in our world today!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Was ok.  But I felt like all together it was a good game. Definitely worth every penny. The HO scenes were pretty good with creative ideas for some of the interactive ones. Challenging but fun. I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes these type games.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Good movie overall. You could see the ending at the beginning. Action was good. Do hope they make a sequel.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game although it is maddening at times. I enjoy the challenge. I would recommend to all my friends and family.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It is a little slow in getting to the main plot.  There are a lot of characters to have to keep up with.
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|this book litterally change my life and change the way i think and see the world.  it is so very simple to read and understand.  this book shows me how to pray properly, how to believe in myself and increase my faith in God.  A whole lot of scriptures make so much more sense to me after this book and many more from Dr. Murphy.  i have read a lot of books on spirituality but none has the same effect on me and on changing my thoughts as this one did.  i have read it and listen to the audiobook version many times.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Great wholesome book!  We read it for our monthly girls book club.  It was very enjoyable to draw out lessons in just being &#34;glad.&#34;  What would happen if everyone chose to play the glad game?
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Very Good Movie, The character of main protagonist re-affirms the faith, belief  and morale in Self...which in the end provides a very good positive message to the society.
B0074VTHKM|2.0|Not well written. Plot extremely weak and just not an easy read. I would not purchase another of John's books, just simply not worth the expense, a very weak author
B002JVWR4U|4.0|I like the slim packaging and it's design, very good for space, much like the slim sets of Buffy, which I love as well, but the casing itself, was completely cracked and the inside holders for the disc bracket was snapped. Now every time that I open the dvd case, the disc holder falls out of the top. I wish they were more careful with these, sigh, now I'll have to replace the case.<br /><br />So, just a warning for people ordering, you'd better hope they're more careful with the package during delivery. Clearly it can be damaged easily.<br /><br />As for series &DVD's themselves - I'm a big fan of the show, the DVD's are great and I'm very happy with them. No complaints.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoying playing. But I wish I had the option to skip some of the levels. Level 70 was so boring & of course I got stuck there for weeks. I almost stop playing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was fascinating to learn what happened to Danny and what the future held for him.  I am a major Stephen King fan and love the continuity in his novels.
B0068THAGY|3.0|Super 8 had a little too much going on for my taste. I don't mind multiple storylines converging, but that will always wind up watering down other aspects of the story. Still glad I saw this movie, though -- very interesting setting and characters; I felt like I was watching Goonies at times (in a good way).
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Too much modern influence, the music was rap and other mixes.  I was expecting a re-make of the original and it's nothing like the original.  Loved the actors and actresses but wasn't fond of the new format.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I'm a big fan of the Divergent series and this book didn't come close to the other two. It just seemed to be all over the place and to me didn't tie in real well the other two books. I did like how Roth took the chance and killed off one of the main characters at the end but besides that not too thrilled about the book big disappointment.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Allegiant is not as well-written as the first two books; others have aptly described the confusing POV switches that fail to convey sufficient voice to clarify who's speaking as well as the sometimes-dragging abundance of rambling, confusing detail without the phenomenal action and dialogue characteristic of the first two books.  While disappointing, I could live with that.<br />But the ending is just wrong.  Having gathered from internet chatter that something was off about it, I braced myself while reading, trying to predict what plot twist might have upset so many.  I do not believe readers deserve a HEA necessarily, especially if the author clearly justifies the unhappy ending. And I had prepared myself to be ok with anything from Tris or Tobias being permanently injured to something driving a wedge between them that would permanently keep them apart (much like Collins irritatingly, inexplicably did to Katniss and Gale in Mockingjay).  But what Roth actually did was far worse than I could have imagined.  I still can't believe it!  Despite how wonderfully written and engaging all the rest of Roth's series is, as other dismayed reviewers have commented, I will never again read any of the 3 books (although, also like others, I generally reread good book series multiple times) because the series' ending ruined everything for me forever.  I don't know whether I will still see the Divergent movie when it's released; I would be much more willing and eager if someone assured me the ultimate ending would be rewritten for the movie (though in general I hate that practice).<br />Authors, especially YA authors and especially authors of series, do have some obligation to consider their loyal readers when deciding how to handle their main characters.  By the time readers reach the conclusion of a book series, they have invested considerable money, time, and most importantly, emotion in support of the author, specifically in her characters' lives.  In return, readers trust theauthor to treat her characters generously, justly, rationally, and kindly.  After spending 3 books, therefore, fostering readers' attachment to the hero and/or heroine, Roth choosing to do what she did in the end without justifying it satisfactorily to a majority of readers is a shocking betrayal of that trust.
B00D8CSVLW|3.0|The basis of the story was interesting but towards the end the detailed court scenes seemed to more about lengthening the story than actually contributing to it.
B000JO9JHW|1.0|I know this is popular, but I didn't make it 10 minutes into the first show and the violence was too much for me.
B00AHHODH2|2.0|The idea had possibilities but the characters didn't excite me.  I felt that they were not fully developed and really not that likeable.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I enjoyed this book so much. It was insightful on one woman's path in her career and how she navigated the stress of work and home. I wish it was required reading for men.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|It has a nice tempo, it's coherent and both specific enough so you get picture things the way you're supposed to but vague enough that you let your imagination wonder around things. On the down side, it doesn't any type of closure, just like the first book, it's more like a tome instead of a novel by it self, it's stories cannot live without the first book or the third (that's a guess since it's not out yet), also the end of the book feels kind of rushed when compared with the rest of the book.
B00DJ735KI|5.0|Incredible. Mind blowing. Inspiring. Bruce Lipton brings to light absolute truths that need to be accepted and lived by rather than shunned and feared.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Nice to read, very entertaining, it opens and welcomes you to a solid and well form universe. Never the less, it feels too much like an introduction, I'd understand that the main plot remains open for the next installments, but there is only closure to just a few subplots, some of them are not even mentioned in the next book and feel forgotten.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The concept of this book was brilliant. Obviously &#34;dystopia&#34; societies are all the rage right now, thanks to The Hunger Games, but this one was fresh. I can't wait to read more!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Never imagined I would watch this kind of show. I love it. Can't wait for the next episode. The characters become so real and their relationships are complex. They are like genuine people caught in a horrible world that I want to know what happens all the time. It's Five Star all the way. Keep it coming!
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Got it fast and is exactly what I wanted! My son is getting it for Christmas! He will love it!
B00ESNE696|5.0|awesome! one two three. four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen
B003274QH6|5.0|We've absolutely loved watching this series. Not only is it entertaining, so many of the themes explored make for great dinnertime discussion. I've loved discussion the moral issues raised with my wife as we progress through the season. Because of the very real, graphic nature of these issues, this is a series suited for adults and probably not kids.
0452295548|5.0|Insightful and moving. As a health practitioner I found this book to be of great importance as it informed me in a very accessible manner of the workings of the brain. I have recommended this book to many clients.
B00DQVSTCG|4.0|Love this concert, however the sound is awful! And picture quality is not the best. I would recommend waiting until they release a replacement.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This was a fairly decent science fiction story for those wanting to escape a dull day. Something that is entertaining with just enough battles to keep you watching. A bit predictable but overall well made from a new set of acting cast.
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|Really awesome game. Great graphics and great game play. I never expected i would enjoy a game like boxing on a tablet. With kindle, this game is extra awesome.
0345803493|4.0|It was good. Not sure what all the hoopla is all about. I thought the first book was much better with a more realistic and interesting story line. This one is okay. and kind of like it is looking for a new hook to keep one interested in the book other than the sex. Overall she did a good job.
B000NPLLGY|4.0|What makes or break a band? I think Vicky Blue does a good job capturing what made The Runaways such an important fixture in rock n roll history. But it's a story partly told where teenage passion, talent and insecurity got the better of all of them. Between this film, a couple of books and an embellished cinematic feature you get a better glimpse of the mechanics that went into building the band. I think Joan Jett says it best, you had girls willing to sacrifice and dedicate themselves to being rock stars and then the others who didn't realize what all of that meant. They simply weren't on the same page and what could have been the female Rolling Stones imploded on themselves. Worth watching if you're a rock and roll fan and have interest in The Runaways.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The book had a very disappointing ending.  After the first two books, I was excited to finish the last one only to be let down in the story and the conclusion.
B002N14GPE|5.0|I'm glad to see all the positive reviews on here because this film deserves no less than four stars, and that's only if I'm in a harsh mood.  The phenomenal acting (particularly Vera and all the children), casting, and filming leave hardly any room for critique..  I highly suggest stop reading this review and simply watch the movie for yourself!<br /><br />Please, please, please take the negative reviews of this film, both by professionals and consumers, with a grain of salt since such reviewers more often than not are not true fans of the genre, hence are in no capacity to adequately judge a piece like this.  That being said,for those who are easily swayed by mainstream reviews,  Roger Ebert gave this film 3.5 out of 4 stars which is a score hard to come by.
B007Z9RS22|3.0|This movie  would have been awesome if the ending were right. I didn't like the ending at all. (Big Spoiler Alert), had they both been together at the end i would have given it 5 out of 5, rest of the movie was good.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Love Shaun the Sheep!  One of the few shows my children (3 and 5) and I enjoy equally.  Funny, cute, and wholesome.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|THIS A GREAT SHOW!!! The court room drama is just a small part. Stories and actors interact wonderfully. Well done!!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I didn't know how to play chess, but my son had some knowledge and wanted to play with me.  This game allowed me to play with him.  I now know how the pieces move and even have a bit of strategy.
B00AEFYNTU|5.0|Amazon always has good deals on brand new DVD's. This is just another example. I will always search Amazon before I purchase any DVD.
B000005RFQ|3.0|I've listened through this album numerous times in an attempt to have it 'grow on me,' but there is very little I like about it musically. I just finished it again while writing this review. Sorry to any Gillan fans out there, but I've never been a huge fan of Ian's voice in any lineup. It just doesn't appeal to me. And the ultra-1980s recording techniques are really bothersome. The echoy drums sound horrible, and the arrangements don't strike me as being much like Bill Ward's classic style. Tony's distortion is also way over-saturated. The music just doesn't sound like Black Sabbath, in my opinion. \\"Keep it Warm\\" is the most non-Sabbath track I've ever heard. I love every other non-Ozzy album (even up through Cross Purposes and Forbidden), and among the Ozzy albums, Never Say Die is close to my favorite, so I'm no purist. In spite of everything I just said, this album still holds a lot of significance for many Sabbath fans I know. This was 'the' album that my friend listened to over and over again in his basement, wearing out the vinyl. It's not entirely unappealing, but it would definitely be at the bottom of my Sabbath album ranking.<br /><br />Does anyone else think the song \\"Digital Bitch\\" sounds a lot like \\"Highway Star\\" by Deep Purple? I keep expecting Ian to break out with the \\"Nobody's gonna take my car\\" line. It seems like they were intentionally trying to blend MkII Purple and Sabbath sounds on this album.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Mysterious, dramatic, compelling. Yes, Stephen King is back with all his imagination going strong. He writes to your own imagination and I can clearly scare the fire out of myself with his help. Way to go Stephen!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Buy it! It is well worth your money.  The author does an awesome job with the characters and the plot, there are tons of twist and turns to keep you turning the page.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It's like Downton Abbey without the wealth :-)  The characters are believable and the story lines are awesome.  I am hooked!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very entertaining, light, quick, compelling read.  Story line moves quickly and very believable with very well outlined characters so reads like watching a movie
B00FAT9W0A|5.0|Keane is my favorite band and I was thrilled to get so many &#34;new&#34; songs I'd never heard before on disc 2! The two brand new songs on disc 1, &#34;Higher Than The Sun&#34; and &#34;Won't Be Broken&#34; are lovely and I enjoy all of the tracks on that disc, though I already own most of them. It's really disc 2 that I was most looking forward to and honestly every single song is amazing and I'm surprised they'd never released them before! &#34;Russian Farmer's Song,&#34; &#34;Allemande,&#34; &#34;Myth,&#34; &#34;Snowed Under,&#34; and &#34;Walnut Tree&#34; are particularly impressive and they are that type of song you immediately want to hear again after you listen to them the first time-seriously so cool! The CD case and interior is very classy looking and I love the album art. This CD is a must have if you are a Keane fan or even if you are just getting to know them! This album is way, way cool. Bravo, Keane. :)
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|I recently upgraded to LR 5 from LR 3, so of course I needed a new book. I got incredible results following the instructions in this comprehensive, well organized guide. I am very happy with it.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Excellent overview that is highly readable. Schlosser uses the deadly mishap at a Titan-II missile silo in Arkansas in 1980 as the entry point to examine the development of nuclear weapons from the Manhattan Project to post-9/11. Focusing on the issues of safety and control, this book will scare and amaze the reader in turns.
1400052181|5.0|This book comes with so much praise and attention that I wonder if it makes much sense to add my own few words. It is without doubt a very good and very interesting book. It tells a story of Science, of how one lines of cells helped in understanding and developing medicines for a large number of human ailments. It also tells the story of the life of the woman, Henrietta Lacks, the original cells were taken from, and of her family. The book tells these stories as a kind of mystery story in which the author explains her own interest in the subject, and her own story in doing the research. As the research and writing took place over a ten year period it is a story of persistence and ingenuity.<br />Rebecca Skloot also writes with a great deal of sympathy and understanding for Henrietta Lacks and her family. The story of Henrietta's final illness is harrowing. And the story of her family will take, I suspect, most readers into a kind of world of relationships they know little of. The kinds of abuse and  cruelty which went on within the broader Lacks family and the horrible inhumane discrimination 'colored people' suffered are made painfully clear.<br />Skloot is a professional science writer and she knows how to tell the scientific part of the story in a way understandable to the general reader.<br />The irony of many of the Lacks' family being without insurance when Henrietta Lacks , albeit uintentionally, made such a great contribution to the general public health is underlined.<br />I agree with almost everybody who has reviewed this work that it is a truly outstanding and memorable one.
B003E8GQ76|5.0|Great acting and a great story about how we all are looking for a connection. Some of us find it while others spend their whole lives searching.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It's just okay. I was looking for a more fast paced conclusion of the trilogy. The first two books are a must read this one not so much.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This in one of the first books in a long time that had me reading it straight through the day and into the night.  Wonderful story-telling, and excellent characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its awesome and addicting plus nothing beats being a minion for gru. its free so you have no reason not to get it.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|Love this movie.  Actually I love Ryan Renolds.  He's so fine.  This movie has a lot of comedy and action which I love.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|By far one of my most favorite bingo games!  Easy to play, great rewards, and super addictive!  Download it now!!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excellent book, continuing the teachings of inner power.  Recommended by Louise Hay and I had to get it. Thank you.
1742204147|5.0|This book has been invaluable to the planning of our Japan vacation.  I like that it gives tips of what to do, but doesn’t go through a fully detailed itineraries.  I like planning our own vacations to fit around what we want to do.  I’ve never found a planned itinerary to fit well.  In the Lonely Planet book, they make suggestions of must do’s in various cities.  That helps for the high level planning for the trip.  From there, they have the standard listings for hotels,restaurants,etc…  That is useful just to find potentially interesting places to stay and eat, however I will never book a place to stay without looking at user reviews and pictures.  I also like that it has a lot of detail about values and traditions in Japan.  It’s important to realize that we are visitors and we should make an effort to adapt to the local customs so not to offend.<br />All of my comments on the book are based on planning before our trip.  Based on that, I have a great impression of the book.  However, if after the trip I find numerous inaccuracies in the book then I will update the review accordingly.
B0012QRPU4|3.0|I am trying to hang in there because so many people say it is so great but it is rather depressing through season one.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Over all, it is a nice game. Really fun and cute concept, Great replay value, lovely recorded scene from you previous playing for reviewing your own performance. Our whole family enjoys this little game. The only reason I wihtdraw one star is there should be a tutorial for how to control the button for run and jump.  Yes you can eventually figuire out how to play by your own if you keep trying but it could be very frustrated.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Homeland is a well-written, on the edge of your seat, unpredictable fabulous show!  HIghly recommend.  Don't miss first season - must see! must see!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it, this is a very fun and challenging game. I play this in my free time. Can get<br />Friends by way of facebook.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really loved this book!  It was interesting read. It was a quick as well.  I recommend it anyone. We are reading it for my book club.
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|It was great to read about the pros and cons of working remote and some general guidelines to ensure working remote will be effective.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Bill Bryson has a very winning writing style and tells a great story.  I love history and this book tells the history of 1927 in a very pleasant and interesting way.
0312323867|5.0|I roared through this book, finishing it in about a week!  I couldn't get enough of it.  It's quite simply, a really FUN read!<br /><br />The main character, Darcy Rhone is a shallow egotistical, mostly unlikable women in her late twenties.  Oh...and she's also very pretty - able to use her spectacular looks to get  just about anything she wants in life, including the perfect guy who she's about to marry.<br /><br />Now I think it's interesting to read a book from such a gorgeous shallow person's point of view...to literally get inside the head of this completely self-centered (B-word alert....ha=ha)!  I don't think I have ever encountered a main character such as this.<br /><br />Usually main characters are characters you route for....and usually, that works best.  After all, we want to like and care about the star of the story, right?<br /><br />Well...somehow, the author makes this weird set-up work!  I love the way she writes everything that the main character is thinking and feeling.....it's so gripping and engaging to read, because it makes the person seem totally real!  And yes, I did not care for Darcy at all!  But that was okay, because it was just fun finding out what she was thinking...and often quite humorous, too!<br /><br />It was interesting reading how the super pretty operate...and also to discover that things do not always go their way, despite their good looks and magical hold over men....and also, how very needy such people like this can be ....needy of constant affirmations all the time.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book for a good vacation or beach read....or really, a good read any time!  It's pure escapism and fun....never a dull moment!  And no, you do not need to read the other book (Something Borrowed) first.  I didn't, and it did not matter..  Although I now intend to read that book since I enjoyed this one so much!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a very clever show unlike most of the mindless or violent stories that are offered on TV.  Its rather a sophisticated soap opera  that leaves one hanging waiting to find out how Mike and Harvey will get out of each situation.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The first two books in the series are great. Don't want to spoil anything if anyone decides to read, so will just say I am generally disappointed with the entire third book.
B00ESJICMC|5.0|I could hardly wait for mind to arrive.It was well worth it. James Blunt out did himself. this time. All of the songs on this CD I absolutely love.If I had to pick my favorite song on this CD I would never do it because they are all fantastic Way to go James.<br /><br />.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son and two nieces actually plays this game.  It keeps him occupied when I have other things to do.  He's four yrs. of age and plays it better then I do
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive.  Love hate relationship!!! Can't seem too stop. It's no longer fun to me. Stuck on a level. I refuse to spend any more money!!!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|It's awesome! Best Iron Man yet! Picks up where The Avengers left off. Robert Downey Jr. puts on a great a great performance.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|if  you liked one and two  three is about the same Vegas is not good for them  but good movie
B0038NN3B4|5.0|so far i have lost 11 pounds and want to keep on going. not following it to the letter by any means but still im losing weight.. yahoooo
B00G32OER4|1.0|My wife made me go to the theatre to see this movie, I wasted 2 hrs. of my life I will never get back, first of all I really enjoy all the reality ghost shows haunted collector, ghost hunters and so on. So initially I did not mind going to the theatre to see this film, the movie starts out saying based on true events,  the film starts out the first hour like okay not bad then all of a sudden Hollywood gets involved, this movie got so bad, if you believe a quarter of the last half hour was even close to being true you are very gulliable, in fact I own some beautiful land in the everglades I would love to sell you. If the would not have said in the beginning of the film based on true events I would not be writing this, I would have just wrote typical run of the mill Hollywood horror flick. This film has been made in Hollywoods hundreds of times before this film was made, and much better versions, I would not waste my time or money on this film it is really BAD!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I think it is a very exciting game but the well known dinos you need cash(in-game cash) and maybe more websites that give cash and are more kid friendly like not having to pay for something or not have to log in a discovery card.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Intricate intelligent gripping brutal tale!<br />Martin's keen vision is amazing! Every detail is rich and interwoven to the main movement of this gripping tale. He brings each character in each family (House) to brilliant earthy life. Great voice for a woman's character.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is very good to me a like it a lot and I liked what it's about too. It is the best book in the world!This is a great way for parents to entertain their children.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|KEN Follett. Is simply one fantastic story teller .  I have read every one of his books and they just keep getting better. My only slight criticism is that his main characters are in every major spot in history and too many coincidences of meeting each other. But I can accept that as the story line is just so good. I highly recommend this book.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Sam and Dean are great.  I especially love when they are dealing with the Angels and &#34;the new king of hell&#34;.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the Star Trek movies and it is interesting to see the stars in their youth.
1476727651|4.0|I have been reading Stephen King since the first Shinning book hit the stands.  It is great to see Danny as an adult and to find out what happened to the Overlook and the prior characters.  It just seems that he has gone down a darker path of how he views society.  It seems everyone Danny meets in this new book is either a drug dealer, prostitute or alcoholic.
1576875776|5.0|Love her ability to capture the mood of the times. She really understood her available light and the photos are very simple. I love her work.
0143124544|4.0|This is worth reading for the insights into the world of the parapalegic and the character development of the lead female character.  It is not a 5 star because the first 100 pages lagged for me and because of the Oprah-ish tearfulness toward the end.  Yet Moyes does manage to keep the ending un-predictable even though it was not surprising.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its a great game keeps me on my toes all the time has a great need for me to keep focused
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|Atwood has no equal in satirical writing. The  MaddAddam trilogy  will surely live for ages!  I gave this 3rd book of the trilogy only 4 stars because I found &#34;The Year of the Flood&#34; to be more riveting.  Perhaps it is unfair to compare the books.  If compared to other satires, MaddAddam rates 5 stars.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Characters are well developed against historical background. I'm still reading it and looking forward to what happens to them. Ken Follett is always a fine read.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This was a disappointing end to the series and I almost gave up on it before I even finished.  For starters, I did not like the writing style of jumping back and forth from Tris to Tobias.  It made it difficult to know who's point of view you were reading and I found myself having to go back to double check more than once.  I also thought the actual ending was pretty lame.  It's almost like the author just couldn't think of anything else, so she just stopped.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|A great replacement for Google reader.  I don't have to use the send to kindle for every article anymore now that I have this on the kindle.
0670026638|2.0|It can be a problem when a book is highly recommended, disappointment is sometimes not far down the road.  I felt lectured to throughout most of this novel, by Ruth (main character as an autobiographical stand in), Oliver, Old Jiko and even Nao.  Somewhere along the way the narrative became so contrived that any suspended disbelief was impossible on my part.  The biggest problem is that there are two novels here struggling to stay married to each other.  The novel that is 15 year old Nao's story is most appropriate for a YA audience and Ruth's story is that of a middle-aged woman who is adrift in her own life and wants to remedy that but doesn't know how.  There is also the cultural confusions of the character's-am I American or am I Japanese? theme that further hijacks the storytelling.  All in all, some good nuggets that are lost on an island in British Columbia.
B00006AW2J|5.0|What a great record! Like most of my generation, Mick was kind of getting ridiculous as I came to adolescence, and I couldn't understand why he was such a threat to the establishment. This record answers some of that question. I can't really call any of this record filler and this was Brian's last record with the Stones before getting the boot and dying. Of Sympathy for the Devil and Street Fighting Man, enough has been written, but even some of the deeper cuts are just classic. Jigsaw Puzzle and Stray Cat Blues are now favorite Stones tracks of mine and the country tunes are getting a little closer to the mark, if a little laughable (Mick's fake American accent is priceless!). At this late point in my life, I'm finding No Expectations to be a great track. A great addition to this album would be seeing the Stones' Rock and Roll Circus, even if the WHo stole the show.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Excellent film, great script, superb acting all combine to form probably the best of all of the Alien series. I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of the robot by Fassbinder, and his interaction with Noomi Rapace. This movie will be a classic sci-fi movie in the future. I'm just waiting for a sequel. The dialogue is real, the people are 3 dimensional, and (unlike many other films of the genre) the actors actually get to speak intelligently to each other.
B0000067X1|5.0|If you buy only one record by Can, maybe this should be it. Damo Suzuki was a wild man and Can was just the vehicle to make him immortal.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|As Bettlejuice himself might say, I've seen this movie  &#34;...ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SEVEN TIMES, AND IT KEEPS GETTING FUNNIER EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE IT...&#34; And as encouragement to watch till the end, perhaps the best scene in the movie is when Lydia is dancing to Harry Belafonte's &#34;Shake Shake Senora&#34;.<br />Remember, it's not that the living CAN'T see the dead, it's that the living usually WON'T see them.<br />This is a fun movie with great cameos and great acting by the stars... if you haven't seen it, see it; if you have seen it before, enjoy it again. Maybe with a Zagnut.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have a first gen. Kindle Fire (not a HD) and I had no problems with the download / install / in-game crashes. I would recommend this game to any and all magic players. and even if it doesn't  work, I say give it a try :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This season was not quite as good as the first but still worth a watch, if only to get to season 3. Can't wait for season 4.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Leave out the sex and you are left with a simple story like Cinderella, and not as compelling. And compared to other stuff out there, the sex is pretty mild.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Very well written and easy to get back into after stopping for a while. I am learning about a period (late 1920s) that I knew little about.
1451688091|5.0|I am not a history buff.  I ordered this book because I loved the movie so much.  But it is written so well, the author makes it seem exciting, as if the events were happening today.  The people came alive, and the book was full of information I didn't know before.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent  book. Great read. Full of twists and turns. Highly recommend it. Kept you wondering what was going to hapen. I had to stay up late to finish it.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|This book is just OK if you have the patience to wade through 400 pages+ of mainly dull background before getting a mediocre reward climax.  This is certainly not one of Grisham's better books.  I cannot understand any of the five star ratings.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I admit it.  I bought into the hype.  I thought that this would be a good, cheap little device for me to supplement my Roku with.  Well, I was right, it is cheap.  At $35, it is almost a steal.  Almost....<br /><br />What the Chromecast ended up becoming for me is a device which allowed me to easily stream Youtube videos on my TV without the need for a more expensive device.  The &#34;casting&#34; of Chrome browser tabs just didn't work the way it could have, and the apps which support it are extremely limited.  The small handful of apps which are supported, Youtube notwithstanding, are available on a Roku, most other streaming boxes, and many connected TVs and DVD players now.  Also, since it requires another device to tell it what to play, and to pause and stop the video, I did have issues where it wouldn't respond to my devices' commands.<br /><br />I don't regret buying the Chromecast, though I am disappointed for having to wait so long to get it (I ordered it 7/29/13, and got it around the 10th of September) just to see for myself that a lot of the complaints were accurate.  The upside is that I found tons and tons of content on Youtube actually worth watching.  It is possible that if Google releases the SDK to other developers, that more and more apps will appear that could make this little dongle an incredible value.  Thanks to Google keeping the SDK closed, however, it isn't anywhere near where it could be.
B005HJAOLY|3.0|A good read but simplistic relative to King's typical style. Not much revealed about the 'evil character's' origins or purpose.
B0045IPOPE|4.0|one classic Vietnam movie. the time and location where they were in great actors and name of the movie vietnam one crazy place to be at that time.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The app has gotten buggy and is not fully functional. For instance, when I try to use the popup names to address a message, it won't let me select one; I must type the entire name. I wanted to uninstall and re-install, but the option to  Remove from device isn't available.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|I love the movie; I am completely dissatisfied with Flixster/Ultraviolet.  The Digital copy on this disc is NOT, I repeat NOT compatible with iTunes.  Since I preordered it, the packaging photos were not up yet and I bought this specifically because it had the Digital Version.  I had to download some app onto my Mac just to be able to &#34;download&#34; it.  But I cannot move it over to iTunes.  Furthermore the customer service at Ultraviolet was completely unsympathetic and said that it was my fault, I should have read the box.  You know what I can read, your name on packaging, I will make sure I never buy anything that says it on there ever again!
B00DHRLK84|5.0|This has now become one of my favorite movies.  Watched it again yesterday (in 3D of course).  Prior to this my favorite Sci Fi/Horror was the Matrix.  So glad Z is in my video library.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Okay, but a bit confusing, and you it doesn't give me a large enough screen??? Its still a fun game.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Movie was extremely well done; story line was good and very plausible.  Daniel Craig, as James Bond, brings a more realistic and edgier portrayal to the Bond character.  Dame Judi Dench is at her best.
B00G32TD98|4.0|Very scary and edge of your seat! I screamed through the entire thing. The only thing that would have made it better is if they would have shown less of the demon woman. That took away from the scariness because it wasn't realistic.
B0013F1D02|5.0|What an enjoyable movie!  Clare Danes had me wishing stars really could call to the earth. What a role departure for Robert deniro. He played the role beautifully. All in all I was transported by the story and the actors.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|The Followill boys did it again. It only took 2 full listens to love this album. From beginning to end, it is a very strong album. They sound extremely tight and there's definitely a lot of progression to their sound but you know it's KoL.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Beautiful writing, and an engrossing story of 'coming to terms' with a life-changing event, the death of the author's mother.  One would seldom think of months of trekking through the California mountains is a way to accomplish what the author managed to accomplish, but being with her in this book--every step of the way, virtually--was a terrific experience.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I always expect the world from these guys and they definitely delivered here. The only thing I'm mad about is that it didn't come out sooner! Josh and the boys sound great. It's one of my favorite albums of the year.
B00FQU8XTE|5.0|One of the best Christmas albums I've ever gotten...we really enjoy the silent night and o'come Emmanuel songs, absolutely peaceful and calming renditions
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I won't waste anyone's time with a review of the films which are obviously fantastic. This is more about how beautiful the Blu-rays look. I was actually surprised at the clarity and for anyone worried that it would take away from the classic feel of the films, you shouldn't be. What an amazing job Coppola did on the restoration.
039916409X|5.0|Margaret M Lynch is THE best at this. She is honest, direct, FUN, energised, truly inspirational. Her work has so far shifted MASSES of stuff for me around money. She was the first one in my mind to &#34;name&#34; the pain and frustration of The Secret not working and WHY......pinpointing with accuracy all the underlying unconscious vows, resistences and blocks to implementing the Law of Attraction! She is my tapping priestess....buy, it, read it....and good tapping everyone!!
B00158K0S8|5.0|Any movie you care about enough to buy on disk should be Bluray when possible. The detail cannot be beat.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I bought this for my daughter. I buy her the greys editions every year. She loves these dvds. I am sure I will be buying her the new one next year from here
B000MV90IU|5.0|Bluray brings visual detail to this classic you'll never see on standard definition tv. Extra features are always great too.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|This cool little book reads quickly and makes it's ideas very accessible. I enjoyed reading it and will likely do so again.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I often wondered if this could ever be pulled off.  What a terrific movie.  I love Alan Alda & always will.  It arrived earlier than expected & was in excellent condition.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It has been terrific comes in handy what i always needed I think it is very good you should buy it
1250038820|5.0|It is a great window to hidden stories that lay in every human being. Brandon has  a gift to reveal them in stunning ways :)
B00G4I0DNG|5.0|Very sad!  But eye opening.  We as people should not have such beautiful creatures in tanks! A good movie to watch.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|The game is amazing and has some awesome graphics for a mobile device game. I like it and think it is pretty good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story and acting is 5 stars.  It's actually addictive. Looking foreword tor season 4. Love  it  Love it.  Excellent
B00821OX98|4.0|Falling skies is one of the best shows that I have seen in sometime.  Some of the dialog is a bit cheesey but the show is a great watch.  I feel like this is a newer take on alien mythology, i love the fact that it is AFTER the aliens have taken over.  I also like that it is not just 45 minutes of aliens and gunfire... It is the human condition during the alien apocalypse.  Some will say it is a soap opera, but I would disagree.  The only thing I do not like is the use of the character Pope... I think his development is ackward and is a bit distracting from the story.  Overall I highly recommend this show.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|AMAZING. Except when Hans Landa spends too much time drinking milk. But then, AMAZING all the rest of the time.
B00G4I0DNG|5.0|Everyone should watch this!!! Very touching really makes you think. I will Ionger support sea world! Full of information. I loved it
B005J9ZE5I|4.0|I got this because so many people were telling me how I just had to watch this. And so I watched it and  I'd give it like an 8.5 out of 10. Sometimes it ventured too far into the sped up slapstick that I absolutely can't stand, but then quickly rebounded with brilliant stuff like when the hand spots the knife. Really, really good.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|Perfect Nikon OEM replament, Fits like a glove and does not cause Viginetting. Have seen many others do this, especially the one's that thread into the filter ring
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great John Gresham book. The only thing wrong with this Grisham book is that it is so good I finished it in 2 days. His books are so easy to read, and interesting that I can't put them down. I read them so fast that I can't wait for the next one to come out. I try to pace myself but to make them last but get caught up in the story and just keep going.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Probably the best zombie movie. And it's hilarious. Can't go wrong buying this one! The blue ray showed up in perfect condition and in fast fashion.
0765338149|5.0|One of the best sci-fi stories I've ever read.  If you like this genre, you'll like this book.  Looking forward to the movie.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|This is too long ago to remember. There is no more to say on the subject so all Iknow to do is quit writing.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book did not impress me at all. Had to force myself to get through it. I felt it was very poorly written and sounded like a science fiction book. I  read many books on life after death and work as a respiratory therapist in the hospital and have spoken with patients after they have been clinically dead. This guy was not even dead.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|No one's perfect.  As soon as I started reading it the charge went out of my electronic book reader and we haven't figured out a way to easily charge both of ours in both the kitchen and bedroom.  I'm trying to outguess the author as to why he is having the activity declared a homicide and not a suicide.  It must be a homicide even though it looks like an open and shut case of suicide.
B000O599ZS|5.0|This will always remain a classic - not just a classic, John Wayne movie. A 'must see' for any western aficionado.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am with everyone else.  I enjoyed the first two very much and couldn't wait to get the final one.  I even put in a &#34;pre-order&#34; so that as soon as it hit my kindle I could start reading it.  I didn't like that fact that the author wrote as both Tris and Tobias.  That was kind of lame but I got used to it.  It had exciting moments but had some that really dragged.  I knew that it wasn't going to be a happy ending per say but to actually kill off the main character was just ridculous and like another review I read, it just left me feeling sad.  The bad guys are not supposed to win.  Why in the world would you create this wonderful character, mold her and make her into what she became just to kill her off?  Not even with a lot of ceramony either.  I do not see where this final book even makes any sense to read.  Especially if you don't want to be depressed and just plain angry.  I think I might just have to steer clear of any more of her books and that's a shame because I really would have liked to read something else she might have wrote.
0525953728|5.0|A terrific and explanatory book about the training and life of a U.S. Navy SEAL. A 'must read' for those interested in Special Operations units.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Enjoyable reading.  Excellent flow of story.  Characters well developed.  I look forward to many more adventures in the tales of legal suspense.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Fantastic writing and compelling story lines in every show.  I was hooked on the very first episode.  When I chose to watch the show, I thought it would be a Law and Order derivative, but was I ever wrong!  The risque backstory is just as edge-of-your-seat as the cases that the firm tries.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the maturity of the show.  The only pitfall is the one dimensionality of Alicia sometimes.  She might be too good, but even that works here.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I chose 5 stars because I liked reading this book. It was sad and good. I would recommend this book to Nicholas and Tyler. It cuss in this book.
B005FPT51K|1.0|The video can be viewed only from the same WIFI. It does not work via 3G or from another WIFI. Very disappointed :(
B001CTGQBK|5.0|One of my all time favorites!!!! Now my daughter is in love with Danny Zucko too! She wants to go to a singing high school! And it's a million times better than High School Musical!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great Blue-ray 3D movie.  Awesome special effects in 3D.  Movie appears inspired by Zhuangzi's butterfly dream, which can be found here:  [[ASIN:0231129599 Zhuangzi Basic Writings Burton Watson]]
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The writer did an excellent job on creating interesting characters that grabbed the readers interest right from the start. The relationship do the characters was a great mystery that the reader tries to solve before being told. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. RC
B002QH2NUA|1.0|Don't remember ever ordering this.  Interesting and would have liked to have seen him but the record couldn't take it's place
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Absolutely addicting!! I watch it, my daughter watches it, my sister watches it.  OMG I can't wait for Season 4!!
0425261360|1.0|I was very disappointed! I am a huge Scarpetta fan, but this read was a waste of my  time. I strongly suggest that you consider another Scarpetta read.
B0082XJGRK|5.0|All of Washington DC should read this book.  I mean it.  This was a man of discipline and ethics.  On second thought, this should be required reading in every American high school!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It was a very disappointing third book with a disappointing ending. I wouldn't pay to see this movie if they were thinking of making one. It's like the author ran out of gas but still trying to get to the finish line. It's torturous!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I have recommended this book to several friends.  It's not a real heavy read but worth it!  I am going to read some more of this author's book for sure!
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|fun and entertaining. smart lead characters, heart warming. lead is rather similar to sheldon cooper ;) good read. highly recommend for weekend getaway.
B008Y5T5ZE|2.0|Predictable and boring.  Not one of Depp's best films.  If it hadn't been free, I would be very unhappy right now.  The ending was really stupid.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Great Grishman writing.  The detail and tone were top notch.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there were too many references to character quirks from previous stories.  I've read all the other stories but I didn't like being reminded that I wasn't remembering all the details about charactors from books I read years ago.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|Despite the numerous reviews saying that this book is not about cancer or dying, let's be very clear that it is, without any doubt, about cancer and dying.  But before you decide that it is not for you, it is definitely a must read. Your life would be the poorer for not having been introduced to Hazel Grace and Augustus, who are two of the most likeable characters I have encountered.  This is not a sentimental portrayal of dying teenagers, but rather a very real look at what it means to be a teenager with cancer.  Despite the seriousness of the subject, there is still loads of humour in the book, but be warned, it is heart-breaking!<br /><br />John Green is a talented writer and each sentence is brilliantly constructed.  It is impossible to read this book and not feel admiration for his skill.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator all the time. The numbers are large and its always accurate. This is a great app.
B005K17RU0|1.0|As my title says, the recent update absolutely ruined this app!  This was a big 100 step backwards update and now its time to find a new weather app.  Stay away from this horrible thing.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Its awesome. It makes easier to text for an old  soon to be senior citizen. Love it. Love it it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As a long time Grisham fan, I had eagerly awaited this book and I was not disappointed.  Each time I think that he has done his best, he outdoes himself on the next one.  This time, I am sure this is his best.  The suspense had me holding my breath from early in the novel and at no tim did I anticipate the resolution.  I am continually amazed at his depiction of the people of his setting.  I do believe that I know some of these folks!  He made the people of this small Mississippi town come alive!  I felt their pain, tasted their food, and shed their tears.  Though I am not from that state, I do believe that I have driven though many towns just like that one with the boarded up businesses and homes, the weed choked fields and the square with its folks waiting for court to start.  I am telling you, he made it come alive.  As the will was read, the suspense in that room caught in my throat and I felt for each of the people and I was hooked.  The book is wonderful and there is such a lesson to be learned for today's families.  This has to be a must read!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I thought the series was very well thought out. I kinda hope we don't turn out like that, but if someone can imagine it....
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Fun show, it was great to watch a lifestyle, that is not reality, their clothing are gorgoues, there mannerisms, is fun too. It made me realize our now a days that is slowly, gone from our society, edicate also, is slipping away. The story plots were good also, from having babies, weddings and war, how it effects everyone, love can come and go, so quickly, by the grace of God, not sure about the love, but life. Enjoyed all the different episodes.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This was a great story by a great author!  I won't go into detail, since potential book buyers can look at the summary listed for this book and the story is so complex.  But the subject matter was original, a lot of the historical background was sound, and the botany part of the story was of great interest to me.  I liked this book better than Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love.  It was a winner that I will long remember!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest, great ideas, for any event- to crafts, to seeing world, to culture, to your backyard. You can share ideas with family and friends too. It is just a fun site to help decorating or reorganizing, enjoyed it very much.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|Gypsy and Applause are the only good tracks on this record.  I really liked her previous efforts though, particularly Born This Way, but this is just goofy...it's not even really music, it's like sounds with her vocals.  I get it..the artist must grow, blah blah...but it's just not catchy music in my opinion.  Aura has a really beautiful chorus, but the rest isn't any good...I couldn't bare the others.  I'm not  someone who hates Lady Gaga either...I gave BTW 5 stars because that record is good.  Maybe next time she'll do better, but for now I guess I'll get out my trusty Cyndi Lauper CD's for some good pop music.<br /><br />**Update**  A few months later I still find that I hate it - I gave it a fair shot since everyone said it has to grow on you.  Not good.
1884883338|4.0|Pretty good reference tool - surely not gospel, and surely not complete - but for a book this size it packs a lot of info
B0058PJ6NE|5.0|Amazing app hope everyone try it. Is the best one then ever .. thanks for creating that fabulous just for me
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is intelligent, witty, funny and entertaining. You come to appreciate the characters and enjoy the diversity and complexity they display. Enjoy the binge😃
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Best ending ever! People don't like it but how does the internal fight end in real life?  I admire her decision to make it so real..
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Without the Netflix offer Google Chromecasts is a letdown. The product is limited with options. Maybe useful if you don't wanna invest in A smart tv, Roku or Apple TV.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|Best laugh I've had in a long time!  I wouldn't call this a &#34;spoof&#34; of horror movies.  It is really funny, but dark.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep is another great book from the master of storytelling.  A thrilling tale with colorful and frightening characters that I could not put down unless someone was prying it out of my hands.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|Excellent Movie, worth having it on BluRay...<br />Visuals are more than well done and the story is also quite well done...
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|not as exciting as some of his other works, but readable and a fast read.i enjoyed it but not a could not put it down kind of book.
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|Has their old school feel again, although I liked their other stuff very much and really enjoyed the energy it had...<br />this just does it with the older style in place...
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I've enjoyed her other books so much more! Let's hope her next ones measure up. I am clearly a fan.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|The concept of this game is cool.  It seems, on the surface, a simple game; however, once I started leveling up, am feeling the challenge and difficult.  This is a great brain exercise.  I almost got stuck on a puzzle.  Am willing to work on harder levels.  Must keep my brain active and challenged.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush.  It is very addicting and challenging.  I have it on my Kindle and I like the fact that when I reach a new group, it gives you 3 chances to go into the next group.  Unlike the other version you have to wait for friends to send you lives
B003G4W49C|3.0|Good read and lots of run for sequels. Excellent character development and story.  Could use a bit more intro to current climate of how the &#34;Third&#34; came to be.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Could not wait for this book to come out.  I really enjoyed the other two and could not wait to see how the story will end.  In no way did I ever think that Ms. Roth would kill off the heroine.  As I turned the pages I was hoping that there was some way that Trish would come back.  When I read the other 2 I kept telling people you should read these book, they are very good, but now, I would say do not bother.<br /><br />I heard that they were going to make a movie out of these.  I will definitely not go.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This is an Awsome movie. I loved it when it first came out and I still do. I have watched it several times and it is a great way to pass time in the car or anywhere else there might not be a television and you want to keep the kids busy. Instead of being scary monsters these charactors you can't help but to love them.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is very addictive!  At first you get frustrated, but once you master the first two level, you get stuck on then &#34;hard&#34; level.  After 3 months, I still find the hard level challenging enough.
0439023513|5.0|I personally like the books more than the movies. Don't get me wrong, the movies are great. But reading the books gives you a better understanding of The Hunger Games. Would recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very helpful. I think it's good for kids doing homework or adults with homework if your in collage. Get this app.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Fun game !!!!!!!!!!! Love Star Wars but wish you could play C3P0 and R2d2 more. And also wish there were more levels
B003G4W49C|1.0|bad writing.  poor development of characters. not inspirering for young adults. too much good young adult literature out there to waste time on this series.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Very Good flash for the photos that I take.  Doesn't add a lot of weight to camera,  Works gret with my D3000
B00BWQW73E|4.0|The book gave me a insight  into how much hard work and dedication it takes to start and grow a great company in the 21 Century.  The flow of staff from  Company to Company was interesting!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Too many ads, slow to start, always wants to update and looks into your phone directory to send religious texts to others in attempts to proselytize.  Avoid this app; just isn't worth it.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This was an excellent and fuller depiction of the story.  Some versions tend to make Emma someone to laugh at, rather than just a young, misguided woman who learns not to meddle in the affairs of others before she comes to grip with her own life.
0316055433|1.0|This is a brilliant writer with vivid characters, but 755 pages of someone who can't shake a drug addiction is not my idea of good reads. In the last 20 pages, I got to wondering about the author herself and why exactly she is so thrilled about the endless nuances of a drug high.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I finally convinced my husband to watch all three seasons and he absolutely loved it. It was a soap opera for everyone with just enough manly topics to keep him interested.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfect for me. I wish Google would add more apps to this so we can use them. Curently you can only use chrome and Youtube and NetFlix
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The dual perspective was badly misused by the author and pretty much destroyed my enjoyment of Tobias.  Both Tris and Tobias were mostly just irritating and one-dimensional throughout the book.  I was really excited for the the resolution of the series and to learn more about the world outside the fence, but after reading the book and spending a few days getting through the stages of grief (especially disbelief and anger!), I just really don't care to reread the books ever again, let alone watch the movie.  What a let down...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am truly hooked on this game. It is a wonderfully frustrating game. I am looking forward to future levels.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I really like this game. the only problem I have is that I need more neighbors. my farm id is FAVAMCZ. add me. I really need the friends. other than that it is a very fun game.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|Lousy depiction of the character Jack Reacher. Tom Cruise makes a good mini-Reacher. Hard to pull off a 6'5&#34; character. He doesn't even get close to personality type.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Well, I'm torn here. While I think 3 stars is a bit generous, I must say I've persevered and read through it, which the author must at least be credited for capturing our collective attentions. That said, with the first \\"love\\" scene I was thinking - wow this is gonna be juicy, but a thousand cookie cutter love scenes in, I'm yawning and skipping parts. It's just too much. So much so, that you become immune to it all and it loses its impact. Like really, the SECOND they are done doing it, it jumps into a new sex scene. The guy Christian - I want to like him, but there are no bones about it. There is no other way to describe his control freakery other than mentally and at times physically abusive. He also has a deep seated urge to physically hurt her, which he DOES in a sexual way, but he also wants to beat the F out of her physically. While he manages to abstain, it doesn't change the fact that he is an abusive personality. Describe him as sexy all you want, hot body's and pretty faces can still be jerks. The girl Ana, I probably care for LESS than Christian. Right after he says something inappropriate, offensive, or does something abusive, her typical response is \\"Oh, My Fifty!\\" (in her head) she enables his behavior, lets him get away with anything because he's hot, and generally speaking can't have an intelligent conversation with him without getting distracted by his abs, face or butt. And completely off topic, she doesn't brush her teeth when she gets up and what with all the sex<br /> happening, I find that off putting...<br /><br />Update - Ok, I finished the whole thing and had no choice but to lower my rating. This fella spanks,ties,blind folds<br />Flogs this chick and its all cool but she calls a code red cause he wouldn't let her climax? SERIOUSLY?  Newsflash, not having an orgasm is not a criminal offense, beating the cr@p out of you on the other hand.....<br />And I agree with other readers. Lots of annoyingly repetitious refererences. My inner goddess,my sex,my fifty, oh my, sh!t, and the 'f' word, make up about 80 percent of the vocabulary. Most of those eloquent offerings doled out by Anastasia with Christian being the slightly 'classier' one of the pairing...
1781162646|5.0|I am a huge King fan and this did not disappoint. I know it is very different from earlier writings, but maybe that is one thing I like about King, not knowing what to expect.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a game you'll love to hate!  I love playing it on my kindle instead of my phone. And it was so easy to go right to the level I was on, on my phone. Thanks kindle for giving this us game on here.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Didn't get captivating till the last 1/3 of the book.  Too sad and still seemed to have unresolved issues.  Not as good as the other two.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Four stars for this genre piece. It doesn't have the dramatic wallop needed to earn five, but for a comic book based action film it's great. Awesome action and huge special effects. Superhero against superhero battles bring suspense about what superpower has an edge over the others.  Zero blood, massive wreckage to buildings and machines. There is the death of many bug men and of a human we love so gauge the sensitivity of children accordingly.
0385491026|4.0|Beautifully written coming-of-age story that was sometimes a little hard to understand, particulary when it came to the relationship between the narrator and Cordelia, the girl who bullied her as a youngster. Big message that I gleaned: the past is never really past, and the legacy of childhood trauma lives on well into adulthood, even when everything seems fine.
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|I don't want to say anything about the film, because saying anything might spoil the twists and turns this takes. If thrillers are your thing, just watch it. Great transfer, not so great supplemental material.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Not only was it a bad movie, it made a complete mockery of the Superman character.  A base tenant of the Superman mythos is his code of ethics and morals.  This movie threw that out the window.  I just hope Zack Snyder at least has the good sense to be embarrassed.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|What is there to say? It's still one of the best Blu-ray sets ever produced. The supplemental materials are exhaustive. The first two films look like they were made today. If you have a Blu-ray player, you simply don't have a choice -- you have to own this.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Mindless fun that wastes time. I like it and if you're looking for an easy game then this is it.
B003L77G06|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to watch this show, but I'm glad I finally did. It's not constantly hilarious, but it's a show that you just enjoy spending with the characters. And they're all great. I think this season is my favorite, but all are pretty equally strong.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang did it again. I love this app espically for traveling. Thank you Mojang for inventing this amazing app. I love it to pieces.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I loved it and hated it at the same time. Same great Jack, same pitiful tragedies befalling him. That's what makes the show, but come on, give him a day of happiness for a change. He deserves it. I can't wait for the new season to come out. - 24 addict
B00028HBKM|5.0|This DVD and story will bring you to tears every time you watch it.  It is a great depiction of what Jesus went through and the sacrifice made for the sins of this world.  Some of the scenes are hard to watch, but we must know what really happened in order to appreciate the love of God and what our Lord with through just for us.
B000SSPL2Q|5.0|Interpreted and played with deep understanding of Sibelius and the Nordic psyche. These are consistently great performances. I am thoroughly enjoying this set.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I think this book is movie quality..I could hear Mathew McConnehey 's voice when Jake was speaking!  I loved it and reccomended it to my friends!
1452126577|5.0|I have a friend who loves cats.  This is going to be a Christmas Gift for her.  It's just perfect.
B005723JSQ|4.0|This was such a fun book to read.  When I first started reading it I thought the plot sounded silly but the author made it work.<br />Poppy loses her heirloom engagement ring while at a lunch party, and finds a phone in the trash after hers is stolen.<br />She keeps the phone so the hotel can contact her about her lost ring, but gets involved in the life of the boss of the owner of the phone.<br />At times it becomes far fetched but for the most part is just a good fun read.
B000002KDS|5.0|The original AC is in fine shape on this album. Almost every cut a classic - Dead Babies, Killer, Halo of Flies, Under My Wheels, etc. The worlds most parent terrorizing,church terrorizing, authority terrorizing band at their most notorious. The songs are solid and not a dud in the bunch. Some of their darkest moments and concert favorites are herein, By this point in time and long before you either like or you don't. If you need a new copy of an old classic or just want to relive high school it's well worth it and the price is right also.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|It never gets old!!!! I have watched Season One and Two several times already cant wait for February and Season Three
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Really keeps you on your guessing game. Surprised at the end. Great acting and actors, and special effects. Love it.
B00076RT24|5.0|Now that I have the complete pre-quel series!!!!!  I have got my daughter hooked now  Nathalie Portman got much better in the next two
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Movies watched with Amazon Prime has issues. So far I have not been able to watch the end of the movies I started to watch because the movies freeze. For instance, the last one (Flight) froze about 20-25 minutes into it and I was never able to get it to play again. The three stars is based on what I saw for the 20-25 minutes. Zero star for watching movies on Amazon Prime.
B004QZ9P6K|3.0|The book draws interesting conclusions based on observation however there is no added analysis to confirm the causes of Israeli entrepreneurship. I would have liked to see more quantitative analysis. It's a great starter-read on the topic of Israeli business and some of Israel's cultural norms.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Once again Mr. Gary Renard renewed my enthusiasm and interest in A Course In Miracles.  I first read the Course back in 1993 and do to my lack in understanding I have allowed time to erode my interest.  Mr. Regard's 3 books were essential in making the Course clear.  Thank you so much for being open and being a writer.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|The mission.<br />the mission was a good movie that was some what a learning experience. De Niro & Irons had excellent performances.
B00AALX5SI|4.0|My daughter loves this movie.  Especially watching her sing to a live audience.  I like her to have positive female role models and think Katy Perry is one.
B0061S073A|2.0|I downloaded this app for my daughter and was thrilled that you could customize what is accessed up until I realized it's downfall. Although you can select a kindle app as permissible, it will not open. Hopefully they will fix this issue in the future.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is back at the top of his game with this book.In some ways it is like attending a family reunion.  getting to revisit people we met in a Time to Kill.
1449433251|5.0|I ordered this set for my fiancé.  They fit snugly in the box and are very attractive both in the box and out of the box. The pages are printed on heavy paper, giving the books a substantial heft.  The comic strips are easy to read (the print isn't too small); color and black-and-white comics are included in the collection.  It's been fun to flip through the books and see the evolution of Calvin and Hobbes through the years.  If you're a Calvin and Hobbes fan, I recommend this collection.  One thing to be aware of: the books are paperback so if you prefer hard cover books, this isn't the set for you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This entire series had me on edge. I had to stop reading in the middle of chapters because if I got to the cliffhanger at the end, I just kept going! I can't wait for the second movie to come out. This trilogy is just incredible. It did leave me wanting more information at the end though...
0307887960|5.0|I found that this diet actually worked for me and for my wife.  It has been relatively easy to stay on,, and with continuing good results.<br />Well worth a try.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Not his best but a good read. I'm a big Grisham fan and have read many of his books. This is a nice moving trial story with a surprise in the end. Grisham can make a civil law case interesting. He is the best writer of law genre books .
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|I think my husband laughed more than my son did, but that seems to be the trend with &#34;kid&#34; movies these days.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|The whole family loved this one. It was funny and entertaining. Disney/Pixar are creative as always. It was adorable to see the characters in school as monster kids before they became \\"real  scarers\\" at Monsters Inc. This would make a great family Christmas gift.
B00CJGP116|5.0|The music is fantastic. He is a great singer. I loved the variety and his different styles. It is great music to dance to as well
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|My 10 year old son really, really loved it. Bought it for him right away. The adults however can't stand to watch it again. It was long, action packed and about humans controlling robots under the ocean. So if that's what you like then it's perfect!
B0036S4C6G|2.0|The problem with audio books is that it is far too easy to quantify how much time you have wasted on a story you didn't really enjoy. Ten hours, five minutes. Ten painful hours of wondering why I can't give up.<br /><br />I had a lot of issues with this story; it was a struggle to finish. The only characters I could get invested in were Bennie, Sasha, and (because of Sasha) Ryan (was that even his name? I can't even make myself remember). There were so many characters, so many individual stories and perspectives. Yes, they were connected one way or another, but I feel there were just too many perspectives. It felt to me like Egan took snippets from several different books and threw them together into this one and created a way to tie them together for the heck of it. Each story being an interesting moment in the life of characters we will never truly be able to see go anywhere. The characters occasionally had closure to their story but only with a lot of their story left out.<br /><br />I like to make a connection with the main characters but there are just too many to become fully invested. There were too many perspectives I didn't care to hear from and too many situations I didn't care about. Why should I get invested in a character who will be forgotten by the next chapter? I also could have done without the entire section from Jules' perspective. It was painful and not in a poignant way.<br /><br />If I squint my brain, I can understand why some people really enjoyed this book. Unfortunately for me, I feel like William from Mallrats trying to see the sailboat in the Magic Eye picture. So many people see this novel's greatness and I'm just left staring and trying my best to understand why.
B000ZHBB0Q|1.0|I only was able to watch half the movie.The movie kept having to reboot and it would start ove again from the beginning of the movie.After three tries trying to find where the movie left off,I gave up.This is the first time I used Amazon for watching movies,I hope the service is better than I expireienced.I did send an email the next day and my Monet was refunded(I would rather have seen the movie).
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Enjoyed the story as expected.  Im never disappointed by any of his books. My greatest disappointment with John Grisham is that he doesn't write more books.
B005LAII12|1.0|Did not realize it would be that vulgar/ there was comedy but at what coast. Shared with others for their feedback without any comment and had same results....should have been rated....
0545101425|5.0|I have really enjoyed all of the books from this series!  Wish there was a way to &#34;see&#34; how they all rebuild :)
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|This was a good movie, with predictable plots, and a typical good guy wins attitude.  I was really impressed and I loved watching it.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This movie is so cute.  Watched it with my 13 year old sister and 7 year old niece and all of us laughed out loud during the whole movie.  Perfect for kids, families and all who watch.  Loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I play minecraft I never get bored because you can never do everything and there's always more things happening in the world<br />Get this game!!!!!!<br />Nathan halseth
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Its great to connect to the outside world , friends and family right from my kindle fire..I love it , its great feature/ app
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Real life is stranger than fiction and this is the ultimate real life story. The men who died in Operation Redwing are true heroes.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Despite the sometimes histrionic headlines that don't always match the content of the stories, and the much shorter summaries of longer stories you will find elsewhere, HP is a good aggregator of news.  I have some beefs with the application itself, that has a tendency to freeze up or take up a lot of memory or refuse to update sometimes (more a problem on the Kindle Fire than on my other android tablet for some reason).  I have to go into applications, clear all the memory, and sometimes even uninstall and reinstall it sometimes to get it to work.  Also, the font size is odd and does not respond to pinching as we are now used to.  In fact, even when I go into settings and set the font size to huge, it sometimes remains small.  It is a bit too graphics heavy for my test.  I don't need photos of celebrities - I just want to read articles about the Affordable Care Act or the implosion of the Republican party.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I like the fact the book is a sequel to &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; which I had just read.  I was familiar with the characters and it was easy to get into the feel of the book. &#34;Lily&#34;
B004UO0SAO|5.0|It does what it says, turning my tablet into an HP with reverse polar notation.  Very crisp keys, nice response, changes from landscape to portrait seamlessly.  As someone who cut my teeth with programmable calculators in the final years before PC's came along, I find myself comfortably at home with this interface.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Gorgeous boxed set of my all-time favorite tv show. Loved the inclusion of the script from the first episode. I already owned all 7 seasons, but when I saw this collection, I knew it had to come and live with me. I love it when the writers don't feel the need to &#34;dumb down&#34; the show for their audience.
B002CJZ8TA|5.0|Great book although transparently moralistic with a strong Christian bias that Victor Hugo makes no effort to hide, and at times rambling, I am glad I worked my way through the original French version.  The great thing about reading this on an Android tablet or PC (but strangely enough, not on a Kindle) is that you highlight any word and you get a French to French dictionary.  Formidable!  I wish I had had that tool when learning other languages.  It exponentially speeds your learning, especially if you are reading something from the 19th century full of phrases about horse-related conveyances no longer used.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Don't start this book in the evening if you have to get up early the next morning. I am usually able to figure out how a book will end by the time I'm halfway through it. With this one I had no idea... well, I had a sliver of an idea. I was wrong.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I read this every year.  The original is so much better than any of the derivative movies made based on it.
B00A6SZS2Q|4.0|I first heard &#34;in the end&#34; on the local modern rock station, and thought it decent. Found this listed for $3.99 a few weeks back during Halloween and snagged it. Glad I did. This is a very good rock album. For a band that's not been around long they have a surprisingly distinct sound. Not saying original. It's fair to point out the influences of glam metal from yesteryear found within. Each song on here is catchy, and the guitar work is serviceable and complimentary. Other than the goofy &#34;we are the persecuted/underground&#34; thematic spoken word fillers between the songs, this is pretty tight. I dig it!
B004SDEP38|5.0|Excellent program that allows me to browse my data with a Windows Explorer type of interface.  Much better for random data I have dumped in various files than for reading and editing documents, IMHO, for which I now prefer Google Drive.
B00EPQQ2PW|3.0|Bastille's release is not a bad debut by any means. There's nothing mind blowing or particularly memorable here either. It's a dance-y pop infused record with strains of Coldplay woven throughout. It's passable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story line, great characters and good family entertainment.  Will miss Matthew!  Why did they do that?  Cannot wait for season 4!
0345803507|5.0|The book was used but in better condition than what I expected!! I am looking forward to finding the other 2 so i can read this one!!
B003U51EE8|1.0|Went down hill after season 1 and 2. There just seem to be no direction, every new episode just kept getting me &#34;lost&#34;
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This disk was bought for a friends birthday. She absolutely loves Susan Boyle. Another must have for your collection and beautiful singing.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Its a really great headset after i got my second pair. The first pair was horrible and nothing was working but they sent me a new pair within 3 days.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I liked the novels better for many reasons: The movie did not mirror the novel; it was disappointing and a bit horrific.
B00993I6D2|4.0|This is a classic, must see movie.  Seemingly absurd when it was written, it's theme is now, not only plausible, but dare I say recognizable in today's &#34;political correct&#34; atmosphere.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Meaningful story of heartaches of the foster kids that were transported to these far away towns. I loved the mix of early 1900's and recent times.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Meh. If you like action characters, or if you never grew out of comic books, this might be for you.
0425263924|5.0|Love this series, the third was much more exciting than the second.  And definitely can't wait until the next one is out.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the whole series.  Ending was a shocker but still enjoyed it!  I enjoyed this series a lot more then Hunger Games.  I hope they make it into a movie.
0007144350|5.0|The book is well constructed and accepts usage without losing pages. The text is well printed and very readable. The subject material is very satisfying and reinforced a link with one of my grand-daughters.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This does NOT work on Windows XP. You have to have a newer (ie. worse) version of MS. I wasted $35 because Google wasn't forthcoming. DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE!
B003VANOFY|5.0|this was a gift for my husband. He is using it every day. absolutely love it. good quality. The sound is clear.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Veronica Roth wrote a weak conclusion to a pretty good series, rendering the entire thing a grave disappointment to many of her fans. Instead of making many of us want to read the previous books again to catch all the hidden meaning and messages, it completely ruined the series' replay value.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Very good. I like the new take on the mythology. The Krypton seen was awesome. Henry Cavil did an excellent job.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It can be alot of fun until you get stuck for weeks on one level.. It takes alot of patience.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|If you’re looking for escapism fiction this is the book for you. The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal is a clever espionage thriller that takes you back into the heart of World War 11, where Ian Fleming tries to foil an assassination plot against Hitler. The characters in this story are fully detailed and I love the colorful settings. Like the author’s previous novel, Operation Armada, this book delivers. Very exciting read.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Fantastic prequel to the beloved Monsters, Inc.  Not only a great stand alone movie, but ties in the &#34;little things&#34; to the original.  Randal's fierce need to no longer be in second to Sully.  Mike and Sully's relationship, etc.  Provides an opportunity to talk morals, doing the right thing, etc. with kids without it being presented in a preachy way.  Just an overall great flick.  Destined to become another Pixar classic.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is a great app, the problem that I have with it is that every single time I go to the map, it crashes on me. I hope they fix that soon. Otherwise I am happy with it.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Not a good read.  The characters never become compelling, interesting or anything beyond 2-dimensional puppets in a ridiculous tale that is a complete waste of time.  There are comic strips that do a better job of developing a character that you can imagine meeting and having a conversation with.  And the sex, which at first promises to be at least mildly interesting, starts to prove very predictable and even laughable.  It should be named “50 Ways To Use Beige, part 2”
B008LP8QE8|3.0|I reckon a better display should be considered. It is sometimes difficult or too long to get to the point.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Just what you would expect from the facebook application download. It seems to work very well and have not noticed any glitches.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|CANT WAIT FOR SEASON FOUR!!!!!  Hoping that season four will become available in the US very soon..  hard to wait!!!
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Got this when it was a free app a while back. Great app, but with the update to Flipps most usability was lost. I can no longer stream to my PS3 as it seems to have lost the ability for network streaming. Sad to have to uninstall this app after such a long of having it just work.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|This book will be read in one sitting ! The technical details and the speed of events is simply astounding .<br />.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This app is great I would not change it for anything!!! I would recommend this app this app to anybody you would love it!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I give this a 4 star. Not because the book is in anyway not good, because the book is good... And the story of this Neurosurgeon's life experience is ground breaking! I felt that the ending was somewhat confusing- giving so much reference information. (It is appreciated for those needing to research) Maybe if the editorial company could of separated down a bit in this section, or separated it better it would of given a clearer ending to the book. It's just that the format simply flows into the references given to show the research involved. In and of it's self the book gives the reader proof. However, I personally would of liked getting a little more personal detailed insight of the doctor's final thoughts on his experience.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Love it, so much information about her country. Explains a lot of things we hear in the news and things were not hear about.
B00EPZEU70|5.0|This is my first polaroid cam and I love it. It has more functionality that previous models that is perfect for experimenting effects on photos. I'm referring to exposure modes added to it. Picture quality is perfect, meant to last a lifetime. I might be exaggerating, but I really love this product though a bit pricey.
B00BJS7104|2.0|Some of the actors did not do justice to themselves as actors.  The blood baths were too drawn out. Love Dr. Kingston.
0307271080|5.0|A great book for every African studying or living in the US and interested individuals. Captures every experience beautifully. Chimamanda is my favorite author of all time!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Riveting description. Teen angst. Sustained pacing. “Outview” has it all in this YA supernatural suspense novel. Though young adults are not the only ones who will appreciate the powerful writing and plot momentum. Triggered by the loss of his father, 16-year-old Nate suffers repeated death nightmares that haunt him—Outviews. Touched with a message about the value of friendship, Legg weaves a conspiratorial tale as Nate must unravel the secrets of his father’s death with the help of his friends and brother. As Nate searches for the truth, and for healing from his horrifying visions, his “coming of age” is muted but still present—a mystical yet believably executed growth that makes him stronger and more prepared to face the adventures still to come…
B005MMJ84K|1.0|Not as good as Delirium. Lauren Oliver got lazy. I did like the twist ending though. That was so nice!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I did this one backwards, movie first then book.  The movie was well done.  Although I thought the book was good and the third person was effective it just didn't have the connection to the characters that the movie did.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|So funny.  I enjoy watching these characters interact.  I will be sad to see this show end.  It kind of reminds me of when the show Friends ended.
B008XG1X18|2.0|The app stops working .....app on my phone is fine but this one not so much. I'll give it a few more days before I uninstall..
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I had already done the regular Quell but found this to be more challenging. I had to use the coins more to solve some of the puzzles.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|It is very superficial, although the plot is interesting.  Not a good literature.  Entertaining, like a movie.  I wouldn't recommend as a  good reading.  It is a book to read between flights, I would say.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Not what I expected. I thought I would be actually searching a room but so far it just concentrates on one item.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show!  Better than the first season.<br /><br />All I can say about the finale is this:<br /><br />FINALLY!  About freaking time.
B0087DFIYA|4.0|Very entertaining movie with Gibson in a different role. Well acted and good action. Watch it, you wont be disappointed.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Love Love Love Dr Who!! I especially love the reasonable pricing with Amazon Prime compared to buying at the local FYE which also has questionable stocking of some titles. Shipping was super ! I plan on completing my collection !!<br /><br />FANTASTIC
B009SH5JS4|5.0|Best movie ever. :)  A classic happy romance. :)  Predictable of course, but still fantastic. I love Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline together.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I seemly love all of the seasons. I would like to see season 4 to see what happen after matt had the accident.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. You know more twists and turns are coming in the plot and amazed when Grisham reveals them.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is a challenge to balance goods stored and coin and crowns . I'm only on level 10 ,still trying to gain some crowns to purchase buildings .still working at it.
0590259385|5.0|My children love this book! The rhymes and pictures all work together. We had one before this order, but lost it. I knew we needed to replace it, even though my children could recite it to me without the book!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Not often you find a book that is so beautifully written with a wonderful story. could not put it down.
B000784WMW|5.0|This series stays true to the book.  Timothy Dalton plays the perfect Mr. Rochester and Zelah Clark was able to capture the resilient character of Jane.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is not the type of book I would normally choose, but it was recommended to me and I absolutely loved it.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I watch this movie twice.... I like to watch thriller/horror movies but this is awesome! recommended to my friends, I cant wait to see the next one...
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I love it,<br />It's still my old friend Bridget!!<br />How can you not laugh, at her trying to check for nits on her 'toy boy's' head without putting her glasses on, so that he doesn't thing about their age difference.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|I bought this movie despite all of the negative reviews I heard and read.  I enjoyed the movie, it was exciting and suspenseful, it had zombies (I have been a huge fan of Zombies since I first saw Night of the Living Dead in the early 80s), so I LOVE Zombie movies.<br /><br />That being said, the thing that almost ruined this movie for me, was that my brain kept screaming \\"HAS ANYBODY INVOLVED WITH THIS MOVIE READ THE BOOK?!?!\\"<br /><br />You would see breadcrumbs of the book sprinkled into the movie, like a name here a location there, but that was about it.<br /><br />Once I was able to ignore the voice I was able to enjoy the movie and it only bugs me a little bit that this movie is named after one of my favorite books and has almost nothing in common with it.<br /><br />If you have never read the book, you will really enjoy it, if you have read the book you will really work at enjoying it.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|Never read the book but thought this was a good movie, although I don't normally like movies with sad ending.  Talk about a double standard for women!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food, Inc. provides its viewer with numerous compelling reasons to think that eating ethically is not easy. I would definitely recommend it.
B0081336FO|5.0|As a follower of Sherlockiana since a youth, I found this, as well as the first season, to be absolutely great.  As there doesn't seem to be a possibility of another season, appreciate what you've got.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Ms. Kline offers a view of our history few American now ever knew existed. I highly recommend this book to all readers of history.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great show, another great season. Hard to stop watching each night... A law show with so many side stories to keep you engaged... The Good Wife is The Good Show. Wanting season five!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Even though I do not know that much about creating nuclear bombs, I found the story intriguing and followed it as best I could. Why did the author have to kill off my favorite character?
B005PK57NU|5.0|Great show, another great season. Hard to stop watching each night... A law show with so many side stories to keep you engaged... The Good Wife is The Good Show.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Incredible book should make an even better movie! Anybody who remembers WW2 should read this book. Takes you beyond the stuff you were told in high school history books
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I enjoyed this novel overall but found it too long winded near the end. I almost set it aside a few times but then was glad that I reached the satisfying ending.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|One long chase scene, very little actual plot.  Only good if you watch it for free. Don't pay for it!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was a very good story from beginning to end.  Not a happy ending but makes the story real.  I read all three and I enjoyed all three.  I am a 77 yr. old woman and would probably not have read them but my book club chose the 1st book. I enjoyed it so much that I then on my own bought the next two.  I would recommend all three for my grandchildren who are teenagers
0399157573|5.0|Ms. Cornwell has written another great book. Dust is her 21st Scarpetta in the series. I look forward to this all year. Ms. Cornwell has a real knack for drawing her readers into the story. Her attention to forensic details continues to keep the Scarpetta series a must read on my list. Ms. Cornwell has brought back all of our favorite characters. Marino has a new little friend in training. He is no dog whisperer.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|awesome movie my grand daughter has watched it over and over! as good as the first one if not better
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book suspenseful love story not only a sexual book but has a interesting story line that goes with it.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|From the very start the story grabs your attention.  The characters are believable  and fun to watch. It moves fast and the relationships are fun to watch as they development.  I was a nurse and find it very interesting.  Love it...and still watch Grey's Anatomy on TV.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I'm just about 17% through the book. At first the points of view narration threw me, but now I'm enjoying the different perspectives of the story.
1616550414|5.0|This book is like a holy bible for any Zelda fan. I have been playing Zelda games for over 20 years and I played every game and I cannot wait for the next game: A Link between Two Worlds. This book is big and the cover is beautiful. Inside the book, it had every information of the games, beautiful pictures and drawings, interviews, storylines and many more. As a fan of Legend of Zelda, I want you to buy this beautiful book and trust me you will not regret this recommend
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging once you get really far into it. Its one of the funest games ive ever played.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've searched for a lot of different things to get my disorganized brain into a more focused state, and this just might be it. Instead of using sticky notes, moleskines, and every other thing from an office store, I can simply use the virtual notebook of Evernote. I'm only a few days in, but it's already helped motivate me and release stress/tension from my life!
B00881VLCE|4.0|To be honest, I was a little surprised that it was so fun. I was thinking that it wasn't gonna be the good because it was just doing puzzles. But I was wrong it is a lot of fun.
1449433251|5.0|amazing it´s all you eer wanted about Cavin & Hobes, great edition, good print quality, paper is ok, package good.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|This worked very well the one time I tried it.  Easy to set up, clear sound, comfortable to wear, excellent microphone.<br /><br />For some reason though, my dog liked it, too.  This is the first non-toy item he's chewed up in two years. So, something to watch out for maybe if you have a dog.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Rereading this aloud, again, to my grandkids here in Paris in the English has been one of the highlights of my relationship with the three of them ages 12, 9, & 5 years old! Now, I am following this up with reading to them The Horse & His Boy, Lewis' third in the series. What a joy! And I will always be grateful  as to how Lewis' world of Narnia has drawn us together as grandfather and grandsons in this shared world of common imagination created by Lewis! A highlight of my life!
1452101248|5.0|Gorgeous photos, amazingly easy and flavorful recipes.  He is really thoughtful about how to create a complete, flavorful meal with vegetables the central component.  Not all cookbooks are worth having.  This one is DEFINITELY worth having.  Makes a great gift too!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This movie was a great addition to my Bourne Collection and even though Jeremy Renner was not in the original ones he did a wonderful job.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|the book is just ok not excellent or great. probably worth reading, but not great and do not rush to get it.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|This game is wonderful. The challenge is so much fun. I play this game almost everyday and have a hard time putting it down .....like a good book. Thanks so much!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time!  Very captivating...I don't want it to end!  I've found a new favorite author!
B0084670FU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and the suspense. It's the type of movie where you don't have a strong sense of how it might end. The acting was done very well (a lot of the foreigners were recruited into the movie a few days before filming).
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is the best thing that Stephen King has written in a very long time. I can't remember exactly when I purchased it, I guess sometime in 2012, and it was a wholly absorbing read. I consider myself a King aficionado, since I've read almost everything he has put into print since the beginning. For the most part, I love spending time in the worlds he creates. King has a way with characters. He humanizes his characters in ways that other authors can only dream about. He makes their struggles feel like our very own, their wonder, becomes ours, and horror once unimaginable to us, becomes something we actually consider possible. He is the master in crafting characters. For me personally, this was not only an enjoyable read, but an important one. Is there anyone in my generation, that remembers where they were the day that Kennedy was shot, and wouldn't want to travel back in time to stop Oswald? I don't think so! Kennedy's death made such an enormous impact, particularly on the youth of our country, and I think that anyone that lived through those times, as I did, would relate to this book. It definitely made an impact on me. I am forever grateful for Stephen King and his many worlds that have played a crucial part in my own necessity to sometimes escape into an entirely different place and time. Yes. Read this. It's a brilliant piece of work, and fully satisfying.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|New found fun with media. Moving CATV closer out the door. Quick and easy to set up. Portable to take traveling and watch what you want when you want.
B00AB0AXU6|5.0|Not as good as previous movies in the franchise, but OK. Definitely worth renting but I wouldn't buy it. Just trying to save you all a little cash.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Though I wish it was a little easier to get Dragons, the game is fun. My wife and I play and enjoy it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been on legal 125 for over 10 weeks. WT heck!  Ive tried everything and just cant get last. I play eagerly times a day.
B00005ATQD|5.0|I  have seen this at least twice.  Kubrick was dead soon after it came out. Coincidence?  There are some truths hidden in this film.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|This is the album from them I've been waiting for. It has a heavier, early metal grind, and a pounding drum beat on most of the songs. They got away from the punk/ metal feel for a change. The only drawback is that Synister doesn't shred as much, but I still gave it 5 stars because if the change up they did for this album. I'm beating on my steering wheel going down the road again :)
B0087YPCYA|3.0|It had pretty ladies in bikinis but it was a little too much blood. The scene that was a Baywatch spin off was out of place, too.
B00G32OER4|4.0|It was old school scary without the typical vulgarity, cheap effects, nice looking 20 some things with little clothing acting life sex starved savages being mutilated while they satisfy  their sexual appetites.
B00BAXFAOW|1.0|I am a Gladwell fan, but he hails miserably here. The examples he uses are not relevant, and his writing style is pedantic and repetitive. Quite honestly, I am surprised that it was published at all.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it is a pretty good app. I like that I can play with friends on facebook. they can give you lives and you can give them lives.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Very challenging & fun brain teasers that allow me to challenge myself at different numbers of puzzle pieces! The variety of puzzles at the free level is great and much appreciated!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Full of action and becomes addicting to watch.  I can't put my kindle down, just finished season 3 from starting two weeks ago.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Could not put it down. Wish he could write faster as I'm already waiting for his next book. What a talent!
B005LAII44|4.0|in great shape and was a good movie love that Dwayne Johnson I hope to see more movies to buy
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so much fun to read - granted the ending was a bit much...probably could have wrapped it up a bit earlier but cannot wait until the movie comes out.  I had just read Silent Wife and this was a great next read.  You won't want to put the book down - enjoy.
B00COCY67A|5.0|This is a great cd set.  It has some songs that you can't find everywhere else.  It is definitely unique.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|It's definitely worth watching. I enjoyed it very much. Denzel Washington is one of the better actors of the times.
0062255657|5.0|I stayed up way too late because I could not stop reading this book. It grabs you and doesn't let go until the end. I highly recommend it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Very well written. It makes me want to do something similar. Get fired from my job and go find myself on the Pacific Crest Trail. Cheryl Strayed is not the type of writer I would normally read. However, this is good writing.
B00CTT9646|3.0|To boldly go where we have gone before but better the action is fast paced, the actor's do a good job of making you believe the storyline. AND THE PHAZER IS TO COOL !
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love historical novels, especially stories of the South. The Kitchen House is a great read and almost impossible to put down.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|This is a cool movie with a easy to follow plot and neat robots that you can almost believe are real , just a well done action film .
B00BD99JMW|3.0|After checking the first two books in this series out of the library, I couldn't wait long enough for the conclusion to hit the shelves so I preordered for my Kindle.  It ended the series satisfactorily, but not overly so.  Not to post spoilers, there's lots of sad stuff, but even more confusing stuff.  Even having read all three pretty much uninterrupted in a short period of time, I'd be hard pressed to explain just what ultimately was going on in the Chicago of the story.  Maybe the story rings more true for the YA audience for whom it was written, but as an adult it just didn't resonate.  Maybe as an adult I have a hard time seeing the adults in the story acting the way they do.<br />If you've read the other two, you might as well read this one.  It's worth the money, but just barely.  If I had it to do again I'd wait for the library copy.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad Piggies is is yet another amazing app ! Take it from me ,  it is ( to me ) better than most other Angry Birds apps .Building  vehicles is so easy . Me, my brother , and my sister all simply adore this game . THIS IS THE CORRECT CHOICE FOR A TIME PASSING GAME . Deserves 10 stars .
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Great book, really a quite enjoyable story. Read it in one sitting, will probably pick up sequels. It is very different from the movie, so expect that.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. CHALLENGING YET SO MUCH FUN. I'm addicted. Can't wait for the next version. There are so many junk games out there but this is not one of them. Kudos to all involved with creation and development of this 5- star game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is my second reading of Ender's Game.  I've read the whole series, but the first one knocked my socks off!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Title implies story. Known each other for a couple oh hours. After a couple of drinks and spilling of the soul they decide why not.  They both been hurt, why not try a loveless marriage
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Django is easily one of Quentin Tarantino's best! Bloody violence and a great story about the redemption of a slave and his vengeance on the cruelty of slave owners. The film brought gun-slinging to a whole new realm!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Interesting story, very good acting and can't wait to see how this goes. Creepy critters, Spielberg wins again!  Go Steven!
B0000214F1|1.0|I did not receive what I expected! I expected to receive the unrated version and received the R-rated Version instead.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read most of Grisham's works and consider this one one of the best. I loved the quick flow of the story and wasn't sure how it would end.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|VINCI code for the world of those bobby<br />mutual funds to gather<br />The yahoo YOUR your Yahoo Yahoo<br />During the world is going through the university and try to gather information
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved this book.  John Grisham has done it again with a mind tingling escapade.  I love that he brought back Jake Brigance from the past and hope to see more of him.  Can't wait for the next book.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|An excellent book for advanced readers. This captivating story gives an interesting look into human nature. If you like this book try Jane Ere by Charlette Brante (Emily's sister)
1451666179|5.0|I have been following Allie's blog for a few years now, so I knew what to expect. And I was not disappointed! Even if I'd already read some of the stories in here before, they STILL make me laugh like a lunatic. Her insight into her depression is also like shining a light on my own, because those particular chapters feel like I could have written them. They made me cry, I'm going to be honest. I only wish the story about Kenny Loggins ruining Christmas had been included, because that was the first story of hers I had read.<br /><br />All in all, 'Unfortunate Situations' is a fantastic read, whether you've been reading the Hyperbole blog, or are looking into Allie's brain for the first time.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Every song gets better from the first to the last. I like the unique style of the lyrics and rhythms. I also like that it has no vulgar language.
0812550757|5.0|Loved the book, although Ender's Game is even better.  The Shadow series are my favorite &#34;Ender&#34; sequals and are also definitely worth a read.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I found the book very fragmented and episodic. Characters were introduced in an arbitrary fashion without really building or adding to the plot or content. In the end I found myself losing interest as the plot roamed formlessly about. The unremitting picture of poverty and darkness seems distorted to me and rather unbalanced.<br /><br />Some intersesting themes are explored, such as inner worth versus outward worth, loyalty, friendship, commitment. Characters are interesting and well drawn, but do not weave back into the central backcloth of the book.<br /><br />On the whole, I would not recommend this book. Not as good as 'The Kite  Runner'
B003K15IF8|5.0|Author brought me right inside Stoners mind.  Beautifully written.  This book will stay with me for a long time .  Can't wait to read more of Williams work.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Very depressing ending. I reread both Divergent and Insurgent but I will probably never pick up this book again. I don't know if I'd go see the movies now.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|The movie is very orignal and fresh.  I did not expect to like this movie as much as I did.  Loved the music too!
0525478817|5.0|Such a good book. I would read this one over and over again, I liked it that much. Money well spent!
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|This movie never stops and the characters and action scenes are some of the best I have seen in a very long while.  I highly reccommend it .
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|A believable and highly emotionally study of an alcoholic set against a background of sex, drugs and heroics on a doomed airliner which produces a roller coaster ride of adrenaline riveting emotion. DW performance is superb with help from supporting cast whose purpose it is to either help or hinder his alcoholic addiction
B008JFUO72|5.0|What bad can I ever say about Iron Man.  I grew up reading all of Stan Lee's and Jack King Kirby's comics, and the movies have kept up to Stan's expectations and to all of us, the fans.  Nuff Said.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|There is tonz of more things you can do in this game for free including customizing your robot and they are going to add global miltiplayer too
B00D2ZF24O|4.0|I was undecided about this movie when I ordered it.  I was told it was terrible, and also told it was well done.  Some parts could have been expanded on, but for the mojority I found it very entertaining.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read all 3 books in a week... Could not put it down just when you thought you were getting bored it keeps coming
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I met Ed and Lorraine Warren in 1979 during an Artists Lecture Series at Midwestern State University.  They are the real deal and I was glued to their every word.  As they said, there is good and evil in the world, and I too have seen a part of that evil that they showed us.  Do not doubt for a minute that what they show is false. Ed has passed on but Lorraine is still very much alive and I thank her for showing me the courage and love in their hearts. And Annabelle is still locked away..
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|This wasn't a bad read. Some events were a bit out of reach even for this type of story line but a good book all the same.
B008JFUORW|5.0|It is hard to tell about this without giving away the plot.  but I will tell you not to just stop when the credits begin to roll.  All I can say is They Did It Again.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|one of my all time favorite movies...I went to the theater with my sister when the movie first come out..I could swear the seats moved from the twister.So real and I love Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|I love this movie.  the children do such a good job of acting and the parents give us just as many thrills as the kids.  I really loved this movie for the way it was done and how all was explained.  Great job.
B00BKZUVGM|5.0|Such an amazing book, but remember to read divergent and insurgent before you read ALLIGENT you will not regret it. The divergent series is a must read!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Any Star Trek Fan will stayed glued to this movie.  I am not going to give away the plot of the characters, but the crew of the Enterprise continue to grow in their characters and I cannot wait for the next installment.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Super easy to install, and overclock. Got 5.0 ghz out of this one, but was scared of the heat and dropped it to 4.5ghz for the last 7 months. Haven't had any issues at all out of this processor. I have found that my son's pc with this 1155 i5 3570k pcu runs higher overclocks with lower heat and better stability than my daughters 1150 i7 4770k. I have hers set at 4.3 ghz. It may just be the luck of the pick on this processor, but I have read similar stories on Pcpartpicker, Tom's Hardware and the like. This processor is still a force to be reckoned with and can be picked up at a very good price.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|I think he's still back on top of his game with this one. He may not be as popular as he once was (even he acknowledges it in one of his songs) but his lyrics and flow are just as good as they ever were. Just to let anyone reading this post know, I've been a fan of all his past albums (&#34;Relapse&#34; might be at the bottom of the list), so it's probably not a surprise that I like this one as well. For those that haven't liked his past albums, I'm sure this won't change your opinion of him.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row is one of John Grisham's best reads.  It grabs you on page 1 and doesn't let go until the end.  This is Grisham at his best!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Not as good as good a read as books 1-2.  Believe Roth may have been trying too hard to be &#34;literary.&#34;
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I like the daily reminders and also the lessons are not overly long. I think it is an easy way to pick up key words and phrases.
B0018M6J90|5.0|Frances McDormand is one of our best actresses...maybe even better than Meryl Streep.  She can portray any part with panache and flair.  Even though she is not the best looking actress, she gets lost in her role and becomes the most watchable actress even when Amy Adams is on the screen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have never read a book so emotional, romantic, dramatized book in all my life. Truly amazing. I recommend to all Harry potter readers.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|Awesome Album!  Almost every song deserves to be on constant replay!  There are so many songs that haven't been released to radio but have the potential to be a hit!Tyler and BK- Keep bringin it ya'll!
B00GB7GX20|5.0|Very nice to hear Celine Dion's<br />Beautiful voice again.  I believe<br />Time away with her family only<br />Enriched her beautiful voice.<br />This is a joy to listen too.<br />I would highly recommend it.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|This band continues to amaze.  4 albums in and still showing that they have not peaked, which you don't see too often with most bands.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Seriously warped psychological mystery....you'll want to tell all your friends about the ending and they'll hate you for the spoiler.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I watched this movie after one of my girlfriends, who is my age (28), recommended it. I love it! I thought it was so cute, and very clever. I liked all the characters and the way the story was done, and know my nephews will enjoy it, too. My 16 month old nephew won't understand it just yet, but I know he will like all the bright colors. It's not a 100% new story, but it is very well done. I'm buying a copy for myself and one each for my nephews! I will watch this again, and know it's going to become a classic in my house.
B00DXP7L88|3.0|I'm  completing DVD series of Dexter. Although I disappointed with the ending storyline. It appears to leave a opening for a new series for Michael C. Hall. Only the writers,and time will tell.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought that I would not Luke this book because I think normally sequels are<br />horrible but now I see I was wrong.<br />  I thought this book was fun, amazing and totally awesome and I thought I could give a good rating. so that's it. I no it sound childish but yeah.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The USB cable works perfectly with the kindle. Management gave me no problems in assisting me with my Kindle problems
B00BAXFECK|5.0|One of the most amazing books I have read this year.  The main character grips you from page-one and does not let you go for the entire book.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|It's full of action.  This is something someone that likes lots of action would enjoy.  It's quite enjoyable without any deep meaning to it.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I cannot wait for Hunger Games On Fire. And the final MockingJay to Come out.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|Too bloody and tense. I love Natali Portman. She is gorgeous and was sooo thin for this role. I just didn't like the intensity and blood.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't have high hopes for this book before I read it. I thought the idea of a tournament to kill children repulsive. However the author did a good job of writing such a sensitive idea.
6305692572|5.0|This movie is so spot on, sad and happy. This is more about the co-dependent husband than the alcoholic wife. The older daughter breaks my heart.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|I liked this one. I'm glad the goofiness was omitted that plagued the previous superman movies. I thought the casting of actors was very good. Although Amy Adams really SUCKED in this one. The CGI was stunning. I take one star off because it lacked originality. It's the same story as every superman. The action was almost non-stop. Nothing boring. Superman usually works because he is the ideal man women can fantasize about. He's exotic, good looking, super powerful and has a honest strong moral compass. Males like him because he empowers us when we feel weak.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|i have been watching this show from day one and cant get enough of it. the acting is topnotch and the special effects will blow you away. even if you dont like horror elements in ur tv shows or movies, u can still enjoy the story and characters...the gore is just the icing on this dead cake! i recomennd starting from the very beginning so you can understand everyones motives and follow the story better...i dont think children under 13 should watch tho.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|It's OK. It is a useful app and it serves the purpose it is intended. The interface is simple and user friendly. It has reminder alarms and colorful icons to represent different events on a calendar view. In my opinion,  its use of 7.8 MB of ROM memory is too large for an app of this sort. This feature should be optimized.
B000001F2X|5.0|For those familiar with MR. CALE, it would be difficult to say there was a BEST album----don't think he ever did a less than stellar song.  However, when asked, it is this album that remains my favorite of his.  RIP
0345803507|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey,, I bought my wife all 3 Books and she loved all the book--You must buy--Buy It
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love the emotion and the other peoples point of view the book it was just just too good to be true you should defiantly read it I was forced to read the book now I could stop!
B004EPZ06G|4.0|I bought this movie because my wife loves it. --I hear that part1,2 &3 are fantastic ,, You will never know unless You buy it
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Just downloaded this app and it is wonderful. I can finally keep my lists and things all in one place, no losing small pieces of scrap pale or having a &quot;bulging&quot; purse from so much paper. Wish you could personalize the covers a little bit more but they are fine the way they are too.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was really disappointed in this book.  I loved the first two books in the series.  I hated the ending and I felt like the story was predictable.
B002A9THA8|4.0|great old school movie. this movie was the reason I always wanted to live in a loft. I enjoyed it.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|played it already online was hoping this would be different. easier to play with a mouse than a touch screen
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Great on my kindle fire HD, graphics, story, ease of play, all great. No problems, nice long game. Ho are fun, puzzles are pretty difficult but has skip and hints as well as strategy guide in options.great!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyable story of two people taking a difficult situation and turning into something good.  A guy looking for something more in life.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|So far so good. I'm enjoying this game and looking forward to more! Just seven you start to give up, you figure things out!
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Spoiler alert! Be forewarned.<br /><br />I began reading this book more out a sense of duty to Bridget than out of excitement since I was well aware she'd killed off Mr. Darcy. However, I shouldn't have been so judgy going in. Fielding nailed it again, perhaps expanding over more emotional ground than her first two Bridget novels explored. I cried, shook my head, and chortled loudly. And despite initially not wanting to pick it up, couldn't seem to put it down.<br /><br />Over the years, the reader has aged along with Bridget, and it's quite easy to relate to Bridget's current set of (hilarious) predicaments. I recommend curling up with provisions (wine, chocolate, a box of kleenex) and catching up with an old favorite.<br /><br />Total side note: Sincerely hoping for a third movie installment now as well. Daniel Cleaver, Mr. Darcy, and James Bond? What's not to like?
0544104404|2.0|It is not written in a clear, usable style.  There is some good and surprising information there but I don't think it would be a good source for either teachers or parents.
B00G32TD98|4.0|Great movie that actually provides scary moments rather than cheap pop out around the corner scares. A definite for any horror fan.
B004G600A4|5.0|Love this movie. It is great to watch as a family. And the horse was so funny. If you need a laugh this would be the movie I would pick.. Because the horse acts like a dog some of the time
B00E9A656K|5.0|This is the best drag racing game for the kindle fire ! If your don't have it ,you need to at least try it out its free.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|awesome acting, Channing Tatum is always wonderful to watch.  All the actors did a fantastic job in this movie.  Bravo!!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Amazing one upgrade or level should have for the energy core to make you have more fight chances but it's very well put together the controls are simple I like that the different modes are very cool and online even better this is pretty much one amazing game
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Loved the book.  As with all his books they are happy and sad.  I wish there was one really happy book.  Would recommend to anyone who likes Sparks' books.
0762451319|4.0|I love it, only the chain of the necklass is short, but the other items are great, really like it very much

B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great start to the development of a new hero.  All of the struggles and team development, the past on the island and how it has made Oliver the man he is today has been played out well.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Didn't expect much and it succeded in that. All the laughs are cheap, storyline was blah and the ending was obvious.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Just loved this movie. Got it for my wife she has always loved the wizard of Oz since a little girl. fast shipping.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Oh, why my life?!? Cecilia life was ran perfectly, she knew what needed to be done, when it needed to be done and she even planned ahead, in my world she was on overachiever. But Cecilia loved her life and she could function no other way.  Her children could rely on her, her husband of twenty years knew she would be there and the community around her knew, well….she could do it all. It was the letter that started to crush Cecilia. Her thoughts started to sway and wander.  Was her life really so perfect? What was in this letter that she had stumbled upon that her husband did not want her to open until his death?  Why after she informed him of the discovery of the letter, did he cut-short his business trip and demanded to know the where-abouts of the letter? Cecilia cannot stop the thoughts from invading her mind about the words that formed on the letter. Like Cecilia, I was dying for her to open the letter yet the perfect life she was leading and loving, I feared was going to come crashing down once she read what her husband was now wishing he had not wrote.  As Cecilia tore open the seal and read the words, I slowly read along with her knowing the Cecilia that I had once met was not the Cecilia that was going to emerge after reading the letter.  It was Tess, Will and Felicity’s world that gave Cecilia hope.  Tess and Will had a perfect marriage and had their own business with Felicity (Tess’s cousin) working with them.  Tess’s world exploded one morning as Will and Felicity announce that they have fallen in love with each other.  Betrayed and humiliated, Tess leaves the love-stricken duo so she can attend to her mother who has hurt her leg. Arriving with their young toddler in hand, Tess is back in her hometown sorting through her feelings and trying to put her life back together.  She seems to be in the right place just when Cecilia needs her.  Rachel, her daughter was murder as a teen for which no one is serving time.  Rachel feels she knows who committed the hideous crime yet no one listens and Rachel wants justice.  Rachel does take comfort in watching her only grandson and she is blessed as she watches him a couple times a week. She is devastated when she learns her daughter-in-law accepted a job in the U.S. and everyone will be leaving for the states, leaving her behind.  Rachel just wants justice and she has evidence which she believes links him to the crime but is that enough.  As the three worlds collide, I found myself not being able to think about anything else.  What a terrific way to spend a couple days….wrapped around someone’s drama.<br />Words cannot express the feelings I had when I read this book.  Definitely another hair dryer book, I took it everywhere I went….sneaking pages just so I could get a glimpse into the happening of these three women and their lives.  There were so many parts in the book that I enjoyed and reflected upon.  When John- Paul said to Cecilia “I fell in love with your goodness. It was like looking at a beautiful lake.” I was taken back.  What Cecilia thought about when he had said that, how she thought about herself at that moment and what she really thought her husband fell in love with twenty years ago hit her pretty hard.  What she thought was true, lived and now knew, was all a mess. How true this little realization is and Cecilia points out to us.  The quote by Rachel as Cecilia and her are talking, “A son is a son until he takes him a wife; a daughter is a daughter for all of her life,” I had never heard before but it was so perfect for this book.  The drama and the characters were so authentic that I felt as though I was walking through the front door of their homes and plopping myself down on a stool.  Their drama unfolding right before my eyes, it was terrific!!the hideous crime yet no one listens and Rachel wants justice.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Where was her editor? I am not complaining about story line here, She can plot as she wishes, BUT if you write a book with 2 voices they should be distinct. One should not be forced to remember what the chapter was named to remember who is talking. Tris and 4 are NOT the same and their thoughts motivations and dialogue ought to have reflected that,
B008Q0D32S|1.0|Boring movie with great actors with a poor script and an attempt to be &#34;artsy&#34; with long shots of faces.
B006GGR5QY|4.0|This is light piano style music. Good for background music to work, read, think, whatever. It isn't elevator music and it is creative. For a young guy, he has produced a nice album (ha ha). No matter what you like to listen to, it's a nice album. You'll find a place for it in your home.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Better movie than I thought. Enjoyed it! I'm not a huge zombie fan, but this movie was well done and kept me interested.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Good choice of music and download process. Prices are excellent and allows you to listen to purchases right away as well as the option to order the disc too.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|My entire family (the old man, 3 year old boy, and our parents) all enjoyed this movie. Very funny!!!! It is great for family night, we all laughed our butts off!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent read. As in true Grisham style, very entertaining about the law. Great story with interesting characters and surprisingly suspenseful plot. Couldn't put it down!
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|It is a great program, it took a little time to figure out how to  get the information I was looking for, but it was worth the time I put in for it. to be able to have all my information at my finger tips.

B00BATKPBE|5.0|Read by the author, an insight into how great minds come to co conclusions. An audio history of both colonial times and the English schools system.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I had to watch this movie twice to catch all of the Bond subtleties.  As a teenager I read all of the books and I think Daniel Craig does a fantastic job of creating Ian Fleming's Bond.
1451695195|1.0|I thought the book was poorly written.  His style of writing was very distracting.  What was the argument. He felt strongly about it, but who was his audience?
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie takes the Batman to its classic levels.  All of us get older, and I understand that the next movie takes the Batman into his retirement years....If you liked the way the Antonio Banderas Zorro movies bridged the gap, then you will like this, too.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Classic Gaga, this is what made her famous. Some of her best songs ever (G.U.Y. , Sexxx Dreams, Gypsy, Dope) !!!
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Solid Bourne series continuation.  I do not think you need to watch all of them to enjoy this one....but, I would watch all of the again anytime!!
1401937519|5.0|I had heard Dr Dyer talk about this book on PBS and had Anita on his show and after hearing her story, I knew I had to get the book. It is a divine book and VERY MUCH worth the read.

B00C74SHRK|5.0|I have loved every single Donna Tartt book, and this is no exception. Superb.  It's like a grown up Catcher in the Rye, but more beautiful.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Honestly, the awful, unnecessary ending was almost expected by the time I got through the rest of the book.  I was looking forward to this book so much after the first two, but Allegiant is almost childishly bad.  There is no distinction between the voices of Tris and Four, making the chapters impossible to follow and enjoy.  I'm very disappointed and feel like this was a waste of my money and time.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's a fun game....the graphics are great. Great way to past the time. Just wish there was an easier way to earn coins.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Entertaining and time wasting, bringing Facebook games to Kindle. =)<br /><br />It is visually appealing but some of the things are too expensive.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Im not a reader, but I read every word of every page on each of the 3 books! Kept my attention!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game.....it is so easy and addicting! I really enjoy seeing my time, score, and how many moves it took me to complete the hand!!! A great way to spend some free time!!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It's so awesome I would play it over and over again if the robots were bigger and have weapons like guns and swords
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|One of the best episodes of the season. I can't wait to see what happens next. This episode was great!
B00F35BV64|4.0|As someone who remembers well the original Star Trek tv show, this production does an excellent job of  creating a believable (2nd)  pre-quel.  It gives a plausible illusion of the original cast in their younger years, and Mr. Cumberbatch excels as a formidable villain.  And of course, visual FX are  up to par, as they must be for this type of movie.<br /><br />My only regret is, I wish I'd rented the  HD version rather than the  standard def version, but the picture and sound quality were still OK even in SD.  (I viewed it full-screen on a 21.5&#34; iMac).  I think the choice of HD  vs. SD should  be prominently featured on the Amazon site  at the outset, and it  may be that it was, but I just didn't catch it at the time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I fell in love with this series and I can't wait to see the movie and remand the next book!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've read every one of John's books, and they just keep getting better.  Make this a must read.  So well written.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such an original way to tell a story!  Kept me captivated the entire read. So much more than  another Holocaust novel.
1572704497|4.0|The story line was good, but not one of Agatha Christie's best. The story line seemed dragged out in the first disc.
B0085X31VE|3.0|rock, fusion (world music), progressive, it's all that.  Quick bursts of loudness, have ugly wailing vocals, by a man.  And yes, there is certainly a fiddle, congrats, you made your own sound.  This is no kind of Death Metal, or even black.  The occasional growling vocals is more in the vien of, NU metal.  Confusing people who know of classical transitions in Black Metal, causes them to? not notice that It Is Prog.  Then people display the horns at a Nevermore concert.  Atheist Lyrics, what?  So there is a heavy bent toward fusion, An interesting atmosphere as well.  Fiddle throughout reminds me of an original styling, indescribable, that's why I gave it an extra star.  So much violin instrumental section throughout is why I immediately docked that star.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am not familiar with this game, however my wife and daughters play it all the time, they just love it.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|Loved this! Monsters University was fun, heartening and I loved that one of the &#34;messages&#34; it sent wasn't that going to college was everything - that hard work could get you to your goals, even sometimes when education can't. Has anyone suggested this movie to Mike Rowe? It's right up his alley and ties in his message he has been singing lately -
B00F8MIIKO|4.0|A cute story...perhaps not as engaging as the original, but nicely done all the same.  I bought this from Amazon Instant Video, and was disappointed at the amount of buffering time when streaming; was hoping for a solution to the overflowing DVD storage case, but I don't think this is going to be it.
1600108512|5.0|The Last Unicorn is a childhood classic to me - beloved and beautiful. This graphic novel version stays true to that and is an absolute delight to simply just thumb through. Definitely an excellent addition to my library!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Great action, fun and entertaining. I read these comics as a kid, great to see a movie with them together. I like Robert Downey Jr.s' Iron Man character.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm hooked on this game! I play on facebook and I wanted to also play it on my kindle and my phone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the game, but how do you play for free? Please inform me of this free game that it is supposed to be.
B00008G7UF|2.0|One of my favorite movies but in the first 5 minutes it skipped so bad, hard to watch.<br />Quality not good!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play this game while studying taking little breakes. It keeps your brain working but in a more relaxed environment. It also reminds me of PCB layout, something I learned in an Electronics class.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have found I very much enjoy all the John Grisham books, but I especially love the ones which are written in the same manner as the one which first grabbed me........A Time to Kill.  He writes in an easy to understand and follow way, yet it has a way of leading you around corners and makes you keep turning the pages to see where you are being led.  While rated as fiction, one is led to see the possibility of a true story.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Enjoyable, uplifting, entertaining. This series is respite from all the violent, angry, sexually explicit programs that seem to have overtaken movies and television.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I read every Grisham book. This was typical Grisham. From page one it had you going until the end. Good Book
B004FHCH96|5.0|We gave this movie to our son for Christmas last year and he loved it!  He says it is one of his favorite movies of all time (why I don't know, I never could follow it!)  As long as he liked it, that is what mattered!
B00GH4R95C|1.0|They turned Superman into a murderer, he is not a hero, he is a criminal.... Worst &#34;Super Hero&#34; movie of all time.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Exciting movie. While there are many highly improbable scenarios in the movie, it is very action packed and fun to watch. Definitely not one for younger kids. The zombie transformations are pretty frightening at times.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much and read all of the Clifton books.  He is one of my favoriite authors.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book is typical Grisham, a crackling, can't put it down legal thriller. Great character development, and a hard-charging, action-packed pace.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It kept my interest throughout the book.  I like John Grisham as an author and have read all his books.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The writing itself wasn't bad, but the story was very predictable. I'll probably try the second book and see if that changes.
B002G917ZK|3.0|Some films weather time passing, and others seem trite years later.  &#34;Breakfast&#34; seemed corny and didn't pass the weather test to me, even though it is considered a classic by many.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the book. The main characters are quirky and lovable. I've told everyone I know to read this delightful book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This works exactly as advertised and I love it. I use it on my Mac to watch live sports and have realized that I can have the game up on the Chromecast and still use my laptop at the same time. Occasionally the Chromecast will lag and then drop the connection, but it only takes a minute to reload.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|There were parts of the novel that didn't make sense and jumped to conclusions for which no ground work had been laid. Without giving too much away the ending didn't make a lot of sense...all the different groups, resetting, ect. I got where the author was headed with the final ending, but didn't love it. This needed to be edited a bit more and smoothed out to make sure all the parts connect. Similar to the other novels Four and Trise were written well and that made up for some of the plot shortfalls.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This game is worth the  $1.99 it is challenging and you might have to buy a few levels with the coins you earn but it is vary fun.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|An awesome read: interesting, inspiring, and easy. Gladwell is a storyteller and a scientist, which makes for excellent stories and lessons.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Me and my friend's like playing this game. The graphics could be better but the game is still my favorite
B009JZSC9S|4.0|This show is constantly amazing in that the story lines and the acting are first rate.  One of the best series on TV now.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I have had this headset for 2 years now, and it is amazing. For such a low price, you get a headset better than pretty much everything on the market. Great sound quality, very comfortable, and amazing build quality. I have dropped this, run it over in a chair, and just generally abused it, but it still works as well as the day I got it. Highly recommended. Also, because it is analog, I can use it for anything.
B00FPH3YQA|4.0|We liked this movie and thought it was a little cleaner than the other 2 until the last 2 minutes of the show.  Over all it was a good movie.
B00C6Q3UNK|4.0|My 9 year old love it.  Shes been playing with it everyday and added it to her collection of dolls
B005MLOOJA|4.0|It is a good show - not profound but has good moments. Overall, the characters do make you interested in them and it keeps me coming back for more episodes.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Ug.  I am a huge Amazon customer, but this book has finally taken me from purchaser to reviewer.  I disliked it that much.  What a disappointment.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love this series.  Can't wait for season 3 to come out on DVD and for the 4th season to start.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was a great wrap up to the series. I don't think anyone who's lived with these characters through the first two books will be disappointed.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie made me laugh and it was shot on the LSU campus I live in Baton rouge so i don't live to far from LSU
