B006LSZECO|4.0|I was loving the book until the end.  The he/she perspective was great and allowed the story to unfold in a way I had not really read before. However, the ending left me feeling cheated.  It seemed as though the author ran out of time or did not know how to conclude the story, so she just ended it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I finished reading this book 2 weeks ago and I can't stop thinking about Layken and Will. What an amazing love story!! I couldn't put this book down. I'm going to reread this book. Obsessed fan here.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Lots of fun to play.  Very similar to Mario Brothers.  Pretty easy to control as well. Acorn symbol a little hard to see at first.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Bought this CD as a gift and it arrived on time and in great condition!!! If you're a Linkin Park fan, this CD will not disappoint you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So like many of you, I got sucked into the hype. This isnt something I would generally read. I am more into murder/mystery and non-fiction. But oh my, this was a refreshing change!! I couldn't put it down! I am quickly reading thru the series, and I am not sure where to go next! It is a simple, easy read. It isnt award winning by any means, but I did find myself re-reading many of the encounters! Read the summary, if it something that you think you wont like, then dont read it. But if you are interested, even in the slightest, then give into the hype and pick it up. I wasnt disappointed! and neither was my husband! ;)
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Great CD almost everysong I had heard on the radio  don't know why I waited so long to get it....  love it
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I just loved the very unsophisticated but compelling simplicity of this book, but it contained a huge message!<br /><br />I learned; I loved; I  emphasized!  What a wonderful fulfilling experience! Use it before it's too late!
B004W648Y2|4.0|Following an excellent experience with the re-mastered 3 CD \\"The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society\\", and in particular with the markedly superior mono mixes included in the set (\\"Phenomenal Cat\\" - Wow!), along with similar treatment for singles and outtakes from the same era, I decided it was time to check out more from their catalog that offered the same. One by one I would work my way through what I consider the golden era of Kinks albums - from the mid 60's to early 70's  - and explore the world of Kinks mono.<br /><br />\\"Arthur\\" is.... A disappointment, at least in regards to mono. The source tape is very hissy, and the mixes generally put the vocals too high, which then tend to sound a bit shrill when looking for optimum listening volume.  Only the very last song, \\"Arthur\\", benefits from mono treatment, as the stereo mix is a bit too extreme with one channel percussion.<br /><br />This disappointment, however, is quickly remedied by a listen to the wonderful re-mastered stereo mix, which is an absolute pleasure. My guess is that by this time stereo rather than mono was the focus, because the mix is almost perfect. There's a great soundstage, with all instruments clear in the spectrum, and a perfect balance between instrumentation and vocals. For this alone, the disk is worth the price.<br /><br />But there's a bit more.<br /><br />Where the Arthur mono mix falls short, the extras that augment the collection have awesome mono mixes, and as it is with the Village Green era songs, the mono is often superior.<br /><br />\\"Plastic Man\\" & \\"This Man He Weeps Tonight\\" jump right out as more coherent and harder rocking. The stereo \\"This Man\\" has a completely different feel , like a California Byrds type of thing.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln County\\" is perhaps the best example of a better mono mix, with a carnival-like \\"swirl\\" effect coming clearly across, where the stereo separation is too extreme to feel that. It's just too \\"inside out\\".<br /><br />The last gem is the instrumental-only \\"Shangri-La\\", presumably found on a master tape before overdubs that are also presumably now lost.  When one considers the red-carpet treatment Abbey Road gave the master tapes of the Beatles, it is so saddening to think that so much of the Kink's master catalog doesn't exist, and we'll never be able to hear the sonic possibilities of complete remixes....sigh.<br /><br />However, for the stereo re-master, and for the mono versions of some of the extras - this package is well worth picking up.s the instrumental-only \\"Shangri-La\\", presumably found on a master tape before overdubs that are also presumably now lost.

1451627297|5.0|I've read every Stephen King book. I'm a huge fan, clearly. Not all are great. Some, frankly, should have stayed in a drawer. When he is doing his best work, though, it's hard for me to find someone who is a better storyteller. And like any great author, occasionally a masterpiece lands. This is easily one of his best novels ever, which is saying it's one of our best novels. Understand, you could not pay me to read anything about the Kennedy Assassination. I avoided this book for months, then started it, then put it down after about 40 pages, because I couldn't work up the energy to read about 'Oswald and ghosts' to quote Woody Allen. Finally, months later, I picked it up again and made it a little farther. One particular event happened and I was sucked in. I then tore through the first two-thirds, I was so entranced, then went slow in the final third because I didn't want it to end. It's that damn good. And while it certainly deals with the assassination, it is about so much more! The characters are wonderful and real, you care about them deeply. Where the novel eventually winds and it's ultimate points are genuinely surprising and thought-provoking. I cried a number of times in the final sections and was deeply, deeply moved. If certain critics and award circles could get over their haughtiness about populist authors, this could be the book that wins King some top awards. He deserves it for this. It's that damn good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book. Couldn't wait to read the next one. Everything written in great detail.  You could almost see it in the wording.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A MOST compelling read...couldn't put it down.  Although I was disappointed in the ending.  Not what I was hoping for..darn!
B0058YPILY|4.0|I enjoyed this DVD set.  It arrived in good time and was in good shape.  I spent an entire evening watching.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|FSOG is a very disappointing attempt at: writing rommance/erotica at any level. I struggled to read this rubbish and advised family and friends to ignore it.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|I was a little skeptical since this is what the 4th movie?  It was so funny and actually had a great story line.  Stifler still being himself which is a douche as he says!! Not for prudes though, Jason Biggs shows his junk which surprised me, but it is what it is!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|my bff told me bout this...i said it wss just a game befot i tryed it...now i am adicted! loge this game!!!
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Each album is different from the last, but they always converge on excellence.  This album, in particular, seems to be her most musically complex yet--and that says a lot.  She's just...awesome as ever.
B000256TD0|5.0|Great products, I bought all three as a set for a back to the future enthusiast. He loved them as well complimented the quality and replicable properties. They are now part of his model car collection. Would highly recommend for older kids or adults.
1451608659|5.0|\\"Off Balance: A Memoir\\" by Dominique Moceanu, treats two main themes:  the rigors of training to become an olympic athlete and issues of adoption.  Particularly growing up in a Romanian family with a Romainian coach, there was hard work and not much empathy.  On the adoption side, so many go so badly.  Here is a case where the adoptee ended up in the perfect family to encourage the sister with no legs to become a true member of her adopted family who enabled her to become all that she could be.  Great reading.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband loves TV and movies and has a vast collection of DVDs. I got this at a great price for a boxed set and knew he did not have it. It was a Father's Day gift for someone hard to buy for. He was very pleased to add this to his collection.
B0086700CM|2.0|It was alright for bout a day but it just gets boring doing the same thing over again and same background and no levels..make it more interesting!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I needed something to take me away from my \\"book hangover\\". This book did exactly that.Very enterataining. I loved the ending. A lot of people did and will hate it but I thought it was incrediably genius. Made me buy her other 2 books! Great job. Looking forward to more!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It helps me know exactly when to plug my Kindle in. It tells how long you can read, play games, or just be on standby. This app is very helpful!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game Iz pretty fun and it keeps me entertained and is some times pretty changeling and some are pretty daisy so this game is actually cool has a but load of games to play so you wont run out of games to play
B008MEM24S|5.0|I really want it but my mom will not buy it she said free only I just wish that it was free and not for $0.99.
030758836X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I am sure most who did not like it were not happy about the end. I thought that was creepily perfect!  When you have psycho, messed up characters, sometimes you get psycho, messed up endings.  Can't wait to go back and get her other books!
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|There is a lot to like in this movie. THe graphics are nice, the underlying story has depth and is entertaining. However, I find many scenes, dialogs, and characters are a little cheezy in an unnecessary way. A little gratuitous naked flesh here, a little too polished bad guy there. It is a little disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very detailed when it comes to sex, having said that I have read all three books and LOVE them.  I absolutely recommend!!!!
0425263908|5.0|definitely a must read if you liked reading 50 shades of grey, truly enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down.  The storyline was intriguing, the characters were amazing, you couldn't but help to fall in love with them. Never thought I would say this but I think I actually love the character of Gideon much better than Christian Grey.  The only down side, when the book ended, you wanted and needed to keep reading but now need to wait till October till the next one.  Have tried getting into other books since I have read 50 shades several times but couldnt get past the first two chapters, this book had me from the first page.  It's storyline is a bit similar to 50 shade, rich gorgeous guy that for the first time fell madly in love but the story is so heartwarming.  Think I will read it a second time, read it so fast the first time probably missed some details!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I know this got a ton of bad reviews, but despite all the sex, this was a story about a relationship that evolved into something great for the two people involved.  The sex was just the icing on the cake! I liked what ended up to be a great love story.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|The game in general is fun to play.  It does have some issues where it will freeze up when trying to visit &quot;friend's villages&quot;.  When it happens there is no way to back out of it so I have to force close my kindle.  It is pretty annoying plus I will never pass those challenges since that happens every time.
B008COD5UI|4.0|Enjoyed the multiple cameras presenting the movie from different characters point of views. Movie built for pure laughter! lacks a serious storyline but with teens, the more random, the better.
B005D4YOWI|5.0|I have had these sandals for 2 months now and they still look great. I wear sandals all the time during the summer. The cheap sandals I have been buying from Walmart rarely last more than a month. I drive a truck for a factory and all I do is spot trailers, so there is a lot of climbing up and down out of the truck. These are the first pair of sandals I have found that could take the punishment. Not to mention that they are probably the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn. Keen Newport Sandals are worth every penny and then some. When I wear these out, I will definitely buy more!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A must have series for the sci-fi fans. Watch at those browncoat parties with your friends and have a great time!
B00170GXQ2|4.0|If you like vampire movies this is a great one.  It has a good story line, romantic of sorts.  Characters are fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|an enjoyable way to waste some time.  I have only used the free play part which is relaxing and not too challenging.
034580404X|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed with the trilogy.  The underlying story of 2 people struggling with their identities was more important than the \\"all about sex\\" angle that has been the majority of opinions. I will be looking forward to seeing the movie and hoping it brings out the real story as I read it.
0374275637|5.0|Great psychology/behavioral book which focuses on human biases, rationality, fallacies, and the quest for happiness. Kahneman breaks the mind down into two agents to help explain his theories:<br /><br />System 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, subconscious<br />System 2: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious<br /><br />Although it can be complicated at times, overall this book is a great read and I definitely recommend it to anybody curious about why we do what we do and why we make mistakes.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This was a fun, quick game. I liked it. Good for those times you 're not sure  how much time you have
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Realy fun game I recomend that u play it as well u put 2 elements together and creat  a third party so<br />If u r intrested. In playing this game u should
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Left to right scroll, summoning allies and casting spells a you fight off wave after wave of zombies and demons. There's a lot of in game purchase available, and around wave 20 you'll probably be seriously considering it. Its one of very few games I've enjoyed enough that I've picked up my phone and headed to the couch instead of to my PC and my 50 dollar games.
B005GTJEZC|5.0|This gift set came in the mail very fast.  The blu rays have no problem playing in america.  Very glad i bough this box set
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game because it's very creative and it's super cool.  This game has lots of detail to it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|absolutely love the game but im really tired of acidentally buying plots of land... there should be a confirmation question for that ive wasted too many coins on land I didn't want =\
B001LM1456|1.0|Warning..these older movies include an expired digital code.  I bought this mainly for the digital version for my iPad.  Code did not work and I tried to get an updated code with no luck.  Emailed Amazon customer service and they approved and emailed me a return mailing label. So I assumed I would get a full refund.  When I got an invoice for a pitiful $2 credit because they charged me for postage and restocking fee I was extremely upset.  I am a long time Amazon Prime user and this was very disappointing.  They should have told me that they would charge me for the postage and restocking fee.  IF they had I would have just kept the DVD!  Buyer beware if you want the digital copy and shame on Amazon for not honoring a full refund.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Wow - great read. The characters were living in a completely different world; but, I could feel such a connection to them as if I knew them. Makes you appreciate life - we have it very easy.
B00884GR0W|5.0|OMG! 2012 best game of the year! I got it a month ago and OMG!!! It's freaking awesome! It's nothing like minecraft and is not a ripoff of it and ROCKS! AMAZING JOB GUYS!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the kids love playing the game. its a lot of fun and they entourage the movies also. they want yo play all the time
0470876417|5.0|This book not only presents a very efficient model for planning and discussing business strategy. It provides a review of ALL the major online business strategies presented with its method. This single book can give a team the shared language they need to rapidly define or redefine their business.<br /><br />It's simple and aesthetically attractive. The typeface is a little small and the last 2/3s of the book are about how to plan and brainstorm with their tool - if you have a background in brainstorming and facilitation it might not be impressive to you.<br /><br />As my subject line says, the first 105 pages are worth twice the price.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Loved it! I play all the time when it's slow at work and it's so nice to be able to play by yourself. I think the challenge thing that it does on draw 4 wilds is a little weird but overall, great product!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Buying into the hype, I decided to read this appalling book.  At chapter 2 I wanted to give up after the word 'beseiged' was used twice in 2 sentences to describe how overwhelmed Ana felt working at the hardware store.  I pressed on, nevertheless, but at chapter 6 had to start skim reading... This book is dreadful.  Yes - it's some 'fun' mummy porn, but really, it's just not worth it.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I don't use it a whole lot. It was kind of a hassle to set up in the beginning. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone.
0345803507|5.0|Every woman should read all 3 books in order.  Excellent writer.  Waiting for her to write more.  Definitely the best!!!
B005LAIGF0|3.0|Spoilers! The acting was very good; so many scenes seemed very real to me. But too many  scenes also seemed totally pointless. Ramon's wake & son saying he'd wanted to marry the mother? (Ramon's whole business in the movie at all was tenuous at best.) The argument with a student about the intent in a line of Shakespeare's? The landscape scenes? (At one point it was so extended, we thought the movie might have ended.) These inconsequential scenes kept getting in the way of the movie instead of adding to it. The story itself is very compelling, but the addition of pointless scenes was annoying. I watched the 150-minute version. I keep wondering if the 186-minute version made those pointless scenes have meaning by somehow tying them into the plot. But I'm sure I'll never know, because I can't imagine ever wanting to spend that many minutes watching these little vignettes into someone's everyday life again.
0316123587|5.0|I'm a huge gleek and as soon as I saw this on the Internet I immediately ha to have it. I went on to amazon and bought. I was kinda sad not to see tehe newer characters in it but whatever. I also think there should have been an actual yearbook page with all their pictures. But over all I loved it.
B005H0YP7W|5.0|It has been a hot Summer, and this release is a rush of cool air, with a light mist to quench your thirst after a long year of dry A-typical lyrics, flows and rhythm chords.  The cover presents eye-cathching artistry definately enough to make you look twice and you can just tell it is some flavor inside. This release is a classic debut with many memorial tracks with uplifting anthems, good vibrations and faithfulness.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is great! I'm grateful that this app is for the kindle. I like challenging other peoples highscore. Awesome!!!
B00846REIS|1.0|So frustrated with this book. I finally put it down and plan not to finish reading this book. The similarities to the 50 Shades story are so apparent that I found myself rolling my eyes at times. Also, it is a boring read. I am not a fan of her \\"writing style\\" as some have mentioned, I find it boring and offensive. I am not a prude but certain words used could surely have been replaced with a more fitting and less vulgar word. At least in the 50 series, I was anticipating what would happen or what was next or when someting would finally happen between the two main characters. In this book, not so much.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's a \\"Love it or hate it\\" kind of book. I personally loved it! Yes, there's a repetitive use of words, but it's still very addicting, fun and romantic! It's Hard to put down! I found myself laughing out loud many times! The BDSM aspects are shocking and hot, but the emotional pull it's definitely the real focus.
1416511946|5.0|I like the book a lot. Something real to read about. He has a great true story, that paints pictures in you mind. I like Motley Crue and I love Sixx A.M.
B0023ZLI42|5.0|These two books can make sense of a lot of information that is typically given as separate pieces. Good instructors integrate concepts for their students and make the puzzle of separate lessons into a picture that becomes music. The students that have been frustrated by having lots of lessons that they struggled to integrate will be well served in purchasing this series of studies.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This cd is just as good as the book. It's like he summerized the book, and put it into amazing music. It's depressing, but it's real.
0307460444|5.0|I was very happy with my recent purchase of the book, Martha Stewart's Cupcakes: 175 Inspired Ideas for Everyone's Favorite Treat. The book arrived quickly, and it arrived in excellent condition. In addition, it is the perfect book for what I needed. It has so many awesome ideas for fabulous cupcakes, and also includes websites to find the baking tools I need. Plus, beautiful photos, which I love!

B00782O7NE|5.0|One of the most creative films ever. Five academy awards pretty much sums it up. Mel Brooks did an admirable silent film. The Artist stands alone. 5 stars!
B005N4F48Q|5.0|After a trip to Gettysburg, we reinforced our education on the field with this film and were very satisfied with the film. It helps to flesh out the major characters of the Civil War who seem to be fictional until one walks the fields of Gettysburg and learns about Meade and Lee, Chamberlain  and Pickett, to mention a few. These men live and breathe again on the film and this film makes learning about the three most decisive and bloody days of the Civil War far more understandable.
B0086HJW76|5.0|I like this new \\"album\\". I first heard Joe when I was in college back in 1974 when he was touring in Florida. I was always impressed with his range of material, including the classical influences on \\"So What\\" and his obvious guitar chops on James Gang and other solo work. To connect with the rest of us grey hairs out there, he continues to put together plenty of good material that is timely, funny, and still shows flashes of guitar brilliance. It is especially meaningful to hear him talking about the changes in his own life and weaves his reflections into this new material without sounding too preachy. It was great seeing him live at Fontanel here in Music City earlier this summer. Keep it up, Joe!

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The is a good cover. It serves it purpose. Also I like it because it serves as a dual protection.<br />It is a protector and a stand. I would recommend this product.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|This one is good from the beginning to the end! Payphone is my favorite song, and you should check it's video.
B002CN2NCG|5.0|The disc was in perfect condition with no scratches.  Disc data has no skips or jumps.  A great buy for a Blue-ray of a classic movie.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|To begin, let me say that Don Mancini is probably the only person in Hollywood that could pull off the \\"living doll\\" idea with any amount of success. Luckily, he was the writer of Child's Play, a film about a little boy who receives a doll for his birthday that is possessed by the spirit of a serial killer. Many people will be most familiar with the \\"living doll\\" stuff from R.L. Stine's popular children's books Goosebumps. There were originally three Goosebumps books (excluding the other bizarre sequels, like in Goosebumps Horrorland or Goosbumps 2000), that dealt with dolls coming alive. \\"Night of the Living Dummy\\", \\"Night of the Living Dummy II\\", and \\"Night of the Living Dummy III\\" were all successful books that would have introduced children to dolls coming to life. They were so successful they received follow-ups like \\"Bride of the Living Dummy\\", and \\"Revenge of the Living Dummy.\\" That being said, however, R.L. Stine can never compare to Child's Play. Child's Play is a lot better than the R.L. Stine stories you would have grown up reading. These are actually scary. That being said, let's get back on the topic of Child's Play.<br />Okay, so this movie is basically about a serial killer that transferred his soul into a doll and, in order to refrain from being sealed in his kid-friendly container forever, must transfer his soul into the first person he let in on his secret, that he was a killer. Consequently, it happened to be six-year-old Andy Barclay, who desperately wanted a Good Guy for his birthday. It is a cute doll, to begin with, and the movie starts off really well. Just when you think you have things straightened out, Chucky turns evil.<br />From start to finish, Child's Play is, hands-down interesting. First and foremost, the doll is awesome, with its evil (with an edge of comedy) attitude, and the killings are cool. Everybody that's seen the movie wants a Good Guys doll, and, to me, that makes the film so much more special. That somebody would see a movie and want something in the movie, to me, means that it's a good movie.<br />This movie serves to show that even the stupidest ideas ('cause, let's think, dolls coming to life isn't an Einstein move) can make the most frightening movies.ie and want something in the movie, to me, means that it's a good movie.<br />This movie serves to show that even the stupidest ideas ('cause, let's think, dolls coming to life isn't an Einstein move) can make the most frightening movies.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely loved it. Can't find anything better and she needs to keep that going as a Series....  Not only would she make a fortune but make a lot of readers very happy. Plus we wouldn't have to look for comparable reading material.  Thanks EJ for the romance.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I have always been a P!nk fan, but I wasn't ever as pleased as when I heard I'm Not Dead. It is the best album of her career! I love the songs and can't wait for her new album to come out!
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|I chose this book because I am a former Canadian and had read the sample. It started off well and I was fascinated with the family dynamics and the weirdness of the parents, especially the mother. However, as the book progressed it became sloggish and repetitive. The characters got weirder and even though I was excited to see how it ended, the ending was a big disappointment.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King is always good if it's not too scary. This was a brilliant idea and most will be trying to figure out what happens in the end even though it's a fun and fascinatinating read from the beginning.<br />I happened to figure out the ending (not always the case) and was thrilled I was right. Maybe that is why I liked it so much.
034580404X|4.0|5 pages of significance in 500 pages of lust and enlightment. Good reading, and liked the storyline. Interesting characters and good writing.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|The rating is for the 6th series itself.  I'm not going to give the series a bad rating because of a fake copy.  Anyway, the copy of this that I just received is a fake/bootleg copy.  It is VERY professionally done, it almost fooled me, but I noticed a few things off.  Here's how to tell if you got a REAL copy or a bootleg.  I've noticed a few people complaining about poor packaging...THIS IS WHY.  The real set does not have poor packaging.<br /><br />1) Inside the box (once you take the interior \\"case\\" out), there should be one of those plastic security stickers.  If that's not there, that indicates it was either repackaged or bootleg.  New sets are never repackaged.<br />2) The episode description on the INSIDE of the sleeve should be glossy like the outside.  If it's not, it's fake.<br />3) The DVD cases themselves shoule be BLUE like in the picture above.  If they are clear, it's fake.<br />4) The print on the disks themselves on a bootleg copy are lower resolution than they should be.  They don't look bad (like I said this was professionally done), but they don't look nearly as good as the real ones.<br />5) The case indicates that this is a region 1 set.  I examined one of the disks with DVD Decrypter...it comes up region 0 (region free), and all the disks are titled \\"NEW\\".<br /><br />Make sure you look VERY CAREFULLY at your set when you receive it, and look for the above things.  The people that are making these fake sets obviously know what they are doing.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|So often Hollywood takes a book I have loved for years and completely trashes it (Starship Troopers by Robert H. Heinlein instantly comes to mind).  This is not one of those cases.  It's been a good 30 years since I read the John Carter of Mars series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and time has faded many of the details from my memory, but this movie captures the \\"look and feel\\" of that character much better than I expected.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I generally love romance novels with any sort of paranomal view. As we all know vampires, werewolves, and witches have come and gone time and time again. Well Karen(writer) takes fantasy to a whole new direction. The word fairy is NOTHING like we all believe in our world. This book is dark, magical, DIFFerent, lust, anger, murder, passion, basically not your average romance novel. Incredible story line but the books are cliffhangers which leave you either losing sleep =) or impatient for the final book to come out in january 2011.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Great game for kids and adults! Downloaded for my 8 yr old and got totally addicted myself. Can't wait for more levels to come out.
159562015X|3.0|Interesting book, but being used the former owner used the code for conducting StrengthsFinder on-line survey. Such a fact should have been noted,b/c if I'd known that the main reason for my buying this book was not going to be available I'd have bought a different one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is the best game ever!!! I like because you have to think a little to complete the puzzle. and its just a REALLY awesome game!
030758836X|5.0|Finally, a book where the next step is often a shock and not obvious.  Very different book....well written, hard to put down, great characters, interesting story....really gets into the psychology of the characters so that you understand why they behave the way they do.  This also makes the characters seem very real and , like real people, very complex.<br /><br />I have recommended this novel to many of my friends; one of the best I have read in a long time.
1595141979|5.0|I loved this book.  took two days to read this one.  This series is first rate.  Can not wait to read more these books.  D.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this bag a few months ago and it was 32 and some change...I think this is an EXCELLENT SPACIOUS EASILY CUSTOMIZABLE BAG.....BUY IT! Very nicely padded back, between you and the bag.<br /><br />What does it actually hold? Here is what I have in mine:<br />Canon T4i, Canon 100mm 2.8 Macro lens, Canon 17-55mm 2.8 lens, Canon 50mm 1.8 lens, Canon 10-22mm 3.5-4. lens, Canon 70-200mm IS II 2.8 lens, Canon 70-300mm lens, Kenko Macro tubes, Kenko 2x Teleconverter (Extender)....tons of extra batteries and extras in all of the extra pockets and compartments!
B007PJFIU6|5.0|My daughter took this game to the beach to play with her cousins.  It was a huge hit with all the girl cousins and their friends.  They would make special trips to the beach house so they could play.  The ages were 10-14 and they absolutely loved it.  I enjoyed it too, and was disappointed I couldn't get my nephews to play, because I think they would have enjoyed making up stories.  I highly recommend this game for people with tweens or young teens - it's a great game for the family to play.<br /><br />Only one minor bump was we misinterpreted the scoring rules for the first few games, by not giving points to the people whose cards received wrong guesses.  Once that was cleared up, the incentives to play correctly lined up and we didn't worry about people purposely throwing a wrong card.  We also found that first time players always make their clues way too specific.  Fun for everyone!
B001EJV276|2.0|Wanted to see the movie for my Spanish class and assumed it would have audio and subtitle options. It was a great disappointment to find out it doesn't have any.
0439023513|5.0|The best book of the trilogy.  Because it does not trivialize the horrors of war and the moral delimnas combatants face, it is thought provoking.  It is also cognizant of the psychological effects and after effects (PTSD) of combat and psyops. A must read for those interested in stories about the human struggle, and political conflict.
B0086700CM|4.0|Extremely fast paced but challenging for a senior citizen but my granddaughter had a ball. She introduced me to games that she plays with her friends in Al.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I got this for my daughter but found myself playing ot over and over again. Carly Rae is a great young singer and I hope to follow her career.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I couldn't even get through the first 20 pages before putting this book down in disgust. The writing is appalling, and like many of you I was seduced by the fact that this was such a quick seller and about BDSM (who doesn't like a bit of sauciness?).  I sincerely regret not having read some reviews on Amazon before I shelled out the cash though. Don't do it!!!
B005POK858|2.0|this game is ok it would be better if you could change the name of the main character like you could on grinsia
B00127RAJY|3.0|If I didn't own any of her other workout videos, I probably would have rated this workout better.  I had already completed 'Ripped in 30' and 'No More Trouble Zones' prior to buying '30 Day Shred'. I realized that '30 Day Shred' has essentially the exact same routines as 'Ripped in 30', but '30 Day Shred' doesn't have as many workouts per circuit.  It seems like Jillian took her original workout of '30 Day Shred', then amped it up to create 'Ripped in 30', so I felt that I got much better workout with the later. I'm not a professional athlete or anything, but I've always been very active, so I didn't find '30 Day Shred' to be as challenging as I wanted. But, for someone who is looking for a more beginner workout, I think '30 Day Shred' would be an excellent place to start.  Once you've mastered it, I would then suggest taking on 'Ripped in 30' for an even bigger challenge.  Both workouts are comprised of 4 different workouts (about 25-30 min each), so I love it that I can do a different workout each day, or get a couple workouts in at a time. Oh, and coupled with a change in my diet (no sugar whatsoever), I lost 5 pounds during the first 4 weeks of 'Ripped in 30'.  I'm not overweight, so losing even a single pound takes a lot of work...the last 5-10 pounds to reach your goal are always the hardest.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is one of the best movies about today's warfare which is well directed and acted by real soldiers. I watched this movie twice and I still feel great after watching.  Sometimes, we take peace for granted as everyday is life as per normal. It is these brave men which are depolyed somethere to fight against these forces and even lost their lives. The aim is to maintain peace and order. Not to forget the back end support from their family members too.<br />It is a grest movie for keeps and repeat viewing. Show the support for them by buying acopy of this movie.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Great book at the approach to happiness from a different angle of seeing it as a work ethic.  Highly recommended!
0671027344|5.0|Book was in superb condition. I love the whole plot of the book and makes you think about your actions. It addresses common teen problems
B006MW3VC4|5.0|I love British drama and this series had me riveted.  I did not watch it when it first came out on PBS (shame on me) so I had to buy season 1 and 2 and literally watched 3 episodes a day until I had seen everything. Brilliant writng and acting.  Characters come alive immediately.  I can't say enough about the folks at the Abbey!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|this movie is really cute, super funny and my kids loved it it kept them laughing the whole time. ,
0345803485|5.0|All of my co-workers had been reading this trilogy and that is all anyone talked about. Now I know what all the hoopla was about. I couldn't wait to finish one to go to another. The love story is great!!!!!!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|me and my children really enjoyed this movie (2 & 4) and it shipped fast, came in excellent condition so i was really happy and have no complaints.
0425263908|1.0|I don't mean to sound mean...but what is wrong with women? how is emotionally dysfunctional men sexy? oh thats right..he's super hot..he's a stalker too...thats okay..he's hot. I mean COME ON!!! This kind of drivel does not need to be printed. IF this happened in real life women would be calling the police on the guy. But since it's in a book that makes it okay. I just don't get it. I am just going to stay away from \\"best sellers.\\" Because so far none have lived up to the hype give. This goes in the trash along with Shades of Grey. I really wish people would actually THINK about the books they read. Sorry for being blunt and mean, but I am done with books like these.
B001HN6918|4.0|me and my children really enjoyed this movie (2 & 4) and it shipped fast, came in excellent condition so i was really happy and have no complaints.
B000ICZD5M|4.0|Slow but sure i am upgrading my movie library to blueray, so when i see them on sale or at a desent price point i purchase.  That is the thinking behind buying Dune and 2010: The Year We Make Contact.  Both films a bit dated but are great little films and the blueray always is a better qualitiy and hold up better in the long run.<br /><br />Amazon.com got them there on time and before scheduled delivery date in great shape.<br /><br />Very happy wiht my purchases.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|i bought this movie around 4 or 5 months ago and my children (2 & 4) and i fell in love with it. we have watched it close to 100 times. it is an absolutely adorable movie, it does have some \\"voodoo\\" in it but personally it does not bother me at all, but every parent is different.
B00004SEWN|4.0|The only song I am familiar with is \\"Coming Back for More\\".  Took me years to find this song because I only remembered a fragment of it from long time back.  Love this song so I just had to get this!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I would highly recommend getting this app on the Kindle. It allows you so much more room to create your drawing and to make precise details that you wouldn't have if you used a mobile device. It works nicely, never freezes, and is just an all around entertaining game. I would encourage anyone to try it, artists or not it is highly amusing.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|the game has a fun level up system plays a little like plants vurses zombies so its catchy.  keeps items even if you die on the level so you can keep making money to by stronger level ups.
B004159Y98|4.0|The song \\"The Blowers' Daughter\\" was featured in a Jude Law movie (bad at remembering titles) - \\"I can't take my eyes off of you\\".  I really liked this song but never had it until now.  Love the entire album =)
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I have a hard time sticking with books that don't grab my attention right from the get go.  Therefore, I usually will only pay for books on my Kindle that are by authors I know I like.  I'd never heard of this author, but it was only $3.99 and I was in dire need of promising reading material.  So, I figured I'd give it a try.  Of course, the next book in the series is going to be full price, but if it lives up to my expectations after reading Discovery it'll be worth it.  This book took about a chapter to really get going.  I'm not saying it was the best book I've EVER read, but it was really good and I'm hooked!  The characters are interesting, at times unpredictable, and not always lovable.  The story line is intriguing and original.  I finished it in about 2 weeks and now I have to buy the next book in the series to figure out what happens next!
B008KRJWEK|1.0|This game would be fun if it was not so glitchy. Ran great the first day. Now it wont show my money. Also it relies to much on it wanting you to spend your own money. Not worth spending any money if they wont fix it
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the absolute best book, in my opinion, in the Hunger Games series.  I finished it in 4 days (that's fast for me).  If you loved the Harry Potter books and are sad that they are over because you just can't find anything that lives up to that level of wonderful, give this series a try.  It's only 3 books, but you feel the characters emotions and live through their struggles with them from page one of book one to the last page in the last book.  Now, I'm sad that this series is finished too!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome! if u r looking at this to find out if u want it, then get it. u wong be sorry ;)
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I couldn't wait to buy this second book after finishing the first one.  Despite the remarks from some readers, so far I am still having a hard time putting it down.  I'm only 1/4 of the way thru it though so don't want to comment completely yet.But I'm definitely enjoying it so far.me  There is a lot of historical background that I had a hard time following as I'm not big on history but the character development is so good it keeps me involved.
0786958731|4.0|the game is fun enough. the miniatures alone are worth the price of this box. 1 issue I have though not a big one is, out of the 9 times my buddies and I played this game we won only once, and barely.  my major issue with this was the condition the box arrived.  mine was crushed on one corner and had a puncture mark on the top. this package came from amazon, so department was tempered by surprise. the pieces were all fine so I never did anything about it.  the actual punch out pieces are delicate, be very careful punching then out.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love all the free choices on this app and the fact you can set your own challenge level.<br />The pictures are of high quality and soothing music plays in the background.<br />All in all a great app. Would be nice if there were even more free puzzles, but can't really complain considering all the ones that come free on this app.
1453804080|1.0|If I had known that I could buy this from Barns and Nobles for $4.99, I would have gotten it there.  This book was missing a chapter and my son can't even read it.  Now I have to go out and buy another one.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|This is a well put together album. It has many elements and I think they did a good job. Some part where a little loud for me but still good non the less. on a scale from 1 to 10 I would give it and 7.8. because it goes quick and you want more which is a good thing but I want it now :n)
0783232039|2.0|If you like the Child's Play movies, the one where Chucky is a cute doll hunting down a little boy (or, in the case of the last instalment, a teenager) named Andy Barclay, then this film isn't for you. This movie is extremely different in comparison with the others. We suddenly realize that Jennifer Tilly and Charles \\"Chucky\\" Lee Ray had a love relationship back when Chucky was a human??? And to add to the fun, Chucky **SPOILER** possesses a female doll, given to him by Jennifer as a joke, \\"You may kiss the bride!\\" with the soul of Jennifer Tilly, and the killer female doll Tiffany is born!<br />Now, most of the Child's Play movies had a pretty even balance of horror and comedy, but this instalment goes haywire. This movie is dependent on comedy. There isn't anything scary (or even jumpy, for that matter) about this movie. And, Chucky doesn't have any specific people he has to kill, or people he has to possess. All he needs is to get a certain item, and he tricks a young couple into helping them get it.<br />Perhaps the only thing keeping this review from being a one-star is John Ritter. He plays a cranky uncle that doesn't want his daughter dating her boyfriend. She *SPOILER* runs away from the uncle, and the couple get married last-minute at a church, rendering the uncle powerless against the marriage.<br />Brad Dourif is, again, the role of Chucky, and his voice perfectly suits the role. However, when he read the screenplay, he had to have been thinking 'are you guys serious? this sounds like the stupidest movie ever! i don't want to do that!' However, he did, and it is, indeed a stupid rip of Bride of Frankenstein. Equally, R.L. Stine, author of the famous children's horror series Goosebumps, released a book in his \\"Night of the Living Dummy\\" series (a miniseries, all released under the Goosebumps name) entitled \\"Bride of the Living Dummy,\\" which, if I'm not mistaken, was released before this movie. Coincidence?<br />Jennifer Tilly fits the role of Tiffany verywell, although (I'm sorry all you Tiffany fans) Tiffany does not belong in the Chucky movies. They were much better when they had only Chucky and he only had to kill Andy (although he would kill anybody who would get in his way). Thank GOD the new sequel (after Seed) is going back to continue after Child's Play 3. The movie is called Curse of Chucky. THAT will be worth watching, more than this. Although, I could sit through it once, I probably wouldn't do it again. PASS!
B0070QSP5O|4.0|It took me a while to get into Old Ideas. The first couple of times I heard it, I was busy working and thought a few songs were OK, but then the rest was just odd. But I never give up on an artist I like after just a couple listens, so when I had the chance to actually listen to it rather than just hearing it, I found it opened up like a properly decanted wine. And reading the lyrics while listening really enhances enjoyment of the album.<br />All Leonard Cohen fans already know his facility with language, the lyrics to the songs on Old Ideas are deep, perhaps deeper than usual, and the music simple, almost quasi-religious, alluring, and swirling with delightful harmonies. Some well-known people like Ed Sanders and Jennifer Warnes are here, and Sharon Robinson is back to add her special touches.<br />My favorite cuts are the redemptive Amen, the searing Darkness, the gospel-tinged Banjo, and the thought-provoking Different Sides.<br />The CD comes with a very informative and attractive booklet containing the all-important lyrics, sketches and lyrical scraps by Cohen, as well as pertinent and useful album information. There is also an insert within the booklet containing the lyrics in Spanish. Some will be delighted by this album immediately but others may be put off as it is so different from what we've come to expect. If you are among the latter, do yourself the favor of giving it a few more chances. You won't be sorry.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love to read and can read about anything. These three books are the best that I have ever read. I do not know why everyone thinks they are just about sex. The story itself is so amazing. I have read them more than once. It is like a good movie, when you watch it for the second or third time you find out that you have missed different things that are right in front of you. So if you have read it, read it again. If you have not read it, read it.<br /><br />Laters, baby
B001FB55HQ|2.0|How bad can a Terminator movie with Christian Bale (AND Sam Worthington), a big budget, and access to modern special effects be?<br /><br />Pretty darn bad.<br /><br />It plays like a cheesy Mad Max movie - except it wasn't produced in Australia with a then-unknown brand new actor and a low budget in the '70's.<br /><br />The key \\"reveal\\" of the movie is thrown away almost accidentally. No psychological, wonder if, wonder what, build up. No doubt or surprise when a team member switches sides. In short, these days even comic books are much deeper.<br /><br />Don't get me started about the young actor who plays Kyle Reese, John Connor's future time traveling father. He was completely unsuited to the role! (But played an excellent \\"Chekhov\\" in the Star Trek reboot the same year.)<br /><br />I won't say don't waste your money on it. But don't have much in the way of high expectations.<br /><br />And stand in awe of James Cameron, who with spit for budget kicked off this series in the first place, with the low budget, but high impact, original Terminator.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|If you liked Thrones this continues its greatness. Despite the loss of some great characters from the first book COK is fantastic and continues an incredible story with deep and flawed characters who you get almost too attached to. The brilliance of Martin can not be said enough.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|I have always been a fan of Donna Summer back in those disco days. This is a fantastic cd-album set.<br />It brings back memories of how great Donna Summer was.<br />I would definitely recommend this cd set to anyone and this includes the kids of today. They don't know what they're missing when it comes to descend, quality danceable music.<br /><br />Donna Summer will be truly missed but you don't have to miss her music when you buy this cd set.<br /><br />Bruce
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is by far one of the great fantasy novels ever written. In some ways I can't explain how good it is, reading this you almost feel like you are reading historical fiction. The worlds and characters are so detailed, real, and in some cases flawed that it makes relating to them an easy task. Can't say enough good things about it, if you have not got into this genre, this is the book to try.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|\\"Quiet\\" is a must read for people who live or work with an introvert. The patience required to allow a fellow worker or family member to listen and think through her response and to listen attentively when the reply is forthcoming is amply rewarded on many levels. The author, an introvert herself, offers a sound argument for less talk and more thought in today's world of constant babble.

B000P0J06U|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />\\"Batman Returns\\" is a thrilling piece of serious superhero filmmaking. In what would be his final bow in the Batman and Bruce Wayne dual role, Michael Keaton delivers another definitive performance.  It is important to note that though Christian Bale attains equal mastery of the part in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, Michael Keaton is also highly apt in the role.  The audience is fortunate to have two interpretations of such high quality from which to choose.  Mr. Keaton gives a fantastically solid performance in this film, his character fighting an enemy in The Penguin that in some ways is a broken mirror of Bruce Wayne's own background.<br /><br />Gotham City is fully into the Christmas holiday as the movie begins, and business impresario Max Schreck(Christopher Walken) is all too happy to play a smarmy Santa Claus to boost his image among the city's trusting denizens.  Schreck doesn't think very much of his mousy secretary Selina Kile(Michelle Pfeiffer) or the rumors of a legendary half-man/half-penguin living in the city's sewers until he comes face to face with the grotesque creature in a great sequence.<br /><br />This movie gives us more of The Penguin's backstory than is arguably available in any other \\"Batman\\" media outside of the comic books.  Born a deformed child named Oswald Cobblepot to wealthy parents who abandon him out of shame and fear, this movie reveals The Penguin to be a tragic, though evil, character.  Danny DeVito digs into the character, and gives a stunning performance.  For her part, Michelle Pfeiffer balances two demanding sides of a character, being appropriately retiring as Selina Kile and seductively dangerous as Catwoman.<br /><br />Tim Burton also gives up the director's chair for \\"Batman\\" fims after this installment, but he makes sure that \\"Batman Returns\\" is a compulsively watchable superhero film.
0345803507|5.0|I do agree with some of the other reviews that a lot of things are repeatedly said and it took me a while it get over it but other than that I fell in love with the books. Yes they are erotic that didn't both me one bit it's better than reading those ridiculous romance novels that are beyond fake in the love scenes tho I've never known anyone to cum on cue.<br /><br />I was shocked to find these books at Wal-mart but glad I did. Who knows maybe it's just my marriage isn't as exciting anymore but this sure has sparked my interest and wish there was more. I also wish she wouldn't of given us an update on Mia and Ethan at the end of the book other than them holding hands.<br /><br />Other than that I'm just glad this series didn't turn out like Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty Trilogy if this is ever a series with all types of bondage and no real plot that will numb your senses it would be that one.<br /><br />Keep up the work E. L. James I thoroughly enjoyed it!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app!! The Relaxation sounds are great and you are able to set the timer to either pre-set times or a duration of your choosing. You are also able to combine sounds or beats to create and save Favorites even adjusting the volume. There are a lot of sounds you have to choose from, nature, animal, music, theme, etc.<br /><br />Next I thought I'd give the binaural beats a try. Wow! I can't believe how quickly I went into a relaxed state. I've never meditated or tried relaxation before but the beats quickly brought me to a different state of mind. I've been dealing with a lot of stressful situations lately and so many issues I have been suppressing were released just by listening to the beats. I was able to begin to uncover them and see them in a different light then I was able to before. I think this app will be very helpful to me. I'm next going to try to find a combination of sounds to help me deal with the acute pain of recent surgery and the chronic pain I've been living with for many years. I can't say it will work that way for everyone but it did tor me.<br /><br />I can't believe how much worth this app has already provided me. I purchased the premium version and am so glad I did. I can't wait till the Asian Relaxation app is developed for the Kindle Fire.

0345803485|5.0|No this book isn't perfect but I did enjoy it. I think this one, the first one, is my favorite out of the three.<br /><br />wow!!! The Haters and Trolls have it out for these books!!!<br /><br />Read the other reviews to see what I mean.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The first book definitely peeked my interest and the second book has not dissappointed me.  Still alittle shocking to read at times, but I am so involved with Christian and Ana.  Looking forward to Book 3.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is well written book. Thank you sending this book on time when I ordered. I enjoyed a lot. Amazon always saves my fast reading!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was alittle nervous about reading this book.  Some of the content was pornagraphic like, but I kept reading because I am thoroughly involved in the love story of the book.  I think the way the author describes each character, gives my imagination a wonderful workout.
0345409671|5.0|I have purchased this book over 10 times throughout my lifetime.<br />The reason for this was I wanted to give it to others so they can understand why it captured me so.<br />This book made me question a lot of things when I first read it about 15 years ago.  It challenged what I thought I knew about religion, life, and everything anyone has ever told me was true.  It led me down a path of spiritual enlightenment, questioning and self reflection that ultimately led me to a place where I finally feel at peace with such things. I feel this is much like Anne Rice herself has done throughout her life.<br /><br />If you are looking for a typical vampire novel, this isn't what you want. This is something much different and unexpectedly placed withing the vampire chronicles.  The character of Lestat is the perfect creature to meet with the devil and go through this adventure however, and his unique lavish selfishness, and the depictions of hell and Memnoch's story about \\"the truth behind the devil\\" really conflict with Lestat at this point in the story.  After the events of the Queen of the damned, where the main characters face creatures of unbelievable power and cruelty Memnoch the Devil offers readers another confrontation with the all powerful, and one that not only deeply affects the character, but the reader as well.<br /><br />Not for the weak of will.
B005JR3ERK|5.0|Mind blowing show and mind blowing episode. The episodes are really clear and I can take my time and pause, etc - as opposed to watching it on Sunday nights and risk missing something. Really great show. Best one I've ever seen.
B005OHSUQK|5.0|I had to get this episode because I had lost power and I'm a big fan and could not wait for the repeat, thanks!
0316069884|5.0|This is an important book for all people who eat animals, or don't.  It is written with much thought and research and Jonathan \\"tells it like it is\\".  This book is an education, and well worth it.  Reading this book has made me take action, that I never thought I would take.
B0058FW1MM|5.0|I've never been a fan of the movies \\"Teen wolf\\" but after watching an episode from the 2nd season, I was drawn to the show and wanted to know more. So now I'm on my 5th episode of the 1st season and have to say that Teen Wolf has all the right ingredients to a suspense thriller in a show. My teens can watch it with me and there's not a lot of adult content at all. My whole family can enjoy the show. I hope to see several more seasons in the future!!!<br />Thanks to the cast and director/creator of Teen Wolf :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|very capivating,I realy got to know the girl in the story and could feel her pain and hope Interesting ending
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Love the show, my favorite season with Donna. But be careful with what you get. Got a bootlegged copy on my first order. Cover design looked perfect but the text on the disks was badly misspelled  and package was a. It damaged. Got a refund on the set. Still love the season but just hate the bootlegging.
B000ZN802W|1.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone...SPOILER AND DEPRESSION ALERT!<br /><br />Sure...a competent cast and decent cinematography that follows a young man's trek of idealistic obsession into Alaska....WHERE HE DIES AND IN HIS LAST MOMENTS (in the movie) FEELS HORRIBLE HINDSIGHT, REGRET, AND ISOLATION!...one reviewer called this a horror movie and I agree. I think one of the scariest things is regret someone feels when dying and I am not the type of person that finds it fun to watch in movie form! Then, they tossed the real Christopher McCandless's picture right before end credits with some of the worst bullshit music playing after you just experienced his actor-self dying. I think I would have rather read the book. Surely the book doesn't traumatize you like this movie does.<br /><br />So the answer he was looking for, he found... at the cost of his life. There was no way he could enjoy his new found revelation because he was stuck in the wilderness with no one. It was not one of those moments where he became fully realized and the trip payed off...no. He was a sweet, but lost, kid...with some admirable ideals that he took too far, and payed the consequences. It was very sad and I felt very distressed after watching this movie.<br /><br />This movie crossed a line for me...dramatizing such a thing as raw as Penn did is not admirable imo. I am sure there was a better balance he could have struck, and shown more of the beauty from this guy's life. The few times McCandless stops to stare beauty in the face of a herd running by or during some hippies talking didn't do his life justice!<br /><br />Shame on you, Hollywood! Tryin to give me nightmares, you sons of ^%#&@! I seriously want to undo this movie in my brain. For anyone reading this, seriously don't watch this movie. Go watch Kung Fu Panda instead. My review, if I weren't so traumatized by the end, would have been 3 stars. If I could turn this into a negative star rating, I would.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I cannot understand the positive reviews for this book. It started slow and cumbersome but then finally picked up the pace and my interest because of the unusual plot. It could have been, and was for a while, very interesting and a bit exciting with it's twists and turns. As I neared the end, I kept wondering, where the heck is the author going with this? (A good thing.)<br />Unfortunately, she went nowhere! The ending, in my opinion, is quite disappointing. That's all I'll say just in case you want to read it.<br /><br />But I guess many people like that kind of ending. So go ahead and read it. See if you do.<br /><br />At least it's very entertaining until the end.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is an excellent backpack style SLR camera case. I use it for my Canon T2i and couldn't be happier. The straps adjust easily for comfort and stability, and despite what some people have said, the zipper is still firm after repeated use for months. Stitching appears to be high quality, with no snags, rips, or tears. The case is roomy, highly customizable, and fits ally my accessories and lenses. I also like that the tripod straps are on the side; this makes navigating narrow openings a breeze.
B0049P1N3K|4.0|I loved the book. I've put to work a lot of the advice and focus on the positive things and I've see it work for my self. I would definately give it out as a gift this Christmas.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game.  The lower levels are easy and fun while the higher levels are more challenging and require spacial and logical reasoning./
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Better than expected for a sequel.  Lots of action in a modern update to the old serials.  I would have paid money to see this one on the big screen.  Like mysteries, and Sherlock, so a natural.

B0036OS3Q0|3.0|The quality is good on these croc snow boots, but the sizing is very small. My daughter usally wears a 9.5 or 10. We ordered the 11 because she wanted to wear thicker socks. Even the 11 was way too small. So if you can wear them, they are a good deal.

B00129JSMY|5.0|Witty story with unforeseeable twists and a very fun Robert Downey Jr. - Val Kilmer \\"duet\\". The dialog is fast and there are lots of details to  discover - even if you have seen the movie thrice before. So not a party movie where everyone is paying only half attention but certainly great entertainment for 4 or less, guys and girls alike.

1416972242|5.0|In book one Clare introduced us to her outstanding cast of characters that build the foundation of her Mortal Instruments series, which in my personal opinion ranks right up there with the Harry Potter series and surpasses the Twilight series... both of which I read and loved. Sequels always have the option to leave a reader wanting, or run the risk of being a poorly written rehash of the original story. Never fear, this book treads so far from both of these paths that you will be racing through it's pages and hoping that book three is equally as entertaining.<br />Once again we are following the now very interwoven lives of Clary and Jace, and if you thought things were going to settle down now that they knew who they were, you are very mistaken. Clary can only hope that her life would ever be able to return to any semblance of normalcy, after the shocking revelations in book one... alas, that is not to be.<br />We are again taken on a wild adventure full of mystery, intrigue, and love... as Jace and Clary must contend with their new knowledge, and the crisis it presents to their lives and the lives of the Clave and Downworlders alike. All of your favorite characters, and some of your not-so-favorite characters are back, as well as new faces that will leave a lasting impression on the storyline and you the reader.<br />An outstanding read for young adults to adults, and even a superb read for a book club to explore.<br />If you are anything like me, you will read this book so fast, that you better have book three on hand.
B004EWEX9Y|4.0|Once i got this product, i couldn't wait to plug it in and play something up on the big screen. It took a while to put the chords in (only because my tv is mounted on the wall and i couldn't see where they were to fit.) I finally did and it did not play on my TV! i was very dissapointed but i didn't give up. i went on amazon and looked at the reviews for this product and as i kept reading they all said it worked great with netflix, youtube, and videos. so i went and played a random youtube video and it worked! i realized the app i was on was not supported by this product.(i also saw a review witch said to go to settings- general- TV out- widescreen on) i am not sure if that helped but it works now and i am very happy with this product, though i wish it played my app that played shows. the app i used was ABC family,so that doesn't work. I will not return this product, i am very pleased, but also note that mine came in a plastic bag (not an apple box) and it has video chords(red green and blue) and audio chords (red and white). But overall, good price for this product! it is still from apple though it didn't come in the box!

B006RUJST6|1.0|I know most people go by the popular vote when reading reviews and obviously I am one of them. If I learned anything from reading this book it's that reviews aren't always accurate. I only gave this book one star because I can't give it a zero. Main character is awful and desperate. Thank God for Katniss Everdeen and Hermione Granger or we wouldn't have anyone for our young girls to look up to. The main character is very Bella-like. But at least Bella isnt a spoiled brat like this character is. Honestly she is just awful. And to think this author had the audacity to put this character in a second book??? Wow...I could barely get through the first. Don't waste your money even if ur looking for a cheap read.

B000093BDX|5.0|I recently attended a 50th reunion concert of the Beach Boys.  It gave me the itch to hear more of their music, so I purchased this CD, and loaded it in the car.  It's probably a permanent fixture in the vehicle for the summer.  It's just \\"feel-good\\" music in a better era.
061891868X|5.0|Remarquable book on every respect.<br />First of all it is totally unusual ; a non specialist is , by the way of that book , led to understand what is at stake in the physics of today . It contains an incredible fisheye roundtrip along the whole scientific development especially coevering the XIX° and XX° century physics .<br />A remark here is in order : by non specialist I mean a reader introduced in some serious scientific background . The book does not contain calculations but every sentence has to be read twice if one is really willing to understand . In that case on cannot speak of \\"vulgarisation\\" ; it is a book for learning seriously . It is a book which can provide the ground for conferences adressed to a very large and popular audience but to achieve this , hard work is necessary .By itself , the book avoids any shortcuts which coul lead to misunderstandings or treason of essentiel ideas .<br />Second , we talked about the sientific content above which by itself is an absolute performance . But the book goes beyond that , it contains deep thoughts  realative to the course taken by fundamental research in Physics .<br />You may agree , disagree or discuss strongly some of the author's reflexions but a current scientist , far from physicists alone can easily recognize dangerous trends affecting scientific research ; some trends are internal and the focus in that book is on those ; some are external which depend on overall public policies; these are also mentioned .<br />In any case this is not only a fantastic experience , it is THE book ; the one that every student in scientific studies MUST have read .<br />Do I have a criticism beyond enthousiasm ? I just mention one ; there is reference to a theory which took some development in the late 50'ies avout \\"hidden variables and parameters \\" ; names relative to those ideas , are among others those of  Bohm and Vigier ; however little detail is given while the book describes at length other main ideas ; it is regrettable given the author's opinion that one should look at these twice , while they falled into oblivion soon after their production as \\"leading nowhere\\" .<br />What to say more? The book is unique absolutely unique of its kind unfortunately . It is no best seller given the difficulty but this is a shame when you know which kind of junk is widespread today about science in general and modern physics in particular . The author deserves a prize . OLIVIER GEBUHRERhor's opinion that one should look at these twice , while they falled into oblivion soon after their production as \\"leading nowhere\\" .

B003B02O7I|4.0|Testament is John Grisham's testament to the power of redemption and the strength of unselfish actions.  The story is also an old fashioned adventure tale, as the hero travels into the wilds of South America.  The old vices of avarice and greed of one group of heirs, along with their unethical attorneys, are sharply contrasted with the virtues of compassion and unselfishness of a missionary-doctor heir.  Both are the potential heirs of an estate worth $11 billion and hence the title, the Testament, which refers to the last minute holographic will of a warped and wealthy testator.  But in the end, there is also a deeply religious side to this story, as the protaganist arrives at a spiritual redemption for his life and frees himself from the pain and destruction of alcohol addiction.<br /><br />This is a great story and like all Grisham's novels, the characters are fascinating.
0385360169|5.0|I was going to just buy the trilogy but I'm glad I didn't.  It's really different and keeps me going.  I'll sit in the car (where I listen to the CD set) just to hear more but I'm going to buy them one at a time rather than invest $100 in something I may not like all the way though.  But it is fascinating.  The reader could be better.  But once you get used to her, you don't notice that she sounds as young as she really is.  Maybe a more mature voice wouldn't work as well.  I'm glad I bought it.
B004UIXZV4|5.0|I am uncertain as to what people want from a book. This is a free copy of Swann's Way in French. it is excellent for students learning French (assuming they've read Proust and can piece things together). Even, pronunciation-wise, it is great for reading aloud. Moreover, it is...this book is quite sad when you read it untranslated. Sad in a strange way that I don't have the energy to articulate. I would recommend this to ANYONE, particularly students of the French language who want to see what genius looks like in its original form.
0440224764|4.0|Great story about an unhappy lawyer looking for a way out of the rat race.  Our main character, Patrick Lanigan, is quite the man to follow.  I loved his antics as well as his great sense of humor with his friend, Karl, the Judge and his attorney, Sandy.  There are some tense moments at the start but by far, The Partner is an entertaining read.<br />I too was somewhat disappointed in the ending and would love to see a sequel by Mr. Grisham to give this outstanding story a solid conclusion.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|It's free. It's brilliant. It is the catalyst that made me realize that art is useless and necessary and, as an artist, I am (ignore being useless) necessary. Jewel Kilcher wrote a poem about cynicism and how the brilliant find beauty in beautiful things. This book is her proof and I recommend all artists to read this, and understand what genius looks like.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The 5th book in the series continues with good twists and some new characters. There are so many storylines that I sometimes forget the details of what was happening with a particular character by the time the story picks up.  But ovewrall this is a great series.

I have every book in the series and have recently started getting them as kindle editions. At one point I was  reading this book digitally while my sons were reading Killing Floor and Bad Luck and Trouble in print form. Well worth the read, just make sure you have the time to read it since you wont be able to do much else!
B005R473G8|4.0|Une aeuvre classique et magnifique à la portée de tous.<br />Concernant la version Kindle, si la mise en page est quelque peu aléatoire, notamment au niveau des paragraphes, le reste est respecté à la lettre.
0439023521|4.0|This trilogy was given to me as gift. As the author of The Spiritual Warriors (The Warriors of the Way) I was able to appreciate the scope and breadth of this series. It surpassed my expectations and I have since given out several sets of my own to friends who haven't(can you believe it) read them yet. Don't hesitate to read them, much better than the movie trust me.
0345803485|1.0|I'm gunna make this as short as possible. I originally brushed this nonsense off as another fad, but then I started hearing about it everywhere.. Apparently they are even making a movie about it. Whatever.<br /><br />The book is obviously so poorly written that I'm terribly surprised it even got printed on real paper, instead of floating around on the internet for an eternity.  The only reason I decided to pick it up was because of the \\"explicit sex scenes\\" that were oh-so obscene. Nope. If you really want some BDSM, Dom/Sub relationships, pick up \\"The Story of O\\" By Pauline Renge or \\"Justine/Juliette\\" by Marquis De Sade. Those are obscene and not even comparable to this fan fiction gone wrong.<br /><br />Christian supposedly has a lot of experience with Dom/Subs but he is a total push-over! Their relationship is basically monogamous, with a pseudo contract explaining LIGHT BDSM intensions. Christian is boring and Ana is unoriginal.<br /><br />I like the last name Steele. Kudos. Some sort of superhero junk over here.
B004O86JZ4|1.0|Amazon is incorrectly listing the vinyl release of Wasting Light.<br /><br />The actual Wasting Light Vinyl is a full size 2 LP set with 4 sides of music set at 45 rpm speeds. This is unusual because usually only singles and small 7 inch records are 45rpm speeds. While it does to appear intentional that Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters decided to record at the faster 45 rpm speed on a full size set of LPs, Amazon is not noting this at all.<br /><br />That said do not buy this vinyl copy unless you have a high end vintage record player capable of playing both 33 1/3 and 45 rpms and make sure that player is tested to play these uncommon 45 full sizes. The \\"new usb\\" players tend to struggle keeping up the faster speed of a full length 45 and vintage restored ones may be sold as \\"working\\" but lack ability to consistently keep the 45 speed needed for this record.<br /><br />Additionally the Amazon track listing is incorrect as the vinyl version is 4 sides not 2 sides.<br /><br />Do not buy this particular record on vinyl from Amazon unless you have a record player that you know can play full size 45s.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|All of the 5 star ratings are accurate. This is an incredible telling of a marine grunt's view of brutal combat against the Japanese during WW2 at Peleliu and Okinawa. It is one of those books you cannot put down. Terse and gripping. Not a lot of philosophy or discussion of broader war strategy or tactics. But boy does it convey a sense of life in the ranks. Great character sketches of good and bad soldiers and officers. Also an important portrayal of how vicious the Japanese soldiers were and how necessary the atomic bombs were to end this war and spare our soldier from further brutality and death. Useful maps and commentary to supplement the writing.<br /><br />I read this after reading George Feifer's  [[ASIN:0762772794 The Battle of Okinawa: The Blood and the Bomb]], which helped provide a useful context of Sledge's marine's-eye view of the fighting.<br /><br />The Kindle version gets only 3 stars because a number of the maps were not oriented properly for the Kindle Fire, such that the map kept turning when I rotated the Fire to get a proper alignment. Jumping to and from the footnotes also was problematic because of placement of the links too close to the page edge.
B008BM9L72|1.0|I'm not a prude and I'm not shocked by the gratuitous sex scenes in this series. They're actually a tad dull. What I was horrified by was the way it was written. Refer to Katrina Lumsden's review where she counts the use of \\"Oh my\\" in Fifty Shades of Grey 79 times. 79! I fear for the women who are attracted to the abusive, disturbed and weird Christian Grey character and I just hope young girls don't read this trash and aspire to it. All-in-all, it's just badly written fan fiction and I'm mystified why it's become so popular. A must-not read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works well on my kindle fire I will recommend the app to others needs some work on weather watches and warnings sometimes does not work
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Team Ico gave PS2 players two remarkable games in Ico and Shadow of the Colossus and now these two great titles have arrived fro PS3 players to enjoy and rediscover again in this great collection. I will admit the trophies are challenging but it only serves to increase the replay value. The visuals and soundtracks to these games simply take you away and allow you to immerse yourself in an amazing story.<br /><br />I recommend playing the games in the following order: Shadow of the Colossus/Ico for the maximum effect.<br /><br />Shadow of the Colossus opens with a mysterious young man arriving in a temple carrying the body of a young woman, he meets a mystifying spirit that sends shadow like beings to attack him, the hero Wanderer displays a sacred sword that withdraws the spirit's attacks and the bargin is made: Wanderer must hunt down and destroy 16 colossi for the spirit and in return the spirit will resurrect the young woman. While Wanderer hunts down the colossi, a group of warriors are headed to the temple.<br /><br />Ico takes place after Shadow of the Colossus, a young boy with horns is sent away from his village since he is considered to be cursed, he is taken to a castle on the sea and imprisoned in a stone tomb, a tremor breaks the boy loose from his prison and he explores the castle. Ico finds a young girl (Yorda) suspended high in a cage and sets her loose, she doesn't speak his language but she is friendly. Ico and Yorda explore the castle to escape when terrifying shadow creatures attack Yorda, Ico defends her and realizes he must protect her while they try to escape.<br /><br />Both games have wonderful stories (I hope Hollywood doesn't take them and ruin them like most video game movies) and the gameplay is unique. The games are about isolation and patience, both have puzzle solving and action, the colossi look impressive and the music will pull you into their world. I highly recommend this game but if you are more into shooters, sports, or simple platforming games this might not be for you but if you like a sense of adventure, a great story with action and drama, then get this game and rescue the princess...Team Ico style.

0670023329|5.0|This is one of those books you cannot put down.  One wonders how much cruelty and torture the prison guards can dish out.  Shin was inspired to flee when he made the friendship of one person who told him about the outside world.  This shows how much can happen when you trust just one person.  All the prisoners were encouraged to snitch on each other. Shin was constantly hungry, but forced to do hard labor.  There are many examples of cruelty, but the young girl that was beaten to death because she had 5 kernels of corn in her pocket stands out.
B005LAIH54|3.0|1981's 'Clash of the Titans' was the last stop-action animation film that Ray Harryhausen worked on. Harryhausen, a student of Willis O'Brien, the animator of the 1933 'King Kong', practically invented the modern stop action animated film. Harryhausen's first major film was the 1949 'Mighty Joe Young' and he continued to create fantastic masterpieces of film using the art of  the then under appreciated technique of stop-action animation. He was unique. Not only was his work difficult to do but he did it alone. He superbly managed to bring  clay characters to life.  His inanimate clay creations had emotions and personality. From skeletons to flying saucers to dinosaurs, the viewer believed in these characters even while being aware that they were not real.  'Clash of the Titans' was not his best feature but it still remains a classic movie today represents the vibrant dying past of film animation. It also is one of the better examples of child friendly films that was typical of Harryhausen's art.<br /><br /> The 1981 'Class of the Titans' had little to do with Greek mythology but it was still a lot of fun. The realism he brought to his animation was not matched until recent CGI efforts such as Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings'.<br /><br /> 'Clash of the Titans' was remade in 2010. It was a slick, well-made, but generally lifeless re-imagining of the original film. It was a summer popcorn movie that was short on plot but long on fabulous CGI. It had even less to do with Greek mythology than the original but It had a very good cast and was a PG-13 film instead of  the original PG version. I was not a fan of this film. However it made a lot of money so a sequel was inevitable.<br /><br /> The sequel was 'Wrath of the Titans'. This sequel was better made. 'Wrath' also has a very strong cast and very good CGI action sequences. It did not do very well with critics but attracted large audiences and made loads of money.  We will  be seeing another sequel soon.<br /><br />'Wrath of the Titans' has an excellent cast headed by screen veterans like Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Bill Nighy. The strong cast carries the film which otherwise might have been just another summer action extravaganza. Like its predecessor, 'Clash of the Titans (2010)', the film pits humans against the gods they think they no longer need. The gods are in trouble since without the prayers and worship of the humans, they will vanish into mortality and become just like humans. The Olympian god's father Kronos is trying to escape his bonds with the help of another god. Zeus asks Perseus for help and the struggle begins.<br /><br /> There are some very strange changes in plot logic going on in this film. Human characters are not like the characters in the original. Behavior traits are almost reversed. Andromeda is now portrayed as an almost god-like female ruler. Io, Perseus' wife is nowhere to be seen. In fact there is little connection to actual Greek myth for any character in the film. The most humanlike portrayals are those of the gods themselves and the god-like humans. Keep in mind that Perseus and the comic sidekick Agenor are actually half god, half human.<br /><br /> Myths are transposed from other stories or altered. Kronos becomes a volcano-like god (probably because it looks good in CGI), the Minotaur is transported to some kind of underground cave, and Zeus is tied to a magical post like some sort of King Kong or Christ. The filmmakers seem to have given little though to the actual Greek myths or even to some kind of consistency of story within the film itself. Yet, surprisingly, obscure mythological characters are interspersed thought the film.<br /><br /> Even the basic premise of the film is reversed and is almost subversive to the plot. The basic idea of the preceding film and this one was that the humans do not need gods or kings anymore and that the need for gods is fading. Yet when it comes down to it, the film relies not only on the powerful gods but also the leadership of Queens and generals who if not gods themselves, represent divine authority of kings and queens on earth.<br /><br /> 'Wrath of the Titans' is an exciting CGI film that satisfies the need for fantasy action. It is all well done and visually appealing. Interestingly as well is that the dialogue and pacing is very good. The script and the acting is, in fact. what saves this film from being mediocre and just another summer time waster. One only wishes that there was more character interaction and less 'let's blow up things' in the film.
B007PBKG5G|1.0|I ordered the \\"Alabama Shakes\\" album \\"Boys and Girls\\" - and was never able to download it. I tried it on three different laptops - and each time, it said that I couldn't get a connection to download it.<br /><br />One of these connections was an ethernet cable directly into a mainframe, and it still wouldn't download it.  So I never got the album.<br /><br />Be wary of trying to download this - you may never see/get it !!
B004LWZW8I|3.0|Poor old white man.  Now he's watching movies in which a Greek seer is an Asian Indian and among the Greek soldiers are blacks.  But to even point out these ridiculous castings is to invite attack from today's frightened white men themselves.  And what's happening is ironic when you think of some of the lines in the movie.  My kind invented free speech but we surrendered it to the hungry hordes.<br />To the peanut gallery:  I comment on products I purchase.  I never read or see any comments about my own comments.  I have no interest in your opinion.

044655667X|1.0|I bought the books-on-tape version for a long trip.  At the end of the first CD I wasn't sure if it was a mystery or a treatise on the mortgage crisis of 2008 - a simplistic andn biased treatise at that.<br /><br />The narrative launches into several lectures on the big bad banks scamming the poor consumers by loaning them money beyond their means to pay.<br /><br />Somebody tell me why it is that so often these successful mystery-series writers come to the point in their careers where they think that their readers are interested in their eco-political views. The last writer to lose me was Lee Childs who decided to bash Bush through Reacher.<br /><br />Buying this book-on-tape was a waste of money.
190864043X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3S1H0E8YXJJ3J]]<br /><br />FOR TOP LEGAL FIRMS DESIGNED TO HELP YOU BUILD AND REBUILD YOUR PRACTICE IN A DOWNTURN<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />You may have heard it before, but that doesn't mean it isn't the key to continuing success in the practice of law.  And that is that the law is a people business which often requires a delicate balance which must be maintained between the interests and aims of clients, colleagues and ancillary staff.<br /><br />All this and the issues which it raises is, of course, the preserve of the Human Resource department which, in larger law firms especially, can become exceedingly complex and which requires a steady guiding hand.<br /><br />Fortunately this new book from the Ark Group offers lawyers involved with personnel issues rather a treasure trove of HR advice in my view.  There are lots of HR texts out there, but this one is law-specific and targeted directly to those who are involved in the human resources management of law firms.<br /><br />If you are an HR professional within a law firm, this book - presented in the convenient format of a management report, can help you devise ways and means to help your firm  achieve a consistently profit generating HR strategy while raising your own  profile and that of your department within the firm.<br /><br />The author, Julie Harrison, is an expert in this field and includes the views and insights of a number of other experienced professionals whose case studies are often quite thought provoking.  For example --  especially in the light of the 2012 London Olympics, consider contributor Steve McNicol's `Muckle two lengths' article, which, focusing on the story of Olympic swimmer Chris Cook, reveals one instance of how business can be linked with sport.<br /><br />Chris focused on a single objective; which was not winning medals, but merely swimming two lengths of the pool as fast as he could.  Obviously, as McNicol (Muckle LLP's managing partner) admits, this oversimplifies the process by which Chris achieved his medals, but the basic principle is certainly pertinent to motivational HR in most lines of business, including law.<br /><br />Any HR strategy, including this one should ideally be designed with similar simplicity and with a key objective in mind.  The details of how this can work in the context of a law practice are further explained in this book.<br /><br />As well as a learned profession, law is also a business in which -- as the author points out -- people are the most valuable, not mention the most expensive resource. Developing an effective HR management strategy, therefore, can help you raise your firm's profile and profit in a downturn.<br /><br />With its results-based, practical approach, this book is designed to help you do just that.  A sensible purchase for your professional library!  Yes, we would say so.  The work as published in 2012, the book is also available as a PDF.iously, as McNicol (Muckle LLP's managing partner) admits, this oversimplifies the process by which Chris achieved his medals, but the basic principle is certainly pertinent to motivational HR in most lines of business, including law.<br /><br />Any HR strategy, including this one should ideally be designed with similar simplicity and with a key objective in mind.

B000PKX2KA|5.0|I did not read anything about installation except that the baud rate for the serial port (USB) needs to be set at 4800. With that setting done via settings and devices, and with Streets and Trips running (2011 version), my location was pinpointed on the map in about 5 minutes in an area that is difficult for GPS satellite reception. I do not know how the GlobalSat will behave in real use on the roads, but my initial view of the product is very positive. With Win 7 and Streets and Trips, the CD and the directions are not even needed; in fact, Macromedia flash crashed when the CD loaded and it is required to load driver, read the pdf file, etc. Win 7 got the correct driver from the internet as soon as I attached the GPS receiver.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|The first listen through..I did not like this album that much at all - conditions of my parole and Toma are the only two songs I really dug...this is Maynard we're talking about here though so I have no choice but to give this album some more time....by the way...the cover art and album artwork are hilarious...some of the funniest I've ever seen.  5 stars because conditions of my parole (the song) alone is better than most full albums out there now.<br /><br />Also, time to let the cat out of the bag....there is NO CLEAN VERSION of this album...there is one beep on the entire album and it's in the song Conditions of my Parole.  Maynard is hilarious for making people believe the MP3 version of the album can only be purschaed via the \\"clean format\\".  He doesn't like the download revolution at all so that's why he did this..there is no swearing on this album.<br /><br />From Maynard on what puscifer means as a band:<br /><br />simply a playground for the various voices in my head, [...] a space with no clear or discernible goals, [...] where my Id, Ego, and Anima all come together to exchange cookie recipes.\\"

B007HV93CQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of Yanni, and I found \\"Truth of Touch\\" to be a wonderful listening experience. It is a little different than his previous music but well worth purchasing. If you are a Yanni fan, be open to this CD and you will find it very enjoyable. I was a little leary of buying based on some of the negative reviews, but I am glad I decided to give it a try.  The more you listen, the more you'll love it.

B001ANSS5K|4.0|When i first started reading this book, i had just finished The Fault in Our Stars. Expecting another WOW book, Paper Towns is just slightly short of that factor. As part one started and progressed, i really enjoyed the book to where it was going. But as part two started, in a way, it just started to bore me. Towards the end, Margo's character started to annoy me, but i could see where she was coming from. Ben and Radar were completely laughable and lovable characters; they fit how stereotypical best friends would be. Quentin was by far my favorite character. If he was a real life person, I'd want HIM to be my best friend.<br />Needless to say, this isn't my FAVORITE book; maybe because the ending didn't exactly end like how i wanted and really wished it would've. But also due to the fact that it started to bore me. But i would recommend people to read it! It makes you really think about your life and surroundings, but also about what 'real' friends really mean to you. Another bravo John Green!

B00846REIS|4.0|Great book, if you liked 50 Shades and Gabriel's Inferno series you will definately like these.  There's a lot more going on with the other characters over 50 Shades and I like knowing more about the others in the story line.

B0083TXXZ4|5.0|The new Hail Fire gun is a big step forward for Nerf fans!  This thing DOES get the distance it claims, at least with the new blue darts loaded.  The gun gets heavy if you install it with 18 dart clips instead of the measly 6 it comes with... and this gun holds 8 clips, but ONLY comes with FOUR.  So, buy more to fill it up!  TONS of fun, and highly recommended from someone with 5 other Nerf guns in his arsenal.
1469984202|5.0|I must agree with another commenter for explaining what makes a 5 versus a 4 star review:  Rather than simply being an enjoyable book, this one has stuck with me after I've finished.  I cannot WAIT for the next in the series.  I did not read but perhaps 5 of the reviews of this before delving in, nor did I read further comments before writing my own, so as not to be swayed - I'll likely echo others, if I had to guess based on the number of reviews and stars given.<br /><br />First and foremost, in the simplest sense, this book was an incredibly quick read for me.  I bought the ombnibus edition, then First Shift, and finished ALL of them within the span of two days.  One part of that is because I was so engrossed, but the other side is that it is so well written that it just flows beautifully.  There were little to no errors that commonly afflict self published books, so ideas progressed naturally.<br />The characters were well developed, even the ones that aren't in every book;  the fact that even secondary characters are fleshed out shows the thought and detail that was put into the entire collection.  Just when I had my feelings for a character all sorted out, Howey had to go and do something that totally made me think differently.<br />The story itself is JUST this side of believable, which makes you really think about what life would be like in an environment such as the one described in Wool.  (WOOL?)  It deeply touches the humanitarian in me, makes me sad for the world, proud of the brave few that are willing to fight for what they feel is morally and socially right, and essentially just brings out true emotions and thoughts within me.  That emotional investment is a hallmark of a great book.<br /><br />There is so much I want to say about this, but I don't want to give any spoilers.  So I will just say that if you like sci fi - or even if you don't, read this series.  You will find yourself immersed in a world that makes a person wonder what is truly possible, and you will marvel at the strength and power of human nature to effect change.<br /><br />So while I wait another few years for the next book in the Game of Thrones series, at least I know I'll get my WOOL fix long before that.  ;)
B0086700CM|5.0|Cant stop playing... A total must have. If you get this game you'll be glad you did. I totally loved it.
B004LROMQG|5.0|I must say, with this last season, BBC has finally found their niche with regards to how they plan to do this series. There is finally a decent, long-living plot with plot twists that you know are going to come back to bite. They are finally diving right into the thick of things and I can see much more forward-movement beginning now. They have quit making the series as episodic, like the early episodes of Dr Who, and have created a more intriguing, connected, season, like David Tennant's last season was. I'm so proud of them, and I do hope that this change endures through the remainder of the series.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I never loose this pacifier cause it's attached to an animal. The baby never loses it cause it's tucked into his shirt which also keeps it in his mouth. Great product. Already recommended to everyone!
B0018OAOQC|5.0|This may be my favorite disc of theirs, alot of this content is found on their \\"sold out\\" dvd which was my introduction to this band... Their beats and rhythms are fantastic, drummer is a beast (IMO)Michaels vocal stylings are very original and make this band stand out from all others...TURN IT UP!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|it's a fun and addictive game. I have it on my ipod so I couldn't wait until it came out on my kindle fire.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|The Warth of the Titans is a good movie,mythological Gods and with human for the power,fighting and supporting each others. Fun for kid about the basic lesson on a meaning about God! Lesson on humanity,literature and mythology by our ancestral writer,for kid and adult. History as for all ages,then all ages for history,to be human! Good movie,joyful world,happy life.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|I was very pleased with the quality of the SD version of this movie. I thought the stream would be choppy and digitized but it was Great. No problems, no glitches just a good stream. The movie was also pretty entertaining. I have bought a great deal of movies from Amazon this way and can not say I have had a bad experience at all. I recommend this movie and all other SD movies on Amazon.
B0073CNYWY|5.0|The only bad thing about Downton Abbey is that it ends. You just want the characters to keep playing out the story. By the time the series is over you will be searching for new episodes or a similar show. The UK doesn't seem to use profanity, nudity or drama unless it would be a normal part of a story unlike many US productions. Highly recommend.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is a great app. I have always wanted minecraft and this is it. Ai showed this to my friend who has minecraft andy he loves.
B0086DBE62|2.0|I am very thankful I rented this movie instead of buying it. It seemed to be mildly entertaining from the many commercials I have encountered, but it was actually worse. Although, it was somewhat quirky and funny at times. Other than that Julia Roberts was a very disappointing wicked witch, and the main parts that were plainly differing from the original Snow White were worse than the original. The whole movie just seemed awkward to me. Maybe Snow White and the Huntsman will prevail in being much more entertaining.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|I saw Journey 2 prior to seeing this movie. I then needed to find \\"Journey\\" so i could see how it all started. It was a great movie! really enjoyed it, family friendly and exciting.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|The advertisements did not do this movie justice..which is unusual.  Despite Channing Tatums history in other movies, this one is actually entertaining and funny. However, Jonah Hill is clearly the real entertainment because he is one who does well with this type of sarcastic humor. Not everyone can appreciate this type of humor, but I found myself laughing throughout the movie. Overall, It's definitely a movie worth seeing!
B0086700CM|5.0|I could not stop playingbit intill I won wow best game I ever bought the other games I have are not as fun as this game I have to finish review because now I need to play bad
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading The Hunger Games once I started! Suzanne Collins is a truly gifted author, full of orinignality. She has made every page detailed and vivid, and puts an interesting twist at the end of almost every chapter; fueling the readers eagerness to keep reading. Immediately after reading her first book I bought the second, then the third. It is a great series and will not disappoint any reader!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I had never heard of Christopher McDougall and found this book quite by accident -- I was searching for Dr. McDougall's diet book.  But when I saw this book, the reviews on it were so phenomenal that I became curious and purchased the book.  Boy, did I get lucky!  I am not even a runner, but this book drew me in so quickly and so deeply that I could not put it down.  It's a fascinating story written by a very entertaining writer.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great read -- regardless of how they feel about running.
6305784078|5.0|We still have a VHS system. Great to find excellent movies at a reasonable price. Great movie! Enjoyable for adults as well as the kiddos.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|More of a horror story than a mystery. Gillian Flynn is a brilliant writer. I LOVED her book Gone Girl (except for the ending which I found disappointing). This one I couldn't even get to the ending.<br /><br />There were some scenes that were so disturbing they will probably haunt me forever, especially the horrifyingly vivid descriptions of the pig farm and the mother pigs. I would give anything to not have that image in my mind. I will definitely never eat industrially farmed pork again and maybe that was her goal in including that bit of horror.<br /><br />Halfway through I realized that things were only going to get worse. Not only do I not need more awful scenes to haunt me, but I couldn't see the point in intentionally consuming evil, depravity, depression, child abuse, animal abuse, addiction, bullying, and total human destruction by equally damaged people just for the sake of an exciting read.<br /><br />Fortunately Kindle books are instantly refundable. But I would have paid if I could have unread this book. Also, the Kindle format was messed up--the first letter of each chapter was supposed to be a large capital and instead was a tiny one.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|War Horse is a movie to enjoy by all. Worth the tears I shed. It is jam packed with adventure and an eye opener to the reality of war. Cruelity to animals was prevelant then as we experience it today.
B0000DYKET|1.0|I own a pair of the (Men's) leather Keen Newport sandals, and I feel that this sandal is of poor design.  Aesthetically, this is a very visually appealing, stylish, attractive piece of footwear, but it just didn't perform practically.<br /><br />My sandals have been on two Boundary Waters (of Northern Minnesota) trips, and a couple of hikes, and I have to give them an all-around and overall grade of \\"A\\" for aesthetics and visual appeal, a \\"B\\" for comfort, but an \\"F-\\" for functionality.<br /><br />They are a good-looking and comfortable sandal for (relatively) dry flatland hikes, and I'd say that this is where these sandals are best suited.<br /><br />The traction, at least on mine, is terrible, and extremely slippery on any rock surface (wet or dry).  This becomes extremely dangerous when portaging gear.  The traction in water (which is expected to be less than on land) was terrible in my experience, and created several slips (and even a few falls) on both of the Boundary Waters trips that I wore these particular sandals on.<br /><br />Another low point is that they don't dry quickly.  My feet were wet for each entire trip that I used these sandals for, which can become a hygiene and health danger, especially where a lot of hiking is involved.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good and sturdy everyday-wear sandal, and \\"OK\\" for some dry, flatland hiking.  Mine, although nearly new, have been \\"retired\\", and are mainly used for running out the trash, mowing the lawn, and a little bit of casual wear for a chic \\"Outdoors\\" look. But, in my experience, and at the advice of my (very seasoned) expedition/trip partner, when looking for a good, well-made, high traction, quick drying (and true) water sandal, the best bet is to look into a pair of Chaco water sandals.<br /><br />I can't disagree.  For wet and/or dry land, it's tough to beat the traction, comfort, breathe-ability, and overall function of the Chaco water sandal, and they cost less than my Keens did.<br /><br />Keen makes good sturdy products, and I've owned other Keen products (trail hiking shoes, etc.) that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend, but these sandals just don't perform the advertised function to the best of my experience.<br /><br />And, to note, I met another person in the Boundary Waters (again, of Minnesota) wearing almost identical design to mine (except a Women's sandal), and she had relayed the exact same disappointments as I had with these shoes, and even though hers (as well) were brand new, she was going to also be \\"retiring\\" her sandals after their first, initial trip for all of the same reasons that mine have been \\"retired\\".<br /><br />It's not a bad \\"casual\\" sandal, but, for me, it's just not much more than that, either.<br /><br />Something like a Chaco or a Teva are simply better designed as outdoor use wet and dry land sandals.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />In looking at Chaco water sandals, I found that if you custom order them (which costs about $ 25 more than their retail sandal) they will make any model that they offer with any color strap that you'd like, and they make these (custom) sandals in the USA.  The other models are outsourced and imported back to the USA, but not the custom sandals, which will be made in Colorado.<br /><br />For me, it's worth the extra $ 25 to get an American-made product.kes good sturdy products, and I've owned other Keen products (trail hiking shoes, etc.) that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend, but these sandals just don't perform the advertised function to the best of my experience.<br /><br />And, to note, I met another person in the Boundary Waters (again, of Minnesota) wearing almost identical design to mine (except a Women's sandal), and she had relayed the exact same disappointments as I had with these shoes, and even though hers (as well) were brand new, she was going to also be \\"retiring\\" her sandals after their first, initial trip for all of the same reasons that mine have been \\"retired\\".<br /><br />It's not a bad \\"casual\\" sandal, but, for me, it's just not much more than that, either.<br /><br />Something like a Chaco or a Teva are simply better designed as outdoor use wet and dry land sandals.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />In looking at Chaco water sandals, I found that if you custom order them (which costs about $ 25 more than their retail sandal) they will make any model that they offer with any color strap that you'd like, and they make these (custom) sandals in the USA.

B004DMIIVO|4.0|This film was far more interesting than I thought it would be. I was expecting a bland, straightforward, predictable summer romance. Instead, it was a blend of family, technology, cyberspace, history, and virtual reality. Good story, not completely believable, not completely unbelievable. The world of OZ was rather fascinating. I almost wished I had an avatar.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|I tried to read this book, and even after about 50+ pages, I just couldn't seem to get into it! For me, the main problem was that they are just letters written to and from an anonymous source! I definitely plan on finishing it; in hopes that it gets better. That, or I learn more about the speaker. I bought this as it was a recommendation from \\"Thirteen Reasons Why,\\" which is one of my favorite books of all time!<br /><br />Again, those are just my two cents. :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Interesting, attractive and sometimes appalling if you are not familiar with \\"that\\" subject. Great \\"love\\" story - interesting characters. Enjoyed all three books and will read the fourth if there is one.

0857685570|3.0|I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the quality of this book, Drew Struzan; Oeuvre. I have purchased this book from Amazon.ca and I am sending back my Fourth copy!<br /><br />Every copy has had the binding come apart after only a week or so and after only flipping through a half dozen times or so.<br /><br />I would think a book of this quality art would have much higher quality materials and workmanship.
B007SGM084|3.0|I have heard the review as a mixture and decided while I was at the airport, I may need a novel to read. I picked this up and was a little appalled by the writing and how it was such a drag. I guess the author wants to pen on the situation, the emotional wrapped around, etc. The ending left me hanging.<br /><br />The fact that there is a 2nd and 3rd books made me decided to spend a little time to do the reading at Barnes and Nobles. The 2nd book seems decent as it starts to get more intense into the psychological part of the characters. I decided to buy it home to read slowly.<br /><br />I was actually quite frustrated with Ana's indolence at a point, overbearing assumption like she has an experience of a 40-year-old woman when she has just learnt to crawl... On the other hand, Christian seems impossible to exist... but hey! We got Mark Zuckerberg, one of the younger self-made billionaires! So, I don't think it is impossible. I wished I could dig into his brain of what he has gone through in life to be who he is.<br /><br />The last book is more fast-paced and less giggling, gasping, but more intense psych-logic and suspense. The fairy-tale ending, of course... then there is a small writing on Christian's side of story.<br /><br />It is an entertaining reading on the plane or to get yourself out of intense working days. And PLEASE don't expect too much. I think the last book wrap it all but you won't know much if you don't read from the beginning.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like the quantitative reading in the notification bar. Operates properly, gives me great info on battery life left and predicts how long it will last for various uses.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|During my recent purchase of Star Wars blu ray I must its everything I dreamed and more...its the best way to watch this string of six great films and a ton of special features I thank the seller and am glad he put this up for such a bargain as opposed to paying over 100 in a store...
B0026S1XDM|5.0|So much has already been written about Tubular Bells so I'll keep this simple.<br /><br />This release is not a reworking in the style of Tubular Bells II or III, it's simply a reamstering of the original 1973 classic with a few subtle and worthwhile mix alterations. The remastering process is in fact so sucessful I think this is now the definitive version. I am struggling to think of a more effective remastering. All the hiss and bass rumble is gone and we are left with a warm, luxurious sound that is absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />On this record you will find little flourishes left off the original release all together and the overall effect, for me anyway, was that I fell in love with Tubular Bells all over again!<br /><br />So what of the extras that make this a deluxe release. Well you also receive the original 1973 mix just in case, for some bizarre reason, you dislike the new master and mix. The single version (Mike Oldfield's single) and the Sailor's Hornpipe featuring Viv Stanshall are stunning and humorous but do come with the standard release. Disc 3 contains a 5.1 surround sound version for those with 5 ears presumably! The real treat is a live 1975(?) BBC DVD performance featuring such luminary guitarists of the time as Steve Hillage, Mick Taylor and Fred Frith with Karl Jenkins on keys.<br /><br />All these new remasters has rejuvinated my love for Oldfield's music and has led me to the discovery of an album called Mohribold by an emerging musician called Andrew Taylor (plug that into your search engine!). He is an artist who must have listened to Oldfield's early albums in great detail, though he clearly has a flare all of his own too. Both Oldfield and Taylor are talented multi-intrumentalists, if you love Tubular Bells you'll love Mohribold.
0143119680|5.0|I just finished reading this novel, I admit I was put off by the title but the synopsis got me intriqued. I am always on the lookout for new author's.  I have been a voracious reader since my first library card when I was 7 years old. I have been told that I have very eclectic reading habits which is true, as I have no restrictions, except for horror novels which I just personally dislike no nightmares please.  I was hooked from the first chapter, this author weaves history and fantasy flawlessly. I could not put the book down and at 500 plus pages it was not a struggle, everytime I just could not keep my eyes open I was so disappointed to leave the story, I was caught up with all the characters and their various lives. Looking forward to the next novel in the trilogy.  I hope this author continues to entertain us for years to come.
B0026S1XD2|5.0|Much has been written about Tubular Bells and there have been so many variations and best of's with that bell logo on the sleeve that for the uninitiated it can be confusing to know which one to buy. Allow me to help you out.<br /><br />This release of Tubular Bells is the classic original recording released in 1973. It has been remastered using current technology, that means it now sounds more awesome than ever. When Oldfield made this record he was pushing the limits of what could be achieved in a studio at that time and there was hiss and bass rumble, to the modern ear it might also sound brittle and toppy. That's all been fixed now and the music sounds warm and inviting, I fell in love with record from my youth all over again.<br /><br />Honestly just buy it! There really is nothing else quite like it. Tubular Bells is perhaps one of the most addictive records out there.<br /><br />And to sign off...I've gotten into the habit of telling Oldfield fans about a young whipper-snapper by the name of Andrew Taylor who has released an album called Mohribold (google it). If you like Oldfield you'll love Mohribold! There are some Oldfield-esque moments but he's got his own style too. Maybe he's one to watch out for since Oldfield has called for an instrumetnal rock renaissence after his Olympics opening ceremony appearance.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series and was so sad when it was cancelled. This is all of the episodes on four separate discs. I got if for a very reasonable price. it arrived in great shape and works fine.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|I really LOVE my Kindle!  I can now read in bed at night without wearing my glasses.  My books are totally portable without being cumbersome.  It fits right into my purse and is there whenever I get a few minutes to read.
B001VFGL4W|5.0|I love this album, it brings back memories! I enjoy the feeling of nostalgia that overcomes me when I listen to something I haven't heard in a while that I used to listen to all the time.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I liked Iron Man 2 good sequel if you liked the first one. The movie picked up the story line from the first movie.
B0012631UM|4.0|Some of these albums being reviewed are ones we already own, regardless of whether they were purchased through Amazon or not.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|it is an awesome game and if you are a good cook this game is right for you .when you cook start with the French toast and cotumize ur restraunt but save your green gems! &iexcl;#
B002T66IHC|5.0|If you haven't figured out already. Taylor Swift is the bomb dot com. I enjoy about 98% of the songs she releases. That's pretty darn good.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Best show on television...couldnt stop watching it.  Incredible acting, incredible story lines.  Very excited to see the series coming in September 2012.
1423389263|4.0|I received this item then took a while to remove the shrink wrap and listen to it. The case, housing the sleeves and disc, was broken inside - I don't know what the arms that hold the sleeves in place are called but they were separated from the case on the back cover so the sleeves constantly come out when you open the case. At almost $45 for this audio book I would have expected the case to be intact. For what it's worth the CDs themselves are fine and the book is good (though a bit slow for my liking).
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldnt put the books down.  I know everyone talks about the sexual content but I really enjoyed getting to know the characters and what made them who they are.  I enjoyed all three books...highly recommend
B0001I55OC|3.0|Had I not read the novel first, I would have liked this movie more than I<br />do. Some very strange choices were made, characters eliminated, but others added for no appareent reason. The casting of Gerard Butler as Andre Marek was perfect.  Frances O'Connor, a fine actress, was horrid in her role, I just wanted to punch her.<br />Despite that I actually like this movie.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My son LOVES this mobile.  He'll lay in his crib and coo at this mobile for 10-15 minutes no problem.  It's been very useful for when I have to quickly make and eat lunch while I'm home alone.<br /><br />The leaves that open and close mesmerize my son and he seems to love the brightly-colored rainforest creatures.  The base unit also plays pleasant classical music and has a nice, warm nightlight (both of which don't seem to do anything for my guy, though).  Putting together the mobile wasn't too difficult either, considering that I managed to do it all by myself WHILE carrying my son in a front-load baby carrier.  The base wouldn't screw onto the front or back of my baby's crib (Europa baby Geneva crib), but it's been fine on the side rail, closer to the backside of the crib.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down...there was just enough intrigue to keep me wanting more.  Perfect summer read or a book club selection.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Thank you to Amazon for featuring this on the MP3 main page. I just happened to click the sample button and the song that played hooked me enough to listen to more samples from the CD and then the $5 price-tag sold me, I gave in and bought the entire album. I can honestly say I have been listening to this ENTIRE album on repeat, non-stop since I bought it. I work from home, so when I am first settling into the morning, firing up my laptop and drinking my first few cups of coffee, this album totally sets the pace of the day. There's mellow, wine-drinking songs that make you a bit melancholy and then there's more up-beat, toe-tapping tunes that rev me right up. It's the perfect, perfect album for a road trip, a long walk, or cleaning around the house. This is the kind of album you want on repeat in the background when you have friends over for wine and dinner.<br /><br />Listen to this album carefully, you'll certainly find songs that speak right to your heart. But no matter what, don't skip any tracks the first time you take a listen. If you do you might just miss a song that will eventually become your favorite. P.S. I totally suggest giving this album as a gift to that hard-to-buy for friend with a hand-written note and a bottle of wine. Perfect pairing.
030758836X|1.0|It's not very often that I don't finish a book that I spent money on. I felt like this book bounced around and it just kept losing my interest. I tried coming back to it over and over but just gave up. I was about 100 pages into it and felt like they were still \\"building\\" the story and that nothing had happened that was keeping me reading. Disappointed in this book!
0393317552|1.0|This book was purchased for an AP World History summer reading assignment.  It is sad that the high school students reading it can write better and actually get to the point and stay focused.  Very poor writing style.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|All in All it is a pretty fun game,  but with a couple major improvements thus could potentially be the best app out there. First of all the free roam is a great feature that makes it awesome to play. But the graphics are not great at all. Another Problem is the fact that it is merely impossible to save your game. Everytime I have exited out of the app I have to restart the whole game whenever I want to play again. This really gets annoying. With Improved graphics and eliminating the fact you have to restart everytime, this would be a #1 app.
B00770KR7W|4.0|Master Chief arrived looking spiffy in the packaging, however, his assault rifle has a large plastic piece on the side opposite the viewing area.  This is presumably so that it can be on his back while he runs around but this makes it very awkward looking if being displayed as a model.  Chief also has two weird hip holes (for holding pistols?)that detract from his authenticity.  Otherwise the figure looks pretty sweet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This Is fun Except For that you have to buy things with real money! And who wants to do that!
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love the tack that I can open it without any spam or multipul questions. Bright large an simply what I need.
B005P06AAO|5.0|I Found this show after the first season had already aired. I don't watch MTV too much but happened to see a preview for season 2 and thought it looked good. MTV had a season 1 marathon and 2 minutes in to the pilot ep, I was hooked. The cast is amazing, they are all so funny. There isn't one character who hasn't provided me with a laugh. They tackle topics that teens and adults can relate to, without being super dramatic about it. I bought the DVDs and have already watched them like 5 times. It's definitely one of the best shows on MTV and tv in general right now.
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|Carefully avoiding a spoiler, this film gives us \\"cute\\" in the most unlikely places.  The plot and plot devices are no less plausible than Star Trek, which we have all come to take for granted.  All in all I got more than I expected and had a good time watching.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My daughter in law purchased the three books in the series. After I read the first book, I couldn't wait to read numbers 2 + 3 to find out what happened in Ana's quest to find the perfect man.  I am now reading the third book. I think that the author should continue the series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I, like many others, decided to read this book to see what all the hype was about. Friends of mine also were reading it and raving about it. I wish I hadn't wasted the ten dollars. I wouldn't have paid a penny for this had I known! Books like this deserve some type of refund system online!<br /><br />The writing is just poor. The sex scenes are awful. I have read several other books with sex scenes in them that are written much better and are much more believable. And the female character in this book is annoying, always thinkin 'oh my' and biting her lip. Her naïveté is annoying. And even though I only got to 26% of the book, the theme of the whole thing is so ridiculously unbelievable.<br /><br />It's just not good. I wish I had listened to the other reviews that told the truth about this book! Kicking myself for sure! I wil not be finishing this book!<br /><br />Word to those who are on the fence about getting it.... DON'T!
B007H7XJD4|2.0|The Immortals was an interesting look at Greek mythology.  Unfortunately, the gratuitous violence and the grotesque battle scenes made the movie much less enjoyable.
B0079NQZLE|5.0|This was a story that only the Japanese could envision.  Having said that, the way politics are shaking out in this country I don't think they are overly outrageous with their hypothesis.<br /><br />I won't reveal the plot I will only say that the story unfolds in a most abrupt and realistic manner and is a shock to this particular student class.<br /><br />The unfolding story is not about what Japanese teens would do when faced with this situation but what would anybody do including you!<br /><br />The acting is very good.  The pacing is just right.  It is not a particularly gorish movie. I mean violent acts are not usually nice and clean. I was enthralled by the story and it provoked many questions within my own psyche and I am afraid I didn't always like my own answers.<br /><br />This is a story worth hearing and a movie that presents that story very well.
B00846REIS|5.0|After finishing up Fifty Shades, I decided to give this on a go. I loved how it sucked you in from the first chapter. I am counting down the days until Reflected in you is released.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked 50 shades of grey and wanted something else like it this is the one for you! I don't know if one is better than the other but this one is right up there on my list with Fifty shades of Grey
B0043URV5U|5.0|This cd is awesome and has all the great hits on it. This is defiantly a must for bob segar fan. It also a great price.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm not a poetry person so I was not interested when I first saw this title, but my sister read it and liked so I thought I would give it a try. I am so glad I did. This is a terrific book for the collage aged to their parents and all ages in between. Don't let the poetry scare you away from this book it is so far deeper than that! Want a great romance that you can relate to and loose yourself in the characters Slammed is for you!.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Great workout!!! Jillian Michaels does not disappoint!  I will definitely be purchasing other dvds, once I begin to master this one...
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like the amount of sounds in this app. the sound quality is extermly high. put a pair of earbuds into this and you will not be disappointed.
B004ZG5F0K|5.0|I enjoyed this film very much, and was elated to finally get a copy of my own. But when I put it into my Blu ray player, it would not play at all. I am very disappointed that I have to return a BRAND NEW movie to the store.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|they are very hard games. I like this app because you have lots of options and you will never get bored.-
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I would recommend this CD of his previous recordings.  It definitely brings the great times in the bay area and all the groupies.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I just got my new smart phone and kindle fire so I'm still learning this app.. So far I has been as easy as my laptop. So far it has been great.
0307730697|5.0|Thanks for the great service I really appreciate it. I give you all a five star for the quickness in shipment
B0085776BG|5.0|This gives a great look at a group from our on history here in the U.S.A.. Their standards were set higher than others doing the same job, but they met those an set their on standards higher. Great movie about how men can overcome.
B008BM9L72|3.0|The read started out with surprises and created an anticipation of a thorough read but as the pages progressed it became more of the same,thus I struggled to keep my interest with this book
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. The sounds are great and super calming. I especially like that I can play multiple sounds and adjust the volume of each. The only suggestion I have is to allow the app to play,even when it's not open- like during reading.. with that said, it's free, so what do I have to complain about?
B004Y12S9W|4.0|I have Google TV in the family room, but wanted to be able to access Internet and iPad apps on the HDTV in the bedroom.<br /><br />This device does not come with instructions, but after trial and error I was able to get the connections right. It does a good job, though it does seem to run very hot which makes me nervous. Also, it has a second connection on the end that plugs into the iPad--I'm baffled as to its use.<br /><br />Still, it's a cool gadget.
0451205766|5.0|I have seen the movie many times and finally decided to read the book.  The book is better than the movie and that is saying some thing.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a good free app. I enjoy the game play and feel it allows my brain to quickly identify possible patterns. Good mind exercise.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game just rocks pretty much hella  addicting. beautiful graphics doesn't lag and lots of goals in the game that make me keep playing.
0375703764|5.0|I know there are a lot of people who think this book is BS and the way it is laid out is stupid or whatever, but to those of you out there who think on the other side, you'll totally get what I mean.<br /><br />This book gets under your skin. It changes you. It makes you think differently. It's frightening.<br /><br />Give it a shot. If you can't handle the way it's laid out, perhaps your mind isn't ready to be opened.<br /><br />This book is effing brilliant.
B000001ESP|5.0|The contrast between an album like 2112 or Hemispheres and Moving Pictures is quite astonishing. Transitioning into shortened, single-track songs established a different Rush that had evolved from a rather metallic sound into a more complex and light-hearted  band while still maintaining a continuously transforming lyrical and instrumental creativity. Moving Pictures is the quintessential Rush album and features one hit after another with a fantastic set of thematically varied songs that explore many of the more theoretically analytical conceptual qualities of life: burgeoning individualism, linguistic relativity, libertarianism, personification of nature, and phenomenological fairy tales all cohesively embody the album and provide a theoretical foundation that is intrinsically illuminated by the outstanding technical ability and profound emotional qualities that are conveyed by their music.
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this game a while back. it was recommended by a friend. it is SO addicting I can barely get off of it. gotta get it. I cant wait until they come up with a video game for it
B0079KGAOY|5.0|I have watched all four blu-ray movies from this set and I loved them.  I have each on dvd but I was excited to get them on blu-ray and the quality and sound did not disappoint!
030758836X|4.0|I found this novel difficult to put down.  It was clever in that it was presented using two different perspectives - both characters gave their versions of events.  From the beginning to the end the reader is unsure who they side with.  I personally found both characters despicable. With that said, maybe the ending had some poetic justice to it.  I did not give the book five stars only because I was disappointed in how it ended. But it was a page turner!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I usually do not read these types of books. My preferred taste in books is \\"dark\\", like \\"darker\\" than \\"Fifty Shades\\".  I was actually expecting this book to be what I normally read. That being said.. I am EXTREMELY happy that I did read it! I could not get enough of this book. It was extremely predictable until around 20% (like someone previously stated), so I could not wait to get to that point. Once there, everything you think is going to happen does not! I just finished the first book... I cannot wait to get to the second!!!<br /><br />P.S... I think I need to find a Will for me!! ;)
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a very good free app. It is helpful to have because most people keep their phone near them most of the time &amp; with my phone it gives plenty of light  to see by using either the screen or the camera flash.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love how it gives you hints. the adds are annoying but its still worth playing. Its a free app so you cant really complain much and since it hasn't crashed my kindle I'm pretty happy
0345803485|5.0|I loved the book!  I received the book in a timely manner and the price was excellent as well.  As the product itself, It was a wonderful start to a wonderful trilogy.  The characters were very well developed, the plot was a little thin but it was overall a really good addictive book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and challenging keeps my interest. the games are challenging but not overly so. the veriaty is great too. the unlocking part of the game makes me want to ply more too see what's next.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it is fun but you say oh.... ill play for a few minutes but after you pass a level it just continues and you end up playing for fifteen or so minutes. it is very fun though for sibling Competition it is simple and all ages can play. enjoy this game it is free and worth downloading.
B008MM9630|3.0|I honestly loved this game, and unlike many I WANTED to purchase content...the game would not connect to the market and then froze. I tried clearing the data and reinstalling like Amazon suggested and still have the same problem. It also will not connect with Facebook. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Won't update they keep asking for more and more permissions, big brother is monitoring and trying to control you device and data.  JUST SAY NO.
B008MM9630|5.0|o my God this game is a magically amassing in all the ways in the worldwide video game worlds Done
B004I744AS|5.0|Great app .... highly recommended ...  I was surprised at the little extras. I haven't thought of hangman in a long time.
0307592731|1.0|This book is a huge disappointment.  I am embarrassed that I actually paid money for it.  Though I finished the book, in hope that it would get to a point or have some redeeming value, I regret the time I took to do so.  The nature of memoir is that authors embellish true stories to add interest or entertainment or to give the stories more substance.  However, the constant repetition (sore hips, feet and the big backpack)and salacious details of the author's peculiar personal life are more repulsive than enlightening. I generally share books that I read with my adult children, but not this one.  I would not want them to waste their time reading it.  It is difficult for me to understand why those of us with negative reviews of Wild are in the minority.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really love this game its so fun! I can't stop playing it. I like everything about it. it even has a mini game that's very similar to fruit ninja.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Only about half way through the book, but it is great.  I have never seen the HBO series, so really love the book!
B007OV9EYG|4.0|I think everyone on here needs to calm down. The point of this movie is to teach kids about how chopping down trees hurts the environment. Last I checked this was NOT up for debate. Is it wrong to teach little kids about environmental awareness? I don't think this movie has an \\"agenda\\" I think it's just a cute kid's movie about a fluffy Lorax who wants to preserve his precious trees. People need to stop putting politics where there isn't any. Yes, many kid's movies have double meanings and hidden parts (the penis on the castle in The Little Mermaid) but I don't think this movie had malicious intent.<br /><br />I plan to buy the 3-D version once the price goes down, which it should because right now it's cheaper at Target. Other then that, it's a cute movie and well worth buying. Dr. Suess is classic, and kids everywhere read him for a reason. I read him as a kid, and I will read his books to my kids.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Short and sweet.  Among the best sci fi series ever made. I just regret not having purchased the blu ray version.  A must for every sci fi fan. Sigourney Weaver at her best.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love it its very additicing. I looooovvvveee it keeps me busy all day when I'm bored. love it so much
B004J4WKTW|3.0|It bounced around alot. I think I was expecting more so I set myself up for disapointment. All I can say is...not bad, but not great.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|This is the kind of CD you can just listen to over, and over, and over again.  Every song is fantastic.  Highly recommend.
0345803493|5.0|Had to have this book after reading the first one.  It's a continuation of the Fifty Shades of Grey.  It is awesome.  I loved the story line.
B0027MJU00|4.0|At the beginning, Libby seems like an unsympathetic character who blames what happened to her as a child for everything that is wrong in her solitary life. But as you get to know her and learn more about her story, you can't help but feel for her constant struggle to get out of bed every morning. It's easy to see why she turned out the way she did. Her honesty is raw and true. How can you not admire someone that strong, considering how weak she believes herself to be?<br />Her motivation starts out with her need for money, but after she visits her brother in jail for the first time, it turns into a search for the truth. She suddenly needs to find out what really happened that night as she attempts to piece together her own painful memories.
030758836X|1.0|I'm sorry.  I apologize in advance to those who adore this book and admire the author's cleverness and facility with \\"playing\\" the reader.  YOU MAY LIKE IT.  THAT IS OK.  We can agree to disagree. If you read this review, you are doing it because you want to hear what I really think and not just the gushings of the author's friends and of people who totally buy into the book, right?  Right.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />Now, I love a good unreliable narrator, a text that takes you for a spin and you suddenly realize, hey, the narrator is either not understanding what's going on HIMSELF or is presenting only the details he or she wants to present for readers to see him in a good light.  You sort of have a double-understanding in texts like that.  They are tough to do and very much fun when done right.<br /><br />But this is not what I consider a good novel with an unreliable narrator.  If you want an unreliable narrator to take you on a ride, read Philip K. Dick's mainstream novel Confessions of a Crap Artist.  This is just . . . I don't know, the author doing obvious maniupulation and lieing to us.  I don't mind being \\"played\\" as a reader if the payoff is \\"Of course!\\" the way it often is in these twisty little passages of novels, but this just made me feel I was playing in a mudbox and I wanted to wipe it off my hands.<br /><br />The first third of the book makes you sympathize with this poor little woman who writes the diary, but then you realize what a lying conniver she is.  Slowly you see that you have been almost 100% lied to, not just misled or teased, but tricked.  I do not think it is playing fair with the reader.  It becomes so obvious what a psychopath she is, and I don't like the husband, either, because he cheats and seems as shallow as a cookiesheet full of stagnant water.  I guess the ending serves them both right, but I just couldn't stomach the thing.  I did not drink the Kool-Aid.  Yuck!  I feel as if I wasted time that I could have spent watching re-runs of the Big Bang Theory.  You see, those characters are flawed and do things that could be seen as mean or crooked, but you LOVE tham and you understand them and want them to be happy. I just wanted both of these idiots to fall into the abyss.  Buh-bye, idiots!<br /><br />Here I have been LIED TO the whole first half of the book and then the plot basically falls apart, because if she did all this setting stuff up and then it turns out she's not dead and she reappears, then who did all this setting up to make it look as if he killed her?  Is that not an offense that she would be arrested for after all the publicity about her being killed and such?!  They aren't going to pursue charges at all?  And now I am supposed to feel all OK about how clever it was and how it justifies whatever?  There is not enough NO in the world.<br /><br />I read fiction to make sense of the world, not to be jerked around and fed bull-corn.  I read fiction in order to have a vicarious experience that I enjoy.  That's why I don't read stuff with excessive gore, explicit endless hump-hump-hump sex, or \\"inside the mind of a serial killer\\" because I do not WANT to be in there.  I want to be in a fun rollercoaster ride that delivers what it promises.  This did not.  If you want to read a caper novel where you actually DO root for the criminals--read Donald E. Westlake Grandmaster, any of his books, especially the Dortmunder series.  Those books will not leave you feeling ripped off (maybe avoid THE AXE because justice is not done there either and it might make you mad, but the others are great rides.)  I just can't recommend that you waste your money and time on this particular book, as clever as the author was for the first part of the book.  And there weren't a bunch of typos and messed-up sentences the way you see in lots of indie pubs now.  That's the highest praise I can give it, I suppose.<br /><br />Sorry to be a downer.  Next time I'm only going to review books I adore and wewon't have to go through all of this,.  Not recommended.<br /><br />Again, I'm sorry it didnt turn out better for all of our sakes.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wouldn't waste your time. This book is badly written and will make you feel icky. I wish it was possible to unread a book.
B007STXHTM|5.0|I don't understand why amazon is charging so much!! I love shopping amazon but for this i went to my local best buy and picked it up for $49. (every dive shop has them for $49 as well)  It works perfect as is and even better with a red filter for ocean filming. No lens distortion and sharp footage!!!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Honestly - the only reason I bought the 3rd book was because I finally got through the 2nd and figured if I'd gotten that far, I'd have to see it to the end.  When I hear the words \\"oh my\\" now, I cringe.  These three books were not a \\"turn on\\" for me, they were boring, boring, boring.  I never skimmed so many pages so quickly....I read lots of books, and believe me, there are plenty that are erotic and sexual, but in a good way - these books were not.  I thought it was just me, but everyone I've spoken to feels the same way...some teenager's fantasy - Sorry - Fifty Shades of Nothing..
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a fast paced game filled with cool minigames. Plus it has all of your favorite charaecters from the movies.

0425263908|2.0|There are over 700 reviews of this book-but, here is the gist, as I see it. If you loved, loved, loved \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" (hereinafter \\"50\\" because I don't want to type it every three seconds), then give this book a try because there is a high probability you will like it. Why? Because it is, in my opinion, trend-spotting and completely derivative. But, what the heck? That isn't a criticism for an unapologetic, die-hard \\"50\\" fan. If you hated \\"50\\" for any one of the logical reasons that anyone could hate \\"50\\", you might like this UNLESS your exception to \\"50\\" was copious sex, slightly porn-y sex, creepy behavior that is absolutely unacceptable anywhere outside of fiction, and the weirdly unreal \\"Sex and the City\\" vibe of fabulous, beautiful and obscenely rich (yet surprisingly vacuous but for all their emotional trauma) people doing fabulous and sexy things frequently with supernatural stamina. Oh, yeah, and the potential exploitation of sexual abuse to lend this very slight novel some gravitas.<br /><br />Yes, the author is a better and more experienced writer. She has removed the redundancies, the the \\"Marjorie Morningstar\\" high-jinks Ana kept getting embroiled in, and only presents about twenty sex scenes to James' 5,497 unending sex scenes (no, I didn't actually count.) However, it is absolutely and totally derivative which detracts from any talent she may have. This, for me, was akin to reading a tale about Sherri Pottery, a young witch with a star shaped scar on her cheek, going away for her first year at Pigpimple, the legendary Scottish school for witches.<br /><br />You can yell at me if you like or neg my review, but it is true enough to warn readers who might not appreciate a book they have already read.<br /><br />And Seriously, is this the new trend? People damaged by horrendous sexual abuse being healed by love and copious quantities of fairly raw sex? We have JR Ward- she has several characters who have suffered serious sexual abuse. James' \\"50\\", obvs! This book. Is this appealing? I tend to think of sexual abuse as seriously horrific. Sexual abuse of a ten year old is beyond awful. Yes, if the story requires a certain back-story, I can understand a horrible back-story. But, do these stories actually require this much horror? I do not know if \\"Bared to You\\" nor \\"50\\" needed this particular back story to tell the actual tale. They are romance novels about negotiating a really, really hard relationship. And, a romance novel (because that is what this is) isn't really about addressing the horrors of the back story, its about the cute-meet, the zing, the sex, some light trauma, and the happily ever after. Yes, stories with sex abuse victims can certainly be excellent. However, I find it ironic and slightly distasteful that it is the trend in masturbatory/highly sexualized books? What is sexy about this particular back story? And, I can't get past the the idea that they are healing their psychological trauma with orgasms. Let's be honest, the emotional/relationship i.q. of these books are not very high. So, the idea that a real \\"love\\" is healing them is supplanted by the suspicion that it is actually a lot of sex that is the crucial factor in these relationships. And that weirds me out a whole lot.<br /><br />Additionally, is this disturbing to people with alternative sex lives? It is becoming like a bad syllogism: All people who were sexually abused have difficult sexual relationships; Alternative sexual lifestyles are difficult sexual relationships; All practitioners of BDSM were sexually abused. (Forgive me, I haven't taken a logic class for over twenty years but I think I got my point across without any style or grace.)<br /><br />If you go into this book expecting nothing better than \\"50\\" or looking for something to prolong your \\"50\\" high, you'll probably be very pleased. Otherwise, take from this review what you will.<br /><br />Edited to add:<br /><br />I'm afraid I sound more scathing of \\"50\\" than I actuallymean to be. I don't have too much of a problem with \\"50\\". Not my favorite book but it really did have its' charms. The sexual abuse survivor thing in \\"50\\" was part of the story and fairly well-handled. I didn't really feel like it was exploitation. Now, a derivative work that takes the sexual abuse survivor thing a step farther and includes it for no other reason, that I can see, than it is what was in \\"50\\"? Yeah, that is exploitation. If you need angst, then make him a veteran, or a victim of a child-hood kidnapping, or a widower, or anything that is original and organic to the story and character. There are tons of negative and traumatic back-stories available. I am just disturbed by the inorganic quality of this sexual abuse back-story.<br /><br />I was also thinking more along the lines of stories that had well-done sexual abuse survivor's back-stories and I came up with two in particular: Lisa Kleypas' \\"Blue-Eyed Devil\\" where the heroine was raped and beaten in a domestic violence situation and Sherrilyn Kenyon's \\"Acheron\\" where the hero was basically sold as a child prostitute. In each book, the back story was pretty damn integral to the whole story the author wanted to tell. It was a fundamental character trait to each character and was never shrugged off. Haven's recovery was a serious portion of Kleypas' book. Made me cry, to tell you the truth. And, Acheron's? Ugh, I've re-read the latter half of the book but I can't make myself re-read the first half. It is awful and wrenching. But, integral to how much you love him and admire the character and root for his happy ending.<br /><br />But, I stand by my point. Yes, books with a sexual abuse story line can be well-done. But, to use it as a convenient, even \\"trendy\\" traumatic backstory makes me really, really uncomfortable. And the double sexual abuse backstory in \\"Bared to You\\" makes me suspicious and uncomfortable.mean to be. I don't have too much of a problem with \\"50\\".

B003ITZBW2|5.0|I've always like the darker side of Batman.  The Christopher Nolan Batman Trilogy is exactly the kind of Batman story that I've come to love and this animated movie is right up the same alley.  I recommend this to any ADULT Batman fan.<br /><br />P.S. - this is not the \\"WHAM\\" \\"BAP\\" \\"BOOM\\" Batman that you can sit down and watch with the kids...
B006Z9SP3E|3.0|Quite gripping to start, but ends weakly and without a conclusion. Maybe there is a sequel coming out.<br />Too many characters necessitate re-reading parts already read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Each level 5x5. 6x6. 7x7 etc. Get harder but do-able. Makes me think but not frustrated. A nice distraction.  The timed challenge is also fun..challenging.. and a bit addictive.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put my Kindle down until I finished the book. Thank goodness for Amazon. It's so easy since you don't have to go to the library or leave the house.
0345803485|1.0|I too fell into the romantic hype of this book. I found it to be the classic...girl meets crazy, messed up, cute, rich boy and she can \\"fix\\" him..... Repetitive sexual encounters left me skipping ahead...not very erotic. If you like the bad boy fairy tale of living happily ever after you may enjoy this book.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Like other reviews you will hear that this app is just like the app of tiny mosters. True, I also have the tiny misters app and they say it's just like Dragonvale. Well they are all copies of one another but they are good apps to purchase! Thank you,
0312641893|5.0|I'm so glad I finally had some free time this summer to read more than 30 minutes here and there.  I enjoyed the book Cinder so much, and was so engrossed in the story, that I stayed up until 2am to finish it!  Once I reached the middle of the book, there was no way I was going to put it down until the end.<br /><br />For me, a really good book makes you feel for/with the characters.  I found myself really engaged in Cinder's emotions throughout the book; I was happy, angry, and sad with her.  At one point in the story, I actually got tears in my eyes.  It's been a while since a book did that to me.  I wouldn't say this book is perfect, but the story made me want to keep turning pages.  When Cinder was over (at 2am!) I still wanted more pages, more story, in spite of the hour and my fading eyesight.<br /><br />This was such a fun book to read; I can't wait for the next book in the series!  New author, Marissa Meyer, is off to a great start!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing. I absolutely love it. I could sit and play it for hour's. Its addicting and fun.

B007M45PMU|5.0|Love this album! They have a new sound but an old feel, great for cruising around town on your own, and doesn't lose that real sound
1442419814|5.0|This right here, was an epic read.<br /><br />The writing was flawless. The plot spoke to me; about the way we must look after our planet and to accept ourselves as who we are and what we look like.<br /><br />Tally - I think - is a great Heroin. She is a determent girl that tries her best; even when things don't go well for her. But I honestly didn't like the way she betrayed her friends.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Let me start out by saying that this was a great book. The story kept moving and never dragged. However, I do lament the misuse of question marks where they clearly don't belong. For example, when you start a sentence with \\"Maybe...\\" it is a statement, not a question. This appears throughout the book.<br /><br />Overall, touching story that is well written.
B008MEM24S|5.0|So much fun!  Really solid game, great for passing the time while waiting for appointments.  And with Perry!  Everything's better with Perry!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was a brilliant expose of the 1960's and what life was like during the Kennedy years.  Take that and weave a marvelous tale of time travel, love, intrigue, history, murder, and you have Stephen King's new novel.  I couldn't put the book down.  I fell in love the the protagonists! While I wished for a different ending in some regards, I knew it ended the way it HAD to end...touching, beautiful, and right.<br /><br /> The most incredible aspect of the book was the preciseness of King's ability to bring you back with the hero as he walks through history and faces Oswald, Kennedy, and the world during a simpler time.  The uncomplicated years of the late 50's and early 60's with its honor code on one hand and blatant prejudice on the other, along with a touch of nostalgia and clean air, the past is literally brought back to life though King's magical words. His description of Kennedy during the cuban missile crisis was spot on.  I was a young girl during that time in history and his vivid details made me relive the incidents like I was there again - seeing Kennedy's strained face, hearing the quiver in his voice...and rejoicing after knowing we would not go to war. This is truly a masterpiece.  Bravo to a brilliant storyteller!! His best book yet. Thank you Stephen King for taking me on a wonderful journey back to my childhood.
0307744434|5.0|Erin Morgenstern's \\"The Night Circus\\" is beautifully detailed, exquisitely written and utterly enchanting.<br />That such a remarkable piece of work has been eclipsed by E L James leaves much to be desired of the reading public.<br />This is a superb and highly-deserving literary creation. Congratulations, Erin, on your success. I can only hope it garners the audience it deserves.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was electrifying!  I changed my mind about both of the protagonists several times while reading the book.  I first hated the husband, then despised the wife....then went back to hating the husband and then wanted to commit the wife....in the end I really felt like I had been on a roller coaster ride and needed to hang on for dear life. I came off dazed and confused and yet glad I had taken the chance and took the ride after all. It was most entertaining and unusual and the end was probably the best way it could have ended without spoiling the ride.  I don't want to give away anything about this book except to say hang on tight and every time you dip or turn a corner your ride won't be over.....WOW!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|A must read at the moment- very easy to read and hard to put down. It's not the most well written book I've read, but still worth reading
B006ON41FC|5.0|get it I got it months ago and love it if u have o.99 cents get it if u do not get its Cu's u got no cents!!!
B001UW58WW|4.0|I live in a household which loves music.  I play many instruments and always like to listen to music around the house.  This cd is a truly wonderful blend of classical and modern music with a twist.  David Garrett is a very talented musician and I own several cds from him.  I love this cd, and when I play it when I have company over, they ask me which cd it is, and then they want to get it too.  Highly recommend!

B002I0J5FG|5.0|Ever since I was a little kid I always saw the SoC game and wanted to play it really badly, although it always was too expensive.  It was amazing to get that nostalgic experience that I never got to have.  Ico was a nice add on to what I wanted, but gets frustrating sometimes.<br /><br />------GAMEPLAY--------<br />-ICO- Ico is a pretty bare game when it comes to the complexity of the gameplay which does this game well.  You only need to press 3 or 4 different buttons when you are playing and of course the analog stick.  Ico was the \\"hipster\\" of modern day indie games being one of the more minimalist experiences.  With just a beat the crud out of the shadow enemies in the game.  Although, the worst part of the game is that Yorda is way to defense-less.  She has an awful AI that you would certainly hope for in modern day games.  For it's original time it was not as much as a problem, but you'll be cursing at your screen as she runs around the ladder instead of going up to and climbing it.<br /><br />-Shadow of Colossus- This was the most amazing gameplay experience in it's day.  With some minor controls that are odd, but will take you 10 minutes to master.  Climbing up the beasts is an easy task, finding and slicing at their weak spots is the best feeling I've felt in a game in a long time.  I really don't have much to say about it because it is beautifully done when it comes to gameplay.  Gameplay on SoC alone makes this game easily worth $30 (Let alone $20)<br /><br />------Presentation-----<br />-Ico/SoC- Whenever I get an HD remake of a game (Like God of War) I check the old one to see if it really is a remaster or just a re-release for money.  This is definitely a remaster.  There seemed to be a great amount of time thrown into it in order for it to look good.  This INCLUDES the cut scenes! Ico was not as well done on the remaster, but that is understandable since the original game was older and did not look close to as good as Shadow of Colossus.  On the storyline, I will not say much, but the stories are not what you expect from a PS2 game and sparked video games becoming similar to modern novels, the first to make you feel into a game since FF7.<br /><br />----Verdict-----<br />-Ico-  Ico would be a great modern PSN game, and would probably be sold for 15 dollars since the game is 5-7 hours long (There is a trophy for beating it within 2 hours if you play it enough).  The game would be a good competitor to Limbo or even Journey.  Even though the graphics are not as good as the modern day PSN games, they are great.  The best part of the game is the story.<br />Ico's overall: 8/10<br /><br />-Shadow of Colossus- This is the game I really wanted to play and I am glad that I was able to!  There is just this great feeling you receive when you take one of them down, and then you feel bad as you have 15 more to go.  The game can be upwards to 12 hours long and it is definitely worth every second.  You can even pin this game against the top modern day games.  This makes me look forward to the Last Guardian.<br />Shadow of Colossus: 9.5/10<br /><br />I know that looks more like a 4 star game, but throw in the price ($20) and it is a MUST HAVE for any Playstation fan.<br /><br />OVERALL: 9.0/10<br /><br />Add me on PSN: ottoroyal
159102594X|4.0|I originally read the First Law Series after completing George R.R. Martin's \\"A Feast For Crows\\" and commencing my 6 year wait for his next book. Upon reading other reviews, I feel that Abercrombie is harshly and unfairly criticized for not delivering the well-developed characters and rich, engaging plot that Martin created in his Song of Ice and Fire series.<br />Logen Ninefingers is the perfect brute. While I love Martin's books, I feel that he spins his wheels in many of his books to stretch them out. When I read a Dance With Dragons, I felt like half of the book could have been omitted. Abercrombie does not mess around. He gets straight to the bloody, gory fun.<br />Anyone who can read this book and not enjoy it is taking themselves too seriously, and being unrealistic in thinking that they will ever find a fantasy writer whose work can compare to Martin's.
0345529057|3.0|I purchased this boxed set at a local store and actually paid more for my box set then the price here on Amazon, so I would recommend purchasing on Amazon if you are interest in this set.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones (Book 1):  I found this book to be AMAZING. It is jammed packed with numerous characters, lots of plots and subplots, and many locations. I found it to be a real page turner and had a difficult time putting it down as I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. It can be challenging to keep up with all the different characters, locations, and how they are all related but each chapter is written from the perspective of a different character which was helpful. Also there are MANY websites that assist with this and even an iPhone App!!!  The timeline can also be confusing at times as the adventures of each character don't necessarily happen one after another sometimes they happen as the same time as another character or even in the past, so keep that in mind. I really enjoyed all of the characters even if I didn't necessarily like them as a person, all of them were interesting to me. I would say this is my favorite book of the set.<br /><br />A Clash of Kings (Book 2):  This book starts to intensify the story and character adventures introduced to you in book 1. It starts the beginning of really unraveling a mystery in the book. For the most part the characters remain the same as in the first book but you are introduced to a few new ones. This book begins the plotting among characters for power. Numerous adventures continue and again I found this book to be another real page turned that I had a difficult time putting down. My second favorite book of the set.<br /><br />A Storm of Swords (Book 3):  For me this book was somewhat of a struggle. You are introduced to a slew of new characters with many of the characters you were invested in throughout book 1 & 2 not being huge players in this book. This book is mostly battle filled and consists mainly of battles or planning for battles. There continues to be a good amount of adventure but I found it much less interesting to me then the first two books and had to force myself to continue at times, but that is just my personal opinion while some of the battles were interesting to me I tend to be more of a character reader and was saddened that a lot of the characters I had grown to love or hate didn't have as big of a role in this book then the previous two books.<br /><br />A Feast for Crows (Book 4):  I REALLY struggled with this one!!!  I felt as though much of the story and characters I had been following again didn't have major roles in this book. I found the story to REALLY slow down and again found myself forcing myself to continue on reading which really saddened me because of how much I LOVED the first two books. This book seems to have a whole new set of characters and while it was initially somewhat difficult to follow and learn the first set of characters I found the learning of these new characters to be even more of a challenge. Overall I was disappointed in this book and wished it would have had more of the same spice the first two books had. It seemed to me that the authors writing style had changed (which is very possible when you consider the time in between the writing of each book) and at times it was almost like it was written by a completely different author.<br /><br />Overall I LOVED book 1 & 2 but felt that book 3 & 4 fell short in comparison. I will still read book 5 (A Dance with Dragons) how can you not after investing your time in around 4,000ish pages of this story and will likely read the remaining two that are expected to finish the series if they are written which seems to be controversial. For a series of this genre I did enjoy the bits of magic but that it wasn't over done as some other books of this genre tend to do. I have watched the HBO series and I will say that it is AMAZING and does follow the books very nicely and remains very true to the written story. I would recommend this series but do keep in mind that there are very slow points and not to become too attached to the characters throughout the books because they often change and it is very likely that some of the characters you get invested in no longer have a major role throughtout the rest of the books. With those points in mind read on and enjoy!!!

1451629192|5.0|I have just finished reading \\"A Stolen Life\\" by Jaycee Dugard. (Yes, didn't just hearing her name pull a heartstring in you?)    She is the 11-year-old girl that was walking to the school bus stop when she was approached by a man in a van, tazed, and abducted. She lived in his backyard for 18 years. She knew him longer than she knew her mommy...    The book is written by her. Her little-girl recount from the terrifying moments of her abduction to the first rape, the subsequent abuse, babies she bore to him as a young teenager, and daily life in his filthy backyard is heart-wrenching, devastating, and should instill feelings of rage in every parent, every person, every human being.    I plan on having my 11-year-old son read this book in its entirety. He may blush at parts, but these kinds of details are what our children need to hear so they understand the real evil that is waiting at the hands of a kidnapper. Telling them \\"...don't talk to strangers, they'll do bad things to you...\\" is NOT good enough, in my mind. Some may disagree with me on this, but I want my son to know, and I want him to be afraid. Fear will keep him aware. When my older children were growing up, we discussed details on exactly what can happen to a child when they are stolen. Detailed details. As adults, my children now tell me how much they appreciated that honesty and how it made them much more focused on the world around them when they were alone.    I believe this little girl's memoir will help children to really comprehend what can happen in an abduction. I also believe it will bring a greater awareness to children of what is and is not appropriate behavior between a child and an adult, regardless of the relationship.    The book is $15 here in the U.S., $17 in Canada, and a portion of the proceeds go to a foundation (started by Jaycee) that provides support and services to families recovering from abduction and other traumatic experiences. [...]    Go buy the book. If you can't afford it, give me your address - I'll send one to you.    Hugs to Jaycee for having endured such a terrifying ordeal. What an extraordinary young woman for finding the strength to rise above such trauma and embrace the life and freedom she now has. I am grateful to her for having the courage to share her experience with all of us.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|The reviews vary and I did try some other similar apps, but this is my fav, as I prefer its tones much better, very soothing to my ear.<br /><br />I will upgrade this app soon.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Too vanilla but happily ever after regardless. Still a good trilogy that would not make a movie we could get on Netflix!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is by far my favorite utility app! I love that I can either have music or videos on my kindle fire instantly. I can open them up no problem and with no hassle. I love it very much. Get it! You will like it too(:
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The 3rd book was not as exciting as the first two.....it end very typically for a love story. Boy meets girl book 1.......boy almost loses girl....book 2........happy family book 3..........
B004D4ZZM2|5.0|This is just a great compilation of all the great works of this great writer at an even greater price!!  I just wish it were easier to go back to pages on the Kindle!  If there were a feature on my Kindle to enter a page number that you could go back to and them resume reading that would be wonderful...but on mine I only get the percentage of how far I have read and no actual page numbers.  But all in all this is a great book if you love Shakespeare!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was awful! It has been written for a heart sick teenager and not for adults. It was horrible. I did not finish more than a couple of chapters. What drivel!
B0086700CM|5.0|love it! I spend hours playing it. sometimes when trying to go one way it goes another but that just me trying to learn the game sensitivity.
0345803485|1.0|Seriously, absolutely, without any doubt - the worst written piece of fiction I've ever read. Please, please, please don't waste your money. If you have to find out for yourself how bad this book is - try to find and read it for free. You will thank me forever for saving your money.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|As long as Captain america is considered just one extra step for the assembly of The Avengers, I personally like this hero. And the Blu-ray is loaded with fine extra features for people who enjoys the proccess behind a fine production.

0345803493|3.0|It was ok because it was repetitious, sex over and over and over....the plot line could have been accomplished in the first book or even the second....but a third book was not necessary.
0441013597|5.0|I will start this review by telling you who I do not recommend this book too. I do not recommend this book if you are look for a light, easy time waster, a book just to relax. Dune is a book that requires not just your full attention, but your full mind.<br /><br />Set on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune), a fifteen year boy boy named Paul, accompanies his father, a duke, to the new world to supervise the cultivating of the addictive spice Melange.<br /><br />This is an extremely brief summary of the incredibly complex book and plot.<br /><br />One of the things that impressed me most about Dune was the world building. Everything works to make this world, nothing is added just for the sake of feeling 'exotic' or 'cool'. Everything works together in order to make this world seem so whole and unto itself. One thing about Sci-fi is that it can easily be dated by advances in technology, but Dune does not feel dated. I feel it could have been easily written today in the same form. That is how good the world building is. I cannot recall being pulled out of it for a moment.<br /><br />I think i large part of it is the focus of politics and philosophy also keep it from being dated. Since so much of it revenant to us, especially the commentary on the interplay of religion and politics. Some of the quotes and lined made me pause and just think about them and their place in the  contemporary world. The only other author that has ever made me do that is Orwell.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that can be considered 'brain food' and challenging to you, then pick up a copy.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It was a wonderful story full of redemption and hope...all of the good things which Jean Valjean did and how he was so humble and faithful until the end...Peace
0547564651|5.0|This book is packaged to look like parenting pop psychology, so I was eager to get my copy. I love parenting pop psychology. I always need good new choices for the parenting section of my children's library. There's a lot of excellent material in How Children Succeed to make it well worth reading. Author Paul Tough retails for his reader some important studies: specifically, Michael Meaney's rat studies and a comparison study between two prestigious middle schools using new character driven agendas to help their students.<br /><br />The rat study was described in the early chapters of the book. At first it seems a bit simplistic. Meaney noticed that young rat pups did not like to be handled in his lab. (Who would?) When released back into their cages, in some cases, their moms would rush over and lick and groom them, calming them down. In other cases, their moms wouldn't even set their mai-tais down long enough to give them the time of day.  So he put together a whole experiment documenting this phenomenon. Baby rats who were licked and groomed (LG in Meaney speak)grew up to be well adjusted, maze running, fat and happy rats. Baby rats who were not LGed grew up dysfunctional, barely able to find their pellets, they dropped out of school early, had higher teen pregnancy rates -- you get the picture.<br /><br />At first this seems like very obvious stuff. But quite early on in our childrens lives, we begin to face the question: \\"Should I lick and groom my crying child or let him develop a little grit by dealing with it?\\"<br /><br />Well, Paul Tough doesn't answer this question.<br /><br />This book isn't about practical answers for practical parenting questions. Paul Tough just tells us what the latest studies are. He doesn't generalize from them. Which is admirable, esp. to me, because if there's one thing I have a tendency to do it's to float away on a hot air balloon of generality into another land. The title of this book is a bit misleading too: \\"How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character.\\"  This should really read: \\"How Children in Unique, Cutting Edge Middle Schools Succeed: Grit, Self-Control, Zest, Social Intelligence, Gratitude, Optimism and Curiosity.\\" Because those were the characteristics which were evaluated in the middle schools' Character Report. The study about these schools and the turn around staged for them by principals concerned with the character of their students is a fascinating one.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I see a problem with the individual parent trying to apply this philosophy in raising children, except in a general kind of way. But then, that wasn't Paul Tough's purpose in writing this book. It was just my purpose in reading it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I guess i am not the person to rate this book, as I really am not getting into it.  It has taken me 2 months to get through book 1 and 1/2 of the second.
B0052FYPJK|5.0|This is Bruce Lee's own thoughts on his development of the Jeet Kune Do fighting philosophy. It's invaluable to anyone who wants to learn or is currently studying Jeet Kune Do as it shows precisely how Bruce Lee thought. Since Jeet Kune Do is not a fighting style but a set of principals for development fighting and conditioning technique, this can help you with one of the most important parts of being a student of Jeet Kune Do: developing it, expanding it, and shedding whatever you find is not helpful to develop your own Jeet Kune Do.<br /><br />The book observes fighting from many angles, including strategic principals, philosophy, conditioning, and specific techniques and advice on how to use those techniques. Much of the technical advice is not that easy to follow without knowing or training in fighting yourself, but that is to be expected. No one should take this book as a substitute for learning from a teacher. Rather, this book is an excellent companion for those who are learning or want to learn the art of fighting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the challenge. It's fun;makes you think yet not hard enough to make you get flustered. Highly recommend. Great way to stay entertained
B0087HT36U|5.0|Very enjoyable, exciting entertaining and challenging. Love how you have to save the peasants! Give us more levels please!!!  (great alternative to angry birds...who doesn't love to break stuff)
0385344228|3.0|The premise here is very intriguing and horrifying -the idea that your own son could be a murderer but you just didnt know for sure. This one kept me interested after I got about 1/3 through it ... it was slow going in the beginning. Worth reading.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was my first Stephen King book and I'll be reading more of his work! This book was great.  King really brought me into the story and had me laughing, crying and angry at some of the outcomes. It truly is a very good read and I highly recommend it.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Ordinarily I like well-written works of literature interspersed among the junk books I've been reading since I retired.  I always look through the new \\"Literary\\" books when ordering for my Kindle.  The advance blurbs about Canada had me pretty excited.  It looked good.  Maybe I expected too much.<br />Canada is a slow moving work where even the exciting things are boring.  It is like Henry James or Emerson on tranquilizers.  There are gems in that prose, but the author spends too much time mining the gem and then polishing, polishing, polishing until finally I longed for the cubic zirconia of my junk books.<br />The story's premise is a good one.  The parents of twins rob a bank.  One of the twins, the female, runs away and destroys her life.  The male twin is taken to a remote outpost of Canada to prevent him being put in a foster home.  In the Canadian wasteland, the twin is parked with a near sociopath.<br />The first person narrator tells the story almost exclusively from the thought processes of what the male twin is thinking.  Too me, it was painfully boring, but I can see why many readers might like it.  As for me, I miss Spenser.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is awesome it has everything. I need and more I really love it. I'm really surprised. they have it for free I think every one should have this app! it really helps! :)
B00275EHJG|5.0|This movie is cute.  A little more action than some of the prior ones in the series.  Something the entire family can enjoy. Happy with the purchase and movie selection.  Toddler Parent in Virginia
B0055EDBIE|1.0|I *AM* the Charlie Brown of Lenny Kravitz fans in that I keep buying his cd's, believing the hype and his claims in interviews that he has returned to form, back to the more &#34;old school&#34; stylings of his earlier albums, and I continue to have the football yanked from me before I'm anywhere close to kicking it as I buy cd after cd from Kravitz that are all VERY mediocre.  I really liked Lenny's first four albums, and for my money, his 5th album from 1998 -- cleverly titled '5' -- as a sonic step forward and a collection of (mostly) solid songs.  So even though that one was very different from his first 4 albums, I had no problem with it and in fact have it as one of my favorites (along with &#34;Are You Gonna Go My Way&#34; and &#34;Mama Said&#34;).  But the mainstream success of that album and even bigger success of the single he did for the Austin Powers soundtrack (his cover of the Guess Who's &#34;American Woman&#34;) seemed to have sent the wrong message to Kravitz, that if he stuck to a more modern and pop-sounding direction, he'd sell more albums.  And maybe he has, but nothing he's done since 1998 has been what I'd call a solid album.  Some, such as &#34;Baptism&#34;, have their moments, but &#34;Black and White America&#34; is easily the worst he's done up to this point.  For years, Kravitz has been panned for &#34;overly simplistic&#34; lyrics, a criticism I never agreed with, but one listen of the title track and I see what they mean.  &#34;Come On And Get It&#34; is the blatant attempt at rock radio, but like past tracks such as &#34;Dig In&#34; and &#34;Where Are We Running&#34;, this one leaves me cold. Radio needs a single, ok, I get it, but these types of tracks do nothing for me.  Throw in collaborations with Drake and Jay-Z and there's just not much here for us fans that liked Kravitz from the beginning.  I actually like the r&b stylings from earlier Kravitz releases and do appreciate that genre, but he hasn't done it very well at all since his first few albums and his rock stuff just keeps getting more and more generic.  All-Music's description of this as &#34;aural candy&#34; is completely accurate, although I think they meant it as a compliment.  Not so with me as I just do not find much substance here at all.  The only thing good about this cd for me is that it relieves me of having to question whether or not I should buy his next one.  Sorry Lenny, but I'm no longer going your way.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|My 2.5 year old watches this movie over and over and quotes the characters and is transfixed when he watches a segment of it or the movie in its entirety. It's a great movie.  I am satisfied with the selection. Happy Parent in Virginia
B006OOHYIC|5.0|without a doubt the best game out there.  can not quit playing it.  need. any more quell games.  I will buy every one.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|My toddler son loves this movie! We got Toy Story 1, 2, and 3 in the same time period and love watching the trilogy in small \\"doses\\" or long spells.  Toddlers love to quote it, sing the songs, and role play with the characters. A good flick! Happy Parent in Virginia
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I saw this opening weekend as I am a huge fan of the first two films.  Even number 4 is watchable as a B flick (especially the Dir Cut).  But this new film has the IQ of a rodent - no that's wrong - rodents can find their way out of a maze, can't they?  In this film all sense of character and storytelling is lost.  As others have said it reeks of test audience re-writes.  Thus a film by committee.  Disgusting.  The picture is beautiful - what do you expect from the best SFX houses and $130 M?  The film as a whole is an abject failure of junk science and silly plot lines.  More suitable for a teens in the woods Z grade horror flick.  I am giving it a charitable 3, but it really deserves a negative, imaginary number.  Shame Ridley, shame.

B003GFIWGK|5.0|Have this in a large hardback illustrated edition.  Love the stories of the Great Sherlock Holmes and his trusty side-kick, Dr Watson.  Not at all like the Hollywood movies with Basil Rathborne but just as fun to read.  Nice to have this in a more compact Kindle edition.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|This turned out to be an app I never knew I wanted. On a whim I grabbed the free versions and liked it so much that I bought the pro version. Living on the east side of florida we don't get much variations in weather except sun and heat, so I am able to transport my mind elsewhere when sleeping with this app, like a mini vacation.<br /><br />The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is a common issue others have mentioned and that is device specific sound looping issues. It is not an issue on my old optimus V which is a basic android device running 600mhz, but my new evo 3d running a dual core 1.2ghz will have silent gaps in between about half of the sound loops like rain/wind/noise. It doesn't make the app unusual but it is a bug that the maker should be able to fix.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Too busy to write a proper review. I will just say that I saw this in the theater and loved the movie. Bought it on blu-ray and couldn't be happier. The whole family enjoys this one.
B00843TZJM|5.0|My only Beef is no 5.1 sound.But just what I expected from C.S.N.Anyone expecting them to sound like the 4 way street era is a fool.They are a band that plays for the moment.A Jam type band that will sound different each time you see or here them.Being a musician myself I like that.I don't want to hear songs EXACTLY AS THEY SOUNDED IN THE STUDIO.If you want that go see one of todays million dollar lip sync stars like Madonna or whatever.I'll take old sometimes out of tune harmony singing because it is real.They could have done like many others do today and cleaned it up in the studio but there is Nothing worse than a live DVD Or C.D. that has been touched up in the studio to fix all the flaws.Kudos to the fellas.Seniors and still kicking.

0812981448|5.0|My daughter gave me this book two weeks ago. I started reading and was immediately struck by the creative solution Blake Mycoskie found for the biggest problem facing non-profits, funding. I was part of a non-profit start up that was developed to partner with an orphanage in the Dominican Republic to help provide for and educate the children. We ran out of steam because we simply were unable to attract donors. Mid-way through my reading of Blake's book, our family sat around a table in a local coffee shop to discuss ways we could duplicate the TOMS model. Our passion for our Dominican friends (a group of kids we had lived with for the better part of two years) had finally found an outlet! We researched business options and discovered we could start a tshirt company with virtually no up-front cost. My four kids (evenly spread between ages 16 and 21) and one of their friends designed a cool shirt, we created a website, made some YouTube videos and are now going full-steam to go viral with our message. Love Sees Faces (loveseesfaces.com), a long-time dream, is suddenly a reality. Blake's writing, easy to follow but very challenging, compelled our family to take action for a cause we feel strongly about. I cannot recommend his book strongly enough!

B008OOYALE|5.0|This app is so great. I wish they came out faster. proud to be the third reviewer on such a popular game.
0425263908|5.0|Bared To You is the first book of the Crossfire trilogy. My friend and I read it at the same time and both loved it! We also preferred it to the 50 Shades series. We liked that it had more story lines and more of a plot versus 50 Shades which was more about sex than an actual story.
1423113454|5.0|Sadie and Carter Kane are brother and sister but have lived worlds apart ever since their mother died. Carter travels the globe with his anthropological dad and Sadie lives in England with her maternal grandparents. Carter and his dad are allowed two visiting days with Sadie each year. It is on one of those visiting nights that their world blows up in so many ways. Their dad disappears, they have to run for their lives, and decided whom they can and cannot trust among people they've only just met. They learn about each other, their family history and a lot about Egyptian mythology.<br /><br />The Red Pyramid is similar to Harry Potter as they young people learn they are descendants of Pharaohs and have magic, but instead of witches and wizards there are Egyptian gods and goddesses.<br /><br />I enjoyed this read and recommend this to anyone who liked Harry Potter.
B002BAWIWU|5.0|Great compilation and great sound.  Includes some of his later tracks including the great instrumental Marwa blues which was written as a tribute to Santo and Johnny.

B008510WAE|1.0|This app took my money and never, ever, ever, ever, worked.  What a rip-off!  I'm surprised Amazon hasn't refunded our money since the app never worked and several others have complained.

B001R4MEUM|1.0|I just got this, literally like 3 hours ago. I've listened to the entire disc and compared to the CD of the original mastering, this newly mastered mix sucks azz. The fades from song to song are abrubt at best it does not flow. There are MANY things I was hoping to still hear that are not even in the mix anymore. It doesn't even sound like its in stereo for most of the disc. I could go on and on and spend days comparing and citing examples but suffice it to say this is my all time favorite record, ive listened to it at least a thousand times maybe more, I pretty much know it by heart from start to finish and this new mix it just terrible. I'D REALLY LIKE TO RETURN THIS POS. IT SUX! WASTE OF MONEY.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|It was a really entertaining read.  It went a little flat towards the end however I really enjoyed all 3 books.  This is not a literary masterpiece - if that what you are looking for then this book is not for you.
B00006DEFA|1.0|Why is the wonderful theatrical cut of this film being withheld from a remastered (and one-sided, rather than flipper!) DVD treatment? Apart from clarifying a single line (\\"I regret that we have no servant to show you out\\") from the original film, the extra scenes in this fatuous \\"director's cut\\" do nothing except pad the running length to the point of tedium and add unnecessary nudity that makes it impossible to show the movie to young people. Now I'm not a prude, but I first saw this film in a high school band class, where I fell in love with the movie and with Mozart's music through it. This R-rated version cannot be shown in a school music class, limiting the film's appeal. Can we at least get a remastered disc release with the original PG-rated version available as an option? Does Milos Forman or someone else connected with the film have a vendetta against anyone who actually enjoyed the original version? Like many others, I feel cheated by the fact that my only choice for purchasing this film is between the brilliantly-remastered but tedious director's cut and the grainy theatrical cut that comes on a two-sided DVD in a cheap snap case. Then there's the keep case version of the theatrical cut (2009) being sold on Amazon that appears identical to the snap case version, but inexplicably lists the film with an \\"R\\" rating for brief nudity, even though the disc is otherwise identical to the snap case release. What gives?

1400052181|5.0|This book should be offered as a mandatory read for every health care professional. Modern science owes a great deal to Ms. Lacks and her family. Cancer survivors as well as survivors of a host of other diseases owe thanks & gratitudes to her as well. Life began with Africa and apparently she is necessary for continued survival.
B00846TTDG|3.0|Not impressed. I read the mixed review (some good, some bad), but figured I'd like the realistic events anyways, just to know what it's really like. However, it's just so disappointing. The dramatic scenes are just in slow motion and so un-dramatic, and feels emotionless even when they're trying to depict emotion. I'm not saying that the actors don't have emotion, but rather, the depiction sucks. Bleh.

B007C3TVNA|2.0|Short Attention Span Summary. Spoiler alert.<br /><br />1. A woman has a baby with a man (accidental conception).<br />2. From the outset it is clear that he has some problems (as a baby).<br />3. When he is still not trained to use the toilet (by 5), it is clearer still that he has more problems.<br />4. This story is told as a series of flashbacks in the mind of the mother of the family (it is not clear what has happened to the rest of her family until the end of the film). It's also apparent from present circumstances that something has been done that has ruined this woman's name in the town.<br />5. As an adolescent, the boy's behavior becomes increasingly.......weird and uncomfortable. Everyone seems to see this except the father.<br />6. Finally, the boy has his \\"big moment.\\" That involves killing a couple of members of his family and several high school students.<br /><br />The biggest problems are that the suspense is drawn out too long (and we ultimately get no clear view of the killing) and the plot suffers from too many plausibility problems.<br /><br />Plausibility problems: 1. I know that parents are the last ones to know that their children have problems. But could any two people miss *that* many problems and that many warning signals? 2. Clumsy foreshadowing. Tomato sauce everywhere. Red jelly everywhere. Other red food objects everywhere. Um, ok. We get it. (Talk about symbolism overkill.) 3. After all that went down in that town, the mother still stayed there and didn't move on and change her name? And someone was still willing to hire her and put their business on the line after all that? 4. One person with a bow and arrow could take out that many people before being overpowered? 5. A 5 year old could *run* a house like that and his parents couldn't control him? 6. A mother would come and visit her son in jail after he killed her husband and daughter and all those people?<br /><br />Tilda Swinton is a great actress, and she did the best she could with a role that just wasn't all that believable. I didn't pay for this movie, and I'm glad. I won't be watching it again.ith a role that just wasn't all that believable. I didn't pay for this movie, and I'm glad. I won't be watching it again.

0439023513|3.0|Glad it's over... Being an adult, and a writer, I have to say that I found HG compelling enough to keep reading. Kudos to Ms. Collins for that. However, I also have to say that in all 3, I found the arena/battle scenes to be video games on paper. I skimmed them; skimming is the death knell of fiction. The fact that I'm skimming speaks loudest. After all, it's kids fiction, we know this, and those parts of the book drove that home for me. The dystopic terror was compelling. The fighting was not. And, by the author's and Katniss' own repeated admissions, the protagonist is not a sympathetic character. Which is okay, but some people demand that. Beware adults. It's not the crossover it's billed to be. Perhaps Collins' ending, substantively and stylistically, was it's strongest element.
0812550757|5.0|The second book in the series, the characters continue to expand with new adventures and issues.  Once you read the first book, you have to keep on going to number two and then three which I just finished.  Good science fiction.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I must be the only person not in the know but I bought this thinking it was a thriller - the only thrill was in finishing it. Having been bored to tears by the insipid Anastasia and cringy Christian I laboured my way through this just to see how it all turned out for the implausible couple.I will admit I did moan myself when reading it, right at the end when I discovered there was a sequel. Perhaps groan is a better description.<br />This is a trite, irrelevant, sexist,clichéd, forced novel with no evident writing skill or creative thought on the part of James. Haven't Mills and Boon done all this before?
B007L5KT76|4.0|This was a great movie to purchase.  If you like the first one, Jude Law and Robert Downey, Jr. have that same chemistry in this movie as the first.  I purchased it for a plane ride to watch on my Kindle Fire and it was great watching it on the plane on the Fire.

B000002KAT|5.0|That's it! The best song on the best álbum ever. The strings pounding away in the background while Van wails away his love and devotion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book in the Hunger series is by far the best, although all are good.The characters are well defined, easy to visualize in appearance and personality.  Although alien to us, the events are believable and vivid.We identify with, and root for the heroine. It is hard to put any of the books down. As is usually the case, the book is much better than the movie.Highly recommended.

B0006IUDXA|4.0|This series really takes me back to my childhood. I used to love this series, but as an adult, I can see that the plot devices are a little fantastic, that is a little hard to believe. Come on, sliding down a sand dune on a small wall map? Still, if you overlook the predictability of the programs and momentarily suspend your sense of plausibility, it is pretty good entertainment.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love Ice Age; so glad there's a game too. Really addictive. Many have complained that you can't get anywhere in the game without buying from the game store. I've found that not to be true. Patience is what's needed to collect enough coins and cash to progress. There are a few glitches: images flicker in the shop and collection windows and the game slows when to much is going on. Alot of updates have been made to many other small problems like the friend issue; now you can visit radnom players villages and befriend them. All in all Ice Age Village is a fun game and I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the movies.

1594202842|5.0|People need to keep in mind the few words in the very beginning of the book. She uses \\"Chinese\\" loosely as well as \\"Westerners. It is NOT a parenting book. It is a very funny book and at times very painful to read because, like every family, her family went through a tense phase. I see comments of people who are Chinese and I completely understand. But I don't think she was stereotyping the Chinese people. Again, she used the word \\"Chinese\\" loosely. You can be Chinese without being one by nationality or race. People who gave this book a bad review need to reread it and just ignore the word \\"Chinese\\" and perhaps replace it with whatever safe word you can think of.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't write many reviews.  I feel like a fool for falling for the hype around this trilogy, I wasted money on the three, got the trilogy, and it was PATHETIC.  It was Pretty Woman, Cinderella and Twilight mushed together.  The story is so trite and shallow and stupid, the author is rich now, but certainly can have no pride in what she created.....it's garbage.  And this is not because of the phony porn, some good porn might have been interesting.  It is just such a waste of money and time.  Virgin turns into the world's honest lover in moments, of course the man is rich beyond belief, of course the woman doesn't want to accept his expensive gifts....and on and on.......he changes almost overnight from a serious S&M guy, supposedly, to a romantic love, monogamous, ........you get the idea.  WASTE OF MONEY...big time.

B004EPYZSK|4.0|Admit it SciFI fans. If you have not seen this movie yet, it is because you have been laughing at the truly funny title and the silliness of the implied premise.<br /><br />Cowboys and Aliens is why the term mindless entertainment exists. Mindless perhaps, entertaining certainly.<br /><br />Amazon suggests a plot synopsis:<br />Plot? We don need no Stinking Plot! Yes there is one, but does it really matter? We got Cowboys (and Indians) and BEMs (Bug-Eyed Monsters). You are free to bet on the winner. If it helps not all the cowboys are good guys. Also consider that betting against the side that has both Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig (somewhere in there is also Keith Carradine) - is at your risk.<br /><br />There are a number of plot devices from movies like Firefly, War of the Worlds (newer version), Independence day and, on the western side: the Spaghetti Westerns and ... well let me suggest that: if you are the son of a rich wild west daddy and assume he will get you out of jail for shooting up the town, better to have an angry grizzled Harrison Ford than Walter Brennan. Because eatin teeth or no, that plot device was old before the movie [[ASIN:B000056H2F Support Your Local Sheriff]] 1969, made it funny.<br /><br />On the other hand if you can stare in to the face of an angry grizzled Harrison Ford and remember your next line then you are as fine a child star as Noah Andrew Ringer. Then again, if you can face an angry H. Ford than you too can put a Tennessee toothpick where it can best adjust the attitude of an over - reaching BEM.<br /><br />Daniel Craig may not have the over defined features of a young Schwarzenegger or Steven Seagal but he has a great 50 yard stare and all the moves. Do not hack him off unless you have 30 guns pointed as his girl.<br /><br />A few other bits of advice. Maybe if Col. Dolarhyde (Ford) had abetter attitude towards West Pointers, he would not have lost so many troops at Antietam. As is his final deployment against the aliens stank. If the super high tech alien race had a few more hand guns they would have eaten your men alive..Literally!<br /><br />As for the Aliens, if you are planning a rematch - you may want to think about why it is that in the alien abduction biz, the anal probe is,  industry standard.<br /><br />Yet, this movie works. Unlikely elements seems to come together. The logic fails are no more glaring than many another SciFI movie. What lifts this move above most others is the originality in use of so many used parts and more than enough acting to make it sum out to an entertaining way to enjoy your popcorn..

B002DKGWSE|3.0|Remakes of classic films like this are always by people who have already seen the original, or those who haven't. The inherent problem in that is that you already have an opinion of the original, and hence you have things about it you really liked or really didn't like. Well, if you never saw the original, you don't have to worry about that, and chances are you'll like it much better while staying ignorant of the original.<br /><br />So, let's answer the obvious questions. Is it a good remake? Well, no; It just doesn't seem to understand the core of the original, and hence is sort of cheap and a somewhat quirky slasher versus slasher flick. It never feels like it has the heart of the original, nor does it have anywhere near the quality of its own. Is it a good film on its own? Well, yeah, it's pretty good, and would be better if the original never existed. As someone who has seen the original, it's very saddening to see unwelcome changes that just make your heart sink.<br /><br />Let's try to make this real brief. Let's start with the good: This remake has a cool style that works, good actors for the bad guys and just-OK actors for the good guys, a few replacement scenes that are arguably more powerful than in the original, and it completely eliminates the dull cops from the original, as they never show up in any form here--which is good, as they were sort of annoying in the original. It lets us focus on what really matters: The bad guys in disguise, and the good guys who learn they're the people who assaulted, raped, terrorized, and shot their daughter, and are trapped with them with the advantage of surprise. All of this is a good thing.<br /><br />But then we've got the bad. On its own terms, it lacks the same audaciousness as the first. The obvious one is that our two girls, Mari and her friend, are just nobodies. They have no character, no reason to care about them, and virtually no character development before Mari gets herself trapped. By the time the tensionstarts, the film fails to give you a reason to care about either of them on any personal level. They're just there, two pretty girls who ended up in a bad spot. But Paige is downright unlikable, and Mari is a sweet little teenage girl, plus something about her brother being dead, or something like that which doesn't really make up for her total lack of character.<br /><br />In the original, Mari was not a goody-two-shoes sweetheart, and was out for pot just as much as her friend. Both of them are reckless teenagers who naturally feel invincible and so don't mind putting themselves in dangerous situations. You know, the usual kind of teenager that gets in serious trouble because they think bad things happen to other people, not them. Also, Justin here is made to be a saint, albeit a really stupid saint for bringing them to Krug's apartment hoping they don't come back. Nice going, Justin. (When you think about it, the entire movie is completely his fault for enticing them back to his apartment with good intentions gone horribly wrong.) In the original, Justin's character (named Junior then) is a heroin addict who willingly lures the girls back to Krug's apartment with the exact same promise of pot. He does this not because he's a nice guy, but because Krug controls him through heroin fixes. So the trouble starts the wrong way here. It's an accident here due to the moronic good-natured intentions of a stupid kid who happens to have a total psychopath caretaker he simply didn't expect to come back. In the original, all of it was intentional for a heroin fix. It's easy to see why one of these makes a lot more sense than the other. With here, it's stupidity, not an actual trap. It doesn't feel right, and you have to be like, \\"Oh, come on.\\" when Justin has his \\"Crap! They're back! How is that possible, when I have every reason to suspect they're coming back and might rape and kill these two girls like the others!?\\" face.<br /><br />The events unfold totally differently here and in a completely different way, so let's get to the important part. Yes, for everyone who was worried they'd leave it out, there's a rape scene with Krug violently tearing Mari apart with his dong. It's pretty long, much longer than the original scene, but it's also a bit muted, and slightly less in the unrated version. Also worth mentioning is that she's mostly uninjured before it begins. In the original, she had already endured an entire night of abuse, is covered in blood, and she's face-to-face with Krug as he's practically drooling all over her face as he's doing his thing. Considering that part of this film was *completely about the rape scene to demonstrate a point*, you may prefer this version, or you may prefer the original's somewhat more brutal, but briefer, scene. Additionally, they stab Paige a few times to kill her, instead of outright dismembering her like the original. The whole thing is really nasty, and of course, Mari dies then after being shot in the head three times after being raped and cut open a few more times.<br /><br />A remake, I think, should not cut back on the original. So, really, I can't help but think of that as a missed opportunity to really blow away the audience by amping it up even more. There's really no reason they couldn't except for that beautiful R-rating they need, instead of getting knocked up to NC-17.<br /><br />You know, let's just sum it up as that's the movie's real problem. It *can't* show the same brutality with the same dark humor and off-tone scenes. It's not really the actors' faults, and I especially liked Francis in this replacing Weasel, who comes off as far more threatening and less like just a sadistic idiot.<br /><br />Oh, and sadly, no chainsaw scene here. Yeah, I know, I would say, \\"Huh?\\" too. It seemed like a core finisher for the doctor as revenge for her daughter to thrust a chainsaw through his whole body, but they simply screwed it up here. Badly. Not only that, it's been done before. Rather lamely, the doctor uses a broken microwave to fry the guy's head until it explodes. It's not all that interesting, it's been done before, and the doctor never comes off as threatening at any point, or really all that angry like he should be.<br /><br />So, the original is far darker--but this one has that \\"modern\\" style which works pretty well, but just isn't the same. They cut back on scenes that would probably put them in NC-17 territory, which would've been no good, and it's just...bleh. The entire point of the film is to demonstrate how dangerous a simple outing in a dangerous neighborhood can be, and what can ultimately end up as a result. This version holds itself back, so that message doesn't really resonate. Mari just wasn't supposed to survive the assault, and it's highly unlikely it would happen here, considering that she gets shot right in the shoulder and yet somehow makes it *all the way back to her house just by swimming*. It's kind of stupid, and there's no one that could do that even if they weren't shot. There's a current. Sure, the distance isn't catastrophically long (they crashed near her house), but she was just raped and freaking shot in the shoulder. She shouldn't even be able to use her arm, much less swim like a champion during a thunderstorm. It cheapens the film and makes it less realistic due to Mari's survival. It doesn't make sense.<br /><br />On the bright side, if you've never seen the original, you have a far better chance of getting something out of this, since you won't constantly be disappointed by the highly altered sequence of events or the lack of tone the original had, which was just way more effective for its point, since it stayed dead in reality. Here, well, not so much.<br /><br />As a remake, this is three stars. Add one star if you've never seen the original. And that's that.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So many of my (female) friends were reading this book, I knew that I just had to give it a try.  I am an avid reader finishing some books within two days.  Well...suffice it to say that I purchased this book well over a month ago and still have not finished it.  Reminds me of a Halequin romance novel written by somebody who also submits letters to Penthouse Forum.  Soft porn?  No.  Pretty much in-your-face trash.  Unless you are into BDSM and the whole submissive control freak thing, then this is not for you.  Totally shallow. And stupid.  Not worth the paper that it is written on or the power to run my Kindle.  And there are two more?  Kidding, right?

B003DT194G|5.0|If you have not yet seen 'Once Upon a Time...' I envy you. It's probably my number 1 favorite Western of all times. So that you can weigh my opinion, I add 'Lonesome Dove', 'Tombstone', 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', and 'My Darling Clementine' to round out a top 5 list of Westerns to have with you if trapped on a desert island and you must watch them over and over. If they gave me 5 more it would likely be the remake of 'True Grit', 'Open Range', 'Stagecoach', 'The Magnificent 7', or any of the other Wyatt Earp movies except 'Wyatt Earp's Revenge'. I suppose 'Unforgiven' should be on the list, but I have never been able to see what others see in that movie. Have patience with me... I'm also a sci-fi aficionado, yet it took many viewings of Bladerunner before I really got locked in.<br /><br />What you are about to see is the ultimate 'revenge movie' in a western setting. If you have ever seen Sharon Stone's revenge flick 'The Quick and the Dead', fuggedaboutit. Spaghetti Western director Sergio Leone holds court on how to properly serve up this genre in 'Once Upon a Time...'.<br /><br />Here are some things to know about the movie up front without spoiling it for you:<br /><br />1) It's a bit slow. This is NOT Short Attention Span Theater. The pace of the movie is deliberately slow. It's more like eating a simmered roast than a minute steak. Have a beer or a bowl or whatever to let yourself synch down to the pace of the film.<br /><br />2) Every character in 'Once Upon a Time...' has their own music. Famous composer Ennio Marricone scores this epic film and endows every character with the exact right music to set the appropriate mood. Much of this film is about the score, so tune in and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />3) If you get confused as to what the hell is going on in the movie don't worry. It's not atypical on the first time through. To help with that, don't assume all the apparent bad guys are in fact all bad, and don't worry if there appear to be NO good guys for quite some time. It all works out most deliciously.<br /><br />4) There is an early scene where the Italian beauty Claudia Cardinale walks into the railroad station after disembarking the train. A crane shot follows her into the station and then seamlessly tracks up above the station to reveal the town she has arrived in. It is a breathtaking shot with Claudia's character music blaring. An unforgettable moment! Sergio Leone had the town extensively built for this one single shot.<br /><br />5) The DVD has one of the best commentary tracks I've ever heard. It not only explains the movie, it explains \\"the western\\".<br /><br />Enjoy!guys for quite some time.

B0085X31VE|5.0|The highly digitalized cover art gives the impression that this is a typical power metal band playing a hybrid of melodic metal with the occasional guitar crunch and syrupy vocal lines delivering fantasy lyrics a la Rhapsody.<br /><br />Well, thankfully, that's not the case. Then again, anyone who sees the name of this band should know better. Ne Obliviscaris (Latin for \\"lest we forget\\") is an Australian extreme progressive metal band that may be familiar to some for their highly acclaimed 2007 demo, The Aurora Veil.<br /><br />Five years later, the band has released their debut album, Portal of I. It contains all three tracks from their demo, but they've all been reworked and modified with some parts completely rearranged, and of course, the production is a lot tighter. If you, like me, have listened to the demo a lot over the years, you'll notice that the beautifully pronounced bass solo at the end of \\"Tapestry of the Starless Abstract\\" is now hidden under a chant-like vocal melody that may or may not be to your liking depending on your tastes. Also, the overtly heavy buzzing guitar tone is replaced with a more central sound; the guitar tones are wider in scope and carry more tonal definition. This has obviously led to the 'blackened' vibe of the songs to be less readily noticeable; the focus is more on creating bruising riffs and dynamic shifts of tempo on this album.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you've never heard Ne Obliviscaris before, they're a bit harder to classify. They present a powerful mix of growled and clean vocals, sometimes delivered simultaneously (much like some of the vocals on Ihsahn's last album [[ASIN:B007RC51QW Eremita]]), and utilize breakneck-speed drumming, pulverizing fretwork, and dazzling progressive metal arrangements, all supplemented by slowed-down passages informed by acoustic guitars, subtle overlays of jazz fragments, and an ominous violin sound. Unlike most bands in the genre, the violin is used as a key element to define the sound of Ne Obliviscaris; rather than merely adding colour to the metal instrumentation, there are actually entire interludes devoted to the brilliant violin playing, though it never gets too boring to detract from the heaviness of the album.<br /><br />With rolling drums and streams of melodious riffing, \\"Tapestry of the Starless Abstract\\" suggests it's going to be a song 12-minutes of relentless blackened extreme metal with some growls added for good measure, but a few minutes into the piece, the band develops curious rhythmic movements containing waves of riffs that are both melodically powerful and atmospherically dark and menacing, which is exactly what this kind of songs necessitate. The vocals have improved tremendously since their demo days. The growls now hit a much deeper register, alternating between blackened growls thickened by clean singing that evokes Leprous' [[ASIN:B005CAAXXM Bilateral]].<br /><br />The instrumental passages are perhaps the best. \\"Forget Not\\" is this band's creative peak. Before the violin-dominated middle, the band presents their instrumental prowess merging into a cohesive whole warped riffs, phenomenal drumming, and ground-shaking bass work. A more 'open' sound is explored in the intro of \\"And Plague Flowers the Kaleidoscope,\\" which begins with a great rhythm workout supported by flamenco-like guitar elements. It then morphs into a hypnotic, Ulverian riff-world that will simply transport you before picking up more modern stop-start riffing in the middle and concluding with a nasty, old-school death metal aesthetic that would please fans of Immolation.<br /><br />As far as comparisons are concerned, the slower parts are so beautifully constructed that they recall Opeth circa [[ASIN:B00009W8N2 Orchid]], but due to the ever-present violin sounds and progressive mindset, one also has to think of bands like Winds, Ephel Duath (without their overtly jazz-inflicted avant-garde aspect), Ihsahn's solo material as well as later-day Emperor, To-Mera's instrumental dexterity, Alcest's shoegazing moments for the tension-filled, unsettling soundscapes, and even Between the Buried and Me circa [[ASIN:B000UPQFYU Colors]] in terms of constructing and integrating immortal melodies into unorthodox sound structures within an otherwise extreme metal framework.<br /><br />Portal of I is right up there with the year's finest extreme progressive metal efforts and actually surpasses most of them.r, To-Mera's instrumental dexterity, Alcest's shoegazing moments for the tension-filled, unsettling soundscapes, and even Between the Buried and Me circa [[ASIN:B000UPQFYU Colors]] in terms of constructing and integrating immortal melodies into unorthodox sound structures within an otherwise extreme metal framework.<br /><br />Portal of I is right up there with the year's finest extreme progressive metal efforts and actually surpasses most of them.

B000SP1SEO|5.0|Snatch is a very fun crime film. This is one of those great films where the dialogue makes you laugh, instead of gross-out gags. The cast does a great job, I especially liked Brad Pitt as Mickey; his accent is very funny and has plenty of memorable lines like the \\"D'ya like dags\\"/\\"Do you like dogs\\" bit. I also liked how the film interlinked all of the characters so well. Plenty of memorable/bizarre characters, a very fast pace, great storytelling, and a great blend of action and comedy contribute to this film's greatness.<br /><br />I highly recommend Snatch. I definitely had a great time watching this film. As of 8/7/12, Snatch is available on Netflix Streaming<br /><br />There is strong violence and blood in this film. Also some nudity.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Remember people this is just a movie. But what a movie! Never mind what is possible or not. The effects in the movie were wonderful! Love the effects of that ultimate bad guy, the asteroid. And how NASA granted such access to it's facilities including the gantry grom where the schuttles would launch from & that Huge building where the drillers first experience weightlessness. I've read where that building is so big that the air conditioning has to be on all the time or it'll rain inside the building!  Love the concept & special effects. Great what if movie.
1401937268|5.0|My daughter was very pleased with the quality and pictures on these cards.  I told her \\"A deck would pick her\\" and this one did.  She is so very happy with them. We want to thank Amazon for carrying this product.  Easy transaction, wonderful find.  Thank you.
B001V5CIFI|3.0|SPOILERS...........................<br /><br />Emma Thompson did indeed create a colorful gem of insanity, love, and the rottenest children you have EVER seen! I don't think they were truly bad, I think they were grief stricken and trying the best way they knew how to get their father to really see them and be there for them, which he wouldn't. They were essentially abandoned by both parents. It was funny and a little sad and a little ridiculous here and there, but also satisfying when the kids got their \\"lessons.\\" I also loved the snow scenes. Everything was so garish and gaudy and over the top and then just calm and pure white and beautiful.<br /><br />The two things I did not like and don't think they were especially good for small children to see was, first off, the treatment of the baby. Her siblings put her in danger in the kitchen and even more so during the \\"lesson.\\" In the bonus features, Thompson said they originally showed the \\"baby\\" IN the boiling soup pot, but thought better of it. I should hope so! Additionally, it never showed the baby being cared for. Nanny came to the children in the morning, paying no attention to the baby, and a few minutes later, after the onset of the \\"lesson,\\" turned and walked away, leaving the baby in the crib all day as well, without even looking at her, let alone changing and feeding her.Additionally the baby was \\"lessonized.\\" Why is the baby being punished?  This is all abusive behavior.<br /><br />The other thing that bugged was the \\"solution\\" Simon came up with to save Chrissie. We are supposed to care that he cared about his sister, but a person of lower power and class ranking went, told to go? in her place. It is hardly admirable or compassionate to put the \\"help,\\" the servant or the slave in a position you don't want to be in, because it is better for you.<br /><br />But all in all, not bad!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put the trilogy down.  First time in a while that I took the time to read 3 books in one week.
1468161660|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to buy this book at first because I thought a book emphasizing on poetry can't be that interesting. I am so glad I purchased this book, it's definately on top of my favorites now.<br /><br />I totally LOVED this book. It is a given that this book is a love story but the author gives you so much more with the detail given to each character. It was nice that she didn't just focus on the two main characters but every character had their own story in a way. And the poetry itself takes this book to another level.
B0086700CM|5.0|My goodness you can get tired of running your nevers never mind jumping and leaping. This is a beautifully made apt and the graphics are just great. Everyone who has a kindle in our family has this..that's a lot of kindles (including relatives). This is very entertaining and you will find yourself engaged from the start. I would purchase from the seller again and encourge others to start runnning lol or those things will get you. Very clever and fun.
0743277708|5.0|I was introduced to this title in a graduate Children's Lit course; the book is absolutely beautiful...Please consider checking out the audio version (Audible.com) read by Ralph Cosham...you will love the read/listen and be forever altered/transported, as this is one truly special piece of writing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Now this is entertaining, that calming music and the graphics are very nice. I like the fact that you have several levels and within the levels you have stages to complete before passing that level, unless you ask for a hint (like I did)but it will cost you. If you skip a level which I refuse to do you can just go to the next and hope that ones easy to figure out. I would definately buy from the seller. If they make more types like this then I'm there! Anyone will like this apt.
B0073U2F2Q|3.0|This is one of those movies that do a fairly acceptable job of telling the story of an alien invasion that brings the end of the world as we know it. The concept of the alien is creative and the end of the movie provides hope for humanity. As has been pointed out, the movie follows the adventures of four young people who are visiting Moscow, Russia for assorted reasons.<br /><br />Their agendas are violently disrupted when aliens attack several major cities on earth including Moscow. From then on it becomes the story of just trying to stay alive while all around you are dying. The special effects are fairly good and there are some clever plot twists as the story develops. I was amused by the early warning devices they created and started wearing to warm them of the approach of the invisible aliens.<br /><br />One thing I can say about the movie is it did provide some degree of resolution and left the viewer with hope that humanity might still survive. This is likely a film only the sci-fi buff will tolerate and I can't say for sure how many times they will want to see it more than once. You may want to rent this before you buy.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|working just like I would expect it too. Does everything I need. I don't have any complaints. Except! I'm 55 and this still shows up my bad ability to spell and type. Why does'nt this app. fix that! OK, a little humor,- very little.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I hear all these people saying how great this app is but I wouldn't know I can't download it but I really want to :(
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app' s practical presentation.  It covers all my uses for the devise so I can see exactly how much power I have available for a particular task.
0345509617|4.0|J.W. Rinzler's The Making of Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back isn't so much a book about the making as much as it is a collection of primary materials and documentation about the making, including copious interviews, photos, and scans of original documents. It's great for dedicated Star Wars fans and is (and will be) a treasure for historians. However, the text itself is pretty dry and is mostly a straight retelling of what happened, when and where. Rinzler uses primary interviews to tell much of the story and it's great to hear the voices of the men and women involved in making the movie.<br /><br />However, because the book tries to be a comprehensive chronological retelling, that means it jumps around and never really presents a single narrative. For example, a chapter might discuss problems filming in Norway, McQuarrie's conceptual drawings, and the latest rewrite of the script. This makes it difficult to follow something like the development of the story because it's all spread out.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a treasure and valuable resource, but it's not necessarily the book you're looking for if you just want to learn more about the making of the film. If you just want to learn about the development of the script and story, I highly recommend [[ASIN:0978465237 The Secret History of Star Wars]], which presents a story almost as exciting as the films themselves. I recommend reading that book first, and then reading Rinzler's book to transport yourself back in history to see the making itself.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm listening to book 3 and so far what I get out of it is a broken and confusing storyline. I think all the sex is taken away from what could be enjoyable reading. Some of the issues in the books are kinda crazy. For the lead male in my opinion he is just what he is and him trying to change for the lead female is something to look at. He's a trouble man Yes but I think the writer should have wrote more about the healing process Idk why would he be in therapy that long and not get nothing out of it. As far as the lead female I think she's the one that needs to really get the therapy because so far it seems to me that even though she can't be what she say he needs and can't do the things he's into she sure as Hell in my opinion keeps trying to bring that side back!! I'm intrigued to say the least and after I'm finished listening to the last book maybe i'll be able to write a better review. Till then I must say that the relationship is Hellas weird but he not the only one with the issues she has a lot more in my opinion..
B00881VLCE|4.0|Really like the puzzles and you don't have to worry about lost pieces. Very easy to play and a lot of choices to choose from. Such as how many pieces to whether or not you want to turn the pieces.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|This movie was given an extremely limited release (16 screens nationwide).  I am a fan of period pieces and found this one to very good.  The entire cast gave amazing performances.  This film is a hidden gem that I will end up buying.
B000KE5JNE|5.0|Everything about Vanity Fair was wonderfully executed...the characters...the music...the attention to detail!  I have watched this several times over the years, and I enjoy it just the same as my very first viewing.  Whoever chose the music was spot on.  It helps carry the storyline, and every score punctuates the mood of the scene in the most superb way.  I can't imagine how anyone would be disappointed with this piece.  It is truly a pleasure, and I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love that the game has so many options for adults as well as for kids. We enjoy playing the variety of games together.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Was 5 stars when you were allowed 5g free of music. Then they back pedal and want to make you pay? Such a shame, immediately took the app off.  I won't pay money for that.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it! i have not bought any in game cash. it's  definitely something for a little play a few times a day over an extended time. it's. amazing how much you'll accomplish over time.
B003B5M0PO|4.0|I really wanted to read this after watching the movie and wasn't disappointed as often is the case when you have either watched the movie or read the book first.  It is a nice easy read especially for all the horse fans out there.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|While not a terrible book, I did not find this novel to be that entertaining. I held off reading it amidst the movie hype as I figured it was a mindcandy sort of read and I really did not want yet another cheap paperback book cluttering my already cluttered bookshelves. However, with the Kindle app on my tablet I was willing to give it a go in a digital format (which was actually very well done).<br /><br />The Hunger Games was not a bad book, but it's really not a good book either. Set in a dystopic future where the country has fallen apart and been rebuilt as a totalitarian state, the book has an interesting setting. 'The Capitol,' which sounds like West Hollywood relocated to Denver or Aspen, demands a tribute of children from subject territories and then makes the kids fight each other to the death.<br /><br />It's an interesting setting, but is executed with clunky prose and a  predictable plot. From the first few pages, you have a pretty good idea which characters will survive and that the status quo will be shaken up in the process. I suppose the target market is young adults in their tween years, so perhaps they will enjoyful the color descriptions of the capitol and the \\"Running Man\\" premise which Collins has repackaged for children. The melodramatic moments of death and separation seemed forced and campy to me, but a younger audience might appreciate it more.<br /><br />Parents should feel okay in letting their children read this. I did not find the book to be that disturbing even though it is about... well, children murdering each other. But if parents are looking to give their children a taste of good, accessible science fiction tales, I would recommend Ender's Game or The Giver far more than these books. Now those are classics.<br /><br />I would give this book 2.5 stars if I could. But I can't quite bring myself to give it three. If you're interested in this book, read it now. Because in a few years (after the sequels have been made into movies) no one will really care anymore. Mass market fiction at it's best and worst.will really care anymore. Mass market fiction at it's best and worst.
B008H5J510|5.0|I love her music (cds & music videos). The movie was SUPER, it made me wish I was able to see a whole concert! I loved the documentry parts also, I learned alot about her. She is great. I am now looking foward to the dvd 3d release, so I can watch it agian anytime. I am hoping that they will release a dvd of the full concert.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie shows true love of two young teens. It is really engaging. Shows trust and true spirit in your district. Peeta and Gale head to head fighting for the ones they love or have loved for a long time and that person is Katniss. Thrown into the arena for district 12 , Katniss and Peeta set out to fight for the death. They are given training and prepare for the arena. Many die and many survive. This movie was my favorite movie ever. It was exactly like the book whcih you do not get too often due to the fact of the directors. But, this director nailed it.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|This is a basic hidden object game. You can pinch to zoom which would be necessary on a phone. The graphics are pretty low resolution so on a tablet it can be difficult to identify small items.<br /><br />A big negative for me was the constant Facebook popups. The game puts up an annoying box every time you pass a level so you can share with friends. In reality they are just using you to spam your friend's news feeds with free advertising.<br /><br />They put effort into a story for the game, but it is not memorable and you'll likely forget it within 10 minutes.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|THE STYLE OF HAVING EACH CHAPTER ABOUT A PARTICULAR CHARACTER SEEMED TO BREAK THE STORY LINE UP, IT WAS NOT A SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM CHAPTER TO CHAPTER.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Excellent book(Fifty Shades Trilogy). Please go out and purchase it today. You won't be able to put it down. There's action, love, sorry all in one book. A bite much in regards to all the sex scenes but I truly enjoy the action of the book and a beautiful love story. E.L. James I will be watching and waiting for your next top best seller. Way to go.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|The software has a few problems. But entertains and challenges very well.<br />I'd love a new version of this game.

B008ASLNN2|5.0|fast paced and enjoyable. Too bad it's not instant viewing.  Had to wait for it to download, but it's good that I can watch over two days.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All three of the fifty shades book are totally awesome. I am almost done with the third one and think I'm gonna read them all again lol
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was all it was touted to be.  I couldn't put it down.  Spell binding.  Intriging.  Didn't want to put it down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very fun game to play and I recommend it for anyone who is looking for something to entertain yourself with.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Ignore the bad reviews who say it is not like the original in idea.  The original also blamed the manufacturers for ruining the enviroment this version just added more content so the message hasn't changed it was just expanded on.  I believe in a free market with companies taking responsibilities for cleaning up their messes.<br /><br />That aside movie was phenomenal and the songs were great.  Kids and adults can love this movie.  I have not seen a kids movie this great in a long time.  And it gives a positive message that we with all the conviences we have in life we need to make sure we take care of the things that can't replaced.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is one of my favorites! I like the challenge and get excited every time I complete a puzzle. I also like that they add new levels frequently. If you like a good puzzle game this one is for you!
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I would rate this movie among the three worst movies I have ever seen - along with \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" and \\"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, Her Lover.\\"  Although each movie is of a quite different genre, they all have one thing in common: they all see life as a god-forsaken pit of meaningless despair.  If that is a theme that rings your bell, then these movies are for you.  If not, you may want to save your time and money and avoid them.<br /><br />The story begins with Liam Neeson's character (John Ottway) who is a contract killer of any wolf that happens to wander onto the company property around an oil rig which sits at the end of the world somewhere in arctic Alaska.  We get the impression that wolves may be predators but John Ottway is higher on the food-chain - supposedly.  Nonetheless, Ottway is a severely depressed personality mourning his wife (girlfriend?) who left him.<br /><br />The night-life at this company town - this hole of depression amidst a sea of isolation - leaves much to be desired.  There is drunkenness and brawling; it is a coarse and vulgar existence.  And things only go downhill from there.<br /><br />Next, crew members from the oil rig board a plane to escape for some R & R.  The flight, however, seems cursed from the outset as it takes off in a blizzard.  Taking off in a blizzard seems rather unlikely, but it is only one of several implausible twists we shall consider shortly.  Right after taking off, they then encounter severe turbulence which elicits a long stream of profanity laden curses and dialogue.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the flight does temporarily level off and it seems for a while to go well.  But that escape into momentary slumber is rudely lost as the plane inexplicably freezes up and then pitches uncontrollably towards the earth.  It crashes in a frozen tundra.  That, however, is but the beginning of a struggle for survival by men, most of whom have serious character flaws.  This struggle pits them not only against the elements, but also against a relentless foe of mythical proportions - a pack of wolves led by an alpha-male of almost human cunning and monstrous ferocity.<br /><br />The movie has many implausible twists in it.  But, be not deceived; this movie is not intended to be taken literally.  It is seemingly intended by the writers and director (and actors ?) to be a parable, a commentary about life and its meaning, or lack thereof.  And it is a grizzly parable at that.<br /><br />In this parable, the wolves are undoubtedly meant to represent life (or is it death?) in a most cynical way.  Life on the oil rig is itself a cold, dreary ordeal - endless drilling (\\"boring\\") into a dark meaningless abyss, punctuated only by escapes into vulgarity, brawling, drunkenness, and fornication.<br /><br />The movie, however, makes clear that trying to escape this dreary existence called life is itself an exercise in futility as we are then dropped into the cold realization that life/death, like a ravenous wolf, chases us through a world that is devoid of meaning and of God... or at least if there is a god, he torments us with a sick and cynical sense of humor, abandoning us in the end to the wolves' lair.  Be assured, the wolves do not in the least represent Francis Thompson's \\"Hound of Heaven\\", maybe His opposite, but not the Hound.<br /><br />And here is the unmistakable message: life/death in this worldview relentlessly hunts us down, voraciously consumes us, and in the end leaves us as some crapped-out pile of canine excrement.  You see, in the end, even an alpha-predator eventually gets consumed and dumped by the ultimate predator - life/death itself.<br /><br />I was surprised to see Liam Neeson in such a role and such a movie.  In the past, I have appreciated much of his work which has often contained a testament to the nobility of the human struggle.  This movie offers no such nobility.  Perhaps it reflects his despair at the loss of his wife not that long ago in a skiing accident.  Whatever the case, one hopes for more from him and the roles he plays in the future.<br /><br />It will be a long time before I watch another movie written or directed by Joe Carnahan.  I will leave him to wallow in his nihilism - which, of course, requires some incredibly implausible twists in logic and in worldview in order to be maintained. Thanks, Joe, but no thanks.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is pretty fun. I love Ice Age, so this game is so fun for me. I just wish there was an easier way to earn acorns. So much fun!!
B007PBL9KC|5.0|I listen to it all the time and love the two lead singers.  Duets are back!!!!  Little talks is a fantastic song.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was thrilled with this book's refreshingly new plot and good character development. It is one of those books where the characters are not really likeable, but you want to see what they do next--perhaps thinking they will become more accountable or likeable. The author does a great job at keeping you attached to the characters. Additionally, the plot is refreshingly different from the many \\"ho-hum-villian/hero\\" plots that are current in print. HOWEVER, I like my books to have a beginning, middle, and end. This has only the first two. I don't think I'll spoil anything for readers by saying that the ending is very unsatisfying. It's as if the author developed a very good story and then couldn't decide how to end it, so he just quit writing. Perhaps it was some sort of philosophical comment on the state of humanity and relationships, but the ending made me wish I had bought another book.
0307454568|3.0|With over 1,600 review, there is not much to say. E. Jacobs has already written a perfect review.<br />I'll just add that I did not think everything was tied up at the end - there are still as few teasers out there with a few potential romances, possibly finding Salander's sister, etc.<br />I was bored and frustrated with the middle and the meandering about Sapo and the background of some of the characters. I flipped pages and skimmed a lot because those sections did not seem to add anything. Also Berger's temporary change of job, added a little to the theme of corruption at all levels and places, but did not really contribute to the main plot.<br />I am even bored a little by Blomkvist's last trist. Was it really necessary to have him jump in bed with yet another woman?<br />I agree that it needed editing and perhaps it would have been edited better if Larsson had lived.<br />However, I want more - there are still challenges for Salander - but it won't happen.<br />Wonderful set of books.
B004CQ5GMU|1.0|I purchased this Thursday May 26, 2011 and as of Tuesday, August 7, 2012, it is dead.  The device itself feels flimsy, but for a few months it worked fine.  In its last legs, it started to have issues, like \\"Format F:\\" issues.  That's never a good sign.  Now, when prompted to be formatted, Windows is unable to do.

B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't decide if I wanted to read this book because of the reviews I've read and heard about about. So I decided to read it anyways. Once I started I could t put it down. It sucked me it and I couldn't get enough.  So I have to say I liked it and maybe a little to much.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Great album! Her Rock-Pop sound is great. I am a huge fan. I am a KatyCat :) &lt;3 If you are a fan of this album, make sure to purchase her 2nd studio album and also download some of her unreleased stuff. I am happy she changed her genre from the Christian Rock to Pop/rock.

B008KP6ENE|5.0|By first appearances this is a simple platformer. However, it stands out for its rich, creatively styled, colorfully cute graphics, sound effects, and music. Other game options are a plus like character customization and mini games. No ingame purchases, thankfully! Lighting in some levels (submarine)  are particularly fun. Difficulty is a easy, but the journey is no less enjoyable.  All in all, Paper Monsters is a delight!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Sorry, couldn't get into this book. Wanted to give it a chance since so many people like it, but I did not. No plot, too far fetched and smutty.

B004LE7PCM|5.0|A comprehensive collection of Sherlock Holmes's adventures, this guarantees hours of enjoyment. What can one say about the most famous fictional  detective in history? Conan Doyle is reputed to have based Holmes on Joseph Bell, one of his lecturers at university. He was also fascinated by the real life French detective Ashton Wolfe. Both these gentlemen were great exponents of the art of deduction. Dr Watson, the friend and chronicler of Sherlock, is almost certainly a projection of Conan Doyle himself! Interestingly Conan Doyle, a medical doctor, found great difficulty in finding a publisher for his stories. He finally sold full rights for his first Sherlock Holmes novel \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" for the princely sum of 25 guineas (about $45)!! Although the dialogue and the language are archaic the fascination and entertainment of these stories, the novels in particular, are timeless. The depiction of Victorian London with its carriages and fogs and all the other well written cameos of those life and times are masterly. Conan Doyle grew tired of his own hero and tried to kill him off together with his antagonist Professor  Moriarty (The Last Case),but this caused such a public uproar that he was forced to resuscitate Sherlock, and to this day the Sherlock Holmes Museum still exists at 221b Baker Street in London.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|What a fun book to read. It was so much fun to see life thru Rose's eyes. Such and innocent girl ready to live life 'on the edge,' and what a way to get started...come home and find your overbearing, controlling momma has been murdered and knowing you were the intended target.  It only gets better from there.  I looked forward every night to reading this book, it put a smile on my face and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  Highly recommend this great read!

B004G606K8|5.0|so yes, at first glance, this appears nothing more than a \\"lord of the rings' knock off. in a way, i suppose it may be considered as such, but when you really get into the story and character interaction and development, you realize it is a story unto itself.<br />  dragons of autumn twilight is my go to book. i must have read it at least a dozen times, and been happy to do so, each and every. i have read the entire series (not including all the offshoots that derived from the original series) and i can honestly say, hands down (whatever that means)that this is my favorite series of books. thats all.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Addictive game that gets one to think outside the box.  The only complaint I have is selection of levels.  once a new stage is opened the player is prompted to select a level.  However the levels are predetermined and often do not match the preview.  Fun game though and oddly a learning opportunity.

1451627297|5.0|I've read Mr. King since I was in my preteens (am knocking at 50's door now) and this was a great read.<br />I don't care if he's writing about clowns, hotels, domes, time travel, cars, good verses evil, cell phones, proms or the Florida Keys I love them all.<br />Loved the mention of old characters and places.<br />In this novel alone he introduced whole new generations to Muddy Waters, The Rolling Stones (how many teens & 20's will be looking up Honky Tonk Women)? How many will want to learn about Kennedy and the 1940's, 50's and 60's.<br />My 7 year old granddaughter asked me what I was reading and it started an hour long conversation on civil rights and who Kennedy was, (she knew who the Rolling Stones were I'm ashamed to say, but oh well I love music)<br />This book reminded me of what I need to teach my grandbabies.<br /><br />It will take you back in time lol, and I wish it would of been longer (hate for a book to end)<br /><br />So buy it and get a cup of tea and sit back for a ride, I think I'll go read IT again.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Muy buena película, en blue ray se ve la raja lo recomiendo, además de la copia en digital y DVD, la recomiendo. Excelente segunda parte.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing. with over 100 games you can be entrtaned for life. you should get it. get it get it get it!!!!!!!
006621131X|5.0|I have to admit I'm only vaguely aware of Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe's individual bodies of work and I've never been to NYC so I'm not sure why I was compelled to read this book.  I'm certainly glad I did.  I just finished it and I feel like having a good cry.  I think what is so amazing to me is I felt like I was living it right along with her in the retelling of her early years with Robert in NYC through his death in the late 1980's.  I can also see how it took so long to write this story.  Thank you, Patti.
B00377V6J2|5.0|If you really like the blues, these 2 artists are the best.  Great album.  Really glad I got it.  Nice to have it with CD & DVD.
B002WGZ1L8|5.0|I received this book  and couldn't believe the good condition it was in.  I felt so good reading this classic.  It was so old and the pages  so thick.  Loved it .. Thank you
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I read many reviews before buying this set. I love this combo and would recommend this to everyone regardless of being a Beatle fan, McCartney and Wings or Solo era.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The review of the book did not reflect the actual contain. This book is not approprate for all ages. It is disturbing to see teens reading this book. It is truly an adult book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was curious after reading the complete contrast in reviews. Now I am a total nerd and have read Twilight (hipster talk coming soon)before it was really big. I mean when the first book was originally published kind of deal and then Kristen Stewart ruined what little integrity the mediocre book had with her expressionless face. I also read a lot of fan fiction. Again. Nerd.<br /><br />So I heard about this when it was first published as being a Twilight fan fiction that she basically replaced the names and a few minor details. You will notice the similarities right away. But it takes an \\"Agony in Pink\\" (don't google that just trust me when I say gross BDSM stuff) kind of turn so the author can get her rocks off with this.<br /><br />It is a twilight fan fiction, published as original work, as a fetish novel.<br /><br />There. I saved you 30 dollars and dashed hopes and dreams. This is the reason no one reads anymore. Either crap like this keeps getting published or it leave you with no exercising your brain or using your imagination.<br /><br />Another thing hand fed to the masses under the ridiculous notion that this is literature.<br /><br />Grab Great Expectations. Its free. Its a classic. It will actually challenge your mind and open a world to you. Better thst then this horse crap.<br /><br />I mean just think. You once could have read this exact story for free but now you are paying some overly pompous and self proclaimed housewife your hard earned money in a recession for a fan fiction you could have read online for free.<br /><br />If you still buy it then I hope you aren't voting in the election this year. I would hate to have the fate of my socioeconomic life in your incapable hands.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I enjoy all the creatures. i was bummed when my tiger family just disappeared one day. also it does freeze up quite often when i go visit friends.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a VERY good book to read. The whole trilogy is very exciting and a book you can't put down.
B00589AYWW|5.0|Tuchman always seems able to put the reader in touch with the times, the events, and the people involved.  Very thorough, and amazingly readable.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really great! The only thing I would add is a list of running apps and how much battery they are taking
1423136802|5.0|My son read this series and couldn't get enough of it. I would recommend the Percy Jackson series to anyone who enjoys diving into a thrilling adventure. I even picked up the Lightning Thief and was surprised by how much I liked it.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This is a great way to stay organized and create notes for you to remember and review. I have only barely started using this and have realezed that there is so much more that I haven't even touched on yet.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book is interesting and u don't want to stop the series. Hence the reason I read the series in 5 days :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was my first download with my Kindle, which I have owned for many months. That's how busy I am in retirement!!! The process was much easie than I had feared, and once I caught on to the touch system, I enjoyed doing it. I'll finish the book in time, and will look forward to reading many more on my Kindle.
B002SSBD6W|3.0|I am a vegetarian since birth and never had any temptation to eat meat. But if there was ever a doubt in my mind then reading this book would have made it disappear. Often a book is a reflection of it's writer's opinion and not much else. But Jonathan Foer has done a good job of presenting facts as well as his opinions, which are well separated for the readers to make a fair judgement on the subject of this book - the plight of animals slaughtered for food. The tortures that animals suffer - and due to the industrialization of this activity, almost all animals consumed are tortured - is ghastly, senseless and undoubtedly undeserved. It can only be hoped that this book, and broadly, the subject matter generates a lot of attention and contributes toward ending the suffering of animals. Kudos to Jonathan Foer for his work.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|What a wonderful book!! I laughed, cried, and just thoroughly enjoyed this entire story from beginning to end. It will be on the top of my all time \\"favorite books\\" list! I could relate to the character in the story, as well as the struggles she was going through- so perhaps that's why I loved it so much?? Anyone who has everyday stresses, or is at a fork in the road of where to turn in life and needs to get away mentally- this is your book! :D
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I read this book on a whim after seeing the movie trailer and was blown away by how fantastic this book is. Its basically a snapshot of one person's life through various reincarnations and offers us a glipmse of our potential future. Its not a novel to be read lightly though, there's a lot of serious material in this book. If you like a good science fiction novel, you will enjoy this book.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, I couldn't put it down, and I can't wait to read the next! This book was a fun read, with added suspense, and a complicated love story. You really get to know the characters, and I enjoyed seeing their riveting lives through their eyes. This book had me wishing fun \\"characters\\" like this really existed! :D  I also really enjoyed the snippets of history the author tapped into as well. If you want your imagination to sour, and just have fun reading a wonderful tale, I would get this book!!
B000OVLIQU|5.0|Fantastic book about Geoff's time working with The Beatles and afterwards. Extremely well written and insightful, I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone interested in The Beatles or recording techniques of the 60s. I didn't want the book to end.
0792163710|5.0|I was fishing in flat creek,the legendary dry fly stream that flows  through the elk refuge and around the fringes of Jackson Hole Wyoming ....the water was clear and cold..the sky was surreal blue..a september day to kill for,73 degrees,the grand tetons, distant, but watching..all i lacked was the entity i could not have..fish..cut throat trout,i could'nt buy a fish let alone catch one so i called it quits,walked back to the car with the intention of tucking tail and driving back to the hotel in Jackson Hole.A mile or two down the road,I stopped at the infamous Flat Creek Grocery,a catch all little place,which means \\"it's there if you can find it\\",hunting suppies,fishing supplies,hunters and fisherman buying supplies,coffee,a complete line of Spam and Vienna Sausage,bread,beer.all sizes of Miracle Whip,mustard and ketshup,soft drinks,hard drinks and water,the reason I was a cash paying customer in the first place..went to the appropriate freezer and grabbed an ice cold plastic bottle of Grand Teton Water,I was parched.Paid for the H2O,and was on my way,when I noticed the label on the water bottle had a pic of the town in \\"Shane\\" the movie.The little Hollywood town sat stark and small with the Grand Teton Mountains looming ominously in the black and white backgtound of the black and white still that had come to inhabit the label and was in fact the logo for Grand Teton Spring Water.It was an interesting image because I realized I was not far from where the town had been..Found myself at Jackson Hole's Welcome Center,standing front and center of the Info/Help desk..the guy man-ing the I/H desk said\\"no you're not crazy...people from all over the world hunt up the \\"Shane Sites\\",thousands a year.He gave me directions to a site or two,,,I was off,,,found the town site..a pile of weathered boards was all that was left....did'nt realize how close to the road it was...the graveyard was on a little hill over looking the town site...the ranch was located in an area called \\"Mormon's Row\\"..nothing remained...Somehow I was glad I was able to find the sites.it was detective-ey,kind of spooky,and sad.when you consider all those people who made \\"Shane\\" are gone..Flew home,hell-bent on buying and watching \\"Shane\\"...got my copy of \\"Shane\\" from Amazon...here's the ten reasons \\"Shane\\" is the best Western ever made<br />1)Cinematograohy..every frame framed by the master George Stevens..The Grand Teton's,the realism of the sets,every shot is perfect<br />2)The script and story,one of the best adaptations of a book ever penned by Hollywoodians(\\"a gun is only as good as the person who carries it\\")(Shane,\\"the difference between you and me is I know I've outlived my time\\")(Shane,I guess I'm overdue for a new life myself\\")<br />3)Direction-Stevens sat at the helm of a legendary movie production that infected movie goers with a kind of sublimity that hardy ever happens..it's unforgeting,a value only a few directors have ever been able to send as a side effect of their film.<br />4)The editing---the final scene is argueably the best edited action sequence in the history of cinema.<br />5)The acting--the best<br />6)The Grand Tetons and the Teton Valley---as much a star in this flick as Alan Ladd<br />7)Alan Ladd--too short to be Shane,not actor enough to be Shane(they wanted Gary Cooper for the part)not enough presence to be Shane,the worst possible selection for the portrayl of Shane---well what can you say-Ladd no matter how miscast... was and became Shane.<br />8)the dog---how did they get him to jump in  that stream...as he and DeWilda chased Shane.<br />9)Ben Johnson---probably the real Shane if the truth was known<br />10)The magic and beauty of it all,\\"Shane: translates it's message on aging,regret and the complexities of living and life as powerfully today as it did in 1950.
0375507256|3.0|So I just finished this book and I'm not really sure what just happened... A collection of short, vaguely connected fiction? I feel like Mitchell had a lot of existential ideas and hoped the reader would draw his conclusions, and I guess I can see what he meant, but for the most part the stories went... nowhere? By themselves they were all interesting, well thought out stories, but really their connections to each other were minuscule threads that didn't serve any real purpose... any explanation about the matching birthmarks? No. And speculative science fiction turned into fantasy when certain characters prophesied events... I just don't understand. I just don't.<br /><br />The only reason this is getting three stars is because the individual stories themselves are written impeccably and so interesting and mesmerizing (my favorite being Sonmi's interview, least favorite being Zachry's based on language alone) that couldn't put them down. But once we reversed and went back in time I found it difficult to keep going just because I knew the stories were going absolutely nowhere, I just wanted to know what happened to the characters.<br /><br />Overall I wouldn't recommend this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|excellent app. much better than other ones I've downloaded. love the hour by hour update and the radar. highly recommended
B004XNG4DC|5.0|If you haven't read it, what are you doing with your life? ;) Really though, the books are great! If you've seen (and enjoyed) the tv adaption and want some extras about the characters and just general story background, then pick this up! You'll be glad you did.
B007VT6QSI|3.0|This album is really a catch 22 for me. Bieber is obviously going for a more mature sound, which was obvious when the first single \\"Boyfriend\\" smashed the radio airwaves. Unlike Chris Brown, who also started his career at a young age, Justin Bieber's label/managers/A&R's have pushed a family friendly, kid-like, teeny bopper pop image for him, it's going to take a long time for that to wear off for many listeners such as myself. I have not been a fan of his previous work, but when I heard \\"Boyfriend\\", it was just too good to pass up, so I gave this album a listen. It was really cool to hear a more mature sound coming from him, but I feel like some of the biggest pitfalls here were the guest features: In particular, Drake & Nicki Minaj. Last year we just got through hearing Justin sing \\"never say never\\" with jaden smith, and now he's got a record with Drake saying \\"Girl, I just wanna put it on you...\\". When Drake comes in on the track it fits him, aside from the production being weak. The record with Nicki Minaj sounds very kidz bop-esque, and then comes in talking about the bitches that are hating on her success. Again...disjointed for me. Much of the production is not hard hitting enough for the sound he's going for this time around, with maybe the exception of \\"Boyfriend\\" & \\"As Long As You Love Me\\". With all that being said, it's a decent pop album overall. His vocals have improved, and he's trying a few new things there. \\"Die In Your Arms\\" is pretty impressive, gotta say. Definitely a \\"try before you buy\\" record, unless you're a die hard fan.<br /><br />Highlights: As Long As You Love Me (great verse from Big Sean, solid vocals/lyrics also) Boyfriend (Bieber pulls off a slick rap over some thumpin 808s for the verses on this one) Die In Your Arms (solid ballad, with an obvious nod to the youthful MJ) Out of Town Girl (dope beat, solid vibe remniscient of N'Sync's better work), All Around The World (the chorus really makes it shine)<br /><br />Worth checking out.
0307742997|2.0|I found the plot dull, the characters lacked any heart or soul, and the setting was never described to me.  Perhaps if you are already familiar with the various regions of Norway then the setting of the story might be more appealing, but for me it was vacant and cold.  I have precious little time to read for fun and found that I regretted picking this recommendation up.  It reads more like a movie script than a novel.  My recommendation is to wait for the movie.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I LOVE PERRY THE PLATYPUS!<br />I also love the not-so-evil Doofenshmirtz who I think cares about Perry a little :)
B0054R6BFM|1.0|I just couldn't get into this book.  I read the summary and reviews, thought I would enjoy it.  It just wasn't for me.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I love this series!  I was introduced to it by a colleague and ending up devouring the series slowly but surely with my middle school, special education students.  I learned so much by watching this incredible documentary, as did my students.  I ended up purchasing this series for my mother as a gift, as she is an avid appreciator of nature's wonders.  I still remember and reference what I learned through this series.  I think this collection is a must for households and classrooms alike.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Being an adoptive woman, I could totally relate.  The book had me in tears (good tears)!
0143116371|1.0|Many, many, many of e subjects are either ridiculous or just plain badly dressed. I was hoping for some more inspiration but instead I am presented with a few really good looks and many ugly ones. I even took the time to mark the pages that I liked and in total there were about 28 and that's only with really lax criteria. I can appreciate the idea and the concept but most of the folks are just really badly dressed.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Ok, this book I really did love!  I would take lunch at work, when normally I don't, just to read.  I couldn't wait to find time to devote to the book.  I recommended it to my manager at work and she agreed... book is great!
B000WN4MVS|4.0|Anton gets STAR BILLING and over Toni Collette etc...but I am not into this genre of movies but I'll look at anything with Anton and Toni Collette, they are the best, been following their careers for so many years..\\"Muriel's Wedding\\" for Toni.I looked up on IMDB why Toni would do this movie & the answer is ,the director/producer? of her Showtime series did this movie..so maybe as a favor because it's not a huge part that Toni has...Anton Yelchin is the star along with Anton & Colin Farrell, who play the next door neighbor/vampire...really liked it..<br /><br />Cheers..<br />TC(NYC)
B007N6NGYG|5.0|My 4 year old son loves this game and I do too! He's crazy about everything to do with trains. The controls are easy, just touch the points/signals/etc. you want to change and it changes. The graphics are good too.<br />The difficulty goes up as you go further and there's definitely enough of a challenge for adults to play this too.
B000NQDC1A|4.0|I was happy to find this available on CD, and reasonably priced. I have had the original EMI box set w/booklet for years, but playing a specific track was problematic due to the many, many tracks on the LP, narrow and narrowly separated. Seller is also 1st rate.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was really fun to read a book that didn't just follow the usual format.  I loved the twists it presented and I loved the end, whch reminded me of the French book: Le Chat.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun game. It gets boring if you play it a lot, but in general it is a fun game- worth the money- oh wait... its freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
B008OOYALE|5.0|i played tiny monster before and this game is much like it except this ones better because u can have nieghbores and such. this game has about the same level graphics. but over all this ones the best
B003P8BB5W|5.0|very satisified with my product and the price made it even sweeter.very easy to upload and love how i can use cloud and it's already on my phone and computer.

B008COD5UI|1.0|Words cannot describe this horrifyingly mediocre, lackluster piece of cinema. Through the entire movie, I cracked a grin maybe twice, and the story itself was just godawful. There was no character development, or story. Imagine a 'party circlejerk' for a crude description. I consider this a waste of my time and money, I'm just glad I didn't see it in theaters.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is pretty fun. It is a fun thing to do to pass time if your waiting for something or bored.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i was hesitant to reading this book. i didnt want to fall into it. i heard it was like porn and just wasnt interested. a friend loaned this book to me, so i decided to give it a try. i am completely obsessed. i cant put the book down. ive read 2 books in less than a week and i will start the 3rd book tonight. i hope they make a movie!!!!
034580404X|5.0|Not just a sexually explicit book, but a humorous, intriguing mystery. Opens a door to a world that is not widely understood.
B0086DBE62|5.0|This movie both fascinated and entertained me. The stilts scenes were awesome. I love Julia Roberts in both drama and comedy and this movie was just another display of her talent(s). I would recommend this to everyone!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was a good read. You can tell that James is not a seasoned author. If I read JEEZE one more time I'm going to die! May wanna read Bared to You by Silvia Day
B001152TL6|3.0|a lot of fans say this is his best film but i disagree.it was pretty boring and i kept falling asleep.i had to stop it multiple times and watch some later.maybe some others see something i didn't but i say its too boring and strung out.it might be one of those goofy things people who desperately want to be different and weird like.
B004K00NMG|5.0|My daughter grew up with this video, and we purchased it to watch and remember. I think this would be an incredible story if done with real people and CG graphics. They've redone King Kong 5 times now (why?), and now Total Recall has been redone. Why not make a movie out of the cartoon movies that prior to CG wouldn't have been what they could be today?<br />A great love story that makes you hope that the whole world \\"can have a change of heart.\\"
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I love thus app. its a great time waster. except it seems that you cant get past level 40 in kindle simply because it does not have a fully shut of sound mode. but still its a great app.
B008764ZQ4|4.0|Believe it or not, my husband and I saw the movie at a drive-in theater!  It rocked!  Didn't know all those actors could sing.  Had to get the soundtrack, and wasn't disappointed.  I listen to it on my MP3 player often!
B0086700CM|5.0|its awseome i think everyone would like it and should play it alot its soooo fun i love it alot
B008MEM24S|5.0|thanks for the game its great fun.  some of the mazes are difficult for my 9 year old but he has me to help him
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|An entertaining, suspenseful novel. I enjoyed reading it and found it much better in terms of realism than CJ LYON's books
0307454568|5.0|My husband loved it and he wishes the author was alive to write another one. I myself just finished the first book so I'm not feeling bad yet lol
B003DPKCNY|2.0|I was really interested in seeing this film because of the list of great actors and they did an alright job....I guess. But, the story line failed to keep my attention and I became bored very quickly.  I don't recommend spending the money to buy the video.  Wish it had been for rent instead.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have to say I really love this app!  it gives you every bit of information you could possibly want  concerning the battery health of your particular device.  I consider this is 1 of the most useful apps I have in my collection!
0790744295|5.0|This movie is awesome and who would have though of leslie nielsen playing the part of a bad guy burying the other guy ted danson up to his head in the sand as the tide washes up to carry him out to sea. Like I say great and awesome movie!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|After all I had heard about this summers romantic trilogy that everyone will read, I was pleasantly surprised that I could not put it down. I read all three books in a row and there is not much fiction that can follow that up!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I am for want of a better word an middle aged sci fi geek. Being 44 I was nine when Star Wars came out and like many others my age I have kept my love of that movie burning ever since. So I think you will understand when I say that if this movie had come out when I was nine, it would have been my Star Wars. I can think of no higher praise.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is now one of my fav books. So glad I found it. A must read for children of the 80's and beyond.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Many crashes and force closures and bugs after update.  Removes old app as well. Still a fun game but loses stars for these issues.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|This is simply a cheap, plastic backing for the Kindle Fire with an even cheaper flap to cover the Fire's display. The groove in the backing meant to be used as an insertion point for the flap so that the entire apparatus can be used as a stand is so shallow that the flap pops out and the Kindle falls over when the screen is touched. If you're right handed you'll find that the elastic strap is on the wrong end of the backing if you want to slip your fingers under it to hold the Kindle in your left hand while reading.<br /><br />This is a product that looks cheap and feels cheap and whose cost is way out of line. Its lack of quality reflects poorly upon Amazon for carrying it and more so upon Marware for offering what is little more than the result of a rush to market in an attempt to cash in on the Kindle's popularity.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Unique approach to a mystery story.  Good character development.  It is a little slow to get moving, but worth the wait.
B002PKZER2|4.0|Great Motorhead CD. If you like Motorhead, you'll need to add this to your collection. However, I actually like the 'World Is Yours' even better. This good. 'World' is even better. So get both
0345803485|1.0|Holy crap/shit/cow/hell this book is so horrifically awful it offends me that it is a raging best seller.  I am appalled that intelligent, educated, professional women raved about it to the extent that I felt compelled to read it.  I not only wish I could get my money back from the purchase of this juvenile drivel, but also the moments of my life that I wasted reading the first quarter of the book.  It was at that point I could no longer continue, for if the one-dimensional Ana had addressed her inner goddess once more, I would have flung my kindle at the wall.  And if the first one wasn't bad enough, the publishers released two more?  What a criminal waste of paper!<br /><br />My only hope is that when the \\"author\\" graduates from high school she will marry a handsome 27-year-old billionaire who will keep her tied up long enough that she won't be able to write any more of this putrid garbage.
0553801473|1.0|Jordan, whoops I mean Martin, has trailed off and obviously turned his attention to the cash cow that this series has become.  This is clear from the difference between the last two books and the first 3.  With all the money and distractions coming in from the HBO show, I have no confidence that this series will wrap up anytime soon or with any closure.  I won't buy another book in this series and I won't watch another episde of the HBO show.  Splitting the hardcover into two more books was the last straw.  This guy will be dead before he finishes the series.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|When it was first released it was fun and I enjoyed it a lot, but ever since the updates started all the darn things does is crash. I put off giving it a one because it once worked and I enjoyed it and still have some hope it will get better.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Thanks! Downloaded and printed my DOC within a minute! I didn't even have to hunt for my printer... everything was ready to go! I do a lot of side work and document storage on my Fire and this will save me many steps between printing......
B005LAIHSG|1.0|This movie is terrible. Not worth the $15 theater price and definitely not worth whatever they are charging for it on here. You couldn't pay me to see that movie again. But I quite liked Mirror Mirror-- buy that instead
B007V2UGPE|5.0|time just flies as you play. fantastic graphics. great gameplay justvwish you didn't have to buy powerups. but just like most other games- you do
B00785P2QC|5.0|I was looking for some kind of tycoon game and I saw this and after a while you will make lots of money and teletype lots of stuff and get trucks androut them all over you will like this game
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use this app every day. Really love the modes of use breakdown and the pleasant graphic of the battery. This took time and skill and I highly recommend paying the two bucks if you find it as useful as I do!
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Very good and advisable to buy. Thank you very much. The movie is very good. It is necessary to see her!
B004LWZW8I|2.0|Immortals is a movie that is physically quite a looker.  Very stylish visuals and neat visual touches.  Unfortunately, this is where the good stuff begins and ends.  You see, this movie is BORING.  It appears that the screenwriters were so convinced of their writing abilities that they thought that we would want to see their characters standing around talking for a couple of hours and doing little else.<br /><br />Having characters talking a lot is no problem if those characters are interesting and have interesting things to talk about, but that's just it: the storyline was not particularly interesting and the characters were one dimensional, soulless, and bland; combine a bunch of characters that fit that description in the same movie and you essentially have a sleep inducing experience. There was not one character in the whole movie worth caring about not even the main protagonist.  It was a pure case of viewer indifference on my part; didn't care if the good guy or the bad guy won or lost, lived or died.  I kept checking my clock as I waited. . . .and waited. . .and waited for something big to happen in this film and it never did.<br /><br />The movie should have been about a half hour shorter, and instead of taking itself so seriously, it should have been a stylish, wall-to-wall action and visual extravaganza.  Considering that this film was produced by some of the same guys who did \\"300,\\" this is what many viewers very likely were expecting; an action packed popcorn movie.
034580404X|5.0|I was excited when I ordered the trilogy and I then kept looking for it in the mail. I was behind the crown because many of my friends had already read them and was talking about the chapters.<br />Once I got the trilogy in the mail, I sat down on my day off and began reading. Within five days ( I work full time and I go to college fulltime) therefore the five days are legit, and this is how long it took to read the set.<br />I could not put it down and it moved me, to say the least..<br />I would recommend this trilogy to anyone!!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others. The author did a great job of holding my interest and the characters were well developed.
0385738773|1.0|While the first book of this series was good and had potential to go in a great direction, Dashner blew it with the next two books. While nothing of significance happens in the second book (seriously, it was crap like Thomas runs into a sewer to find a short cut just to run back out.  Did he not think zombies were in the sewer!), Dashner tries to explain all the answers in the third book.  Many reviews claim that the author answered many of the questions and tied up loose ends - I call bull!.<br /><br />While he thought he may have explained why the trials took place, who wicked was and how to find a cure, he did not answer any of these questions in a logical way.  No matter how many times Dashner says the word variable or explains the trials were to map out the munie's minds, it just didn't make sense.  In what universe is that how you find a cure for a disease?!<br /><br />It was almost like Dashner was trying to make sense of the answers himself by over explaining how they needed variables to map out the brain!  it doesn't even explain how it maps out the brain, are there trackers inside the munie's heads? Who knows, but if I had to read the word \\"variable\\" one more time I would have microwaved the book.  Get a thesaurus!<br /><br />Aside from the horribly drawn out plot, the characters were obnoxious.  Their made language was unrealistic and they continued with the back and forth sarcasm through all three books.  I get that teenage boys are sarcastic and playful but instead of working out problems, every idea a character had in the book another character would have a sarcastic comment as to why he idea would not work.  It continued on with none of the characters maturing.  Usually in dystopian books the characters mature, growing up to fast through their experiences.  Not these kids, no character development!
B008602KQI|4.0|This was a great action packed film, I would not recommend watching this film if you are under age of 12 without adult supervision. It is a very creative movie but some topics could be sensitive to people of younger ages (Child Gladiatorial Combat). This film was made after the Hunger Games Trilogy and follows the story closely but leaves some important detail out, it would also be a spoiler if you have not read the second book. Over all I liked the movie and recommend you watch it but just keep a open mind.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great on my kindle fire and comes in handy every day.  lt can handle multiple locations too - which is helpful when I travel.
B001E7EONC|5.0|This is an excellent, fast paced movie with numerous twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.  The big surprise here is Jason Stathom, who gives a convincing performance as a conflicted & conscientious con who just wants to take care of his family.  Well worth your time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game for the whole family. I love how you have to work to get to the next game.
B0086700CM|5.0|addicted to this game its awesome..... love it .....and I love the fact that its free!....I would reccomend this game to anyone
B007PTJOV0|4.0|if u like super Mario u will like this.,! so get it ok than rate it now plz.,! I hope u like it
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Didn't realize this one was number 2.  Don't think it effects the book if u read it out of order.  It not as great as I thought it would be. Cause if it was it would be done.  I'm stuck 33% Done.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Like all the other reviewers I was really getting into the game until it started to cost 4.99 for 3 minutes of game play.
B00873GRU4|5.0|First fiction book I've read in years and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was there, in the down deep, from about 20 pages in. I probably missed something that explained the title name! The only disappointment was that it had to end, but as I understand it, the author is penning the continuation of the story at present - I hope so!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book in the trilogy was better than the first.  The book focused more on the characters and that added a little more drama.  The ending made me want to buy the third book in the series.
B0082A3JHQ|5.0|One of his last performances and he was getting better and better on his guitar playing .  If he only lived longer like jeff beck who knows( no pun intended) where he would have taken us with his music and guitar virtuosity.  You need to listen to this concert if you are a guitar player.  There is no one to replace him so we have to be happy that we have the recordings and videos that he left behind.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I play this. my 8 yr old nephew loves it. challenging enough for the whole family. and Perry is a bonus
B001AITGWE|3.0|I do like the characters he chooses to portray. Movie was good-he was good in it. Troubled. Like a lot of his roles. Ok for a night in.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I saw this show in NJ when she came around in 2011. I have seen many, many top acts and this one blew us away. It was by far the best I have ever saw, her voice is flawless, the stage was beautiful, she looked amazing and the band is beyond talented.  I am so glad I bought this DVD to replay the best show ever!  My kids are even mesmerized by the talent as we watch this.
B0034G4P26|4.0|I thought this movie was great. A lot of funny things that are slipped into the movie that you have to think about and laugh. Me and my son loved it. Very entertaining.
B004LWZW88|5.0|yes product was new. its for little older kids. havent used digital copy version yet. hopefully it works. otherwise fast ship and everything ok
B007J4T2G8|2.0|i am surprised how popular this book has become. the writing is mediocre. the character development is weak. i found the main female character to be quite annoying after a few chapters. the inner goddess especially...overused and juvenile. the book is predictable and full of cliches. not recommended.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|great game. ' very challenging.  money well spent. I am hoping there will be an upgrade to this game also
B0086700CM|3.0|its a really fun game but it runs kinda slowly on the kindle fire but other than that. its great
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was great for the most part. However, I was very disappointed in the ending. It really left me feeling that the book was not resolved.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|its so fun I could play on day long but I can pass level 14 or 15 anybody who passed it let me no everybody should get this game
B007JRU2UK|5.0|I came to this movie with the expectation of simple joy at watching George Clooney at his craft. Instead, I was blown away at how good of an actor he really is.  I loved it and will purchase the movie for my own collection. It was not a predictable plot despite what you may think.  I would recommend it to anyone, George-fan or not.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is fun to play and I like to play it while I eat bacon... never fry bacon naked
B0063IH60K|4.0|Haven't wasted this much time since solitare on Windows 95. I would pay for an ad-free version. Sometimes the basic things are best.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was a great app its sooo fun although some games are hard so don't get fussy if u don't win the time u try a game
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An insightful look at the (planned) doomsday aftermath and written so well that it moves right along, I think Wool would make a great screenplay. Lets hope Hugh Howey sends this one to Hollywood.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|This was great! Suzanne Collins has a wonderful charismatic way of writing that really draws you into her novel. I laughed and cried and really got in touch with the characters. I just wanted more, more, more.
034580404X|5.0|This purchase was totally worth it!  Product was reasonably priced and arrived quickly.  The book were a very easy read that sucked you in and kept your attention not wanting to put the book down .
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First let me start by saying I'm no grammar teacher, my review is purely based on the story line and characters. I LOVE this series. Yes there is sex but these books are about so much more than hot steamy sex. There is an amazing story line. The book has suspense, love, a little brutality. I laughed, cried, was irritated, I felt every possible emotion. Book two and three are my favorite. Don't start until you have time to do NOTHING. You  will eat, and sleep these books. Go for it..
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Just sit back and enjoy.  If you want to be picky and a movie snob, you're sure to find something wrong.  Google \\"suspension of disbelief\\" before watching this and it'll help a lot.  I thought it was great !!!
B004P7CMZA|5.0|Works perfectly & no damage, when received. Product is satisfactory & same as advertised. I would definately do business with them, again
B005MMYHFK|5.0|This show is right up there with game of thrones.<br />Don't listen to the other 3 reviewers they are being very analytic. Just checkout the first episode and you will be instantly hooked!
B0083DCA86|5.0|Finally re-issued is \\"Tough it out\\", the second studio album by leading British AOR/melodic rock band \\"FM\\" originally released in 1989. Both \\"Tough it out\\" and its predecessor \\"Indiscreet\\" have been just released by \\"Rock Candry\\" records both featuring re-mastered versions of the original albums plus extra tracks.<br /><br />\\"Tough it out\\" in particular features the original 11-track album plus four additional songs along with an extended version. In retrospect \\"Tough it out\\" proved a huge leap ahead for the band artistically. Not so much in terms of songwriting (as \\"FM\\" offered first class AOR from day one) but in terms of arrangements. There is an essence of extravaganza that emanates from \\"Tough it out\\" be it the much heavier distorted guitars, the bigger drumming or the intense vocal performances, the second \\"FM\\" album finds the band turning everything to eleven while retaining the same great songwriting of their debut.<br /><br />The line up also remained unchanged since their debut  featuring singer-mastermind Steve Overland, guitarist Chris Overland, bassist Merv Goldsworthy, drummer Pete Jupp and keyboardist Didge Digital. From the infectious chorus of the opening title-track you known you are into the best `80s rock feast you probably missed upon its release, followed by the superb \\"Bad Luck\\", the hit \\"Someday you'll come running\\", \\"Burning my heart down\\" and \\"The Dream that Died\\". Overall the \\"Rock Candy\\" reissue does perfect justice to a gem of a rock album of the late `80s that should never have gone out of print.
B00782O7NE|5.0|The Artist is a film based in the late 1920's when silent films were the rage. The king of Silent Films accidentally discovers a girl who eventually becomes the STAR of the new \\"talkies\\" and her big film comes out when his last talkie does...on the day the stock market crashes. Her career is on..his is out. I strongly advise you get this Blu-ray DVD and make your popcorn and watch this excellent film. It moves well, and the story is gripping at times, and sad at others. So well scripted, excellently acted and directed as well. Don't miss \\"The Artist\\"...if  you do...shame on you for six weeks!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've tried several weather apps and this one won out for ease of use and volume of information it contains. There was another AccuWeather one supplied by Samsung but it went to the mobile website instead of being self contained and I had to keep updating it manually. This one has it all and a nice looking interface - not a fan of the alternate color themes though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Many people say it's horribly written, but in my opinion its a fun and sexy read. I love to read and I don't expect every book to be The Perfect Book. I really enjoyed it. I like the flirty, sexy language and the emails Grey and Ana send eachother. Just relax, ease up on today's authors and take it for what it's worth. It's super hot ;)
B002R1SS86|5.0|I normally don't write reviews. However, I am supprised that there are only two reviews about this wonderful movie. Both my husband and I love this movie, good actors with nice actions. You MUST see it!
B007R41E8O|5.0|really enjoyed! there are too many games that are either too much seek and find and not enough puzzle or are too short and easy.this was just right! :)))
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|While I liked this book - classic Stephen King - I will never purchase another Kindle book that is not lendable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the variety is great. although a few more games with brain stimulation would be nice. but I still have more games to unlock
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved the book. I don't read a lot of books. This one really opened my eyes to what happends in war.
1419703692|5.0|I'm usually impartial to books that delve into the conceptual and production process of a film, but this book is a remarkable exception. The length is faily comprehensive, with each section devoted to key aspects of each film (writing, casting, visual effects, etc). Surprisingly, I wound up reading the whole thing in one sitting--it was really hard to put down. It's written very well, but the beautiful photographs are what make this book worth picking up multiple times. By the end of the book, it became apparent that Christopher Nolan and his team were not only dedicated to making a terrific series of Batman films, but terrific films in general. This book cost a little more than $40 at the bookstore, but regardless of how much money you need to put down, it's well-worth the asking price.
0321647440|1.0|This could be really wonderful but the book version with DVD is not updated to the version of Aperture 3 that is currently on the market.  You have to download other pictures for DVD from the website....look at updates tab in amazon for particulars.  Worse than that though is that some of the adjustments and tabs that are in the book are not in the current version of aperture 3.  I am ignorant enough about some of these adjustments that sometimes I have no Idea what other adjustment to look for to accomplish the same effect.  I have made it through about half of the book.  I can't fault the author too much though.  I am new to the AppleWorld and am having issues keeping up with the fast updates myself... e.g.. I am still reading my book about OSX Lion and am now using Mountain Lion  :)  This would be a great teaching tool if it were sync'd with the software.<br /><br />Update on August 22, 2012... got to page 384 and binding on book popped and split open almost half way down the book...
0345803485|1.0|So we lower our already dumbed down standards once more.  Now fan fiction is apparently acceptable as legitimate as long as you change the names.  How much farther is this going to go?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have not been able to read a book in a long time. Never found one that I would enjoy, until now. I found this book to be entertaining and a non-stop page turner. I could not put it down and if I had to put it down, I could now wait to pick it back up.

B0063B2BNE|5.0|Another great season of Bones.  Interesting to see how Bones handled pregnancy, relationship, work. . . Like the rest of us, it's not easy. Can't wait for season 8.
0143038419|2.0|My problems with Eat Pray Love were numerous. One thing that really bugged me was the way that Gilbert would expound on certain things (be they her own personal morals, the correct way to deal with *greedy and manipulative* third-worlders, or the nature of her sisters personality etc) as though her statements were fact. She would not back-up her statements in anyway, or couch them in language such as \\"I believe\\" or \\"in my experience\\" or \\"I found\\", instead, she just wrote as though everything she said was gospel truth without any need to justify herself. (because indeed all poverty-stricken people are out to get as much money as they can, and this is selfish, and they really should understand her position better - she has to report back to her friends!) That really bothered me.  Gilbert was on Oprah a while back and was treated with such reverence it bordered on being creepily worshipful. She should not be so ignorant as to think that her opinion is the only one and she is self-centered and self-righteous to not express her opinions as opinions but as factual conclusions.
B002B2RY6I|1.0|What happened to his rock sound? This sounds like folk junk. Can't believe the reviews on here? I seriously love Nutini but this is junk.
0345803507|5.0|I read all three books in less than 3 days. I refused to put it down at home or at work in my spare time. I didn't go to sleep till around 6:30am for the past 2 nights. I loved these books way more than I thought they would. Yes they are completely erotic, but the story line is what caught my eye. A gorgeous controlling guy, with a dark, mournful past, and a young woman who has never knew what intimacy, as well as true love, could feel like come together without knowing what they are getting themselves into. It's lustful, shocking, sorrowful, and intense.<br />They found something in each other and it was intriguing to read how exactly it was going to end. You will become completely consumed with knowing each character, especially Mr. Christian Grey.<br />To my surprise, I wouldn't have wanted it to end any differently.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. Trust me, you won't put it down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I had heard about it from my students and friends.. and finally got to read it.<br />The suspense and story line were excellent.. a very enjoyable experience.
0545265355|5.0|This book set is very entertaining.  It's a page turner.  Much better than the movie as always.  Great current distopian novel with relevant social commentary.
0670022950|4.0|In The Better Angels of Our Nature, Mr. Pinker makes an exhaustively credible case for why violence has declined throughout recorded history. Accounting for natural human biases, his optimistic and scientific view of the available data shows that people, from one generation to the next, are learning to be better people. It's a common misconception that rates of violence have increased given what we see on the 24-hour news cycle, but in reality the opposite is true. So true in fact that the period since World War II has been dubbed \\"The Long Peace.\\"<br /><br />The examples and specific statistics given are fascinating and often surprising, but this is a long book. A dauntingly long book. And I can't help but wonder if Mr. Pinker should have made his point in half as many pages because his overall message is important, and certainly some brevity would have made Better Angles a more accessible read.
0762777931|5.0|Kris Carr writes with a relaxed, engaging style that really embodies her crazy-sexy spirit! This book was both informative and entertaining, not an easy mix to perfect! She opened my eyes to the realities of consuming animal products, particularly milk (or cow's mucus, as she so evocatively calls it!). This book is fun to read, but the information is important and potentially lifestyle-changing. If you are in the need for a change for the better (with respect to diet, exercise, vitality and purpose) then Kris Carr's book will not disappoint.

B0067EKY7M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It's never quite what you think it's going to be.  It's not really a romantic comedy.  It's not a movie preaching tolerance.  It's just a good movie about going forward with a dream no matter how crazy everyone tells you that dream is.  There's a nice message about faith in there.  Faith in yourself and faith in other things.  It's charming.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have not read a lot of Grisham and was captivated with the story. Read it in two sittings and looking forward to his next.
B007PS0X0W|5.0|Another great addition to the Underworld series of movies.  Action packed as usual and great special effects. Kate Beckinsale just seems to get better and better.
0307950689|2.0|I was one of the millions who read and enjoyed 'Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons', although I recognize their many (many!) flaws. They were good popcorn-fiction - junk food for my mind. This, however, was hideous. All I wanted was popcorn (it's not like I was expecting literary greatness), and I was in the mood for mindless entertainment, and what I got was the most awfully written, ridiculously plotted book I've read this year.<br />I feel that I should repeat and emphasize the point (much like DB needlessly repeats and emphasizes points) that I wasn't expecting great writing, just a \\"rollicking adventure\\" or a \\"swashbuckling good time\\" or whatever else the publishing pundits told me to expect. DB's writing was so bad, at a few points I actually burst out laughing. The average chapter length is 3.7 pages (these are the sorts of things you notice when the story is a piece of shit). Each chapter ended with some variation of \\"Langdon looked up in amazement. He knew now exactly what the clue meant\\", or \\"Malakh looked at the moon in awe. Only he knew the terror that was about to unfold\\" etc. Like a stupid, contrived mini-cliffhanger at the end of every 3.7 pages, and you knew that you had to go through the rotation (one chapter with Langdon, then Katherine, then ...) before you'd find out what it was that was so amazing/life-changing/about to alter the course of history forever. Of course, this style of writing can be used to great effect to generate tension - it is, after all, a novel of suspense. But when overused, it is frustrating and cheap. And the effect of this is compounded by the fact that I really didn't give a hoot about most of the characters (partly because they were so two-dimensional) because you only got to spend a few pages with them before moving on and so therefore had little time to connect.<br />I am also really quite puzzled as to why most of the reviews (newspaper, online etc) I've read are generally positive (\\"don't read it for the writing,but you won't be disapoointed by Dan Brown's latest bestseller!\\"). Well dammit, I am disappointed. Enough to be ridiculously angry and write a ridiculously long reveiew like this. I want blood!
0811876373|1.0|I am from Germany and I wanted to have a book with delicous recipes for american pops. But the only things I found in this book are cute idears to create a pop, but no recipes how to bake them or how to make your own decoration. All this products are convenience foods!

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This did not surprise me, the fact that I enjoyed this film.  I have been a fan of Chris Evans for a while now.  He is great in Push and The Losers.  I knew he could play this role and could carry this film.  He is amazing and the supporting players are equally good.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|\\"Still Alice\\" was recommended to me because I'm living with a loved one with dementia. The book was the most helpful I've read in helping me understand how a person might feel as their capacity to think and function fades away. I think it would also be helpful for the rest of us who sometimes wonder if it is our turn to go down the path of dementia as we age. I purchased my copy of the book for my Kindle and was able to then read it on my iphone, ipad and computer. This was great since it was a book that was hard to put aside.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|This is my second purchase of these items.  Most televisions made today DO NOT have an \\"Audio Out\\" feature other than optical.  I use a couple of devises that ONLY work with the analog audio out cables.  This item resolves any issues I've had.  The FiiO Digital to Analog Audio Converter works perfectly to resolve my issues.  As an owner of EIGHT flat screen TVs between two houses, this is the best way I've found to resolve the digital to analog problem.  GREAT product.
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|to use the sync and rating feature you have to use iTunes. Really, this app could become the very best out there if the iTunes needed to use the app to it's full potential would disappear. I use Media Monkey on my PC which works great for all MP3 players including iPods.

B00782O7IY|4.0|Based on how much I personally enjoyed it, I'd give \\"The Artist\\" three stars, but since the filmmakers went out on a limb to do something different and did it well, I have to give four stars.<br /><br />Before anyone starts flipping out that I am not raving about this story of silent movie matinee idol George Valentin's troubled transition to the sound era and calling it an instant classic: I watch and enjoy lots of black and white movies, lots of older movies, a fair number of silent movies and even my share of French movies. My disappointment does not stem from the film's lack of color, dialogue, spectacular special effects, explosions, car chases, syrupy romance, bathroom jokes, or breakneck pacing. I was not distressed by the aspect ratio. I get the homage the filmmakers were striving for.<br /><br />These are the things that hampered my enjoyment of \\"The Artist.\\" The plot's combination of \\"A Star Is Born\\" and \\"Singing In the Rain\\" seemed tired to me, except for the way it was reconciled at the end. Maybe I've seen those other movies too many times. If you're going to make a silent movie in 2011, that's fine with me, but come up with something that's not quite so patently lifted from other movies. You can do homage without quite such heavy-handed copying (see \\"Rango\\" for example). I found the pace slow by silent movie standards, especially during George's downward spiral. I often found myself thinking, \\"I got the point of that scene a while ago. Can we please move on?\\" It bugged me that Berenice Bejo, while delightful, did not for one moment convince me that she was an ambitious American starlet named Peppy Miller. French people say they can always spot Americans because we smile all the time. Bejo struck me as a very French woman doing her best impression of a brash, constantly smiling American.<br /><br />Even so, I think \\"The Artist\\" is well worth seeing for the whole family. The period detail, costumes and black and white photography are drop-dead gorgeous.I loved the soundtrack. The acting is quite good and the dog Uggy is darling. Amid what has become a cliche storyline (\\"A Star Is Born\\" has after all been done four times in the sound era, once under the title \\"What Price Hollywood?\\"), there is real and still-timely compassion for the title character whose fame, fortune, and sense of worth as an artist and entertainer have been pulled out from under him by changing technology and changing taste. I kept thinking of silent matinee idol John Gilbert, who descended into despair, alcoholism and early death when his style of acting went out with the advent of sound, especially when George says, \\"Nobody wants to hear me speak.\\" For kids (and probably some adults as well), \\"The Artist\\" has some valuable things to say about pride, friendship, and when it's time to give rugged individualism a rest.<br /><br />If \\"The Artist\\" starts a trend for making black-and-white silent movies again, I'm excited. This is a flawed but worthy start in reviving a beautiful, imagination-stimulating art form.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game the controls are much better than most games on kindle. I will definitely recommend this game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had seen many reviews on this and decided I would check it out. I would say it was a great choice in doing so. This book was amazing. Sad, funny, sweet. It was everything you could look for in a book and I loved it. I would highly recommend every one reads it. I plan to again. Amazinggg.
B003MC5N28|2.0|What might have been a decent book, was all killed in the end. I am not sure how anyone gave this book 5 stars. It does not seem like a completed book at all, the ending completely left you hanging. I thought at first that it was the first set in a trilogy, only to find out that the subsequent books are not actual follow-up books but rather books with seperate characters, plots and societies. How disappointing! Its like the author got bored with writing the book and decided to just end it.  Save yourself some time and skip this book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This Spider App is a very hablt forming game. It comes with many features,that you can choose from, very similar to the game that is on our pc.This game is not very easy to play and is quite challanging,and to be able to play this game on long road trips, or camping, or just at home,with out being tied to the pc, is a real plus on my Kindel Fire.........got to go play \\"spider\\".
1400052173|1.0|The first few chapters were interesting.  That being said, the rest was disturbing.  While the author and family propose that Johns Hopkins was responsible for Henrietta's suffering, nothing could be further from the truth.  The tumor that Henrietta developed was courtesy of her husband.  The suffering from previous infections, also courtesy of her husband, due to her refusing treatments.  Her children's neurosyphilis a result of both parents; their father's philandering and their mother's acceptance of it.  Henrietta received free treatment; while disturbing for many to read, it was standard at the time.  To suggest that her children be compensated is as disturbing as their ignorance which is painfully obvious.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book! Reveals more of why Fifty is the way he is. Less descriptive sex, more about how a person can overcome anything with the help of the love of the right person. This trilogy is great! Can't wait to read the last book and see all the pieces fall into place.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I like this game. If you like adventure games, this is a good one for you to play. Its good
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. The books had an original idea, good characters, twists to the story, and a satisfying ending. I highly recommend this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games could quite possibly be one of the best books I've ever read. The writing itself was brilliant, with a unique plot and characters that you fall in love with. Couldn't put this book down. Thank you to Suzanne Collins for a book that will keep you thinking, long after you finish it.

0786955570|1.0|I was excited about the idea of a D&D board game. It seemed like a natural next step, and there is so much rich story to work with, that all you need is a good game system under it and you are all set. Then Castle Raveloft demonstrated that even with a lot of the work already done for you, you can make a bad game. It's castle raveloft, but aside from a bit of flavor text, nothing supports the setting. It's based on D&D, but, aside from a few key words, very little of the flavor of that comes through either. A good game system helps tell the story, this just tells you when to roll a die. So, set all that aside and what is the game? Lay down a random tile, and a random monster, and then fight it with a simple dice roll-off. The tiles and monsters are random, the monsters movement is programmed, and there is no chance for players to use any group tactics.<br /><br />  We have board games at my house every friday night, with a dozen or more people, and have done so for ten years. We get board games, we understood the rules. I've been a D&D player since 1981, I get the D&D mindset. I got a group of people at a table who were interested in the game. We went over the rules and everyone said \\"maybe it's more interesting than it sounds, lets give it a shot\\". We played a few turns and the consensus was \\"why are we doing this?\\" We boxed it all back up and played something else. Every now and then someone pulls the box off the shelf and reads the rules, then they put it back. I ask them if they want it, but no one has taken it off my shelf. I completely can't understand the positive reviews here. Others have pointed out, Betrayal at House on the Hill does it much better, Descent does it better if you have time to play that one out. Talisman has less of a dungeon feel, but does swords and sorcery adventuring better. Tomb is a wild rush into the dungeon, with traps, doomed heros, scary monsters, and loot worth losing a cleric and a rogue to get. How this game gets a sequel is beyond me. I wouldn't even try that if you paid me, based on my experience with this game.ond me. I wouldn't even try that if you paid me, based on my experience with this game.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|\\"You can watch me torture an entire city and when you have truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's al Ghul's destiny... We will destroy Gotham and then, when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die.\\" Eight years after Batman defeated the Joker and Harvey Dent's anti-crime bills became law Gotham is almost crime free. Bruce Wayne has become a shut-in and the Batman hasn't been seen in as long. When a psychotic ex-prisoner named Bane appears in Gotham and threatens to destroy Batman and the city Bruce is left to make a difficult choice. I have liked every Batman movie that has been made (except Batman & Robin) and this most recent trilogy has been amazing. They have all been really rich in story and they feel like movies and not just comic-book movies. I said when THE DARK NIGHT came out that no movie can live up to the hype of that movie but that came as close as you could. That movie set the bar for the franchise to an almost unreachable height and no sequel can really compete with that movie...but this one came as close as you could. While not as psychotic as the Joker, Bane is a great companion villain to him and is more calculating then the Joker was. There are many sub-plots going on but the movie doesn't feel jumbled at all. I have to say for Nolan to end this the way he did shows huge guts and if the studio was smart this would be the end of the franchise. While the Tim Burton movies were fun and good the Nolan trilogy had much more substance and I really don't think that the Batman character can benefit from a new director and style. He said this is his final Batman and as much as I hate to say it this should be the final movie in the franchise as well. In Hollywood though its the money and not the quality that dictates what is made. Overall, a perfect conclusion to the trilogy. I give it an A.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Fun game, quick and easy to play and it deals with zombies, which is always great. Shipping was fast and the item was as described.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|but since I got this app I fall asleep within minutes! What I love the most about this app is that you can mix sounds. It's great!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I recommend this game, its so fun,  and addicting also.<br />It was worth the price too,  you'll get addicited to.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|\\"Everything will be alright in the end, if it's not alright then it's not yet the end.\\" A group of retired strangers all want to get away from everything and decide to book a stay at the luxurious Marigold Hotel in India. When they arrive they are very disappointed when they find out the brochure and pictures were not accurate. Little by little though they begin to become taken away by the charm of the city and the hotel. I have said that because of my job I watch just about everything weather I want to or not. This is a movie that I really had no desire to watch at all. Could have been because I'm only 33 and this is geared toward people twice my age but I really put off as long as I could. After watching it I have to admit how wrong I was. I was almost instantly grabbed by this and really ended up loving this movie. I'm not sure what it was but maybe like the run down hotel the movie had a certain charm that really grabbed me. The outstanding cast helped a lot too. I highly recommend this movie and I am still in shock at how much I enjoyed this one. One of the signs of a good movie is one you really enjoy after having being forced to watch it in the first place and this one passes that test. Overall, a great movie that really won me over. I give it a B+.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its nice having a bunch of different games in one and having goals, different prices to get more. makes you want to keep playing to get that next game
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it works the best ever I have seen yet<br />u have to get it all the other ones I got<br />was not that good so I think u should get it
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I absolutely love Rihanna's music! Especially on this cd where you can hear the maturity in her lyrics and the growth of her as an artist. I listen to this album on my way to work and it helps me to get ready for the day! This is by far her best work. I am ready for the next album to be released.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. Normally, movies based on video games end up being pretty bad, but that is not the case with Silent Hill. From my limited knowledge of the game, this movie follows the plot fairly well, there are some obvious differences (like the main lead being a woman instead of a man), but overall it's decently faithful, and that's a good thing! It succeeded in creating a suspensful, chilling atmosphere, and some of it was genuinely creepy and unnerving. The acting was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, in fact I'd say the acting was pretty good! I won't spoil what happens in the end, but I will say that I didn't care for it too much, it didn't seem like it offered enough closure, and it was a little confusing, but luckily this is not one of those cases where the ending makes or breaks the whole movie. I'd recommend this movie.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|The definition of fan used to be 'fanatic'.  I was never fanatic about the Star Trek television series.  But it was something I really enjoyed.  This Star Trek movie is really a prequel to the television series.  It tells a story that is entertaining and also shows how our beloved characters came to be the crew of the Starship Enterprise.<br /><br />The cast is excellent.<br />The visual images are gripping and awe inspiring.  Very true to all of the Star Trek movies.<br /><br />This prequel is a movie that I highly recommend.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|This is a great little greatest hits collection. I think it is a good showcase of his acoustic stuff. something about neil and an acoustic guitar, is magicial.<br /> It has my favorite song by him 'Southern Man', which Lynrd Sknrd dissed, in 'Sweet home alabama'. I love the song 'The damage done', for its anti drug message. Later songs like 'Like a huricane', lose there magic. still great collection.
B007SGM084|4.0|Not my usual reading material but very entertaining. I found the characters and the storyline compelling. The erotica was a bit overdone but never to the point of boredom.
B005544V6A|5.0|Best law show on TV hands down. Could not be happier with the writing of this show. So worth the watch.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book so much that as soon as I finished it on my Kindle I purchased a signed first edition to keep.  The plot was interesting, but what kept me enthralled was the imaginative world of magic the author created.  I work in the theatre, and the descriptions of the circus were shocking, inspiring, and enthralling.  I can't wait to see what Ms. Morgenstern comes up with next!
B004RC8NUQ|4.0|Natalie Portman does an excellent job.  Ashton (not my favorite actor) does a pretty good job.  The director walked a fine line in keeping this a comedy, but noting the serious emotions involved in romance.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the humorous situations presented to the characters and some of the realities of trying to have a 'No Strings Attached' physical relationship.<br /><br />If you like romantic comedies this should be in your collection.
0345803485|1.0|This book is for all the women who are either unfaithful perverts or who have husbands that are unable to please them. And the book was obviously written by an 8th grader. Shows the average intelligence  of people in this country to have a book like this as a top seller.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Very entertaining book; another great read by David Baldacci.  Many twists and turns to the plot.  Highly recommend this book and the author.
B008BQL77K|5.0|Seriously the best law show on TV. I am so glad I took a chance on this show. Great job USA nework!!
B006I0ZFMO|4.0|While I am eagerly awaiting OUAT to come out later this month on DVD (b-day present, hooray!), I have purchased four instant videos to tide me over, including the Shepherd (one of the best of the 'twisted fairy tales') and The Heart is a Lonely Hunter (Poor Sheriff Graham). Hopefully these will tide me over til the end of August (I must have watched them ten or eleven times). I like that it's not just a one time purchase, too.Once Upon a Time is well done (though early on some of the green screen effects were admittedly cheesy, they have improved), but with my love for fairy tales I can overlook some tech glitches when the acting is so good.
630542845X|5.0|There are many incredible reviews of this movie.  It is thought provoking to say the least.  It shows some of the darker sides of our minds and the contrasts this with the best that humans have to offer: love.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my mother.  At the end of the movie my mother was in tears.  I asked what she thought of the movie.  She said it was the saddest movie she had ever seen.  I explained it was my favorite movie of my entire life.<br /><br />The movie does have great sadness.  It needs this sadness to lift you up and let you soar.  See the movie with love in your heart.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy the game, seems to work well. It is a little different than the one on my home comouter.  But now I can play when I am traveling.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love my Kindle Fire and the lightweight case gives me the protection I need my device carry safely. I was able to easily return a sleeve that was purchased and returned. Sofe light and sturdy.
B001DF68MA|5.0|One very good purchase. It fits the bike well (mountain bike) and my son loves it. We are able to chat throughout the ride and he seats very comfortably!
B004Y12S9W|5.0|This connector works great and you can't beat the price.  So much cheaper than shopping at the Apple store and we haven't had a single problem with it.  I highly recommend this product.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|It does great at telling me my battery information on my Kindle Fire. Everything seems accurate and the color change option is just the fun little cherry on top.
0060245867|5.0|This book is a classic from my childhood, and I am so excited to share it with my little one. Even as I read it now, there is wisdom for adults and material to relate to (ie when I'm cleaning, one thing leads to another, childcare, etc).  Great story, and it is part of a series of similarly-messaged books (If You Give a Cat a Cupcake, etc). Depending upon your child's interests, you can select the topic most enticing and enjoy reading right along with them!
B0013FSL3E|4.0|I had never seen this movie, but friends recommended it.  So I purchased it and just watched it for the first time.<br /><br />The movie was great.  It was funny, and touching.  There is a message in the movie about the damage we are doing to the planet.  Sometimes I felt the message was over-done, but at other times it was perfect.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the story.  My recommendation is to watch the movie and enjoy it.  You can enjoy the movie without being wrapped up in the message. Or you can watch it with kids and talk about the message.  Either way you should enjoy this light hearted movie.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|Yes, this year, the group of people I spent the 4th of July with eventually agreed that this was the right selection for the night.  It was easy enough to rent it after setting up an account with Amazon's Video on Demand service just minutes before.  The picture and sound were pretty satisfying, but as I'm not a superfan of ID4, particulars about just how high-fidelity the picture and sound of the rental copy was will have to be sought in other reviews.  I will say that the image was sharp on the large-screen, high-definition, lcd screen we used to view the movie, and the sound through the 5.1 surround was quite detailed.  Hope that helps.
B000SEI230|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an awesome author!! I am never disappointed! He knows how to touch the heart and keep your attention! It is always hard to put his books down once you pick it up! Worth the purchase! Amazon has a great selection of books!

B004SIP6LS|5.0|I saw this movie when it originally came out, then recently decided to buy it for my dvd collection.  Watched it recently and was surprised that it was as funny years later as the original viewing.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|OfficeSuite Pro is the only Android office suite I can stand. All the others (and I've tried so many) are starved for basic features, prone to inevitable crashes, not well-planned and apparently programmed w/random keystrokes. OfficeSuite rarely crashes on me, it produces useable docs, and tech support actually answered my question in less than 24 hours. It isn't perfect, and then there's an extortionary $4.99 extra fonts package (nine font sets, four of which are Webdings and Wingdings--get a free Symbols apps instead). But it's decent enough, especially with no real competition. Now where's OpenOffice?
B000ECX0QU|5.0|The movie \\"Topaz\\" is an Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece.  My film library would be complete without this DVD.  Picture is excellent too.  Great purchase!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I luv the Bible its amazing and now I get to get it on kindle the Bible is my favorite book and doesn't spend money
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|This is very much of a \\"support the troops\\" type of picture, focusing on the military subculture as well as the families and what they suffer through when the husbands/fathers go on special missions. The ending parting lines get close to melodramatic at times but it works well enough, I suppose. The commando missions at times reminded me of the \\"Call of Duty\\" video games and it's no accident this was partly marketed through the \\"Battlefield 3\\" video game.<br /><br />Real Navy SEALS were used in this film though their names were obviously kept secret.<br />It was felt by some of the creators that the real deal was needed to properly portray them. Interesting that Tecumseh, an enemy of Americans, was quoted at the end of this film not so much for him being an enemy but he's unknown to most Americans. Still glad he came up.<br /><br />The budget for this film was $12M and it made a bit over $80M at the Box Office.<br /><br />ACTION SCENES: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B; WHEN WATCHED: early August 2012; OVERALL GRADE:  B to B plus.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|Won't  open on TouchPad running ICS.  Very disappointing that another port fails to come over to all Android platforms.  Hope Kindle owners enjoy it!
0345522478|5.0|I'm really glad someone suggested this book to me. It was such a pleasant read with characters you can't help but fall in love with! Atticus and his dog Oberon have great dialog back and forth that you can't help but smile and laugh out loud. The story has a nice build up and conclusion and you can't put it down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely awesome! there are no other words for this book...now unto book two. this is a book that leaves you wanting more!!Worth the money.
B005LAIGRS|2.0|What a boring movie.  The plot was average, the ending predictable and boring.  I'm very sad to say they wasted Denzel's and Reynold's talents on this.  There were so many pieces of this movie that were random and unexplained, and the whole plot - the thing about the list - was never really explained in detail.  It was all too simple.  I'm glad I used my free-Redbox-code on this, because it would have been a waste of money otherwise.
0679805273|5.0|Another great Dr. Seuss book!!  Makes a great graduation gift.  And that is exactly what I got it for.  Only problem was I waited to open the package until I was ready to give the gift.  The outer cover was really wrinkled and creased from the way it was packaged.  It was too late to return it or exchange it.  Booo!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love how each book out does the last. The story all in all is superb. Must keep reading. I was left with no unanswered questions. I am def in love with all things Fifty Shades.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|The only redeeming thing about this so called comedy was the cameo appearances from the original television cast.  Did not think this comedy was funny, unless laughing at horrible acting counts!
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|One of the best movies ever, but the disk was skatched. Bought one for my brother and it was skatched too. Took several cleanings to get them to work. Very disappointing. The movie itself is more than a classic; it is a \\"Unique\\" classic. Highly recommend it.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|I won't really go into detail since theres already quite a few reviews but this is definitely not your run of the mill post apocalypse movie. I would've been pretty into this movie with or without the vampires. I really wasn't sure what to expect but if you're in the mood for a darker more serious vampire film I would recommend this. Great music, better acting than I've seen in a lot of mainstream movies, and a story much more interesting than what I've come to expect in these types of movies.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was breathtaking and heartstopping. I love the plot, characters, and emotions of this book. It was a great way to wrap up the trilogy and really put my heart in a happy place.
0671646788|4.0|I absolutely recommend this book to anyone interested in embarking towards the achievement of BIG GOALS BIG THINGS and BIG DREAMS.  I read this book and a number of others numerous times over an 11 year period.  I even taught from it.  In fact I still reference it today. I embarked on an aggressive self development personal initiative and this book and about 4 others became part of my regular diet.  [[ASIN:1612930298 Think and Grow Rich]]- by Napoleon Hill, [[ASIN:0879800836 I Will]] by Ben Sweetland, [[ASIN:B0089FCVB4 GROW RICH WHILE YOU SLEEP]] which is actually available on Kindle, also by Ben Sweetland and [[ASIN:0671700758 Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life]], which I had to put down the first couple of times and then I couldn't put it down.  That one was by Dr. Maxwell Maltz.<br /><br />  The author introduces timeless, practical tips that use regularly.  I often pass some of the strategies on to students in classes I teach as well as to participants attending my workshops and keynote addresses.  For example, before I read this book over 20 years ago, I didn't realize that where one sat in a classroom could SIGNIFICANTLY influence her or his success.  This seemingly minor action (I call it \\"T formation\\" maybe he did too),  refers to sitting in the first 2 rows and up the middle.  Stop for a moment and think about the many ways that can make a difference to the LEARNER and to the PROFESSOR (or the facilitator, orator or lecturer.  Pause for a moment, think about it.  Dr. David Schwartz's ideas will stimulate more insights in you and from your experience and that, good reader is where the change begins.<br /><br />  Though it was written by a college professor the book actually has a conversational tone. Here it is over 20 years later and I can readily see how the authors tone inspired the tone with which I wrote my own book, [[ASIN:1453624996 If You Can't Calm the Waters Learn to Ride the Waves: How to Succeed in Turbulent Times]]. I am not certain that I hit the mark but I assure you that the reading in this book is straight forward. If you have reservations, visit the bookstore or library and skim.

0061353248|5.0|Dan Ariely is one of my favorite behavioral authors. His books have a quick pace, attack interesting topics, and always keep the readers interest. I've read his two books, as well as a few papers off his website. If you enjoy this book (or books like it), you should look to his website for free acess to many of the papers mentioned in his books. They are obviously more technical than presented in the book, but if you're interested in the topic you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book to anyone interested in behavioral economics, and even those with a general curiosity about the human psychosis.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am generally disappointed by the trilogy. Although the characters were well-defined and the base story line was good,  I found myself flipping through pages of the same sex acts to get to the resolution. This could have been One book rather than the three.
B007Z9QWVK|4.0|I have to say I was greatly surprised at this film.  Kudos to Madonna for making a stylish, interestingly filmed movie.  The photography is lovely and direction obviously professional - which again, I was very surprised to experience.  Not sure if Guy Ritchie was an influence.  The movie is paced well and the editing was perfect.  Very impressed!  I think Madonna has finally found her niche in the film industry!  I look forward to her next directorial project!
0060512806|5.0|Cryptonomicon is absorbing, even addictive, from the first page. Its length may intimidate many a prospective reader, of course, and the unsuspecting but courageous reader may well find to his or her delight or chagrin that the book creates other interests that must in turn be pursued for hundreds of pages more(for example, I have now ordered a biography of Alan Turing and may well get a couple of books on Enigma as a result of opening Stephenson's book). These are the kind of problems we may very well welcome. A great read.

0596009208|5.0|This book is by far the best programming book I have ever read.  The style is easily digestible even late at night, yet the content is very detailed and relevant.<br /><br />This is not a reference book; it is a practical learning guide that recognises that the mind doesn't like to read long boring chunks of text.<br /><br />I have come away from this book feeling like I have a much greater understanding of Java.  Best $30 or so I've ever spent on a book.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|AMAZING Adele's soulful voice performing live at the exquisite Royal Albert Hall in London accompanied by wonderful musicians on piano, guitars, drums and strings.<br /><br />Adele is engaging and witty when she tells what was happening in her life when she wrote most of the songs. She gives her ALL in the performance.<br /><br />And when your in your car you can listen to the same performance on CD with limited clapping and talking. Just the music...all 17 songs!<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who is captivated by Adele's amazing gift of voice.<br /><br />On the DVD there are a few swear words spoken by the nervous and excited Adelle.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was probably one the best books that I have ever read. It was unpredictable from the beginning to the end. At no point during the book could I predict was was coming next. I could not put this down due to how suspenseful it was.
0425263908|5.0|If you were a fan of 50 Shades of Grey you will be a fan of this book. It was an easy but entertaining book that I couldn't put down, I read it in 2 days. I am so excited to read the second book which i preordered. The ending made you wanting more. If your looking for a book that will entertain you without going to deep this is the one you should read next!
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I'm 29 and I don't see me rocking 30 years from now like these guys do. The filming is great, the animations are fun, and the music is incredible... well, it's Rush, playing Moving Pictures entirely 30 years after it's release, playing songs like Stick It Out, Subdivisions and Presto, just to name a few... and breaking your face while playing Working Man.<br />Well, I don't know why I wrote all this stuff, just the \\"It's Rush\\" was enough, at least for me.
0446573019|3.0|Unlike a lot of the reviewers, I didn't hate this book.  It was ok - not one of David Baldacci's finer works by a long shot, but a fairly entertaining read.  The problem with reading 2-3 books per month and having maybe 15 favorite authors is that you eventually run out of stuff to read.  Sometimes you have to take what you can get.  I do agree, however, that John Puller is a virtual clone of Jack Reacher.  Everything from their physical appearance and occupation to their intellect and family background is basically identical.  Even their names (they both go by their surnames) -- Reacher and Puller -- are similar.  It's hard to figure out why Mr. Baldacci would do something like this.  He's generally a very good writer and has had a number of excellent original storylines (see Camel Club).  Very strange.
B004HYHANK|4.0|This was a very good book. I started with this one because it was the first book in Sophie Hannah's Spilling series. This book was suspenseful and kept my interest throughout. I will definitely be continuing with the rest of the books in the series.

It is just scary to think that your gut feeling can be so correct, but others, even your family can't see it. very bizarre and the acting is so real.

0345803485|5.0|Aright, this book isn't perfectly crafted, intricately-plotted, dense literature.  50 Shades will never show up on Masterpiece Theatre.  However, it is an engaging (potentially addictive), light read.  I think it's simplistic, slightly adolescent style suits the story and adds to its charm.  Plus, it is the first volume of a trilogy, so some of the plot elements are there to set up the next book.<br /><br />Don't be afraid to try this book, because of bad or scary reviews.  First off, I didn't find it all that badly written.  As an English Lit. major and a bibliophile, I have read lots with which to compare it and I have read much worse.  Its main fault is its editing.  I found quite a few mechanical things that I would hope a good editor could catch.  And no - it's not the best writing out there.  If you want great, intelligent writing, try Dorothy L. Sayers.  If you want well-constructed, complicated romance, Jane Austen and Diana Gabaldon are there for you.  That said, I once tried to read a \\"romance novel\\" - you know, the Harlequin kind and I was so sickened by its awful quality that I rid myself of it, after suffering two chapters.  50 Shades is so much better than that!  Poor Ana does repeat herself, as many people have complained, but I just assumed all of that flushing and blushing and repeating simple phrases was James' reminder to us of Ana's inexperience.  As for the lip biting - it is part of the plot!  Lots of people have complained about the Briticisms in the text.  Yep - they are there.  However, as E.L. James is British is that really surprising?  Why shouldn't she leave her own mark on her novel?  Plus, the book is written from Ana's POV.  I know that I and some of my fellow English majors have had their own language changed a bit by being exposed to so much British English.  It makes sense for Ana to think and speak that way.<br /><br />Don't worry that this book will scandalize you with its graphic nature.  To be honest, I don't think there is much here that would shock most adults, even us Americans.  I am surprised that there are public libraries that won't collect it.  I don't think I would call it erotica, really.  Being no expert on BDSM, I think the D/s aspect here is pretty tame.  And really - this book is a romance between an inexperienced, young woman and a man who is into D/s relationships.  It explores that relationship more than it portrays hard core aspects of the lifestyle.  I guess if a reader has been the victim of abuse, he/she may want to skip this book, but more because the abuse in the back story than anything that happens in the current setting of the book.<br /><br />To be honest, I am not sure what all of the negative uproar concerning this book is about.  It doesn't hurt to broaden one's horizons.  Plus, it is fun to get all excited about things sometimes, and 50 Shades is a good excuse.  Remember when you were in middle school and couldn't wait to get your hands on Judy Blume's Forever or Miller's Tropic of Cancer?  It's still fun to have something to giggle about, with your girlfriends, even as a grown-up.  50 Shades is great summer reading and it's definitely worth the nine bucks to own it.
B005IY3DP2|4.0|OK, \\"Days are Forgotten\\" is my current #1 favorite.  It's pretty awesome and the strongest on the CD.  There are a number of other solid tunes which make it an overall good selection.  Very glad I bought the entire album as opposed to just a few tunes, and will check out more of Kasabian.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is great for the beach or a long plane ride.  Is it really very believable?  No, but it's so much fun you want to go along for the ride.  I enjoyed it much more than I expected to.  If you liked this type of story I recommend \\"Sister,\\" another thriller than is more thoughtful and better written.
B0063IH60K|5.0|; love playing solitare .it is really fun to play . who cares about the ads!  this app is really fun :-)
0761169253|5.0|This book is so packed with wonderful advice and good points that it almost makes me sad, it wasn't written 15 years ago when I first started drawing. I only just received it in the mail today but as soon as I opened it I couldn't put it down. It's very easy to read and has so many strong points. You will not regret buying this, it is going to be a major help to any creative person out there.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really should have known better about a book that has ever been associated with Twilight. Horrible. I onlyand finished itthe because I'd spentjust the moneyone but I had to force myself through it. The writing was poor, especially the dialogue. Neither character was likable. Was the story was seriously ridiculous. So glad I never have to read her say \\"oh my\\" again -_-.

0393061310|4.0|Seems to be a book everyone one should read, though I just love history.  But this is history told with a unique perspective, more concerned with the whys rather than just the whats.  Will cause you to rethink some of the ideas you've come to take as facts.
B005MHSELS|5.0|Had to catch up on season 4 before the 5th season began.  Cable provider skipped this episode and didn't want to watch out of order.  Gotta say, it's so easy to download episodes from Amazon and didn't have to deal with commercials.  All that aside,  Breaking Bad is the most riveting show on TV.  There's so much to talk about after each episode and it's a challenge to guess where things are headed, which is so different from the usual prime time fodder where one can predict a show's outcome 5 minutes in.

B002G1YPH0|2.0|The cooler seems to be doing the job.  I've had it running in a 95-degree room with no problems; much quieter than the stock fan on my Zambezi.  But the installation was awful.  The printed instructions were very poor.  Eventually I figured out that I had to take my motherboard out -- to install a cooling fan!  All they had to do was include four standoffs to fit the backplate already installed.  I would really have appreciated it -- my system is cramped, and major surgery always brings the risks of complications.  It took me two hours of fiddling around to figure it out and get the system back together and running.

In the meantime no more Kindle book purchases for me since I enjoy reading on my smartphone when in out of the way places.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
B002I0J5FG|4.0|I played these games years ago on the PS2.  I tend to want to replay stuff when it goes HD so I picked these up at a great price.  They happened to be offering 30 days of PS plus as well so that extended my plus membership.  It was a win for me.<br /><br />The games are pretty amazing, especially shadow of colossus.  I enjoy those huge boss battles.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I am still not sure what made me read the first two Fifty Shades.  I guess everyone I talked to was reading it and I wanted to find out what all the hype was about.  So I started....the first book I read in no time at all, and then the second, so I guess I thought I should read the third book in the Fifty Shades triology too!  If you loved the first two Fifty Shades books then you will certainly enjoy this.  Like the other two books, this is also an easy read - once you start you can't put it down.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I am bored at work and this app is the only thing keeping me from dying from boredom! It's awesome!
B006LSZECO|1.0|The writing was amateurish, the characters were ridiculous caricatures, and the last third of the book is a hurried, undeveloped, simplistic mess.<br /><br />I kept waiting for this book to get better, despite my gut instinct that I liked neither the main characters, nor the author's writing style.  Unfortunately, the \\"big surprise\\" really isn't that unexpected and every opportunity to develop this novel into a great read seemed to slip by.<br /><br />In all honesty, it felt like it was a non-edited version of a writer's workshop crime novel.  This cannot be what passes for good fiction today, right?<br /><br />I'd give it zero stars if I could.

B007P6VLRS|3.0|The Smashing Pumpkins nowadays seem like a good sequel to a great movie. The original was better, but the sequel is still pretty good. The bands previous releases from what is considered their \\"golden age\\" (the 1990s) are infamously known for being dominated by Billy Corgan's overdubs of James Iha's and D'arcy's parts. While this holds true for some releases, particularly the band's infamous Siamese Dream record, it's not 100% accurate. The band took on the recording of their masterpiece Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness as a propper band should. Everybody played on it and contributed to the recording sessions. The same goes for the Machina album, with James Iha even laying down the bass parts in addition to his guitar parts after D'arcy left during the recording process. Eventually the band dissolved after this and returned years later with Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlain recording the Zeitgeist album by themselves with Billy handling all guitar and bass duties in the studio and then hitting the road with an all new lineup.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2012. Billy Corgan has an all new lineup of the band and a brand new record.  Some may lament that this is not a \\"true\\" Smashing Pumpkins record. I can see where they are coming from, but I would disagree. Billy Corgan has always been the front man of the group, the primary lead guitarist and the primary songwriter. He IS The Smashing Pumpkins.  This new lineup sounds great and they've recorded this record as a whole group, which is pretty cool.  I'll be the first to admit I don't like it as much as their older material, but it is certainly a quality album with great songs.<br /><br />One can't help but to compare Oceania to the efforts of the past and I would say that it contains elements of the Adore-era sounds with Gish/Siamese Dream qualities to it as well. Oceania has plenty of heavy distortion driven guitar rock with synths and keyboards as well. It has it's loud and soft moments. A \\"best of both worlds\\" for things the Pumpkins have done in the past.  I prefer the band's previous Zeitgeist record over this, but Oceania is still great. New bassist Nicole really sticks out on this record with not just her bass guitar parts but also her beautiful vocals that meld with Billy's voice wonderfully. It's something that really sticks out in places and sounds great. New drummer Mike Byrne sounds great and is a fitting replacement for Chamberlain. He has a different style than Chamberlain and it works well. The guitars by Billy and Jeff Schroeder (who has been in the band since the Zeitgeist-era, but was not featured on the album) sound great, but that's to be expected and is no surprise! Billy also has some great keyboard and synth stuff on here too.<br /><br />I'll wrap it up here. If you're only a fan of the band's older material, good for you. Those classic albums are great and I enjoy them as much as you probably do. I even agree that they are better than this. However, this is still some great stuff here. If you diss it then you are really missing out. Give Oceania a shot!

B005LAIHPY|4.0|Lets be honest here, the movie is -well- dumb but not the way you might think. Because the studio wanted a wider audience, paying for tickets, they made a key mistake in the PG-13 rating gutting what could have been a really gritty and brutal flick. It had all the makings for a hard R rating but no. That's not what we got so the \\"bad guys\\" avoided killing people even when they posed a direct threat. It was very bizarre to say the least. The only recourse the director had was to show alien tech destroying human tech and that's the real gem of the movie.<br /><br />Dont get me wrong. The special effects are top notch and the surround sound is equally engaging. I cant wait to get this in my home theater! Just because the movie is dumb, and requires no thought, doesn't mean I didn't like it! I happen to like some \\"B\\" movies including \\"B\\" movie #1 \\"Battle: L.A.\\"! It set the standard for \\"B\\" movies in my eyes.<br /><br />This is more like one big audio/video demo from start to finish...
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|This is a live recording of Bowie & The Spiders touch-down on earth 10-20-72 at the Santa Monica Civic (LA's best venue EVER), and it is one of the sacred texts of Rock 'n Roll. I used to have it as a double LP on Swinging Pig, and played it till the grooves were flat. I was grateful to have it come out on CD, and there are a few editions of it, this one is probably the best. Mind you, the sound quality is not perfect, but it is a soundboard copy and as good as it gets for a bootleg. There is a nice level of audience response mixed in so the \\"live\\" feel is quite intact. It lacks the Beethoven \\"Ode to Joy\\" Intro that was on my Swinging Pig edition, and this is what people heard in the house, so I wish it was there. They've left most of the stage banter, including the surreal comments that precede \\"My Death\\" (\\"I'm playing to you on courtesy of a piece of palm tree....I asked for lobster tail and they gave me palm tree, a piece of palm tree\\"). There is a bit that goes on between Five Years and Space Oddity where Bowie asks a stage hand to bring him a pair of pliers, presumably to move a tuning peg or adjust a mike stand. He has a bit of a spat with the roadie and tells the guy to leave them, and then it fades into Space Oddity. However, what has been cut is Bowie's mocking remark to the exiting roadie after he tells the grunt to leave the pliers on stage: \\"Hey, I got my (bleep)together man (grumbles)\\" and THEN the strumming starts. Why they would cut this delightful 3 seconds befuddles me, unless it is because this is an edit of a (KMET?) radio broadcast.<br /><br />The flaws in this show are very few: a really flat note from Trevor Bolder, probably, as they hit the final cadence of Five Years, and maybe Bowie gets a bit winded near the end. But this show is about the abundance of rapture and perfection that is created by Bowie and the band. Highlights include the ecstatic opening number, Hang on to Yourself; a haunting rendition of Supermen that just kills the LP track; the entire acoustic set (but especially Space Oddity); the epic versions of Width of a Circle and Moonage Daydream; an ultra-cool version of Waiting for the Man; a ripping version of Jean Genie; and an elegaic closing with Rock N Roll Suicide.  It's truly a wonder, a little wonder...<br /><br />There are several shows from this tour that were booted, but most do not have the mix of great performance with great sound that is the signature of the Santa Monica Civic show. As the tour went on, and the band began incorporating more songs from Aladdin Sane, the shows get pretty amazing, as evidenced by the soundtrack of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, the infamous \\"Ziggy farewell\\" show at the Hammersmith Odeon 7/3/73. Jeff Beck guested on Jean Genie but now won't allow it to be on the record or in the movie -- because he knows he was awful -- but mostly the show is wonderful. There is a medley of Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud >>> All the Young Dudes >>> Oh You Pretty Things that is breathtaking, one of the best things I've ever heard Bowie do. The version of Time is simply gorgeous and the Width of A Circle clocks in at over 15 minutes.... If you like the Santa Monica show pick up this other show that bookends the tour some 9 months later, and ends in the real-life Rock N Roll suicide of one of rock's most fascinating creatures.k; the entire acoustic set (but especially Space Oddity); the epic versions of Width of a Circle and Moonage Daydream; an ultra-cool version of Waiting for the Man; a ripping version of Jean Genie; and an elegaic closing with Rock N Roll Suicide.

B006ZJJ6XW|4.0|Leinsdorf's Beethoven cycle with the BSO has survived despite not only following in the wake of Toscanini's monumental monophonic RCA recordings, but also despite the Karajan, Szell, Ormandy, and Bernstein stereo cycles that were all released around the same time.  This is its 2nd incarnation on CD (the first being on the RCA Navigator Series from the early 90s in a boxed set called \\"Ode to Joy\\").  Right off the bat, we need to understand that RCA, from the 1940s to 1970 only ever had TWO Beethoven cycles.  And the greatest of these was Toscanini's version from 1949-1952 (although in monophonic sound) and Leinsdorf's from the mid-sixties Golden age of Stereo.  This is not counting the superb Toscanini live concert cycle from 1939 (called by Gramophone magazine \\"the greatest cycle ever\\"), which was never released commercially by RCA, but fortunately was lovingly restored by Music and Arts and released a few years ago.[[ASIN:B000R7G6LI Toscanini Conducts Beethoven: Complete Symphonies & Selected Overtures (From the Legendary October-December 1939 Cycle)]].  What a daunting task Eric Leinsdorf faced?<br /><br />Why is this important?  Simply because who was going to dare to re-record Beethoven after the old Maestro.  It would be like following in the footsteps of Babe Ruth, Michelangelo, or Humphrey Bogart. However, RCA needed a modern stereo version and Leinsdorf was their man in Boston.  He was a great operatic conductor and very Toscanini-like in his approach to tempi and the \\"singing line\\".  And now he had the technology of RCA's \\"Living Stereo\\".<br /><br />Every conductor takes liberties with the score or feels some internal musical sense that certain \\"touch ups\\" are needed.  One of the reviewers went in detail about Leinsdorf's changes and their merit or detraction.  Mahler made over 400 changes to Schumann's symphonies (all for the better, I think).  Toscanini and especially Furtwangler were notorious at tinkering with the orchestration.  Bernstein talked volumes about the musical interplay in the scores and made his changes too, demolishing about 1/3 of Bach's St. Matthew Passion.  Toscanini, infamously, whacked some 15 minutes out of Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony and there is Beecham's equally infamous \\"re-orchestration' of Handel's Messiah that included cymbals, triangle, and picolo....unheard of instruments in the early 1700s. Old Herr Dr. Otto Klemperer decided the same Messiah needed to have most of its strings doubled to give a \\"gravitas\\" Germanic sound.  All of these WERE COMMITTED to recordings for us to chew on, groan at, or delight in decades later.  My point is that it is up to the listener to decide what is tasteful and appropriate.  Leinsdorf was not the exception.<br /><br />Not so in the case of sonic performance.  Toscanini's RCA Beethoven series, while definitive and awesome, was nevertheless recorded in cramped monophonic sound and limited high fidelity - the state of the art in early 1950s.  RCA knew that, in the 1960s, they had the opportunity to stamp their RED SEAL with the amazing stereophonic and high fidelity recording technology.  The logical choice was Eric Leinsdorf and the \\"Aristocrats of Orchestras\\" - the Boston Symphony.<br /><br />I disagree with some of the reviewers on the sonic quality of the first LP box set, which I have, and consider to be the finest of RCA's mid sixties recordings with clear woodwinds, weighty, yet clear brass, beautiful violins, and rich, deep bass.  I understand there was a 2nd set of LPs pressed in the 70s on RCA''s very \\"flexible\\" plastic of the time that were not as satisfactory.  The RCA Navigator CD series (for a budget series) was a whole lot cleaner than the original LP set at the expense somewhat of fullness and richness of the bass.  (Bear in mind, early LPs were well doctored by RCA's engineers and this did not always make it to CD).  This new set is very comparable to the Navigator series.  Not as weighty as the LPs but excellent listening (once you getused to it).<br /><br />As far as performances, these are not on par with Toscanini's 1939 concert performances, nor the 1949-52 commercially recorded editon, but that is OK.  Remember the NBC Symphony Orchestra of that period was peerless....no other American orchestra (or European for that matter) could match its colour and sheer virtuosity.  What does count is that Leinsdorf's set compares very favourably with the contemporary sets recorded by Columbia....George Szell (Cleveland), Bernstein (New York) and Eugene Ormandy (Philadelphia) and even Bruno Walter's (Columbia Symphony) although it was not conceived as a set.  These were its commercial competitors in North America.  Karajan's 1962 stereo set was a cut above all of them, but it was an expensive import at the time.  There is much to be recommended in all these sets, including Leinsdorf's...not a bad one in the bunch!!<br /><br />In terms of performances, I would highlight the 7th and 9th as the strongest for me....especially the 9th and I think this stems from Leinsdorf's affinity for opera.  The reviewers are correct.....Placido is superb and the bass/baritone is the great Met star Sherrill Milnes who had, in my mind no equal in the US, except possibly Robert Merrill...The performance is taut, beautifully played, splendidly recorded, and every bit worthy as a stereo successor to Toscanini's unbeatable 1952 Ninth.<br /><br />I would say the Leinsdorf set complements RCA's Toscanini edition with its stereo sound.  It certainly didn't replace it.  The Toscanini set has remained in the catalogue for 61 years (as of 2012).  It is a sonic improvement with the best mid-sixties sound you are likely to hear from any record company.  As far as so-called 24-bit technology, I think the fact is that digital remastering is now in its 3rd decade and record companies have learned, painfully at times, that post-recording \\"doctoring\\" is indeed an art and to carefully heed the \\"LP sound\\" in any CD re-issue.<br /><br />It has been done so in this sonically outstanding set of the Beethoven 9 symphonies and, at an unbelievable bargain price, it deserves to be bought and listened to.  Full marks to RCA sticking with Eric and the Bostonians for attempting the ascent up Beethovian Evererst with the shadow of the great Maestro and his NBC thoroughbreds before him....
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I just received this knife yesterday.  First impressions are:  Knife is very solid and heavy.  Due to the thickness of the blade the point is thick, but should never break.  The knife is very sharp, it will slice through newspaper like a razor blade.  The only minor negative thing I saw out of the box was a very small amount of surface rust on the screws that that hold on the handle.  A couple drops of oil solved that.  The finish on the blade was not perfect, but for the price of the knife I think would be hard to beat.  I also have the Bear Grylls survival knife which I paid about the same price for, and this one is in a totally different class.  Notable differences:<br /><br />Bear Grylls knife:<br />- Orange Plastic handle (more visable, but more fragile)<br />- Thinner stainless steel blade<br />- Partially serrated blade<br />- Better sheath, and with firestarter and whistle<br />- Not near as sharp out of the box<br />- Could be strapped to a stick for a spear<br /><br />This knife:<br />- Very strong and heavy<br />- Full tang handle where hard plastic/rubber could be replaced with another material<br />- Extra storage in the pouch on the sheath<br />- Very sharp right out of the box<br /><br />For everyday light to medium use I would probably grab the Bear Grylls knife due to the reduced weight, but for a true survival situation that required chopping and wood splitting I definitely would rely on this knife, I don't think you could ever really destroy it.
B005I6EU48|1.0|I have just opened my package with the Kindle Case Cover,I am not  impressed. While the cover looks quite nice, well made and rich looking, it does not fit the kindle fire which arrived at the same time. Just looking a the size of the KF  it is to difficult to figure out it was not going to fit, but I tried anyway, NO LUCK.<br />Needless to say I will not  reccomend this to anyone planning to purchase the KF.<br />I now have to return this item and hope what I order next will fit. I have given this  1 star only because of the good quality of the cover itself, I would have hoped for it to fit as well.<br /><br />August 12th 2012--NEW<br />I was able to fit the Kindle Fire into the case with much fight, I must say it looks really beautiful. I have had quite a few compliments from friends. The quality  was always \\"top\\" its just one should not have to fight to get this in place. However it looks great and fits well. Very pleased.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|..., but it certainly won't be my last. Good easy listening with fun songs to sing along to. Looking forward to seeing what's next.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|excellent as well as convenient. love the notification on daily reading. the email option is also good.  sometimes the notification stops and ha to be reset.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really like this game. easy at first until you get to the harder levels. I didn't want to quit after getting stuck in a harder level. all in all its s pretty good game it your sitting in a waiting room and you need to play something to pass the time
B00824ZJ84|4.0|When I first heard \\"Run Free,\\" I thought, \\"This must be a modern re-recording of the old disco classic, \\"Young Hearts Run Free.\\" And a good re-make, too! But I couldn't quite put my finger on who sang that song back in the 70s. I was daydreaming today about my favorite divas from the disco era, and the name \\"Candi Staton\\" popped into my head! After checking out her catalogue on Amazon and listening to a few song clips, I had confirmation. Too bad this song isn't Ms. Staton's comeback record, but Ms. Ferguson sure sounds good as her protege. So, why is Rebecca Ferguson compared to Aretha Franklin?!? Apples and oranges.... I'd put her in the same musical family as Amy Winehouse -- and CANDI STATON -- not the Queen of Soul!
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Well this one is tough to review, after all it is a canteen and canteen cup, of which you should be able to get from an Army / Navy surplus for a lot less, I tried, the cup was a copy and made in china and the canteen did not fit inside the cup, lesson learned, so I opted to pay the extra for the names, (Gerber and Bear) and got this one. Well it is what it is, the handle has some plastic on that melted when I set my cup on a fire to heat up some water, other than that it's a very well made product, a canteen and canteen cup with case.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This a good game to play. there are many different games to play. My son loves to play with me.
0307742539|5.0|I have enjoyed this trilogy immensely.  The books arrived promptly and I read through both first and second parts of the trilogy and am now on the third and last book. The problem I have is that I cannot put the books down.  Thanks Amazon for your prompt action in sending these books.
B00884GR0W|5.0|For the people whining about minecraft I have it, it is awful. There is one mob at night the zombie. You don't eat and they have pigs and cows. that's it. this is so much better l, not as good as minecraft on the Pc but better than the pocket edition of minecraft. I would recommend getting this instead.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|honestly when i opened this book i figured katniss would defeat caitol and get the boy without much of a long term consequence.... a fairytale ending. but instead katniss faced the difficulty and struggle of the effects and problems war brings and coping with it. when peeta comes back to district thirteen crazed and determined to kill katniss i actually cried. our sweet loving baker now changed by capitol  having o ask those around him whethe things are real or not just brought me to tears. and the fact that katniss decided to distance herself from him and have nothing to do with peeta since he was no longer the lovable baker he once was but she begins to love him and trust him again. the ending could have been a bit more detailed but overall a mesmerising book that i think is a perfect way to end this dynamic series
B00009W0WM|4.0|This movie is a classic and it was priced very low compared to other sites and stores. I bought the movie as a gift and it was a hit.<br /><br />The seller also had exceptional customer service. They made sure I received the movie, in the condition stated on Amazon, and they wanted to be sure the product worked.
0307949508|5.0|As mentioned previously, I could not put this book down.  The lead girl in the series is a fascinating character and the story line riveting.  Stieg Larsson is a meticulous writer.
B007JWKLMO|3.0|In my opinion, the documentary is okay and is very respectful of George's legacy. However, after comparing it to \\"Imagine: John Lennon\\" done in 1988 then,  I see huge differences<br /><br />Following, some of them:<br /><br />* Imagine John Lennon was narrated by Lennon himself  and has lots of unseen footage. Everything was neatly interconnected. One thing lead to the next one.<br /><br />* LITMW is a compilation of very nice interviews to George and people who new him but the documentary doesn't \\"flow\\", it jumps to one subject to the next one and leaves lots of gaps. There is very little unseen footage. And the unseen footage is not as relevant as you could have expected<br /><br />Besides the comparision to \\"Imagine John Lennon\\", I didn't like that Scorcese neither mentioned his \\"comeback\\" album \\"Cloud Nine\\" , nor \\"The Beatles 1994/1995 Reunion\\". I only saw a three second clip of Paul & George doing vocal harmonies presumably for \\"Free as Bird\\". Even though is not a documentary about \\"The Beatles\\", I though Scorcese should have given that historic reunion al least 3 minutes...., not 3 seconds.<br /><br />Anyway, it is very decent documentary; However it is very far from G-R-E-A-T<br /><br />After watching Imagine John Lennon I was deeply moved, after watching LITMW I just smiled slightly.<br /><br />That is all I can say<br /><br />GOD bless George!<br /><br />Juan Carlos, Toronto
B0041KW2UQ|1.0|Wrote to ask if movie was in italian or english...opened to see after no reply..will not play in our DVD so going to try a brand new one my daughter has. If works and is in English we will keep it. If it in Italian or it does not work in their dvd we will be sending it back.<br /><br />Stewart Schofield
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I read the book as I had heard so much about it.  I found it very dark - a young virgin being seduced by a \\"twisted\\" older man.<br /><br />I was glad to get to the end of the book and don't feel tempted to purchase the second or third in the series.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|This really gives a different view point to the kind of issues top rank athletes have to go through.  It also paints the picture of the political climite that goes along with making it to the top. Parents of these gifted young people have many deminsions  they do to also live a dream along with the athlete.<br />I loved that this was the authors view and the realism that she brought to the book.  What a great time to read it, while the Olympics are in progress.
030758836X|3.0|I did like this book for the most part. It offered excitement, tension and never knew what you were going to find when you turned the page. BUT, the ending was so disappointing and unsatisfying. I put the book down and shook my head for such a weak ending. I was looking for a quick, easy read that would keep my attention and it did for the most part but there are parts of it that are unrealistic when it came to an old stalking boyfriend keeping her captive.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run its my favorite game to play on my kindle fire!!!! I love buying from the store cuz i'm a shopahollic!!!!
B007Z9QS5K|4.0|Each story line within the movie was very enjoyable.  It had a large variety of well known cast members. Each having a storyline on New Years Eve in Times Square NY.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Beautifully written in a very simple language having immense significant purpose of life.The story is a source of inspiration who loves travelling.After all life is nothing but a journey which is nicely depicted here.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This was such a sweet story about a young and fresh relationship.  I couldn't believe how it made me cry and was captivating.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick read and an escape from reality.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I'd seen the movie years ago and love it because it reminded me of my dad, who is now deceased, and all the tales he told us as children.  It's a sweet love story with a bit of a surprise ending.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its beast to the people who hate t(^_^t) so nodnt hats this game its really awesome so yea so if you don't have it get it
0345803485|1.0|well... one of the most flat silly and useless books I ever read. Full of repeated scenes, (a million flushes, rolling eyes, etc.)There is no point in reading it and I wonder who can buy the other two books after reading this dozing novel.<br /><br />Note I gave this book one star because it is impossible to give zero.<br /><br />Stefano
B008CX2A2I|4.0|I was very excited about this product simply for the fact that I could stream music from my cell phone through my home theater system. I was not 100% sure that my receiver would work (HT-R990) being that I purchased the HT-S9400THX HTIB and thought that I might get lucky. The product description says it will work with all 2012 network receivers, and technically mine was released in late 2011. I was able to successfully pair my cell phone to the BT adapter but to my dismay I was getting no audio out of my speakers. I stream from my cell phone into my car stereo using bluetooth, so I am sure all the settings were correct.<br /><br />I am sure this is a great product for those who have a compatible receiver. I had to send mine back since I could not get it to work with my receiver.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This show is so underrated. It's a great,funny show! It reminds me of Arrested Development and it's just as funny (in my opinion). It's smart and cleverly written. I used to enjoy the Big Bang Theory and other comedy shows on tv , but after watching this show, other comedy shows don't seem as good to me anymore. I'm not complaining though. (:
B0068ZZ6CI|5.0|Another great must have album if you are a fan of Rammstein. Definitely worth getting the special edition too. Get this album today!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|While this book is quite erotic, it is boring and repetitive.  There is absolutely no depth to the story--a thin single plot line that goes on and on like a car chase in a movie that should have ended much earlier. The reader has no empathy for the characters and even grows to dislike them.  The only driving force in the book is the \\"mystery,\\" however weak and unrealistic, in the background of Christian Grey.  What an unbelievable character! And Anastasia can't see the totally obvious, making her a huge contradiction considering her supposed intelligence.  This book is a waste of time.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Game works great for me. I've read other reviews and I have never had a problem. Tons of pictures to download that are free.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is the only re-release Beatles CD i like. It has a great song selection. I think other Beatles fans will agree with this. (:
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this was an easy read and very entertaining.  The beginning was a little slow to start but a revals a great romance with a little spice!  well worth the read:)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this app is wonderful it gives you tons of levels without need to buy. I would recremend it to anyone who likes adicting games!!!!!
0345803485|3.0|I couldn't put this book down, and read it in 3-4 days. That being said, it was more like a train wreck than anything, though an enjoyable one with much juicy description. The British phrases and words are beyond odd for characters who are supposed to be Americans. 'Anastasia' is also a bit of an unrealistic/uncommon name for someone of the main character's background and part of the country her family is from. There was also too much repetition of the same words and phrases over and over. But overall, I liked it, even with its flaws.
B000CNE092|5.0|Any little girl will love this movie. It's the only non Disney Princess movie that i enjoy. I like the fact that this DVD has another movie on it. I had never seen it before. (:
B00785P2QC|4.0|I find myself playing this game all the time. its fun building your own little town and sit there and watch it run and flow.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. it give you tons of money and nuts without needing to spend real money! totally worth downloading!
B0085Z3B2Q|1.0|This animated \\"kids\\" film was built around an environmental awareness agenda. Painting capitalism as the ruthless disregarding anything and everything in their path. Most IMAX films have a similar slant, I just hope this isn't the new norm of animation films.<br /><br />Make a factual film and let your views determine truth instead of cramming this garbage down our throats...
159514188X|4.0|It's one of my favorite books now , however i did have a few issues with it. The second half to me wasn't as exciting (usually it's the other way around). The ending could have been better and in the end i didn't feel too bad for Hannah. I actually felt more pity for Clay. The only thing i can take from this is that you should be nicer to people. You might affect someone without even knowing. o:
0060987464|5.0|So I actually got this book a while ago, and it is so exquisite!! I am soo happy I bought it. If you are fan of Marilyn Manson, this is the book for you! It tells about pretty much his whole life. Its great! I'm reading it again.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I enjoyed the book becuase of it`s unpredicability and fairly interesting summary of the book.  This book isn` my first pick, but if you are into a good mystery, then this book will appeal to you.  Now don`t get me wrong about it saying it`s not the best book on the planet, but i liked the way how the author didn`t put all these unneccessary plots into an already complicated story plot.  The characters are likable {except for a few characters a.k.a. villans} and arn`t forgettable so even if you have your doubts on reading this book, just read it and you might find yourself downloading the rest of the trilogy which i did:]
B0086700CM|4.0|it was a col app needs more emmph u know.... lol....... yeah um wel have nothing left to say sooooooo byeeee :)
B00006AG5N|5.0|This CD is flawless! I could listen to it all day. All of his best songs on 1 CD. Elvis fans won't be disappointed. (:
B004LWZWE2|1.0|Set was incomplete. The photos were missing. Was ordered for a friend. Both him and I were very disappointed. Too bad he decided not to return it.
1594744769|5.0|Just another random person reiterating what an incredible book this is.  This was not at all the story I expected.  I thought, oh, a combination of text and old photographs, this is going to be some artsy wannabe pretending they're a hotshot professional photographer.  Guys, look closely at the cover.  She's hovering.  And that's just one of many incredible photographs contained within these pages, shaping a terrifying, suspenseful book that will actually leave you with chills.  There are so many incredible plot twists along the way.  I lost my love of the story a bit when time travel came into the picture, and the focus shifted from the incredible characters who I wanted to fully know to a less interesting, less bone-chilling plotline.  All of the props I have to offer to the characters, though.  Great book, really original, stays with you long after you're done.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5/5
B007X4ECLY|1.0|This movie was really lousy.  The stupid Hollywood one liners never stopped, I mean never stopped coming.  The story was not bad, but the acting was.  The one guy who played the psycho was the best.  I felt like I was watching Die Hard + Total Recall = Lockout.  I rented this from the Blockbuster box for two dollars and feel ripped off.  If you buy it, you will feel really bad.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I'd never played Angry Bird before my wife got me a Kindle Fire for my birthday.  I wasn't sure what to do with the Kindle Fire.  My wife made some suggestions, one was try Angry Bird.  It was easy to acquire and install.  Lots of fun and free!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. love the movies and love this game. really like the pirahna game. I also like that its free.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I bought this book on my Kindle due to the large number of positive reviews, even though I wasn't a big fan of John Green's book Looking for Alaska. I'm glad I gave it a chance, because this book was great. The characters were well-developed, and Green nailed the way teenagers talk; I also really appreciated the depth of Hazel and Gus' relationship. It contained none of the completely over-the-top nonsense in some YA books that just makes you roll your eyes. These kids had some perspective, and the result is a beautiful tale about friendship and love.<br /><br />Plus, this book made me cry: any book that makes me cry gets at LEAST 4 stars. I am NOT usually a crier.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of some unrealistic aspects of Hazel's medical situation; I know most people don't care and that the author is free to bend reality as he sees fit considering this is a work of fiction, but I'm a pediatric ICU nurse so it kinda bothered me. There's a lot more that you can do for the lung issues she was having besides just BiPAP at night and chest tubes, but the most eyebrow-raising thing to me was that she walks around on home oxygen yet doesn't have a pulse oximeter at home to tell her what her oxygen level is. Just not realistic; unlikely that she'd be walking around under-oxygenated for weeks in real life without knowing it. That being said, I understand this is a work of fiction and such details don't matter to most people, so take my 1-star deduction with a grain of salt unless you're a medical person as well.<br /><br />Overall this book was very good. Made me much more open to reading John Green books in the future!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|pretty good book, read the trilogy, not as much smut as was hyped up to be. really just a story about a girl coming of age, falling in love - granted with a man a story book looks & fortune, but still a good read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books in the series. They made me enjoy reading again. I have read them all several times and find myself devulged in the story every time!
B001V69GB6|5.0|I knew nothing about her.  I had been seeing the name on a number of bumper stickers around town and decided to ask about her to my part timers at work (I am 54).  After being warned that she wasn't exactly pop, I decided to take a shot on an album.  The music is haunting, her lyrics deep!  The songs stay with you way after you've stopped the player/IPOD.  The download as usual was super fast and directly into my ITUNES.  The price was less than ITUNES.  Love ya, Amazon!!!
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|I couldn't wait to get the second book in the Clifton Chronicles series and it didn't disappoint!  The story spans a family saga between New York and London and WW II in Europe and is very gripping as one is pulled through the story and wills an eventually happy outcome for the central characters who are  madly in love but as the story unfolds sadly destined to be apart.  I can't wait for the 3rd in the series to be available on kindle - come on Mr Archer hurry up and get it written!
0345803485|3.0|I read this within one day, I liked it alot but the only thing I hated about it was the BDSM, it seemed very abusive and really upset me. This book is for ADULTS ONLY (18 and up). I can't see how they can make this a mvoie, the only movie this book could turn into is a pornographic film with the amount of erotica, sex, and graphic material it has in it.
B0009U5DD0|5.0|The Gipsy Kings have made the greatest album I own....It something I discovered many years ago at a concert and I have always been impressed with the combonation of jazzy up tempo latino rhythm with flamenco style.  The style is called Rumba Catalana.  ( This band is compiled of two families from the south of France ) Music is very strong with the aucoustic guitar.  Its pure delight energy music.  All the best songs are on this album and for a mere $11 you won't be dissapointed at all.  I think I have used this soundtrack for more occassions than any other music genre b/c its so enjoyable and perfect to dance to,  not just weddings and birthdays.<br />Djobi Djoba is my favorite song on this CD as well as Bomboleo<br />5 stars on this band/album
B005LAII3U|4.0|First off, ignore the 1 star reviews.  That just smacks of misguided and disappointed expectation and isn't a fair critique of this film.  Secondly, for folks who enjoyed movies such as \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Minority Report\\", \\"Equilibrium\\", and even \\"I, Robot\\" you're in the same ballpark here and should enjoy this film (and, no, of course it isn't nearly as good as \\"Blade Runner\\" but there isn't much that is).<br /><br />While the original Recall was a gonzo Ahunuld vehicle full of mean-spirited violence, neon trash character riff raff, and brilliant flip-you-on-your-head storytelling (yes, I think the 1990 Recall is a more enjoyable movie than this one--5 stars on it) this new Farrell, Beckinsale, and Biel vehicle is a more straightforward and grounded dystopian future action flick.  It doesn't want to be a rehash of the original and it's not trying to quite be an updated photocopy either but it does give some nice nods to the 1990 version (the tri-breasted woman makes an appearance; a hologram scrambler doesn't quite help get Quaid past transport security) while maintaining a similar storyline and it also has some nice touches of its own (like early in the film when we see Quaid reading a copy of Ian Fleming's \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" not yet knowing that he himself is a double-agent or that his wife too is an agent).<br /><br />The beginning of the film gives us an all-too-brief history lesson bringing us up to the dismal present and then the film starts us off proper by by reorienting our disoriented perspective when we see Farrell's Quaid in close-up appearing to be in a buried alive situation only to have the camera rotate over and pull back to show us a frantic Quaid laying belly down on the floor.  I'm going to leave it there and not spoil more but I will admit that there are a few little details that the film slyly highlights well enough to allow the intelligent adult viewer to fairly easily follow the narrative and get the plot the first time through without any real hangups (I don't recall the original movie letting us get away with that).  Also, even as Hollywood so often does in making use of cheap ploys by throwing us macguffins and red herrings that are there merely to confuse and disorient us, I appreciate that this movie remains constrained.  It allows the initial plot point of a submerged double identity coming back to the fore to be the real and honest disorientation, which is enough for us to experience without the extra contrivances that could have been pulled in just to leave us dazed and confused and going \\"whoa...uh, what?\\"  Thankfully this movie doesn't bend us in that direction.<br /><br />As for the actors, Farrell's Quaid/ Hauser is a muted and quiet hero here.  He is full of physical action but he isn't overimposing.  Beckinsale, on the other hand, is hotcha!!!  Yowza!!!  She is a treat to watch and an extremely awesome action actress.  She is really great as a determined bad/ good guy in this film.  This movie is at its best when she and Farrell share the screen.  Our other significant female lead, Jessica Biel, plays Melina who is one of the resistance's leads.  Biel, who is herself strikingly beautiful, has her stunning attractiveness dirtied out (sorry, guys).  Bill Nighy makes a rather inconsequential appearance as the resistance's leader, Bokeem Woodbine plays Farrell's undercover co-worker, and Bryan Cranston rounds out the cast as the power-mad Cohaagen (Cransten, a superb actor, has his talents wasted here).  One of the film's most glaring failings is that we are not given any real substance as to why Cohaagen wants to take over and essentially dispose of a certain population area other than a generic \\"it's class warfare\\" explanation that really doesn't fit in the scheme of this film given what's going on with the earth.<br /><br />Still, it was an enjoyable ride.  Don't let the negative reviews mess with your mind.  Take the trip.real hangups (I don't recall the original movie letting us get away with that).  Also, even as Hollywood so often does in making use of cheap ploys by throwing us macguffins and red herrings that are there merely to confuse and disorient us, I appreciate that this movie remains constrained.  It allows the initial plot point of a submerged double identity coming back to the fore to be the real and honest disorientation, which is enough for us to experience without the extra contrivances that could have been pulled in just to leave us dazed and confused and going \\"whoa...uh, what?\\"  Thankfully this movie doesn't bend us in that direction.<br /><br />As for the actors, Farrell's Quaid/ Hauser is a muted and quiet hero here.  He is full of physical action but he isn't overimposing.  Beckinsale, on the other hand, is hotcha!!!  Yowza!!!  She is a treat to watch and an extremely awesome action actress.  She is really great as a determined bad/ good guy in this film.  This movie is at its best when she and Farrell share the screen.

030758836X|5.0|Loved this book! I could not put it down. It was very well written and had an extremely unexpected story. I thought it was a better read than 50 Shades of Grey and it deserves to be #1 on the bestsellers list.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|one of the best fantasy books I've read, with amazing character development & pacing... Just wish the author had put in the time to flesh out the last couple chapters, rather than treating them like epilogues.  I don't mind mysteries that tie to the next book, but don't short change a reader at the end of an epic story with \\"summary\\" narrative.  That being said, I can't wait for the next book to come out!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Lustful and intriguing. This trilogy keeps you turning the pages and keeps you moist! It's more than just the exotic sexual endeavors it's the mystery in what is yet to come. Every woman desires for this fantasy man.
0061692042|5.0|I became a Richard Ford fan when I stumbled across \\"The Sportswriter\\" years ago.  I backtracked through his previous work and then kept pace with each new release.  I enjoy his writing, observations and storytelling for what they are...satisfying  reads that I connect with unlike few other contemporary authors--Frederick Barthelme and Paul Auster would be two others.<br /><br />\\"Canada\\" was not the Ford novel I expected, yet I truly enjoyed this read I was given.  It took me some time to move through it as I took my time--yet when I got to the last hundred pages, I had to stay up until the wee hours of the morning to finish it.  I wanted the last bit in one big chunk--basically, I wanted to see the story through as I had formed notions as to how it would play out.  Fitting how it ends across the water from Detroit--a perspective so close in physical distance, but so radically different mentally from the main character's origins.<br /><br />Frankly, I have so enjoyed reading his books that I have never felt the need to go beyond that experience--although I do appreciate reading the thoughts of others in that regard.  What drew me to him as an author initially was a Michigan connection--something I innately understand and I guess allows me to be drawn into his perspective (Michigan is an ongoing touchstone in his novels, but not at the center of any of them as I recall, with the possible exception of \\"The Sportswriter.\\").  I also simply like the way the man uses words, especially in his way to relate place.<br /><br />I hope he might revisit Dell somewhere down the road as he did with Frank Bascombe, as I would like to see him ruminate on Canada some more.  I have reread \\"The Sportswriter\\" and \\"Independence Day\\" and expect to do the same with this novel someday.  Til then, it will remain at the ready on my shelf.
0307593495|1.0|and whatever it was did a bang-up job of it. He has lamented and bemoaned the decay of Swedish government and society and then subjected our hero to the same horrible fate. It would have been greatly appreciated if this book had been written with alternative endings. I would have preferred ANY ending over the one that was written. If Mankell was so sick of the character, it would have been better to have written another Linda Wallender book in which Kurt was written out because either he was abducted by space aliens, he died of terminal constipation, or he was seen in Stockholm having pizza with Elvis. I'm not kidding, those endings are better than the one supplied. Read all of the other Wallender books and enjoy them.They are all good.

I'm glad amazon now has video instant play but would like the quality to be better, and I would love it if it was available on the Wii. And I would also like to be able to watch it from more than one computer.

1416562605|5.0|Written in the form of a letter to a visiting Chinese dignitary, this is the story of Balram Halwai - the White Tiger. Originally named simply Munna, or 'boy', renamed Balram by a corrupt schoolteacher, son of a rickshaw puller and wanted by the police. As Balram's story unfolds, we learn of exactly why the police are looking for him and why. Despite the reasons your sympathy will undoubtedly be for Balram, a bright boy taken from school to work in a tea shop to help pay off a family dowry loan, who wants always to better himself. He becomes a driver and begins work for the Mr Ashok and his wife, the delightfully named Pinky Madam.<br /><br />\\"Speak to me of blood on the streets\\", I told Delhi.<br />\\"I will\\", she said.<br /><br />Balram learns many things in Delhi, one of them being resentment about the future presented to him - an endless financial commitment to his manipulative grandmother, a marriage he doesn't want and life as a servant. There is much in this novel about modern India, about the corruption of government and police, of poverty and of the fight of one man to escape the life mapped out for him and emerge from the Darkness and into the Light. Wonderful read, with a narrator whose voice speaks for many and who will stay with you for a long time.
B001PPLIFU|2.0|What ever happened to allowing an actor to build his/her character within a scene ? The world's microscopic attention span has affected director's and editor's to an alarmingly annoying level. I got dizzy in the first five minutes, Vertigo in the second five minutes, and was vomiting blood by the ending credits.<br /><br />At least the chicks are hot.<br /><br />Hugs,<br />Kenny
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is a good continuation from the first book, I did find it to be a little bit predictable at times. A lot of people I know gave this whole series a great review and my expectations were very high.  I would recommend this to someone who likes a little bit of all the gendres (Romance, Sci-Fi, Tragedy, Suspense).
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I can do without all the drama!  I'm embarrassed to say I read it quickly, so it was engaging.  Liked the characters and I get their attraction and hunger for each other.  BUT...kinda tired of really pretty girls thinking they're not good enough or the \\"what does he see in me\\" mentality.  Also, does the guy always have to have a crazy jealous streak and a temper that makes him overreact?  That being said, it's still a great read, especially for younger college-age readers.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Without a doubt, all the previous reviews are correct.<br />This product lasts forever.<br />I never did have the dragonfly/wasp/whatever that is in the center go up and down.<br /><br />But I have some questions:<br /><br />1. For the life of me, I can't figure out the name of the first mozart song that is played when the blue button is pressed. Any clue? It is my son's favorite also.<br /><br />2. What is the name of the red bird? We keep calling it a toucan.<br /><br />3. Is the center dragonfly/wasp/whatever that is in the center supposed to go up and down? Perhaps I own an older version?

B004TU05Y8|4.0|I loved many of the remixes on the 3-Disc Edition of Remixes 2: 81-11.<br /><br />Looking back a few years, I see that my 3-Disc Edition of Remixes: 81-04 was a 3-Disc jewel case with no booklet.  I don't remember where I bought it from, but I wish it had a booklet.<br /><br />I was really impressed with the packaging of this 3-Disc Edition of Remixes 2: 81-11.  Each CD has their own cardboard slipcase.  And the booklet has an interesting essay written by Ralph Moore.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I'm an avid reader. I won't waste a lot of time repeating the synopsis of the plot, as that has been done and done again by reviewers. I purchased the Kindle edition and found absolutely no formatting problems with these books.<br /><br />I will say that the author is a skilled wordsmith. He weaves a powerful, realistic, and amazing world. The details make the characters palpable. However, I'm lacking the archetypical hero.  Every character, save one, that I even remotely liked dies a horrible death. I found myself finishing the books only to see how the rest of them met their demise.<br /><br />In Martin's world, if you are inherently good, you pay with your life. Unless, of course, you're being slowly dehumanized and led to the life of a murderer. Perhaps it is realistic, but I can't bring myself to read the fifth book. There's one character I like that hasn't been killed off and as long as I turn no further pages, she lives. While Martin is a skilled world-builder, I could live without quite some many details. Often, I felt like I wanted less detail and more character development.<br /><br />As a reader, I felt like he built up each character only to dream up a gruesome death for them. Perhaps he's the next best thing, but I truly need a good vs. evil battle to get behind. Herein, it is the amoral versus the completely corrupt for the throne. If you're honor bound, you die. An okay read, but my favorites get read and re-read over time. I can't fathom picking this tome up for a re-read.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|I'm impressed with most of the Oceania album.  I really love the following tracks:<br />Violet Rays<br />One Diamond, One Heart<br />Oceania<br />Pale Horse<br />Wildflower<br /><br />I'm excited that Billy Corgan still has creative musical ideas to share with us.  I hope the Smashing Pumpkins keep this line-up for a while.

B0086700CM|2.0|Temple Run is very frustrating for me.  It needs fast finger action and the route for the runner changes regularly so when my runner falls and goes back to the beginning, I can't anticipate what to do to keep him from falling or being caught by the monkeys on subsequent tries. Maybe my problem is not with the game but with the fact that I am a \\"mature\\" grandmother with slowish reaction time and after trying to advance my runner many times, I gave up.  My grand daughter, however has NO problem with this game so maybe you need a coding system for games - You know.  \\"Great for teenagers but not for for their grandmothers.\\"
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I did not buy this from Amazon. Bought the i5-3570K for my first system build. Very easy to install. Comes with a stock heatsink with thermal paste applied--which I did not use. I have this cooled with a Corsair H60. Asrock z77 Extreme4 motherboard and Corsair 500R case. I overclocked this easily in UEFI to 4.2ghz by increasing the multiplier. Like I said, first system and first overclock. Was easy. Did not have to change any other settings. Runs around 33c idle with ambient temperature around 72-74f. No heat or stability issues to date. I have some other goodies on my system, and it runs great.
034580404X|5.0|The books arrived in the amount of time I was promised. The books were in perfect shape, and I enjoyed them thoroughly!
031620157X|5.0|I will quote my Tumblr entry about the book:<br /><br />I want to talk about the debut novel of Chris Colfer, 'The land of Stories', today. I was really really curious how his first novel would turn out. So I pre-ordered it. I also watched his live-chat on the website of his publisher. It was sweet to see how nervous he still gets. Unfortunately I didn't get the chance to ask him something personally :( But it was interesting none the less.<br /><br />Now to the novel itself. I /love/ the cover picture. It is vibrant and beautiful, just like Chris himself. I will try to talk about the story without spoilering it for those of you who haven't read or are still reading it:<br /><br />The novel tells the story of Alex and Conner Bailey who are going through a tough time after their fathers sudden death. On their birthday their grandmother visits them and gives the twins her treasured fairy tale book, 'The land of Stories'. It doesn't take long until Alex and Conner end up inside the world of the book, right in the heart of all the stories both of them, especially Alex, love so much. Now they have to find a way back home. Their only chance is something called the 'wishing spell'. They have to travel through the whole fairy tale world and collect different items on the most important and biggest scavenger hunt of their lives. Along the way they meet all the persons and creatures they only heard of until now and realise that all those stories never ended after the 'And they lived happy ever after'. Quite the contrary. And they discover a lot about themselfes.<br /><br />I won't tell anymore about the story itself. If you are curious now (and I hope you are!), you should buy the novel. Believe me, it sure is worth it!!<br />Chris Colfer's writing style is beautiful and pulls you directly into the wonderful story. He has an certain way of telling this story, that I can't describe and his way to interpret the stories, what happened to the characters afterwards and give everything a whole new point of view is fascinating. I get the impression that every word he wrote came right from his heart. He manages to describe that fairy tale world so lively and vibrant, that I basically saw the twins on their journey through it right before my eyes the whole time. It reminds me of JK Rowlings first Harry Potter novel, 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone', to be honest. And I can fully understand and agree that a lot of people say that he could be the JK Rowling for the next generation. And the fact that his novel was #1 on the New York Times bestseller's list right away and keeps it's position for the second week now isn't surprising at all.<br /><br />All in all: WELL DONE, CHRIS! I am really impressed just how talented you are. Can't wait for the second part of that wonderful story :)<br /><br />And with those words, I say 'BYE!' for now!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Good book with interesting insight into how women think.<br />Storyline is just ok with some interesting chafes of direction.not sure this book will be for most hetrosexual men!!
0307279189|5.0|This was such a great book. I actually listened to the audiobook version, but it was fantastic. I got so caught up in the craziness of the ultra-running world and the ancient Mexican tribes, all I wanted to do was rip off my corporate clothes (and put something else on!) and just run through the streets and trails where I live. The good thing about the audiobook version of this particular story is that you actually can run whilst listening (much harder to do that with a physical book!).<br />This is a fantastic, rollicking story. Give it a go and I dare you to contain the urge to get out there and run!

0143038419|3.0|I had issues with the whole concept of the book - I totally get that anyone can have a seemingly perfect life and then feel unhappy/depressed/trapped. What I don't get is how in the middle of all that pity, there isn't the voice in your head that says \\"but geez, in so many ways, I'm so much better off than so many people - people who are sick or hungry or who've lost loved ones or who have no money or who can't afford health insurance or ...\\". Seriously, that voice always interrupts my personal pity parties. It doesn't mean that I get over things, or don't wallow in my depression, it just means that I feel guilty about doing so(!!!) and that I know that ultimately, despite the shitty things in my life, I am a very, very lucky person. This sentiment is absent from Gilbert's writing. In the whole year it took her to have her travel experience and write her book, never did she express an iota of guilt for her inability to cope depsite her very (very!) comfortable existence (I believe, from memory, that she and her husband had multiple houses in New York). By all means, creature comforts do not equal happiness and privilige does not make one immune from depression, but Godtopus almighty, she did not show a shred of self-awarness that there are so many who are worse off than her who could no better piss off for a year of international travels than they could fly to the moon (or afford health insurance or pay off their house or send their children to college or...).<br />That said, Gilbert is an extremely gifted writer and storyteller, and she totally sucked me in, and I definitely enjoyed reading it... But I definitely felt slightly puzzled/confused/a trifle dirty afterwards.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app to fill short down time. You can solve the puzzles in any amount of time you like but the true challenge is to solve in the least amount of moves possible and you receive a star! I like this app.
B003VXPKQW|5.0|This book is wonderful. I was not a lover of 'Eat Pray Love', (I enjoyed it, but felt that Gilbert lacked self awareness), but this book was simply wonderful. A treatise on marriage, analyzing it from numerous different perspectives (historical, philosophical, religious, feminist etc), she presents an examination of the institution that so defines our modern-day family unit. I particularly loved the way she wrote about gay marriage. This was a surprisingly wonderful book that I highly recommend. Gilbert has a great narrative voice, and is a really skilled storyteller.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was a lesson in degradation of women and abusive behavior. The characters were unlovable and improbable.  In a world where violence against women is pervasive, this book tries to glorify and romanticize it.  Shame, shame,shame...

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I came across Raven's Shadow by accident while \\"searching\\" for another read. Having concentrated on historical fiction surrounding Western Europe for many years, I was sad to have such a poor search result for new reading material. After a number of \\"people who bought this book also bought....\\" clicks, Anthony Ryan popped up. After noting the many star ratings, and the price, I took the leap. What a wonderful, pleasant, surprise to once again be in a book that took me away..... and that I found myself wanting to get back to! He certainly deserves more than the low, \\"introductory offer\\" price, and assuredly will be getting more for Book 2.

Definitely deserves 5 stars!
B005LAIHHC|4.0|The Dictator is the third collaboration between director Larry Charles and writer/producer/star Sacha Baron Cohen, and the first to break from the mockumentary mold of their previous films together. Yes, unlike [[ASIN:B002M4CEZG Borat]] and [[ASIN:B002P7UCJA Brüno]], The Dictator is a narrative feature with a plot and it may be the funniest film they've done together. It has low-brow humor that is outrageous and crude, but there are several moments of ruthless political satire that ultimately make The Dictator much funnier than I expected it to be.<br /><br />There are pop culture references and topical humor that restrain it from being anything close to timeless, but I don't think I've laughed harder at a movie this year.<br /><br />The film courts controversy immediately by opening with the title card \\"In Loving Memory of Kim Jong-Il.\\" From there, we meet Admiral General Aladeen (Cohen), the bearded, ignorant dictator of the (fictional) Republic of Wadiya. Aladeen's astounding stupidity, willingness to execute anyone who disagrees (or agrees) with him, and his development of nuclear arms that unnerve the US has his own men out to assassinate him; particularly Tamir (Ben Kingsley), the rightful heir to the throne that Aladeen has assumed. When Aladeen travels to New York to give a speech to the UN, his beard is shaved by a would-be assassin and he escapes into the streets as a double replaces him and promises to give Wadiya democracy. Aladeen \\"befriends\\" a feminist, vegan shop-owner (Anna Faris) and, against all odds, begins to fall for her as he desperately tries to keep his double from signing a constitution that will give his beloved country democracy.<br /><br />The film frequently utilizes shock humor and no topic is off-limits. Be forewarned; The Dictator doesn't know the meaning of politically correct. 9/11, child molestation, sex-selective abortion, various sex acts, stereotypes targeting race, women, and cultures are just a few examples of the comedic fodder here. The humor alternates between intelligent and down-right stupid, but maintains a streak of intelligence by always being aware of the audience it's targeting. Two early scenes represent this dichotomy; in one, Aladeen exclaims \\"you now have herpes\\" after a sexual rendezvous with Megan Fox. In another, Clayton (played by John C. Reilly) mistakes Aladeen for an Arab and informs him that \\"anyone outside of America is technically an Arab.\\" Once you sift through the low-brow stuff there is some fine material that takes on dictatorships, America, terrorism, and cultural stereotypes. There's also an amusing and subtle gag about Osama bin laden and a brilliant throwaway gag that shows the confusion throughout Wadiya when Aladeen orders the words `positive' and `negative' to be changed to `Aladeen.' In a film where a man is beaten for several minutes by a large pair of breasts, it may seem odd to refer to said film as \\"intelligent,\\" but writing dumb in a smart and witty way is difficult and Cohen (and his co-writers) knows how to capture these differing facets of humor remarkably well.<br /><br />Making a film with a straight-forward narrative rather than the documentary-style of the previous outings seems be a more freeing experience comedically for Cohen and company. There is material here that Cohen would have never been able to execute on real, unsuspecting people without a potentially dangerous backlash. One example is the helicopter scene, which is one of the funniest and most hilariously politically incorrect scenes in the film. It's one of the film's best scenes and it would only work so well in this narrative framework. Some jokes fall flat, but the film's brisk 90-minute running time and rapid-fire humor make it easy to forget a mediocre joke as the next one has you rolling on the floor laughing.<br /><br />The Dictator is an uproarious experience that will have you clutching your stomach with laughter and also nodding in agreement when it catches you withsurprise moments of brilliance. The speech at the end about dictatorship in America is astounding and insightful. Never sticking to one comedic level for long, the film ends with the line \\"are you having a boy or an abortion?\\" There is something here to please, or offend, anyone. With a slew of celebrity cameos including Edward Norton, Chris Elliot (yep, he's still alive), and Garry Shandling; The Dictator is over-the-top and consistently funny, despite the topical humor that will grow stale in years to come. It's not a timeless classic, but I was shocked by how good it turned out to be. I don't know if I've seen a funnier film this year and I doubt that I will.<br /><br />GRADE: B+
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down! The first couple of pages were kind of slow but the further I got into it, the better it got.  Talk about plot twists! Just when you thought you had it figured out, it would surprise you.  And I never saw the end coming! I'm definitely going to have to get the author's first two books now.
0345803485|2.0|Very poorly written I must say, but at least unconventional sex is getting its public notice. I think if you don't mind nonliterary romance, but you want something different, this book is okay. But if you're on the fence because you want to know what all the hoopla is about, don't bother.
B0082A3JHQ|2.0|A bit of a dissapointment. this is just his existing stuff of that time done live.  It's ok, but I have other examples that are better.
B001THZAAI|4.0|This movie was a lot of fun. I'll have to say that some of the humor would have been a little hard to translate, but the translation was admirable, and captured the wordplay in the movie very well. Even though it has a lot to do with French cultural references and bias, that was not a deterrent to someone from another country \\"getting it\\". The acting was superb, and the slapstick humor was well balanced by a universal human-experience theme - that of being thrust into an unknown place with grave misgivings about the outcome, and finding that there can be joy in all kinds of circumstances.

B0088TG252|5.0|Best Movie Denzel has done in a while...GREAT MOVIE!!! I was on the edge of my seat thru the whole thing!
B001NKI60W|3.0|I had not seen this movie prior to seeing the Broadway play.  After I saw the play, I thought I must see the movie.  What a disappointment!  The play was outstanding.  The movie was okay.  It may not be fair to compare the movie to the play.  I think my expectations were too high.  The singing in the movie was just mediocre.  I don't think I would have liked it even if I had not seen the play.  It is a good story.  The scenery in the movie is fantastic.  It is a \\"feel good\\" movie and I did \\"feel good\\" after watching it.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I read the first 100 pages and still could not get into the story and finally threw in the towel and gave it away.<br />I was thinking more of a Harry Potter meets Twilight as quoted in some reviews.<br />But the book is \\"Twilight written well.\\"<br />Did not think the idea of the book was original.

034580404X|5.0|Everyone who had read it before me said it is intense. I never would do this. It really is good. I admit to crying in a couple places. Well worth the money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent book series. I could not stop reading once I began. I had a friend tell me about the book and she was so into it I knew I just had to read it. It was well worth the money I spent to buy all three books in the series.

B005L12SB2|3.0|i received my box set on 8-6-12 and amazon had it shipping between 8-14 through 8-24-2012 so product gets plugs for that. what i fail to see is in the packaging; CBS records for an import went to all the trouble to remaster each C.D. especially MONOLITH-it sounds great, but they couldnt afford to put MINI SLEEVES in the album inserts with the LYRICS just like the original albums; come on now; that is pretty bad. even for the great price i paid for my set($32.00) this is a huge over site.<br />i give the box set 3 stars and thats for the sound; i knocked off 2 stars for the packaging. this might sound like a huge complaint, well your right it is and i am surprized no one else mentioned it in their review.
0316023744|5.0|complete research on a never ending  story of the conflict. a perfect edition, for a addition to his other works on the subject. my wife said \\"another WWll book\\"? I replied \\" the book on WWll!<br />Good read, you will enjoy it!
B0085G0DH6|5.0|This remarkable recording, released over 30 years downstream from inception by ECM Records, captures the legendary, somewhat youthful Keith Jarrett \\"European Quartet\\", (also called \\"The Belonging Quartet\\" for their first album) with the highly-inventive Jan Garbarek on tenor sax and flute, and the driving, buoyant rhythmic tandem of Palle Danielsson on bass and Jon Christensen on drums in the group's last known recording session, live at Nakano Sun Plaza in Tokyo Japan on April 16, 1979. The songs and performances are as fresh today as they were then and are re-inventions of earlier EQ Jarrett songs. Each song is a separate sonic jewel, and some highlights are the 20 minute intense \\"Personal Mountains\\" with Danielsson and Christensen pouring on the heat for the mostly uptempo searing improvisations of Jarrett, Garbarek, and Christensen as well, eventually giving way to the early shimmering 3/4 time reflection of \\"Innocence\\". The wonderously beautiful ballad \\"So Tender\\" morphs from warm ballad to frenetic invention with Garbarek's finest solo of the date. And perhaps best of all the mercurial 28 minute \\"Oasis\\" with it's many different and wonderful dimensions, especially Garbarek's highly effective work on tenor and wooden flute and some amazing percussive Jarrett improvisations. And finally the excellence of the sizzling heavy-duty funk/gospel of \\"Chant of the Soil\\" with telling solos and support from Jarrett and Garbarek. This is my initial exposure to Keith Jarrett with this quartet and they produce fabulous, very impressive jazz that is stunning at times. My Highest Recommendation. Five INTENSE Stars! (7 tracks, based on an iTunes download; Times: Personal Mountains-21:12; Innocence-10:48; So Tender-13:27; Oasis-28:14; Chant of the Soil-14:53; Prism-11:15; and the encore New Dance-7:07. Note the actual individual track times.)

B00516ZWRE|4.0|Not that they would ever release anything that would even come close to disappointing their loyal fanbase, but Saxon's nineteenth full-length, 2011's \\"Call To Arms\\" is easily one of their best efforts of the past few years. It is a quintessential Saxon record, showing off the English band's no frills, meat-and-potatoes approach to writing heavy yet always somewhat tuneful hard rock/traditional heavy metal. It has excellent guitar work, catchy vocals, and a very solid rhythm section. And what about strong hooks? Check. And ample variety? Yep. Everything is in place, here, to make this another promising Saxon album, and probably one of the top ten hard rock releases of 2011.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Afterburner\\" and the opening \\"Hammer Of The Gods\\" are blistering cuts bolstered by propulsive, proto-speed metal tempos, muscular, belligerent riffing, and excellent soloing. (The latter also features a strong, grumbling bass line, and memorably big, Iron Maiden-like choruses.) \\"Back In 79\\" takes on a concertedly more mid-tempo approach with hard rock guitar licks, a soaring, shredding solo, and memorable vocal patterns in its anthemic choruses. \\"Surviving Against The Odds,\\" which sounds like AC-DC covering Judas Priest, returns the album to its up-tempo roots; but the next two tracks are more restrained and melodic hard rockers. \\"Mists Of Avalon\\" boasts epic, skyscraper harmonies, crunchy guitar hooks, and deliciously melodic, air-guitar-worthy soloing; and \\"Call To Arms\\" (the song), with its clean guitar strumming, power metal-esque vocals, and wailing melodic solo, is 50% hard rock and 50% power ballad. Next, the very catchy \\"Chasing The Bullet\\"'s rhythmically galloping beat, propulsive, groovy, slapped bass line, and more amazing soloing and memorable, concert-ready choruses, sounds as if it could have been ripped straight out of some long lost AC-DC notepad.<br /><br />\\"When Doomsday Comes (Hybrid Theory)\\" is a catchy mid-tempo march that has nice backing guitar harmonies, ripping, trade-off solos, and irresistible, Judas Priest-y choruses. But the main standout part in \\"Doomsday\\" has got to be its excellent keyboard solo! The Ozzy Osbourne-esque entitled \\"No Rest For The Wicked\\" brings back the familiarly hooky gallop of \\"Chasing The Bullet,\\" but does so in a crunchier, more riff-oriented fashion (it is filled with tough, serrated riffing), and also tucks in a brief bit of acoustic strumming in the outro. \\"Ballad Of The Working Man\\" is highlighted by a steady, grumbling bass bottom, a catchy, swinging groove, and Angus Young-ish vocals -- but it's the guitars that take over again, here, and do so with an impressive array of Thin Lizzy-styled twin guitar leads and piercing, ripping, epically high-flying solos. And the record's second title track, \\"Call To Arms (Orchestral Version),\\" sports orchestral backing flourishes, warm acoustic guitars, supple, Motorhead-inspired crooning, and noteworthy lyrics, thus making it an excellent set closer.<br /><br />Saxon do not disappoint on \\"Call To Arms.\\" This is a very good, extremely solid, eminently memorable, and immensely enjoyable album, even if it is not one that offers many surprises.es, ripping, trade-off solos, and irresistible, Judas Priest-y choruses.

0062082353|5.0|Since watching the movie \\"Act Of Valor\\" so many times that I was afraid of wearing out the DVD, I started ordering books about SEALs from Amazon.  I can't say that I have read every one, but I have come close, and this one is by far the very best!  The author was brutally honest, not only about his successes, but also his failures. In other words, \\"He Tells It Like It Was,\\" and is not afraid to pull punches when it comes to mistakes made by those up the chain of command.<br /><br />If you like first person action, this is the book!!  I particularly remember when, after hours of shooting insurgents who were hiding in a cemetery, he sat down with his back against a wall to rest.  He then noticed hundreds, if not thousands of empty casings on the roof from where he, and his fellow snipers had been shooting, or the time he fired right over the head of a US Marine officer to stop an insurgent from sneaking up on the Marine squad from the rear.  The following radio transmission was \\"classic.\\"<br /><br />BTW - One thing that repeatedly stood out was his great respect for US Marine Corps soldiers with whom he served.  I find that both honest and refreshing.<br /><br />Kent Williams (US Border Patrol - retired)
B005LAIHZY|3.0|I like Pixar films. I like those lovely and likable characters this animation studio continues to create - Woody and Buzz, Sulley and Mike, Lightning McQueen and Remy the gourmet mouse chef. I also like Merida, the heroine of Pixar's new film \\"Brave.\\" (She is the first female protagonist of the company's films.) And I tried to like the film itself, which is certainly entertaining, but fails to offer a story that this brave and independent heroine really needs. In short, Merida deserves a better story.<br /><br />The story begins promisingly. Merida is a princess of a Scottish clan, with formidable skills with a bow and arrow. Being dissatisfied with a marriage arranged by her parents, she obtains a magic spell from a witch living in the woods so that she can thwart the marriage plan. As you expect, Merida's conduct results in a terrible disaster that she must somehow fix on her own.<br /><br />The best part of the film is its visuals, especially those of Merida and her hair. Voice acting is also wonderful. Kelly Macdonald captures the spirit of strong-mined Princess Merida. Another good point is that the film sometimes seems having fun with genre conventions.. Witches are often depicted in a negative light, but in \\"Brave\\" the Witch (voice by Julie Walters) may be strange, but definitely not evil.<br /><br />But the weak storyline needs improvement. That Merida looks often selfish didn't bother me. We know she will change, and she actually does, but the point is how she changes. \\"Brave\\" does not give the heroine a real challenge. A big bad bear is not good enough. A considerable portion of the film's second half is spent on silly slapstick involving her young brothers. Curiously Merida, a skilled archer, is not given enough chance to show what she can do.<br /><br />\\"Brave\\" is better than last years' disappointment \\"Cars 2,\\" but the film, despite its interesting heroine, is still a letdown.
B00846REIS|4.0|Pretty good book, a lot of it seemed like it was stolen from fifty shades but whatever. It was a good book and I am excited to read the others! Def. more in depth on the sex part then fifty...so if you like that then get this book!
0345803493|4.0|As with 50 Shades and as many others have written, this is not a well-written book but it is fun to read nonetheless. I know that I came to really like Christian and his wit (and the banter between him and Anastasia). So 50 Shades Darker continues the story from book one with a natural progression. There are a few twists and turns, a lot of repetition (how many times can you have sex in a day?) and it lingers a little too much in some areas.<br /><br />But it was fun to read, easy to get through, and a great diversion from the day.<br /><br />Not my favorite from the three book series but a necessity to get to book 3.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Minus a few things here and there, the movie follows the book quite closely.  The production quality is outstanding.  Great movie for everyone.
0345803507|4.0|This trilogy is really a love story from exciting and flirtatious beginnings to settled and happy endings. Even though the series received a lot of publicity for the steamy sex scenes (and there are fewer and fewer as each book progresses) they are not really the crux of the storyline.<br /><br />Christian and Anastasia are likable characters and have enough chemistry between them to make for a believable relationship. This last book was a great way to end the series and it seemed to follow a natural progression in the story line of the first two books.<br /><br />I think I liked the first book the best since it was full of that new relationship fun (and heartache). The second book was good but seemed to linger a bit and this book was really good. Although I didn't pour through it the same way I did the first two.<br /><br />I also like the end of the book where we hear some of the events that happened earlier in the story line from the perspective of other characters.<br /><br />So, my title is 'a great ending - or is it? because I'm not sure if the story can pick up from here. It is pretty settled. But you never know if popular characters will return in some fashion.<br /><br />A recommended series for fun reading.
0307278255|4.0|I bought this book for a summer reading assignment but little did I know that it would turn out to be an amazing book! Jhumpa Lahiri writes the book flawlessly and the stories connect with each other perfectly. Overall, it was an enjoyable book and everyone should give it a shot.<br />As for Amazon, the book was shipped out quickly and I received it in perfect condition.
0425263908|1.0|I was flipping through my kindle trying to find some good new books.  Bared to You kept popping up, so I decided to take a gander.  I bought the book on my kindle based on a review saying that it was like Fifty Shades of Grey but written by a better, seasoned author.  I began to read with the knowledge that it'd be extremely similar to Fifty.  I was prepared for similarities but I was not prepared for how awfully put together the story is.  I must compare because I have read all of the Fifty books of course, so I can't say that I'd hate the book if I hadn't read the series.  But, I do hate it.  I hate it so much I couldn't finish it.  The characters were flat, predictable.  Where Fifty had a love story that was believable, the two main characters seemed forced to have this attraction out of nowhere.  It almost seemed as though the author wrote the book real quick after the success of Fifty just to capitalize on what people like now.  I guess it worked because I bought it :( .  But...the story seems false, rushed and just...all wrong.  I will never purchase a book from this author ever again.  For shame.

Overall, it was an enjoyable book and everyone should give it a shot.<br />As for Amazon, the book was shipped out quickly and I received it in perfect condition.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Perry is great. lots of fun.  fun little sidefacts on other agents. funny comments from major monacle. extra secret games with balloony and more! must have for die hard Perry fans.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I have this game on my kindle fire it was really fin unroll level 40 I got stuck. you have to turn your volume all the way down or off so I turned it all the way down and the door did not open so I kept trying and it did not work. later I found out that it was made for ipad and ipod. so now I don't know what to do. if someone has a kindle tire and knows how to turn the volume on mute that would be great if you posted it on here.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This starts off slow, steadily increases the tension. I could not really predict the ending or how we got there. For the most part I did enjoy the book. The author should have eliminated the last few pages. The ending dragged on way too long. I finished in order to say I did but wasted my time.
B001DHXT2U|5.0|We weren't sure we ordered the right movie at first....but this is the better of the two. Dvd arrived in the condition we expected. Would buy from them again
034580404X|3.0|I'd been warned that these books were very poorly written and that I'd be frustrated by that so I knew what I was getting myself into. Still, I wanted to see what all the hype was about. It's true, the  story line is poorly developed. Major dramatic events are introduced and resolved within a couple pages. The character development is weak and often irrational. The book isn't quite sure if it is a love story, a mystery, or an action adventure book and these elements are not woven together in any sort of meaningful way. Definitely not a literary work of art.<br /><br />But none of that is why you buy these books. They are cheap, easy, mindless reads that are fairly entertaining, when you don't let yourself get mad about what they are missing. Take them for what they are and enjoy...but don't say you weren't warned!
B00004WG2F|5.0|I enjoyed this move about a family living in Montana and the issues of their rugged life during those times.  Colonel Willian Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) leaves the military over the cruelty of the US Government to the American Indians.  He is raising his three sons without his wife who couldn't bear the lifestyle in Montana where they moved.  He manages the ranch with his friend One Stab who is an Indian, who was in the military with him, and his ranch hand Decker.  William Ludlow has three sons.  Alfred is the oldest and he is an intelligent and aspiring  politician. Tristan (Brad Pitt) is the middle son and he lives a wild life and is best friends with the Indian One Stab. He lives in the wild and hunts and One Stab trains him in many Indian ways. The youngest son Samuel is attending college in the east at Harvard and returns home with his fianc&eacute;.  WW 1 breaks out and Samuel is going to Canada to join the army and fight the Germans.  His two older brothers go with him more to protect him than to really join the war effort.  Samuel is killed and......<br /><br />The tragedy of two surviving brothers returning home after losing their brother is a tale of sadness.  The entire family and their friends are changed for life by that event and the others that follow.  Not only did I like the movie I liked the spectacular cinematography of the area they lived in and the depiction of life in those times.  I looked at the movie as entertainment and I enjoyed the acting as well as the storyline.<br /><br />I didn't want to tell too much of the story as the movie is good and you will enjoy it.  It is a movie about family, love and tragedy.  It is well worth watching.  I recommend this movie to you.

B006Y5H74W|5.0|I absolutely love the Smash TV series. Now I can watch any episode I want without commercials. I am addicted to this show.Love the music, dancing and acting! Can't wait for next season!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I usually read books that aren't so mind-numbing.  One of my recent favorites is Melpomene's Tears by Jonas Hyde: [[ASIN:B008EF2HZY Melpomene's Tears]] - If you've read that, then you know what kind of books I enjoy.<br /><br />That being said, I found the entire Fifty Shades trilogy entertaining.  While it will never be mistaken for a classic, sometimes the mind needs to just shut down and get lost for a few hours.  Don't let that be a knock on James' work, even Fifty Shades has a place and is well worth the read.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Really good love story between the 2 main people, and lots of sexual bits to it, but it has a story to it and once u start reading it you don't want to put the books down.
0345803485|5.0|These are FUN books! They are entertaining page turners - I laughed out loud at some of the bad reviews for these books....<br />there are a lot of sexually repressed people out there. This is entertaining fiction/fantasy, yes there is a lot of sex and I did skip over some of it, because it got too repeatative, but I kept reading because I love love, and I loved the characters chemistry. It was spot on. The e-mails that they sent back and forth showed dry whit and were funny. Some reviewer's have been slamming the female character Ana for her simplicity. Anna is only 22 years old. Her behavior and her comments are that of a 22 year old. Ana (the character) is not a woman who has traveled, and has been in the workforce for 15 years.<br />I really enjoyed these three books, the second one in the series was my favorite. How I found out about these books... My dog had died, and my friend gave me these books to read, these books eased my greiving and I am greateful. When I read these books I got to go somewhere else for awhile that was fun and entertaining. A great first effort for this author!
B0086700CM|5.0|if ur the kind of person who likes to beat your own high score or play against friends beating each others score this is your game but if ur not like that than get it anyway cause its sooooooo fun!!!!!!!
0316056871|5.0|I picked this book up at an airport to read during my travels. I fly out and back every week and go through a ton of books. Bossypants is extremely funny and an enjoyable read. I just know everyone sitting around me on my flights must have thought I was crazy because I just could not stop laughing out loud. Even if you are not a serious Tina Fey fan the book is plenty entertaining.
