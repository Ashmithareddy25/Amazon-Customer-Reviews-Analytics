B003O86FMW|1.0|How this became a sensation and a successful film is almost beyond me.<br />An example of how the &#34;Marketing Machine&#34; can sell anything.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Was expecting much on this and certainly wasn't a work of art.  But, surprisingly, it did have some good action and a passable story.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very clever with interesting twists and turns. Several times I thought the story had reached a conclusion, only to find there was more to be told.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game and easy to learn too. cant wait to seen what else this game has in store. I absolutely love it. and I'm saying this for the credits by the way
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It keeps my son busy, quiet and happy. Even if it only last 10 minutes it is worth every second.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is easy to use and a great app. I use it all the time and love it. Get this!
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|Enjoyed it thoroughly!  Was sad but gave a real insight into a teachers attachment to his pupil and the values that were passed on.  There are many life lessons here if you're looking.  Wish more movies were as wholesome.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie is awesome and Christopher Nolan makes batman as real as he can with this sweet dark knight film
B0054PSY2W|5.0|I got this as a gift for my husband.  It is his favorite movie.  I could definitely watch it over and over.
B000X418UE|5.0|Great action and all-star cast.  Just excellent!  Nicholas Cage as the geek FBI guy is so endearing and his relationship with Sean Connery's character is solid not just scripted.
B000MYFILK|5.0|I can watch this movie a million times and never tire of it!!  Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn at their finest.  Don't just rent, buy it.  The whole family will enjoy it!
6305127646|5.0|Val Kilmer changing character and personality all the time in this movie is fascinating.  Can't imagine how one can turn it on and off like that.  Intriguing story and excellent ending.
B009AMANBA|5.0|[[ASIN:0985394986 Profiles in Leadership: From Caesar to Modern Times]]<br /><br />There have been many movies about Abraham Lincoln.  This is one of the best in terms of giving us a portrayal of Lincoln the person, the personality, the challenges and the times.  The acting, the setting, the scenery, the people and the political atmosphere are splendid.  The direction, of course, is marvelous.<br /><br />We get a feel for who Abraham Lincoln really was an individual, a leader and why he was our greatest President.  For those who wish a longer, more detailed and even more compelling portrait, I suggest the Lincoln Mini Series starring Hal Holbrook.  I believe the Mini may be the finest of all the bio films done on Lincoln.  That being said, I strongly recommend the latest Lincoln without question or reservation.<br /><br />Emilio Iodice, author of Profiles in Leadership from Caesar to Modern Times, North American Business Press, 2013.
0385342020|5.0|I absolutely love this book! I got this hardcover book for less than three dollars. You cant beat that price anywhere!! The story was definitely amazing had me laughing the whole time. Couldn't put it down. I recommend this to book to everyone
0743270754|5.0|[[ASIN:0985394986 Profiles in Leadership: From Caesar to Modern Times]]<br /><br />There have been more books written about Lincoln than perhaps any other personality.  Even so, his life, his methods of leadership and his times are still fertile ground to delve into and develop.  This book shows us that the more we know about him, the more we want to know.  It reveals his amazing sense of self confidence in that he was willing and able to surround himself with political rivals for the benefit of the nation.  The country came first, not his ego and not any personal interest. Lincoln focused on his mission to save the Union, end slavery and bring the United States back on track to stress the great values that created our republic based on the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the Bill or Rights.  Doris Kearns Goodwin depicts a Lincoln of perseverance, patience, good will, wisdom, humility, cunning and bravery.  Few leaders could succeed as he did with so many forces opposed to him a person and a President.<br /><br />This book must be read by anyone interested in leadership and anyone interested in Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />Emilio Iodice, author of Profiles in Leadership from Caesar to Modern Times, North American Business Press, 2013.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I like this book because it was interesting and had a bit of Greek mythology in it it also was very suspenseful.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a great game. It keeps me busy and its fun!<br />I love Disney so of course I decided to try this game and I can't stop playing it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|WOW I can't believe how fun it may have been in the ice age  this is the best game ever never going back
B00CH26TL8|4.0|didn't find it very interesting but i am sure many people will, is not bad specially if you can it free.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is a very well put together game with multiple levels of entertainment and genius. It also is very fun to play.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game, and find it rather addicting... My whole family even plays it, and we all love it! PLAY IT bruh!
B008HTQ28K|3.0|I don't know whether the author wrote it himself or used a ghost writer but the John Grisham recipe was followed down to the last full stop and comma. Entertaining but not a compelling read
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun especially if you love despicable me my little brother loves this game he's the one that showed it to me  he wouldn't let me play on his kindle so I got it on mine and ever since I've loved every second of it
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|The best book I've read in a year.<br /><br />Excellent and compelling writing. The story is heart breaking and the characters brought tenderness and reality from all perspectives. EXCELLENT!
1401938906|5.0|brilliant book with brilliant ideas. what alife we can have if we put these ideas into practice. a wonderful book
0375704027|5.0|This is a good book. Read it if you want to read a good book about mental health or such.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A very good book with great storytelling and very interesting characters. Looking forward to the next book by this author.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I like that it gives me options of what I want to do with the video I'm looking at.  Just what I was looking for.
0767903862|5.0|A great read. I learned so much about Australia - things that I didn't even know that I wanted to know.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|So far I'm very happy with it. It's a great price for a fairly large camera bag. Lots of storage and little compartments that are perfect for most photographers. Would definitely recommend.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Many different puzzles good graphics. An enjoyable way to pass the time.  I would recommend this game to others to download.
0307279189|5.0|One of my friends kept injuring herself and was told that she needed to give up running AND get knee replacement surgery. Instead she chose to read this book. Upon finishing it, she changed her shoes and ALL her running issues went away. Her pain? Gone! Injuries? No longer! Her speed? Like the wind! Her distance? Holy cow! She's now running marathons regularly and she will tell you that this book changed her life more than any other book she's ever read.<br /><br />Of course I had to give it a read myself. The verdict? Love. It has become one of my all-time favorites. It reads like fiction, but it's a true story filled with fascinating and helpful information for the runner or the would-be runner. It took several pages for me to *really* get into it, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. If you love running or competitive sports, read this book. There are sections where you will be on the edge of your seat, cheering for one runner over another. You will be amazed and in awe by what some of the characters do. It's a fantastic read!<br /><br />Yes to this book!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I feel that I get a good weather report for the cities I am traveling to and it helps me know what to pack.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Fast delivery. Thanks I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE YEARS AGO AND ENJOYED VERY MUCH.I HOPE THIS VERSiON IS AS GOOD.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't post very much on Facebook because I don't appreciate Facebook using our photos, likes and shares.  It would be better if they would protect our privacy.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Nice and simple and it works as  described. A good little tool. 8 more works as required by this review.
B00F35BV64|5.0|A very enjoyable with a really good cast. Well written and exciting. I will but this movie for my collection.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  If you own a dog or not, you will be moved by this touching story of love and loyalty.  I am amazed it was not more mainstream.  It's one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Your entire family will enjoy watching it together.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just got this app and so far I think it's pretty good. I rode a horse once and I instantly fell in love, and having this app reminds me of how much fun I had.
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|One of my favorites of al their albums that they have released since I was in college in the 60's.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Lots of fun and action.  Great way to spend time and not be bored. Does take a little while to reload.
B007XF4J70|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my 84 year old stepdad.  He loves old movies and is very happy with this dvd.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's fun in a sick kind of way, but the fact that you actually learn about disease vectors puts this over the top in terms of value for money. The only downside is lack of replayability. Once you've beaten all disease types, there's very little to keep you playing.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Setterfield creates a fascinating story with plenty of atmosphere and mystery.  I loved this book.  Colorful characters and gothic settings made this mystery hard to put down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was already in love by the end of season one and now by the end of season three it is borderline obsession!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I play Minecraft with my grandson and I bought this for him and he loves Legos so this was a great gift for him.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|This was a good movie and an interesting adaptation of Kings' story. Readers of the book will like that it follows the story fairly closely. There are a few changes, some I like, some I don't. Fans of The Walking Dead will feel like this is a reunion show.
B00CEB5QU2|1.0|This device was working only for a few weeks. It stopped working now. I tried with different SD cards and USB drive, not working.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I watched this after seeing so many positive reviews and I have to concur with all of them. Karl Urban is a very believable tough guy Judge Dredd. The action sequences in this movie are very intense and well shot. The plot is simple and straight forward making it for an easy viewing without pandering or dumbing it down.
B00E7PQVHK|5.0|...and I play a lot of Android games.  Fun and addicting.  Runs fine on my Kindle Fire HD.  You will get your moneys worth as it is a pretty long game.
3836538725|5.0|wonderful book great images & reproduction of images i saw work in a Toronto museum and the book was incredibly faithful to the originals
1416955070|5.0|I need to say I had no interest in reading this series since by the name of the title and, sad to say, cover page, made me think twice about it. I went on a road trip recently and my cousin had it available and I had run out of reading material.<br /><br />I could not put down the book and as soon as we found a book store, bought the rest of the series, they were that good.<br /><br />Clarissa Clare is a fantastic interpreter for her characters and the subtle themes throughout her books follow through until the very last page.<br />I am now waiting very impatiently for her next book, which isn't coming out until next year.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I was very impressed with this little chip, for the price I feel it cannot be beat and with an integrated GPU what more can you ask for? I like how it comes with software that allows you to easily over clock it, I had it up to 4.5Ghz with no stability issues but after a few hours in shogun 2 I started smelling a toaster and it wasn't breakfast. So needless to say I let it cool down and backed it back to 4.2Ghz and haven't noticed any problems and that is with the stock fan+heatsink combo, so bravo AMD. Returning to the GPU, I can't give an accurate review of that because I use a gtx 650. But, I highly recommend this for anyone trying to save a few bucks(or more) on a performance build.
B003IKMR0U|3.0|The objective is easy to explain and their is only one mechanism:<br /><br />You are a brain eating zombie and the dice are your victims.<br /><br />Pick three dice from the cup and roll. Keep footprints in your rolling set and score Brains and Bangs by placing the dice showing them to one side.<br /><br />Replace scored dice and go again.<br /><br />Three bangs and you die, \\"lose the break\\" and pass the dice.<br /><br />You can stop any time you want, bank your brains and pass the dice.<br /><br />First one to thirteen brains wins.<br /><br />The Yahtzee Factor is offset by something clever: the dice have easy, medium and hard wins \\"coded in\\" by adjusting the ratio of brains, bangs and footprints, and are color-coded to indicate which ones you are throwing so you can make a judgment on whether it is wise to go on, or better to bank.<br /><br />It's a clever idea for a game using easy to understand mechanics that have been lifted from games older than Steve Jackson has been alive, mashed-up and refaced.<br /><br />The dice come in a card tub which is NOT used to rattle them, just to hold them while the game progresses. I reckon a pouch might have been a better way to go, but maybe not. I keep my Cthulhu dice bits in the same tub.<br /><br />Three stars because the boredom onset is quick and the replay value low. This game is something to do while you are doing something else or waiting to do something else.<br /><br />Even so; Recommended.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I love this little gadget and the price on Amazon is a lot better than anywhere else I've seen. I'm a photo-nut so having the capability to immediately download the pictures from my camera, (yes, I still use one of those! :-), to my MAC.....that's HUGE!!!!<br />I suggest this to anyone who loves to take pics, view them and edit them right away!
1452658145|5.0|I was impressed with the amount of work Mr. Tough put into researching this audio book.  He incorporated the many ways children learn in schools, and ways children from different backgrounds may need to be educated differently.  He even included a section about incorporating a chess program into a school to help the kids learn thinking skills, and succeed in a different way.  It opened up my mind to the possibilities we as a nation might be able to incorporate into our schools to also inspire greatness within the constraints present. I recommend all individuals in a position to influence the way schools are run listen to this audio program first!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I saw this in the theater and bought it on Blu-Ray the day that it was released.  Extremely entertaining and Chris Pine as the young Captain Kirk and Zachary Quinto as the young Mr. Spock totally works for me.  Their appearance and similarities to the original characters is extraordinary (IMHO).
0345803485|3.0|I HAVE ALREADY READ ALL THREE OF THE BOOKS.  ORDERED IT FOR A FAMILY MEMBER......THEY ARE ALSO ENJOYING IT. THANKS
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would recommend this trilogy to anyone! It was very tastefully written and very enticing from one chapter to the next.
0345803493|3.0|I HAVE ALREADY READ ALL THREE OF THE BOOKS.  ORDERED IT FOR A FAMILY MEMBER......THEY ARE ALSO ENJOYING IT. THANKS
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love this game. Its super addicting. Just wish it didn't take so much energy to play each game. Would recommend this game to anyone who likes picture search games.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Mystery thriller. Easy read. I was looking for a book to read after Gone Girl and this was perfect but includes more legal references.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my niece just absolutely love poking dave and making him giggle. she may not know how to play but see happiness on her face.makes downloading worth it.
B00007KWHG|5.0|It has a lot of the greatest hits which is why I bought it.  Listen to it all the time.
B0049985XW|5.0|This movie is a must for any Bogart fan.  Now if you're used to seeing him play a hard-boiled detective, this will throw you for a loop.  Bogart's Dobbs is an unforgettable character.  A man who becomes obsessed with his gold or his &#34;goods&#34; as he called them.  Walter Huston is excellent as the old prospector and Tim Holt gives a solid performance as the man who starts out where Dobbs does, but follows a much lighter path than his friend.  All in all, it's a terrific story involving characters who take a real-life approach to things and you can even learn some about gold prospecting.  Admittedly I knew almost nothing about it before watching this movie but I definitely know more now!  I have watched this several times and plan on watching it several more.  Enjoy!
B00DONVMFM|5.0|Great book, with really good pictures!  Is helpful to me in understanding what's going on in the series!!!  Very interesting!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is very effective. It has a large screen and is easy to use. Well designed. A banner across the top displays ads and is rather large but I guess that's the point of free apps.
1250027624|5.0|It was very interesting....love the stories, they helped me understand the characters and the era better!!  I look forward to finishing the entire book!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Fruit Ninja is a great app to have on your kindle fire. It's a fun app to help you past the time.
1250006341|5.0|Very interesting pictures & stories on the characters...helps me understand the story and the era that this television series is about!
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja Free is a great app to have on your kindle fire. This is a fun app to have in your collection.
B004021BWK|5.0|Fit great. Easy for my daughter to put on and take off. Best of all - No stinky kid feet!
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Born Sinner (Deluxe Edition) is a hot cd to have in your collection. J. Cole did his thing on this cd.
0812415086|5.0|A very good book
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After hearing so much about this book on talk shows and in newspaper reviews I decided to check it out.  Don't believe the  hype, it seems like another typical trashy freaky sex filled novel.  The events are pretty redundant and can get boring after a while.  I don't think I will bother with the second book.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I found it very hard to get into this book and keep track of the characters.  Dark story with a sad story like.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|The disc and case were better than expected.  You couldn't even tell is the disc had ever been listened to.
B007IK44CK|5.0|awesome action packed movie, worth watching, again and again!!!!! special effects are great. mission impossible has always been one of my favorites
1609611543|5.0|I do use some things this book recommends not to eat.such as corn, But, wish I could get the gumption to go cold turkey and listen to this great advice.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this for Netflix...cant wait till I can use it for other things!!  They are working on HBO GO and Hulu plus and I am sure many other services.
B001LM1456|4.0|Like all the Avengers movies, this one has great special effects and stays true to the familiar story of The Hulk.  It does a good job of presenting the human side of the character and making the superhero somewhat believable.
B00005N56Y|5.0|I love Clifford Curzon from the moment more than 60 yrs ago when I heard him playing Mozart and bought my first<br />long playing vinyl record.
B006RXPSLK|1.0|Don't know what all the hype is about, thought it was horrible acting and not funny at all! Don't waste your time, it's stoner humor
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Live the game, despise the gophe!  Some of the holes seem too difficult at times, gets frustrting when you have to make multiple attempts to master them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|On level 41 have not spent any cash great fun for every one come have fun it's free try it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really cool(: I like the graphics and the challenges it gives you. I would recommend this game to any one who likes a room escapes
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My wife bought this DVD to show to her class when they earn the privilege of being allowed to see a movie in class. It works and came in a new cover box as if I bought it in a store.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I think this is one of the best jigsaw apps ever. Try it!<br />:D So it has in-app purchasing. Who cares?!
0470913029|4.0|This is a good book.  I would recommend it to my friends.  Have shared it with others and they have ordered it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a dream come true. The calculator is always accurate and it is very easy to access. You will be very pleased with this calculator. So I'm telling you. Use it NNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWW. IT WOULD BE YOUR LIST OF YOU DIDN'T.  :) &lt;3
B000JIHP88|5.0|The leaves are adorable.  The music is so relaxing.  My grandson loves it!!!  Easy to assemble and fun to own
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Loved every episode; couldn't stop watching!  Can't wait till it can been seen again. Would recommend this for anyone to wath.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|This is fun for the little ones. My grandchildren have lots of fun spring the puzzles. Even the one year old likes to try.
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|A friend of mine introduced me to Caro's music recently and I instantly fell in love with her sound and lyrics! So happy to have found the CD from an Amazon seller! Thanks!
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|It makes you think...and reason...and think some more. It is crazy and frustrating fun. My 6year old grandchild could figure out a few levels in the beginning but it is for older kids and adults as the difficulty levels get tricky.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This is one of the worst apps I bought on my kindle. It is a waste of storage. It lags all the time. I don't recommend it to anyone at all.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing this game for about two years ago I haven't found any other bingo games that compare to it it is fun it just needs more daily credits
B000002MI4|5.0|Excellent album at a great price. I have listened to the album so much, that I know every note. Elvis Costello's Juliet Letters is a work of art.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Great album. Back to the roots. Unfortunate that Bill Ward didn't come out to play but, beside that, one of the best Sabbath albums to hit the market. I don't want to post a spoiler alert, but if you have their first album, you will like how this one ends.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This Album has the most inventive music I've ever heard. It's truly strange and beautiful.  Buy this album. Listen to it all the way through. Don't use it as background music. It's an entire immersive experience. Bath in it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never written a review before. However, this book is special to me. I don't have a serious disease or anything but I really loved this book. I noticed lots of people tell a basic outline of the plot when they review books, but I don't think I will. Instead I will try to explain why I read this book. Lots of people at my school read this book and loved it, but considering the people at my school... I was quite unsure if I would actually like it. This is a book that I would tell anyone to read. I think the few people who gave this book a lower rate did so because they thought it was to sad or should have been more about the cancer. Personally I don't understand this, if they wanted a happier book or a book more about cancer than they should have read a different book. Anyway I really loved the book and my only complaint is that it will be hard to find a book better than this one.
B008RF0M9O|5.0|I notice my expensive headphones padding were fraying. I thought I would have to buy more headphones. These were replacement pad and now my headphones good a new. worth the price!
B005LAII80|5.0|Unfortunately I didn't see this movie till just a month ago, I'm can't I hadn't seen it earlier!  The one liners in this movie are masterful, and Karl Urban's portrayal of Dredd was spot on.  Perfect constant scowl!
B009JZZRGE|3.0|I became hooked on this show when I signed up for Amazon Prime and binged on the first three seasons. I waited impatiently for the fourth season to become available. Finally, $0.00! But I'm halfway through the series and it's such a letdown. The plot lines have strayed to relationships, while the bread-and-butter stories -- legal and courtroom battles -- are pushed to the side. I'm tired of skipping though the stuff I don't like (and even find repulsive).<br /><br />Here are the Top Ten things I dislike about the fourth season. If most of them don't change, I'm outta here.<br /><br />1. Nick has to go! He's skeevy, ugly and dragging the whole show down.<br />2. Put Kalinda back to work. Hang up her baseball bat and black belt and keep her out of the bedroom. (2014 update: I hear Kalinda's leaving the show. Whew!)<br />3. There's not enough of Eli! Give us more... but not of his personal life. Keep him on the campaign trail.<br />4. Forget the Will-and-Alicia romance. There's no chemistry there. (2014: Still, I miss Will. Finn Polmar doesn't do anything for me.)<br />5. More Will-and-Diane! Their working relationship, I mean. But please don't put them in the bedroom. (Ditch all the bedroom scenes while you're at it. No one needs to go there.) More Cary at work, too. (2014: Cary is a loser.)<br />6. Give us more parenting savvy. Zach and Grace are great kids facing universal teen issues. Show us how Alicia and Peter help them through. (2014: shocker about Zach. Miss his teenage self.)<br />7. Spare us Alicia's mom! Veronica is ridiculous. (And give her brother, Owen, something to do other than mope.)<br />8. Spare us Peter's mom! Except the scenes with her nurse companion. He's a hoot! But don't make it into a May-December romance.<br />9. Give us more of the political back-biting of Peter's campaign. It's delicious!<br />10. More courtroom and legal drama, please. But keep the violence and graphic images off-stage, as they were at first. Oh, and bring the firm out of bankruptcy, and put us all out of our misery. (2014: Yay! Florrick Agos & Lockhardt are back in the LG offices! I love Louis Canning... wish he'd join, too.)<br /><br />Thank you in advance, and I hope to see you next season!: Yay! Florrick Agos & Lockhardt are back in the LG offices! I love Louis Canning... wish he'd join, too.)    Thank you in advance, and I hope to see you next season!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater first but felt it was needed in my collection.  I really liked the movie.  It was more from the CIA perspective than the attack on Osama Bin Laden and was handled very well especially how it incorporated real events into the storyline.
B005PK56TA|5.0|What a fun show!  Finally something different than the same old standard formats for TV and movies.  Highly recommend the first season.  Haven't seen the second season, which is different characters/actors, new story, etc. what I gathered from the summary.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This doesn't really follow the book that much but it was still entertaining enough to make me anxious for the next two movies to come out.  I consider this a great addition to my Lord of the Rings trilogy set.
0345529057|5.0|This is an excellent buy. Never thought that I would get these four books for that price. Would recommend this for any game of thrones fan
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|After seeing &#34;The History of the Eagles&#34;, I wanted to own all of the early albums. The packaging of this boxed set attempts to retain all of the early album artwork, which is very nostalgic. The price for 6 albums was way too good to pass up.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|Great game if you love star wars and pinball, then this game is for you. VERY impressed by the graphics and the quality of the sound.  No complaints so far.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|Cute movie with some life lessons for children. My daughter loved it and has watched it several times and enjoyed it each time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is easy and fun game-that can challenge you to beat your last score. It is addicting- as I will keep playing!
B00915G6SU|5.0|Great DVD, shame it had to come to an end, but I think I will be keeping all the DVD's I can find. Your company has helped me buy all these great DVD's and I am looking forward to shopping with you in the future.<br />Thank You<br />Basil
1623420148|5.0|I really liked this book.  Infact, I'm going to try to find more from this author and hope the rest of her books (if she has more) are just as well written as this one is.<br /><br />I know the story is a romance/comedy.  But I felt I could actually be watching this on TV or in a movie or something.  A short tv series but still.  Unlike a recent book I read, the first few chapters really drew me in and I wanted to keep on reading.  The humor's great, it's not terribly sickening love story and it has very likeable characters.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is a great, great movie. I mean, really great. Not because of plot, or pacing, or layering, or special effects -- though all of those are pretty darn stellar -- but great because the people who made it cared deeply about staying true to the Dredd character. You can tell, because of the obvious thought, caring, and detail that went into their effort. The surest giveaway that this movie is more than it seems is that Dredd's helmet is never removed -- his full face is never revealed. Brilliant. Dredd-the-movie is more of a character study than anything else, though disguised, ironically and self-referentially, as an action flick. Karl Urban's portrayal of Dredd is perfect -- conveying a deeply sympathetic character, flawed and striving, instead of the all-too-usual cardboard-cutout action hero. In this movie, Dredd is someone that you actually want to get to know, and someone you miss when the movie ends. The supporting actors and actresses are superb and again carry much richer characters than a typical action flick. This is a movie made by people who cared, and it shows. Five stars and fingers crossed for a sequel!
0316776963|5.0|This is my first David Sedaris book to read, after having listened to him read his book, Holidays on Ice.<br />David's voice is unique and hilarious just in itself, and his voice comes through in the book as well.<br />I find Me Talk Pretty One Day to be very very funny: he will be telling a little story about childhood and then come up with very random words and experiences that make it truly hysterical.<br />I can't wait to read more of his work!
B00003CX9W|5.0|This purchase came through in record time and was in great condition. I was very happy to send this to someone as a birthday gift-and they loved it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First.... WOW! Second..... READ IT! If I remember right the very first installment was a freebie so I thought WTH... I'll check it out. Good move, I'm a tight wad when it comes to books and this one sucked me in from the beginning. The rest are priced right and author has some great insight when it comes to his readers and marketing his work.<br /><br />What an awesome story, which just gets better as you progress through the series to come. Well written, captivating, at times impossible to put down. I am one who finds it difficult to find a book I think is worth the time to read or to try to read. Sometimes there isn't an adequate description accompanying the book (jacket - or in this case a kindle version) to perk my interest enough to spend hard earned money on it. I can go through a hundred book descriptions and reviews before I venture into a new author or premise that sounds like it is going to be something I will be happy I read. Wool was not a disappointment! Neither were the others that followed.<br />I think I would have been just as happy reading the \\"prequel\\" first, but the \\"ahhh haaa\\" moments wouldn't have been as potent as they were when read in the order written. I finished them both in about a week and started the newest (Dust) 2 days ago finishing the second half in one reading because I just HAD TO KNOW.... Great Characters, Great story, easy to read and the sci-fi aspect is not that far fetched for the most part.<br />I'm not sure how he tops this... but I'll be watching to find out what he comes up with next.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Amazing book, well written and worth the read. Love Jace and Simon they are my favorite characters out of all her people
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I never thought I would read books about teens and vampires and love them, but I love these. Seeing them as films is every bit as much fun as reading the books.
B00A27X972|3.0|Premise: A socially awkward alien lands Earthside, naked on a Cambridge street...<br /><br />And for a while, as Matt Haig builds from this premise, it's funny! The Humans begins quite wonderfully with the arrival of an alien who can barely disguise his contempt towards humans and believes clothing is optional. The humor works because of our extraterrestrial narrator's terrific voice, which is matter of fact and superior. For example, the first piece of \\"literature\\" he reads is an issue of Cosmopolitan, which leads to this pithy discussion of magazines:<br /><br />  \\"Magazines are very popular, despite no human's ever feeling better for having read them. Indeed, their chief purpose is to generate a sense of inferiority in the reader that consequently leads to a feeling of needing to buy something, which the humans then do, and then feel even worse, and so need to buy another magazine to see what they can buy next. It is an eternal and unhappy spiral that goes by the name of capitalism, and it is really quite popular.\\"<br /><br />I would have liked an entire book of this: just a doofy alien in human form walking around the modern world trying--and failing--to make sense of it.<br /><br />Wishes never come true, however, so the last half of the book ditches the humor and devolves into New Age mumbo jumbo. The plot is unoriginal. Basically an alien comes to save Earth from too much knowledge, learns to appreciate humans, and abandons his old alien life to become a regular Joe Schmo. To supplement this lack of plot, Haig tries to explore the meaning of life through our bumbling old alien narrator, whose voice becomes instantly less charming as soon as he's humanized.<br /><br />The moment someone expressly searches for the meaning of life is the moment I roll my eyes. Sure I find meaning aplenty in books, but it must arise organically through the natural interaction of characters and their environments. Even worse, the meaning of life discovered by Haig's alien is moreclichéd than a Hallmark card. There are a ton of lines like this at the end that made me figuratively gag:<br /><br />  \\"To experience beauty on Earth, you needed to experience pain and to know mortality. That is why so much that is beautiful on this planet has to do with time passing and the Earth turning. Which might also explain why to look at such natural beauty was to also feel sadness and a craving for a life unlived.\\"<br /><br />There are tons of quotes about how \\"love is life\\" and how \\"it's only through our flaws that we can truly appreciate humankind.\\" By this point, I'd mostly checked out, hoping the narrator had one last good joke in him about Catholics. (He didn't.)<br /><br />The reason the alien comes to Earth is to destroy a mathematical proof. So here's some reviewing math for The Humans: smart-alecky alien who makes fun of humankind (4 stars) + heavy-handed existential tripe (2 stars) = 3 stars. Boom, math.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Since 1989, I have been a huge fan of the death metal genre. Carcass is always in the top 10 list due to my immeasurable infatuation for the glorious Necrotism album, of which contains the greatest death metal track \\"Corporal Jigsore Quandary\\". Then, we were gifted with the masterfully melodic Heartwork. That said, it is hard to imagine I would condemn their follow-up album. Swan song felt like an intentional middle finger to fans of not only Carcass, but of the genre, as well. It was not enjoyable carrying a love/hate relationship with Carcass for 17 years, thus I am elated to exclaim Carcass has decided to kiss and makeup with fans in the form of Surgical Steel. Rather than waste time blathering about what makes it so astounding, I will simply encourage any fan of metal music, or people with ears that enjoy superb aural pleasures, to obtain this album with all haste. I highly encourage obtaining a version with bonus tracks as they enhance the flow of the album--they should never have been cut from the standard release. A new Carcass album is a reality many of us never thought would be a reality, but it is here and giving the genre a lesson on how to do proper metal music. Let us hope there is more new Carcass on the horizon without a 17 year waiting period. Welcome back, and all is forgiven pertaining to Swan Song.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|It's Ellie Goulding.  If you're on this page, you probably like her already.  Buy it.  You'll like it.<br /><br />I saw her open for Bruno Mars and had no idea who she was, but I was quickly won over by her energy and unique voice.  All my friends have picked it up too.<br /><br />Yeah, I said that in another review for another of her albums.  Same deal.  If you're reading this, you've already made up your mind.
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd doesn't have the huge budget but it also doesn't sacrifice it's gritty soul in exchange for that budget. It doesn't cater well to families and kids but who cares? Dredd is a great example of true fans of a character making the best they can without a big studio chomping away at it to try to enhance profits.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I have many of their albums and enjoy this collection also. I recomment it highly. I love the sounds in my car.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It has very useful features which are very easy to use. The alarm is easily set and works well with a variety of call tunes.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is a good season for Good Wife. The characters are well defined and the writers throw in a curve most every episode.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|A good, easy to use app. that has a very clear face. It is also capable of intricate calculations which I find particularly useful.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|This was a gift from the tooth fairy to my 5 year old. He loved it. He has another older one and he was racing them for weeks. Great inexpensive toy.
B0035KTIOQ|5.0|Dire Straits second album is one of the best, great sound, a pleasure to listen.<br />The vinyl is top quality,
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|I've had this product for a month, and it is great. It looks great, and is so slim that it doesn't any bulk to my phone.
B00C061I3K|5.0|One of the best albums of the year, great sound.<br />For everyone, not just fans of the band, a great oldies feeling.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Been using this in my tower since i first built it 3 years ago. Got a decent graphics card and the processor can keep up with just about any game. These processors are great for OC'ing as well. Get a liquid cooling system, and you can get your GHZ to the upwards of  6 without too much worry.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The best picture of the year!! by far.<br />The 3D bluray is superb, picture and sound come alive.<br />Must have.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Poor character development and a plot that didn't really make sense.  Rather dull sex scenes.  This guy happens to walk off a bus in some small town where his brother, who he hadn't seen in 15-years, had arrived at the night before, and then is arrested for his murder?
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|Vangelis amazing, retro-futuristic soundtrack is one of the best of all time.<br />Must have in any form, the vinyl is amazing!
B004BLJQOK|4.0|It is a very different Vampire movie which is why I liked it. It steers away from the normal ones you usually see.
B007XNAQL0|4.0|Great concert on film, witch means it doesn't look super crisp bust is highly enjoyable.<br />The sound is superb, the concert excellent, Peter Gabriel at his best.
B00002DE4E|5.0|If you listened to music in the Eighties you surely remember Joy Division. Great band with a great sound. Buy it.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|The best U2 album by far and one of the best of all time in a great 2CD edition, really worth it.<br />If you can't buy the super deluxe edition, this is the best solution.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|THIS IS A CLASSIC!  I WATCH MOVIES TO BE ENTERTAINED AND THIS FILLS THE BILL. LOVE JOHN WAYNE & MAUREEN O'HARA TOGETHER.
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|Pink Floyd masterpiece has a edition that match is music quality.<br />For fans is a must have, is a piece of art.
0525478817|5.0|Amazing book. I finished it in to 2 nights, It's really a great story and my favorite book Ive read in a while.
B00C2ISGQI|5.0|A must see movie, it shines on bluray, the picture and sound are amazing for a 18 years old movie!!<br />The steelbook is beatiful.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|It was more than I expected.  It was suspenseful, smart and visually appealing.  The pace of the the move was like a horse on a track, slower trot at the beginning and then faster trot and finally a run.  Seriously want to go fast forward to the end but resisted.  Was glad I did.  Lots of twists and turns in the journey.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|I love Spartacus and it has come to a satisfying end with an alternate story of the end of the rebellion.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I love this movie! I watched more then once and had the songs stuck in my head for a few hours afterward.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|A great cast with a well done insight to what can happen as we turn older and Life does not become what we had expected.  As well  as knowing that at any age we can still learn to cope and understand other cultures.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|Hard to judge distances, so once you've sit one to gauge it you've wasted a stroke.<br /><br />But fun and challenging.
B000P0J0AG|3.0|One of my favorite movies, with a great cast.  Yet the sound quality was not that great.  Too many times you can hardly hear what is being said, to turn up the sound, the next instant it is way too loud.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Just finally seeing this wonderful movie, and wondering how I overlooked it all these years. Sat spellbound through it once, told BF about it and watched it all over again with him a couple days later. This has a lovely story, with meanings on several levels, humor, suspense, and an excellent cast. A suprise ending that made me absolutely yell out and shed tears of joy. Tim Burton is just plain and simple The Man. This movie is absolutely delightful. Definitely one to purchase and add to the home collection.
B0089LOG02|4.0|It makes you think about what you would give up and why and what a child can endure in their life
B0058YPILY|5.0|Awesome!  Well worth the purchase for those lovers of true crime and the bizzare!  The only thing I really didn't care for was the love drama with Dr.  Spencer Reed.  I know, it's a T.V. drama,  they could have toned it down a little.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|I found this story interesting and thought provoking. It is well crafted with good characterization and excellent pace and plot development.
B005VPRDAY|4.0|This was good for a starter kit for my granddaughter, am still in shock over the price of lego sets in general, kinds ridiculous
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My daughter loves this movie so she decided to buy a copy. We've already watched it 3 more times with friends who hadn't seen it yet.
1416955070|1.0|I wish young people would have better judgment and not eat up every lame, lazy and idiotic piece of fantasy fiction thrown their way. This is a BLAND book. The fact that it is pretty much a HP fanfic retooled and repackaged is a shame. This should have never been allowed to be published. It's a cheap, unoriginal narrative with the same tropes seen in seemingly hundreds of YA books with no depth of flavor to set it apart. A wholly derivative piece of fluff not worth the paper it's printed on. Are young girls that starved for shallow and lame romance they will read anything?
B005HEDIHG|5.0|We love all of the old series and the quality is great! Makes it more realistic, and engages you in the scenes.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I loved this movie! A lot of excitement and really cool concept. I usually don't like movies that are too non-realistic but this one made it seam like it could come true lol. I really liked it.
0062278592|1.0|Would have never ordered this book if I had known it was of the &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34;, &#34;Harry Potter&#34;, or &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34;, type novel with the supernatural aspects.  Just does not grab my attention or interest me in the slightest.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|Brad Pitt actually acts pretty darn well in this movie which is more of an exception than a rule.  And he's always easy on the eyes.  The rest of the acting was quite good.  The 5 stars is mostly in consideration of the genre;  it's a brilliant zombie flick!  Great special effects and very scary undead-  who ever heard of zombies that are really fast?  That makes for many very scary scenes and  great fodder for your worst nightmares.  If you like the genre,  don't let this review get your hopes up but go with an open mind and you'll enjoy the ride.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I enjoyed the storyline but I'm afraid this book is an insult to women, even modern day women.  I realise it is fiction but the saving grace to this story was the main female character walked out of Mr Grey's life.
B000KIPT30|4.0|Nothing fancy but does its job!  A nice cheap fix for headphone mixes in the studio for the artist, recommended.
B004EPYZXU|4.0|I liked the movie aside from critics... but now so much attention directed to the moon by governments and private contractors ... is there an unsolved puzzle with the piece at hand .... and a rush for exploration is on ... ? Hope more movies like these are in our future the Moon has always been intriguing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I finished the book in less than a day. It's a perfect combination of romance and tragedy. I. CRIED. A. LOT. It was one of those books that you just immediately click with the characters and before you know it you're invested. It is a book that makes you look deeper.
1449433251|5.0|Gift
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Reading this wonderful book kept me on the edge of my chair and up half the night.  There are so many facets that carry you through the story line.  Be sure to read the epilogue, the biggest secret of all.  BUT NOT UNTIL THE END OF THE BOOK!  I highly recommend this book.  Enjoy!
0393312836|4.0|I can't imagine what it must have been like reading this when it was published. But for me, this seemed entirely too possible for comfort.
B00594XOZU|5.0|this is a great app, you can text people without giving out your phone number and if you put it on your Ipad or similar pad you can text people over the internet.
1449410243|5.0|What else can I say about Matt's second book. It captures all his sick love and admiration for cats and allows the reader to LOL every couple of pages.<br /><br />The Bobcats are certainly something you can't miss.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|Thank God, Stieg Larsson lived long enough to finish writing this trilogy. It is a thriller as a thriller should be with undertones of wit and humor. I wish he had written more books but, alas, that can never be.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|The season itself is good, I do miss all the complex plotting of previous seasons but I know it is harder to do it given the circumstances.<br /><br />While it is a good start for Liam replacing Andy I still don't completely buy it, he's not even as strong as Andy was. Naevia replacement is also not that good.<br /><br />This season follows the violence we all love but reduces sexual content.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had got it a few weeks ago, AND I LOVE IT! It's really Fun to play and is really like the Computer game. I got this because it was cheaper than the real Game. I can play Survival and Creative. I really can't wait until the realms open, I could use a friend or 2 to hunt Creepers with. Worth your money, you won't regret it!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|What a character Gannicus is!<br /><br />All characters are even more complex and full than they were last season (except for Crixus, he's like a blank paper). John Hannah truly shines with almost all other characters following closely.<br /><br />This is a prequel you simply can´t miss. I just wish it had been longer.
B004OT6NTK|5.0|love the ewoks!  It's a great addition to my ewok village :)  A must have to any SW fan of the ROTJ film.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved all 3books & this was worth the price. I'm definitely looking forward to reading more for E.L James
B0014VPFTA|5.0|This album is awesome.  I'm a blues girl and this cd definitely fits the bill. I'm in love with his creativity, passion and for sure those lips.  John I'm glad that you are a commitment-phobe with relationships and not music.  Andrea
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Good.book I'm getting tired of Richard having to g o through he'll to have a happy life.  Also, why didn't someone teach him some of the rules.  Maybe his grandfather would have been a good choice. The sisters of light were so blind to the sisters if darkness.  It doesn't make since.
B006LSZECO|5.0|All i can say is Wow!!!  Great read ! Could not put it down!!  It really makes you think about who you marry!! Lol!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I loved it and it was a gift to my boyfriend who loved it as well.  I am sorry for reviewing this late but I thought I did at a prior date. The seller was very good and sent the product right away and just in time for my boyfriend and my fourth year anniversary.  Thank you very much.
B00DAXYNEI|4.0|I watched the first episode of season one.  While it does not have the alluring power that Homeland does, I am going to buy the second episode.  Kevin Spacey speaking directly to the camera as a narrative device strikes me as annoying, and it seems like they are trying to staple on equal bits of sex and violence as if to satisfy their viewers formulaic desires for vice in their political thrillers.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ah, amazing!!! Just wish I didn't have to wait forever to read more of this amazing story!! So much going on in this book and now just had me hanging and dying to find out!! I love this love story! It's got me sucked in!
B001EBYMB2|5.0|Come on, if you are reading this, where have you been.  This is a classic war movie with all the arrogance that is America.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|You get what you pay for. This cord worked very well in my kindle fire.Yes I would buy again .
B000HZGNDG|5.0|It was a nice way to say good bye to the old gang of the original Star Trek.  The story line fell in line with their journey of discovery.
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|The Pulse has been a disappointing purchase.  I don't trust the accuracy of any of its measures, making for a mere novelty toy. Most of the reasons I purchased it turned out to be illusory.<br />-- The namesake measure, heart rate, is not a monitored rate.  Moreover, it's so frequently comically inaccurate that there's no reason to trust any of its measurements.<br />-- The sleep measure, like the heart rate, requires you interact with the device to get a measurement, unlike competing pedometers.  I thought the pulse would tell me how many times I woke up at night, but it doesn't. It would only record a wake-up if I got out of bed.<br />-- It's dead-on accurate for the amount of time I spend running: it also thinks I run a 7 minute pace.  But I don't.  So all the runs were off by 20-40%.<br />-- Similarly the measure of steps seemed practically invented since I could compare it to the actual distance when I run.  It's inflated.<br />-- I bought the pulse for, among other reasons, integration with myfitnesspal.  Nope.  Doesn't work either.<br /><br />About a month after purchasing the device, I went for a run on a humid day.  The pulse got sweat on it and no longer works (making it far more sensitive to sweat than my iphone).  Withings recommends wearing the pulse in its rubber case during activity. But the case collects sweat, making it more likely to get wet.  Withings did not respond to my request for support.  I can't recommend a device that can easily be bricked by normal use. I'm now the proud owner of a nearly new $100 1 oz paperweight.
B00632HWOG|5.0|i like it as an app for my kindle. easy to use and free.just click on the icon and your mail is there.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This is a gift for two very special people in our family, I know they will love the DVD as they love everything that has been put out, and are avid collectors of the space series.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This story gives me pause. Once again we find that at the front line of war, there are often just normal people who hold no malice for the other person wearing the other uniform.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|Looks like we'll be renting this one, not buying. Apparently to access all the bonus features you need to own blue ray , buy multiple blue ray versions  copies from different vendors, and buy/download commentary from iTunes. So glad I didn't pre-order. The sad part is that we really like the movie & would like to own a complete dvd version w/ features, but this release strategy is insulting.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Written by someone who knows the world my kids grew up in, mostly from a couch with a control in their hand.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Simply put this is one of the best comic book adaptations, and remakes ever. Period. Karl Urban personifies all that is Dredd From attitude to voice. He is the law.
B005LAII80|5.0|I know my closest friends will not be surprised by this choice at all since I believe \\"Dredd\\" (along with \\"The Raid\\") is one of the best hardcore balls-to-the-wall action movies of the last decade and possibly even further back. I had the distinct privilege of seeing \\"Dredd\\" at Comic-Con this past summer with my buddies from JoBlo.com at its first public screening and it's an experience I'll never forget. Having been a fan of the Judge Dredd/2000 AD comics since I was a young kid, I've always dreamed that one day a group of filmmakers would deliver the perfect Dredd film and boy did they ever with this one. Karl Urban absolutely owned the role along with a terrific supporting cast, classic hardcore 80's style action, a kick-ass techno score and also surprisingly good writing. It's my greatest hope that this finds a strong following after releasing on Blu-Ray cause I can't imagine this not having sequels, it's too good to let go of.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The instructions that come with Chromecast are three little pictures and that's it. Easy enough, if they work. For me, I got connection errors over and over. I spent hours fussing with network settings before I was able to make a connection. I'll never get those hours of my life back.<br /><br />Google gives the impression this device will make your TV an extension of your Laptop, PC, iPhone, etc, for streaming video and other stuff. Yeah, that's not the case. From my PC, it only streams video from YouTube.com and supposedly Netflix.com, and for the iPhone it will stream from the YouTube/Netflix apps. (Google Play Movies & Music is supposedly an option if you have an Android phone). I don't have an Android phone, and I don't have Netflix, so basically this is a $35 device to stream YouTube to my TV. What a waste. I was hoping I'd be able to watch Amazon Prime videos, but that is not the case.<br /><br />I was so disappointed, I didn't even bother to check the streaming quality. If you have Netflix, maybe it'll be awesome for  you. If you don't, you benefit only if you have the urge to watch terrible quality YouTube videos on the \\"big screen\\" - remember, they're streaming from your phone, so the compression will likely be garbage.
B004I11VZA|5.0|A great movie not to be missed.  Even greater when it is a real life story!  Whole family enjoys it.
0553801473|5.0|Well, I chose this rating because my mom loved it.  I haven't read it, but I got it for my mom for her birthday (as she is a big Game of Thrones fan) and she was really happy to get it.
B003INBOEM|5.0|A great movie not to be missed.  Even greater when it is a real life story!  Whole family enjoys it.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|Used it for my grief share support group.  Very heart warming and inspirational, especially for those who have lost a loved one.  Without explaining what the &#34;Hereafter&#34; will be like, the film affirms our loved ones are somewhere safe.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Well produced and acted, it will make you come back for more. Not only are stars great but the supporting actors are fabulous too.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is a &#34;must read&#34;<br />It is beautifully written and touches upon a subject not often discussed. I was emotionally moved, and once started,I could not put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Me and my wife an kids are addicted to the game lol. I would recommend it for n e one to try :-)
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Smart play for a child.  My 6 year old granddaughter loves this app and plays it a lot. Fun and educational.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|We really enjoy this app...my husband and our friends use this app all the time.  When we are out and everyone tries guessing what song and artist we are listening to of course when no one can is sure who the artist is...Shazam is pulled out:)  thank you for having such an amazing app.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The original book is very thin. I really don't understand why the movie is so long (and there will be two more to come), except that the movie studio wants to maximize their profit. But honestly it's a well-made movie.
0786956291|3.0|bought it willing to begin my journey in DD but is just to boring to learn how to play, if you have final fantasy don't bother playing this
B009YU62H2|3.0|I like this album but it's not even close to their best.  I wish it were a bit harder.  However, I like that they're making the music they want to.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game .It always helps me stay occupied.I am eight years old.I want to get the full version. This is my second Kindle  so I had to start over. I hope you download this game.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|The ending is such a thriller!! This movie kept me entertained and on edge throughout which I loved. Great flick.
B00992CF6W|1.0|every time when I try to download it have my card information evert time error cant download string to download for 1 month
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Classic! One of my favorite movies of all time. Pesci & De Niro at the best. I highly recommend it.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Should have read this years ago when I first saw it. Would have dodged a lot of pitfalls.<br />Ah well. Live and learn, move on.<br />Good read.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Anyone who loves supernatural will love this the gag reel is so funny it is one of the best parts
B00F35BV64|3.0|I really wanted to love this movie as much as I did the first one. Yeah, not so much. I think they tried too hard and though I saw the original Wrath of Khan back in the day at a drive in movie theater and don't remember too much of it, I know it was better than this. The actor who plays Khan in this version (his name escapes me at the moment) was certainly menacing, but I found him to be pretty much a one-note character. I've not seen him in other stuff so I don't know if this was his choice or the director's, but I wasn't impressed. If there is another I hope more thought is put into not trying to make it 'bigger and better' than the first, but to make a quality movie. Bigger is not always better.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|this whole new take on star trek made me a fan since the first movie came out. this is just as good as the first. lots of action. no dull moment.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|The watch is OK but is smaller than what you see in the post. Anyway is up to anyone. Definitely not for me
B00DHRLK84|5.0|like they said this movie was the most expensive zombie movie ever, and once you watch it, you will see why that is. great tense moments from start to finish here. a great action packed movie that i didnt want to see end.
B00D2CYU2W|2.0|Apparently I watched a different movie than the rest of the reviewers here. Although I found the acting to be superb, I was not impressed with the over the top characterization's.  Rob Lowe's character looked like someone smashed him in the face with that hideous pucker of his face.  The only true to form character I thought was the actor that played \\"Bob\\".  He acted and appeared like most gay guys I knew in the 70's and 80's. Why producers and directors want to make gay characters so pug faced, spiked lip over the top gay is beyond me. Homosexuality was still very much in the closet in those days and most gays blended into main-stream society quite well. True Liberace was obvious to all but his blinded female admirer's, but still, I never once saw him in any public venue with anyone that was or could be easily picked as gay.<br />The acting was great, Matt did a great job as Scott and Michael carried the role of Liberace well.  However, I can see why other studios didn't want to touch it, and HBO did, it was \\"to gay\\", meaning, I don't think it viewed favorably or accurately who gay people really are.  Straight actors tend to always make gay characters effeminate and seriously most gay men aren't.<br />As to the accuracy of Liberace and Scotts' relationship, that is from Scotts' view. We will never know Libraces' take.<br />I own the movie now, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it without renting it first.
B008220BLG|4.0|I had been told this movie was hilarious, so I went in with pretty high expectations. It's not as laugh-out-loud funny as I expected, but is filled with chuckle- worthy moments. It gives a cute (and occasionally morbid) twist to the story of Romeo and Juliet. It doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should you. As long as you can suspend reality and enjoy the entertainment value of it, it's a worthwhile film.
0740797719|5.0|This book explains the Munsell system better than I have heard before, and<br />how to use it in gamut form.  I wish I had known this many years before.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I bought this album when considering downloading &#34;Let Her Go&#34; and saw the bargain price for the whole album. I'm glad I did. From &#34;Circles&#34; to &#34;Wrong Direction&#34; to &#34;Patient Love,&#34; Passenger has made an album I can listen to over and over.
6304711905|5.0|Of course, I LOVE this movie.  One of my favorites of all time.  I absolutely HATE the format of this DVD.  It is 4:3 but the video is actually 16:9.  This leaves a huge black border to the left and right of the video and the height of the actual video is just under 300 lines tall.  Expect to rip this and have to mess with the format if you want it to be decent viewing.  On a widescreen, such as a laptop or tablet, the video is so tiny!  I hope the BluRay is better.  I will buy that after I get a BluRay drive for my computer to rip it.  (I rip all of my movies to MP4  so I can watch them on my tablet.. it's legal).
B004RJMUJO|5.0|The adults and kids in my family all love to play fruit ninja. My son wanted to play on my Fire and I told him to play on his Leappad, but he argued &#34;it doesn't have fruit ninja on it!&#34; This game is fun, with different modes to fit your mood.
B00CO4KGYA|2.0|This game was too hard for a small child.My grandchildren are under 7 and they found it hard to play.Maybe if an older child that could read it would be much better.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|I was so excited to see this movie and it did not disappoint. The magic is fun, the action is intense, and the storyline is littered with humor. There were only two factors that decreased my enjoyment of this movie- I would have liked to have seen more interactions/character development between the Horsemen behind the scenes of the show (they had such a fun, snarky chemistry together) and I would've liked the ending to expound on &#34;The Eye.&#34; That's it. Overall, a good movie with a twist ending.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Terrific series!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is the one movie I watch every year to start my Christmas spirit.  Gives me the sense of what the holiday is about and just a good family laugh
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|You get some pretty nice 3D effects in the beginning and in the movie.  I like Star Trek Movies.  Got it on the day it was released.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|There's a problem with hip/hop. Everyone thinks it's dying/dead. Then Kanye does something new & breathes life into it with new influences and changes in the music. Haters gon' hate, go listen to Flo Rida, cuz that's some real shit right? Give me a break. This is Kanye's Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club. If you don't know the meaning of my last sentence, you don't have a leg to stand on while hating.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Detailed and precise in its military storyline.  An evocative insight into modern terrorism and the men and women around the world whose job it is to fight radical jihadists.
0812986180|5.0|I enjoyed this book for the inside look at a prison from the inmates' perspective.  Never having been there, I was anxious to learn what it's like.  This book satisfies that curiosity.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this is a great overhead rpg dungeon crawler. Made in the mmo / diablo style gameplay that we have all come to love.
B000669GAI|5.0|Great Album. If tou're a Pearl Jam fan, this has all the best. Download the Amazon Kindle player and you'll automatically get the Mp3 version of Album loaded to your smart phone or tablet
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Let's see. It was easy to set up. I loved the part where I can play something using my cellphone via netflix or youtube. If I have a presentation in youtube I saved I can easily play it. The best part? I am remote or cordless. This gadget is cheaper does a great job. Why connect your laptop when you have your cell and Chromecast.
B00COCY67A|5.0|Truly Genius! This is the Reason he is known as The King of Rock and Roll.  Some of his best work. Elvis' voice only  got better with age.  You could always feel the magic coming through in his music, but this work will blow you away with the emotion that comes through.
B000P0J09W|3.0|If you want an ok movie this is one. Little kids need to stick with Captain Kangaroo but your middle schoolers would be ok with it.
B002OG5GT8|5.0|This allows you to watch tv with headphones on, & be able to adjust the volume to a proper level.
B000002O51|5.0|This is some of the best rock ever. You need this in you collection. I wish the band would not have been screwed and could have produced when they were red hot.
B0006L89N8|5.0|But it got many accolades, so I'm sure it'll be a great book. I don't really like to read long books, but I'll probably finish it someday.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|The best arena rock ever. No mask and makeup. This was one of my favorite albums and still is. If the band had not been screwed over money and greed no telling how big they have become.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is a great blockbuster movie. You will love it. Blu-rays are the best. That's all I have to say about that.
B001J6WWGE|5.0|This is not your This is high octane. The very best of Def Leppard. If I were going to pick and choose my songs this is the album!
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|the problem with art is people get stuck in this idea of what it should and shouldn't be. and I feel that's  the biggest issue with fan reaction when it comes to Hesitation Marks. The album is, in my opinion at least, overly influenced by 80's pop music and hair bands. This linear pop sound will of course, discourage fans who are used to that heavy industrial feel with complex layered sounds and instrumentals. How ever, let's be honest here people, Trent has never strayed away from pop elements, even going back to Pretty Hate. So don't get your panties in a bunch people. You want music, and art to evolve, and not get stale and stagnant. Embrace it, change is wonderful, and so is this album.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I am writing this review because I have nothing better to do. I do recommend watching it. It's a good way to waste time.
030758836X|5.0|I really do not understand why people hate this book with a passion! It was thrilling and shocking! I was fine with the not so happy ending. Can't wait for the move.
B00F35BV64|4.0|it was Star Trek, pretty good story line, great cast they deserve a better storyline though. I hope they make another.
0062059963|4.0|Definitely have to finish the series. The first book is excellent this one does not quite live up and some events feel like they were pushed in the story.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|An unexpected surprise - what a lovoely book.  A simple task of posting a letter unravelled so much more - an absolute delight to read. I just wanted to give him a hug!!
0375842209|4.0|It was hard in the beginning to read having the narrator being death, but the book finally gets going and is a good read. This book shares another portrayal of WWII.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett is one of my favorite authors.  I considered Pillars of the earth to be one of my very favorite works.  I read Fall of Giants and then Winter of the World and am looking forward to the third book.  I liked Fall of Giants better than this one, so this one slips to &#34;merely&#34; great.
B000M341QE|5.0|I find this find surprisingly funny. There is a lot going on and each time I watch it I pick up something new.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Not what you would use to sharpen your &#34;good&#34; knives but does the trick OK for utility type blades...worth the price
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Great follow up to Cannibal. Ke$ha seems more grown up but still has the catchy lyrics. The Iggy Pop songs are great as well.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|No other novel compares to this. Fantastic story that captivates and enthralled and makes sense as the story pulls together all the underlying elements to make it an epic story. The bible could take pointers in how to keep a story straight and believable.
0385344228|5.0|Did not see the ending  coming! All I wanted to do was read this book! It keeps you on the end of your seat and is so hard to put down!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could  not put it down. My heart broke for the characters, I rejoiced in their victories. Do not overlook this read. It is written with class and beauty .
014241493X|3.0|Fault in our stars was a great book and the &#34;mystery&#34; of this book wasn't there and this novel was not as engaging as Fault.
B008OOYALE|4.0|this game is fun, the dragons are awesome and there are lots of varieties of dragons, you get to farm and place habitats where ever you want. If you need to waste a few minutes this is the app for you.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Excellent deal for $3.99! The story is great and not too sad despite both the main characters are teen angers with cancer. Cannot wait for the movie!
0071762345|4.0|Let me clarify that the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I purchased this along with one other book on social media which had I known then what I know now, the other is much more in-depth and there would have been no reason for this one. (that's on me though)<br /><br />The other book is called The New Rules of Marketing and PR by David Meerman, while Likable is great as a specialized Fb and Twitter book, I haven't yet finished it because I always end up going back to the latter which is more rounded. The other book just drew me in and made me view social media as an opportunity as opposed to a dreaded task. :)
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Crazy!! As with all the other seasons this one is excellent. Obviously not as good as the 4th season but still thrilling!
1118488768|5.0|If you are a marketer like me, you may have found the social media circle a bit like going to the dentist, no thank you! However, as an online marketer I also knew the importance of being socially active....but David somehow managed to put a twist on it which gave me a new perspective.<br /><br />Whether you are struggling with your social media strategy bringing you the desired results in your Google position, and/or you are like I was and found it to be a torturous event that you would avoid at all costs, this book should help.<br /><br />With over 300 pages of examples and stories, I can honestly say that David turned my \\"extreme hatred\\" of online socializing into seeing it as \\"an opportunity to engage.\\" I must admit, he brought out some valid points in a way I just didn't see before.<br /><br />Actually, this book is responsible for my writing reviews all night tonight. It is all \\"socializing\\", and when I look at it honestly...I have always looked to others for their input, so it's only right I return the favor.:)<br /><br />If you are looking for one solid book on new marketing ideas, and this new social media revolution....I would highly recommend this one.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|I loved this movie.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Tried the other bubble pop games, winch I love playing but this one takes the cake. Keep me coming back to play over and over again
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Simple game that even tho is designed for young kids is still fun at my age 23. Kinda similar setup for people who have played howrse.com only things move and is better minus the inability to breed.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game keeps you busy busy busy. Lots of fun to play<br /><br />Lots of different things to do with it and I have been in awe with the game. It has so many things to do.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very good people all trying to do what was right even if they didn't agree with the ourcome.<br />Strange that the mother through Louisa out but keep her sister's baby and love it so much.<br />I hated to have the book end but loved the ending<br />We reviewed this book at our book club and everyone loved it even though they didn't agree with the plot.
B007SGM084|5.0|Wow great read could not stop!!!! Hot Hot Hot!!!! The perfect ending, a must read!!! Leaving me wanting more, more!!!!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Bought this bc my friend recommend it. I thought my 3 month old would eventually grow into it but he loved it from the get go! It was super easy to assemble and well worth the money. I wish I could upload a video of him jumping in it. It's super cute!
B00B4Z5J92|2.0|Taking awesome music and an interesting history and not finding a story to drive it - thatʻs the lack of heart in Sound City. If you want to listen to good music, get your albums out.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|Christian Bale did a nice job on it.  Really seems like...haven't I already seen this movie. How do you beat a whole gang with guns by yourself?  Stand up in the middle of the room, in the dark, and move your arms really fast, it makes you pretty much bullet -proof.  Not bad...OK.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Wow, I was let down. I was told that a great chef with the best ingredients was going to cook me a fabulous meal, and all I got was....warmed over recycled leftovers!!!<br /><br />What a waste. I'm a big fan of the original show. I also loved the first reboot, love JJ, love the brilliant casting that outdoes the originals at times. All that plus a big budget full of effects. Sorry but Kahn's 2nd redo plus some lefotvers/retreads from the other movies does not do the team justice. All it lacked was a good script. Even a decent script. Entertaining at times, but not really satisfying in the end.<br /><br />PS - this does not give me warm and fuzzies over JJ taking on the Star Wars franchise.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book you can't put down its so good it leaves you hanging at the end<br />I hope there's another book in the series
B001P3SA94|3.0|I recalled enjoying the movie when I watched it for the first time.  I think I was excited to see Beyonce because the movie itself after watching it now was just okay (mediocre acting, too many story lines).
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Loved it. I was captivated from the first page. It was fun to revisit with the king and queen from her previous books
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are cute and fun way to exercise your brain. You can rack up points very quickly to unlock additionally games.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|There are a lot of gaps in the story. One never really gets what Morgan Freeman's character is all about. Pretty far fetched plot in the end. Still, fun to watch because of the fast action.
B006FPFTMS|3.0|I liked it alot at first, but got very frustrated with the scrolling. On a Samsung S3 held sideways, when you zoom into a document, and then try to scroll vertically using your finger, it very often flips horizontally to the next page. I tried for a long time to perfect my vertical finger movement, but could not come up with a method to avoid the horizontal movement. If there was a way to de-sensitize the horizontal scroll, it would be great
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|This album is completely captivating all the way through the first half and remains pretty interesting as it goes on, but i must say my interest is usually lost around the time Papper Shoes ends and Pendulous Threads kicks in. But some of the band's absolute best is on this album so it is for sure worth your money.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I believe JJ Abrams has done a great job with the franchise.  He has breathed new life into it and has hooked a new generation.  He has chosen his actors carefully and has a great story to tell.  I believe Gene Roddenberry would approve.
B009LLLJ40|5.0|They came out of their Nu Metal phase and return to a more classic sound that makes me want to whip a chair through a window!
B007T99ENE|5.0|This intriguing novel holds you all the way. The writing is refreshing. The concept of stories within stories is charming. The twists and turns and eloquent language make this a highly readable book.
B000P0J09W|5.0|One of my favorite movies growing up, and am proud to say that I passed it on down to my 8 year old, and soon i'm sure when my 4 year old is a little older and understands the movie more he will also enjoy it as much as we do.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|On a scale from 1 to 5 - World War Z is 4+.  Good scary fun and loved it! Bring on the sequels!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|One of the best love stories! One of the best movies Patrick S made, and I love having it in my possession. Seems to mean so much more now that he has passed.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|And I'm one really hard sleeper.  The ability to set many alarms are great, as I have set one for work ask n nd one for overtime as well.
B00AG473GE|5.0|Pretty in pink and sixteen candles were two of my favorite movies with her in it! I love Ducky, and I love the story line. And I am glad they changed the ending from the book, everybody loves a good ending.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I was just testing this game out and became addicted.  It is a fun game that I found worth the time.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Hidden Object games.
B00015YVD6|5.0|This is used to be my favorite childhood movie. I loved mermaids as a little girl, and to watch this movie about a mermaid becoming human and falling in love, it was like a real movie of the little mermaid.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|I wanted to see this when it first came out, but never got around to it.  It was just a really well written script and actors were super.  It's not one of those movies you can watch part of it tonight, then the last part another time.  It does a good job keeping the tragedy of 9/11 ever-present, yet subdued enough to  allow the storyline to be the star.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I love the action pack scenes, and laughing my butt off to this movie. I cannot wait to see Kick-Ass 2!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because you get to do so many things and enter so many contests. The graphics are wonderful and it never glitches.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|In the past, actors had to have talent - singing, dancing in addition to acting. In the past, whimsical shows were enjoyed. That such were marketable today.
B00009V7T2|4.0|If you like progressive rock, this is for you. these guys seem a bit pretentious with their long song titles and over the top lyrics. All in all a good effort by this band.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|is absolutely a great show very unique and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend this.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|This is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. It is full of bad acting and a sub-par story line but it is fun to watch.
B00D7JGL36|4.0|I have long been a fan of the Bakersfield Sound. This CD filled all expectations, although I missed a bit more of Buck Owens.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great series.I have been looking for something like this for a long time. Adore British television. Dawn French and the butler from Downton Abbey make it complete.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This was the era of country music when country music was the real thing. Vince Gill has outdone himself with this CD. Great songs from two of my favorite all time artists. As a singer and lead guitarist myself, I learned a lot of guitar from these two artists Buck Owens and Merle Haggard back in the 60's and 70's. I'm retired now. Got this CD and I'm not at all disappointed. Vince does them justice on these great selections. 5 songs of each artist. Beautifully sung and played as he plays lead on every song,and does a great job. My favorite on this CD is \\"Holding Things Together\\" with a long lead guitar solo at the end of the song. He plays with such a great touch and feel. The guitar  is played so tastefully and soulfully with the supple mellow tone from his Fender Telecaster that it makes you want to listen to it over and over again. I can't say enough about this CD. Worth more than the price you pay Deserves a higher rating than a five. You won't regret getting this CD especially if you play country lead guitar. This is a gem. Highly recommended. Guitar Bob Labbe in Oklahoma
B009EEFTMC|5.0|what great fun, this allows you to be sharp of mind without having to fight to other levels of play.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book but I cried and I knew I would because the demon john green is the author and after reading searching for Alaska I knew I would be reduced to tears. Either way it was sort if good tears that reminded me that in bad there is always a silver lining.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I love Denzel, his acting is amazing.<br />Movie has a very powerful message, I would reccommend this movie, its quite moving.
B009PJXY3M|5.0|I love the entire album. Bridgit's voice is unique,  the songs are cleverly written, and the tunes are so catchy, it makes you wanna sing along to every single one of them. I'm very excited for her next album whenever that may be!
B00BMNM4H6|1.0|I guess I'm not a game player, but since this was free I thought I'd try it.  My trial lasted about 3 minutes after which I thought going outside to watch the grass grow would be more exciting. If you like games, maybe you'll like this one. Me, I'm outta here.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|It's very quiet and runs great. I was going to get the 660ti but saw its only about 5% better then this one. Only down side is its a little big but nothing to worry about.
B007JNWJMI|3.0|I first used picsplay free version and loved it. I wanted to be able to use the different fonts that the free version doesn't let you use. So I bought picsplay pro but it won't let me save the text that I add to my picture. Hopefully this issue gets fixed until then I give it only 3 stars. If that issue gets fixed I will give it 5.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Yes I do like this app.  Facebook is a great way to keep up with family and friends to share pictures.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|One of the best movies the writing and cast combine to bring you back to what was going on not just the history book version of the battles.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great, but it only allows streaming. I was hoping to be able to play back DVD's from my laptop.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Different from the usual hidden object games in that you have to have enough &quot;energy&quot; to enter a room. Also has puzzles as well as hidden object. Fun so far.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|If you want the video streaming feature of a \\"Smart TV\\" but don't want to lay out the bucks this is a great option. If you have a spare HDMI port and a wireless home network you can stream Youtube or Netflix easily. Setup is easy all you need to know is your wireless password. I used my Android tablet and my Iphone to stream youtube within 2 minutes of opening the box. Picture quality on youtube is directly related to the quality of the video posted, HD streams as HD.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Kyle tells about the IRAQ war in what I believe to be the truth......it's not politicized.  He merely tells it like it is.  You won't hear that from MOST of the people who write about a war like that.
B00D8HNR2K|2.0|Maybe it's just me...but all the songs on this collection sound similar. Little variation in tempo. Same electronica feel over and over again.<br /><br />Seems pointless for Adrian Belew and Lindsey Buckingham to have \\"guest starred\\" since the guitars are melted deep into the mix and could seemingly have been performed by any number of skilled but faceless studio musicians.<br /><br />Meh...
B0094K1WZE|4.0|It's not Bourne or Bond but its fun to watch. The plot is over the top absurd and my kids had a lot of fun laughing at how Tom cruise runs.
B0091REZMW|1.0|While I read even the expanded description for the Mystery Manor, it was not clear that I would be asked to sigh up with friends IMMEDIATELY after the intro section.  I was anticipating something more like the Professor Leyton series for Nintendo DS and was so disappointed that I deleted Mystery Manor from my Kindle.
B00AO686MY|5.0|This movie works on a lot of different levels, foremost being nostalgia for the appearances (albeit brief) of so many beloved cartoon characters.  My favorite scene remains the piano duel between Donald Duck and Daffy.  It also benefits from a great cast, starting with an irascible performance by Bob Hoskins.  Joanna Cassidy is perfect as his longsuffering girlfriend and Christopher Lloyd makes a great villain.  Outstanding special effects, a visual treat from start to finish.  Love it.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Yeah, it hard to even know that I have this app on my phone for it just works.  I take a picture and away it goes up into the cloud drive.  I am also using the cloud mp3 app for storing about 1400 songs, and I really love that.  I notice I am listening to more of my music because of the ease of use.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|The only song I wasn't thrilled about was their version of &#34;Mama Said Knock You Out&#34; but the rest of the CD is everything I'd hoped it would be. The lyrics are amazing and the music is hardcore enough not to be considered just rock. It's a purchase I'm glad I made. This band doesn't ever disappoint me.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|A friend on mine at my gym told me about this album.  Suggested I try it on Amazon and did listen to it and like what I heard.  Of course I purchased it.  I believe that I got to down load the mp3 version of the music thus I could play the music right away, and then I was mailed the CD, which I really like to have.  It all sounded really great on my 5.1 speakers and also in my car via my Bluetooth connection to my cars radio.  Technology today surely is fun. The album feature song \\"True Believers\\" is just a great up beat song.  Then \\"Wagon Wheel\\" is my second favorite.  I am still listen to the rest of the album but these two songs make the whole album worth while I feel.  Since this artist is completely new to me I am hoping to research more of his previous works on Amazon and see what I can find.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout shares her perspective on the law of attraction with her reader. The experiments are fun and can actually come true.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Buying the combo packs online is the way to get the best value for your money. This is a great world spanning story while remaining very personnel and emotional without becoming pro or against any political agendas. Sparks interesting debates on many subjects and is a very eye opening story that you don't find very often in Hollywood these days.
B000V63CZI|5.0|This is the best album they ever put out !! Wonderful memories of a wonderful 70's group !! If you liked Super Tramp music such as in &#34;The Logical Song&#34; ( When I was young ....it seemed life was so beautiful )..... Buy this particular album !!
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Love Chuck. One of the most underrated tv shows that was continually saved by fan support. Slowly but surely buying the whole show.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I ab so lutly loved the Percy Jackson books!! I'm so glad that they get to continue!!!!!!! It's also refreshing to have some new character's come in to play, but it's good that some of the older ones get to stick around.
0064430227|5.0|She is absolutely obsessed (shes almost 5) with this book.  Very clever story that really allows them to tap into their imagination.  She makes me read it every night.  Highly recommend for 4+ age group.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Everything you could expect from a George R.R. Martin book. Cliffhangers that keep you on the edge of your seat, action when and where it is necessary, and overall a beautifully written story.
B00CHILW64|4.0|Entertaining.  Kept me in suspense.  Pulled on my heart strings at the end. ..a tear jerk moment for sure.  Wonderful acting.
B00F3L3ZBC|5.0|A great read, I love Jane Austen, the dialogue settings and characters are all amaziing, I just wish she'd written more. This has nice illustrations and proper formatting
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Howey has created an interesting future-verse and fills it, for the most part, with engaging characters.  A quick read but enjoyable.  I recommend it to any fan of distopian science fiction.
B00F3LDAQM|5.0|Jane Austen really rules the period romance scene, and it's all authentic. Lovely pictures, i really liked the lady on the cover. proper kindle formatting too!
0812975219|5.0|Black Swan was wonderful, but a difficult read.  \\"Randomness\\" is a better book.  This book needs a heavier hand in terms of editing, but its arguments, analysis and conclusions are spot on.  This is a \\"must read' for popular newspaper and magazine writers.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a lot of fun to play. It is a lot more fun than most other games. From ask.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|OUAT is genious.  We love some characters, love to hate others (and secretly have a crush on the bad guy).
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This could be hard understanding sometimes but it is an amazingly good show to watch it can make you think or just have fun
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Love it!  I write down everything I need to remember. My family especially, appreciates it, and I don't forget the milk in the way home from work.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I Liked this movie. It was action packed and kept you guessing.  Actors were great. I would watch this again.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A must read for those who want to push themselves to cross the limits of the impossible.  A true and honest account of a driven man who thought himself as a messiah.  It will be a long time before we see the likes of him.
1423140591|5.0|Our 14yr old granddaughter received three of Rick Riordan's books for  her birthday.  She was thrilled...this made us very happy!
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|Not sure how else to describe it.  It is creative and yet copies some tried and true formulas.  It is fun and a good waste of time.
1423140605|5.0|For our 14 year old granddaughter's birthday.  She received all three of Rick Riordan's books and we are looking forward to getting the fourth book released October 8th.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love it joining the pork side was amazing cool and I loved gen grievis,Darth Vader and emperor Palpatine<br />The game was good and I can't wait for the next one<br />this is the game of the future.
1423113462|5.0|What can we say, our granddaughter reads Rick Riordan's books and wanted the Heroes of Olympus books.  Her face lit-up when she opened the package.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Loved the CD -- excellent tone and excellent choice of songs.  Very well done.  Would recommend this to everyone.  Loved being put in the cloud also.  Thank you.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I love the  retro styling, the size, function and the fact I won't have to buy a battery! You have a choice with this model, four different color faces and bands so you should be able to find one you like. I've had it five days now and it runs about -7 seconds per day. I expect it to improve because the daily loss has been decreasing since the first day. This is within tolerance but I will wait about a month until it settles in to see if it may need to be adjusted. When looking at the accuracy, remember this is not a quartz watch but a fine, mechanical instrument that may need to be adjusted for accuracy after a month or so of breaking in...and you can't beat the price!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I love the Wizard of Oz, and this was a great prequel!  James Franco made a perfect Oz.  The only thing that could have been better is who the witches turned out to be  :)
B008ALAHA4|5.0|What a deal 9.95 versus $50.00 for a full adapter.<br />Works great! Let's you take a tiny adapter with one AC adapter versus taking 2 because apple changed the mag safe slightly.<br />The way to go.
0345803493|5.0|Look everyone is being way to effing critical. You write a damn porno novel and then we cant comment. True somethings were repetitive but if thats what you were focused on the whole time reading you missed out. I could never write something like this and i envy how the author can. Mad Props to the author. Get off you High Horse and enjoy the damn book. or don't read it.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Bought this for my husband.....he loves it! I would definitely recommend this to someone who loves good music. A great buy too.
0307271862|4.0|Henning Mankell has a well deserved reputation as a thriller writer following the publication of his highly successful Wallander novels. These have been brought to television first in Swedish and then in English with an outstanding performance by Kenneth Branagh as the moody and introspective detective. However Mankell is more than just Wallander, he has written many diverse other books and this one, &#34;The Man From Beijing&#34; is one of them which is well worth reading. It is a mystery and a very good one at that, but it is more than that. It has an underlying plot which explores the problems besetting our world and how we are coping with changes on a scale previously unknown. There is a history in China and the US which is detailed and which connects to the mystery and which leads the central character, a district judge from Helsingborg, across four continents and into an unfolding web of corruption and intrigue. A very good read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup;<br />1) Opened box<br />2) Plugged into HDMI port and USB port. TV turned on and changed to HDMI input.<br />3) Instructions on screen direct you to the applications you can use to control the chrome cast using your phone/tablet or computer.<br />4) (I used a tablet) Installed app<br />5) Opened Netflix<br />6) Started a movie<br />7) Changed it from playing on device to chromecast.<br /><br />Neat things:<br />1)  Chromecast will go to the stream source directly not through your device. This means you can turned off your laptop/tablet/phone once chromecast picks up the stream.<br />2) You can swap the device controlling the Chromecast at any time even when something is streaming.<br /><br />Is this a roku killer? No. I have and use my roku just as much as before on my main TV. This device is more about changing a dumb TV into a smart TV and it does it well for a very small price.<br /><br />Here is one of the neat hings about this device. I then took my phone, opened up Netflix and had control of the chromecast with the phone. Your device i
B001EN71CW|5.0|I enjoyed watching the last three episodes that never aired on TV.  This was a series that had potential for development but the plug was pulled to soon.  Watch the first few episodes when they first aired but was unable to watch all episodes until now.  The blu-ray format is amazing.  My teenage children also wish there were more episodes because they got into the story line and wanted to know more about the characters.  I would recommend this series for any sci-fi fan who is looking for something a little different without the geewiz futuristic items, ie faster than light travel, lasers/fazers, etc.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|Beautiful film where it shows the whole life of this very unique artist. How she incorporated into her art her gender, her pains, her concepts, her life journey. Shows her work and creative process.
B00013RC8O|5.0|After borrowing a copy from the library I decided to get one of my own.<br /><br />this is a fantastic movie  one could get this just for the cover alone who does not fantasize of driving a full blown 70 dodge challenger cross country with a group of police cars and helicopters on your tail.<br /><br />it starts with a man kowaski who does not use his first name he was in the army before and joined the police force  before quitting after witnessing corruption afterwards he is a man in to speed he did motorcycles and track racing in his past now he's a delivery man that delivers cars to clients this one job happens to be  a dodge charger which he has to deliver from Denver to san Francisco in just 15 hrs but the crazy part is he does not have to  deliver it in such  a time but he chooses to.  of course he takes speed to keep from sleeping  to complete his mission.  this is a fun movie with a good cast  barry newman rocks.  His character seems  to a great guy who only wants to keep moving in life he's not the type  stay stationary and move he does .
B0017XD3OY|4.0|the story is creative, easy to follow, full of action, and tension, one of the first 'scary' movies I allowed my 10 year old to watch. She was kinda scared, but loved it. Love Will Smith!
B00BCG1ZQO|4.0|I am picky and don't watch a lot of TV.  But this series captivated me from episode 1.  It has it all.  Plenty of comedy (episodes strictly for that) and of course horror; but it also has realist human drama, a refreshing and revolving cast, characters that aren't static, points where they poke fun at themselves. Although in every right it is a soap opera - it isn't soap opera-ish (over acted, unrealistic pathetic and boring characters).  This show blends it all, futuristic, horror, deep relationships, sincerity, drama, comedy, and self-effacing which makes it even more real.  Is every episode a home run?  No.  But very close.  I don't know why this isn't on HBO, or other paid channels - but selfishly I am glad that it isn't!<br /><br />Supernatural is Quality writing, directing, and of course - very important, acting which too is high quality.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show. Good series. Keeps you on your edge of seat. Good plot. Love no commercials. Good acting. Very interesting
B006M4F67A|4.0|This game is very good and I did enjoy it.this game get harder as you go along which I like cause it get your brain working.
B005MMY534|4.0|Beautiful scenery and overall a good storyline.  Would recommend to a friend if they are into period pieces of England history.
B0011MRKHW|5.0|What a great move!  Cate Blanchett is powerful actress.  This is a must see if you are into Tudor history.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I love this game. It's a really funny past time! I think it is the ex tennis player story that makes me laugh along with the slow motion when the levels end.
B0077PBPJ6|2.0|Eddie Redmayne is amazing.  And yet.  I didn't like the story.  I didn't care about the girl.  I didn't really care whether they got together or not.  His acting wasn't at fault - so where was the problem?  I don't know.  Maybe it needed a different actress - or maybe it was just the writing.  But it fell far short of what it should have been.  It does not engage you.  It does not make you care.  I didn't really care whether I saw the end or not.  That is very very rare.
0679720200|5.0|Had to have this book for school summer reading.  I enjoyed it.  Easy to relate to and a good read.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Brilliant in its simplicity, near flawless in its execution and brutal in the best possible way it's on of the best times you'll have watching a flick in recent memory . Not for kids or the weak of heart or stomach.
1250030951|5.0|I didn't want this book to ever end.  I loved every single thing about it and when I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it, and wanting to read it.  Even after finishing it, I wanted to read it more.  This is a book that I will reread, there's no doubt about it- and I don't reread books, hardly ever.<br /><br />Cath is an amazing character, I loved that she was shy and timid and loved to write.  I loved that she was terrified to meet new people and do new things.  I connected with her, so, so well.  I also love that when she's passionate about something, she's passionate, she really truly gives her all to that thing.  She writes fanfiction and I loved the writing theme.  I loved that we got to see/hear some it, I loved that it was important to her, but breaking out of writing fanfiction and writing something completely original was a challenge for her.  I loved her journey through her first year of college, through making new friends, finding a boyfriend, and going through a family crisis.  I just loved everything about Cath.<br /><br />I didn't just love Cath though, I loved all the characters.  I loved Levi and his quirky happiness and how he can't help but bring a smile to everyone's face as it's his personal journey in life to make everyone happy.  I love that he loved when Cath read to him and I loved that he was so good to her.  From her roommate, to her dad, to her mom, to her sister, to her professor, I loved all the characters and how well we got to know them.<br /><br />The romance in this story is just so beautiful!  It's slow and in the beginning I wasn't sure if it was a romance, but the banter and the slight flirting finally gave way to something even though it was slow.  It was sweet and just so darn beautiful!<br /><br />This book would maybe be consider New Adult because of the age, but while the characters are in college, it's a pretty clean read.  There's profanity, but that's about it.<br /><br />I very highly recommend this book, I'm pretty certain this will be on my favorites of 2013 list!certain this will be on my favorites of 2013 list!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Cassandra can really write. She keeps you on the edge of your seat through out all of the books.<br />Great Job Cassandra. Keep writing.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is addictive! This game gets tougher the more you play. I switch between modes based on my mood and/or time available. Get it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this it is so fun can't stop playing it!!! It really keeps you thinking and makes you feel like your on an adventure!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|A great show. I think first season is really good. DVD features are also good, I really liked first season.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I really liked first season,so I think second season is even better. A mystery and drama, its all you need for good show.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|Its a good show and I think first season is one of the best seasons of The Vampire diaries. I love extras.
B004YM6JLO|3.0|Third season is okay. I think sometimes in third season are too many blood and violence, but then it wouldnt be a vampire show. Its so much better than other vampire shows.
B003L77GH4|5.0|A really good show, second season is one of best. I like Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder. Show has a very good looking group of actors.Love the DVD extras.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Easy to learn and a great time killer. The mix of strategy and luck of the draw from your deck keeps it interesting.
B00785P2QC|5.0|A slow and fast paced game that puts you in the center  of the action<br />. Players will love this game. It's fun and amazing.
B00AHQNHSY|2.0|I ended up not keeping this player. I'm sure it is fine, or I assume it must be. But I was looking for a player that could play specoific formats and this one didn't do it. I uninstalled it and no lightening bolts came down from the heaven and my nose didn't fall off, so I guess I am okay.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, depending on your needs. I didn't need this guy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In you can go in creative mode or survival mode creative mode is when you have unlimited items to use and survival mode is when you start out with nothing and you have to find stuff that will help you build stuff like a crafting table the crafting table is where you can craft sword and other tools to fight off the dangers of the night you have to watch out skeletons and other monsters especially the creeper<br />which blows up when you get to close to it they stay out day and night just like spiders the skeleton and zombie die in the day and come out at night. There is a lot of things to do in minecraft but most of all there is multiplayer. There are also new updates. Updates are when new things added. In other versions of minecraft you can ride in mine carts and go to a mine and mine in them and make roller coasters. You can find iron gold and most of all diamonds which are really valuable in the game and you can play on realms which is when you play with other people without any WiFi. And that's if you wanna hear anymore go to minecraft.net and there will be a lot of information
B00DJUPLY8|5.0|I used my G-Box Midnight to stream qigong and other esoteric videos from my home office network to my TV. I take DVDs and convert them for such use. I like AVI and MP4 formats, and this player handles both with aplomb on Android.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Excellent blend of three part harmony.<br />Refreshing, new, down to earth lyrics and songs that make you want to sing along with every one. No egos here. Kenny Loggins brings us equal talent with Gary Burr and Georgia Middleman. Incredible live show as well.
1451695195|5.0|Well written and easily read by all.  The ending ties everything up so beautifully.  A must read for anyone that is interested in near death experiences or just curious about what is beyond our physical reality.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Learned a lot about Anka, his pals and Las Vegas. Research interesting names in the book and very surprise on what i found out!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This is so boring! I fell asleep trying to read this! Sure it might help.. but otherwise...it sucks butt! O
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The fact this this is a first-hand true story by a neurosurgeon makes it more compelling. Truly couldn't put it down.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun way to waste some time, good for waiting at the airport haha can't stop playing, highly recommend! get it
B009NY43NY|5.0|Enjoyed - only sorry this was the last &#34;Sookie&#34; story. Rated this book Five because it tied almost everything up.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This apps appeared in the suggestions side of my kindle and I decided to give it a try; after all, it is the end of summer in Europe, we're on vacations in Rome and despite the great weather, one never knows when it is going to rain. Well, there you go! Now, we know whether to carry the clumsy umbrela with us or not.highly recommended!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!! I absolutely love horses and I can't have a real one cause they are too expensive :(. But this game seems like the horses are real!! And the horses in this game will last forever and never die!!! And you can super awesome saddles, bridles, and more! I will definitely when I get kids, I will show them this game!! This game better not ever leave this world!!!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I love this game, and have loved it since I first started. It is extremely easy to get addicted to playing it for several hours, and then plugging the kindle in to continue playing several more. Multi-player is a new beast to me, (I started out on 2 and didn't play the first one till after this), regardless though the system of attacking and using strategy by reviewing your opponents hero, allies and defenses is excellently done when artifact hunting.<br /><br />Defending is great, but either your going to spend a lot of time or money or both to build your defenses. My power rating is insane compared to defense so keeping that in mind, I should have saved a lot more money till later to upgrade my gate instead of my hero's. But regardless of which way you go I feel that paying some real cash for the the gold glu credits is worth it to upgrade your Ronin as he can become so very overpowered using artifacts and charms together.<br /><br />I cannot speak on the $54.00 each characters that you have to pay for the level 5 Sorceress or Daimyo(also keep this in mind, the daily challenges will sometimes require one of those 2). I refuse to pay that for them or even one. But all three earned and started out with hero can be formidable foe for those 54 dollar characters even, as long as your willing to upgrade them, but who knows if that is a whole lot cheaper.. also keep in mind that silver coins will become useless and gold coins will only work after you upgrade far enough. The ronin is way op and my level 8 easily defeats level 130 samuarais no problem. Game balancing issues for sure..<br /><br />I have only been playing for a few weeks but as it stands this game is a great way to test your skills on Tower Defense in a whole new type of method. Love it, recommend it to everyone over 14 years old.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Of course, Downton Abbey is an amazing show (let's hope season 4 can live up to previous)! But what makes it best is the streaming from Amazon.  It is free for Prime members and the video is of a quality that doesn't distract from the viewing.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|Wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted a place to make notes that I could keep and change as I needed to. This app didn't do that for me.
B00BE97ONM|3.0|I did not like all the vulgar language  ben was a sad soul  wish he could of been helped his mother was sick and twisted  she needed to be committed.the cussing  ruined the book for me.
B00AYB12PC|4.0|This may be one of Wes Craven's best horror films.  The opening scene with Drew Barrymore alone is worth the watch.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Very nice for the price. I wasn't expecting something as good as this. I recommend this to protect your Kindle Fire.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It keeps my attention. Not very difficult, but it works. This game is more for kids than adults with a more complex brain.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|I was playing the free version and everything and it was fun, but it like asked me to buy the full for more fun and I said no and then it literally just started the game all over again.so its basically a rip off
B00CW665VI|5.0|4.5 Stars<br />This book is hilarious!  Drew's point of view was laugh out loud funny!  I have not read anything else like it!  It exceeded my expectations!  I loved the chemistry, the heat, and the comedy this book offered!  I will definitely read other books by Emma Chase because this one was so well written and entertaining.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great awesome fantastic stupendous unique amazing original new exciting best thrilling anxious fun  terrific lovely addictive winner! Let's play BINGO!
B000002W9Q|5.0|I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE AND LISTENED TO THE MUSIC MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT. THE MUSIC IS GOING TO THE GYM WITH ME NOW.

B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I saw the movie and decided I had to have. Great sound. Great songs. It is simply Pitch Perfect (see what I did there)
B0019FOC5E|5.0|case was cracked, but cd was in good condition.  so love this soundtrack.<br />movie  is awesome too.  always listening to the music
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great show!!!Sorry it's only 8 weeks.The acting,the story and the over all performance is wonderful! More please....thanks to everyone envolved
B005PK553C|5.0|Story line is great, visually it's wonderful and the acting is fantastic.  Jessica Lange is a tour de force - this is a must see show.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Brings to life some history I was long curious about.  How could such a small group of Scandinavians create fear in much of Europe and explore the new world?  I really like the lead character and his wife the shield maiden.  As far as other works to compare it to, if you are talking fiction, then it appears that the land of Rohan in the Lord of the Rings and its people were based somewhat on the Vikings, even if they were horsemen rather than sailors.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Having grown up in Concordia, Kansas I had heard of the orphan train.  I was excited to hear of this novel about the subject. The story gripped me from beginning to the very end.  I must recommend this book to my grandchildren, especially my granddaughters so they can get a bit of history and a feeling of what some of the early immigrants went through to make this country where they live what it is today.  Injecting the troubled youth into the mix added depth to the story and made it relate better to younger readers.
B00CD36FF6|4.0|A very interesting book, with a lot of data and surprising results. Very easy to read.<br />I really do recommend!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I don't think I'm allowed to read any more stories by Rainbow Rowell. They lead to lack of sleep and anhedonia (&#34;I'm going to miss my favorite knit night because, um well, I'm otherwise involved&#34;).  And I do get too involved in the characters. And upset when the story is over. And I stop caring that it's well after midnight and my kids get up at dawn because I just. Want. More.<br /><br />So should you read this book?  Absolutely. Just make sure to clear your schedule of anything that might get in the way - you know: family, friends, work.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|Feel the emotions roll through you as you watch the struggle between duty and what is right. Watch as it plays out and see what humanity is capable of both good and bad.
B00932A4XE|5.0|What a great movie! Funny and true, I wished it would have been out when I was expecting. I really want to buy this one to watch again and again.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Great movie! I loved it! It was such a great romantic movie. If u love chick flicks this movie is for you!
B00DC8O6T8|5.0|There aren't too many albums where you can turn it on, and enjoy it from front to back without having to flip through a few. This is a great CD.
B00336G7HI|5.0|everyone should have a spare battery for their electronic stuff. this fills the bill, here are the last six words
0525951652|5.0|&#34;Fall of Giants&#34; is book one of Ken Follett's Century Trilogy. This mammoth undertaking follows many families in Europe, Russia, Germany and America starting pre WW1 and continuing in &#34;Winter of the World&#34; into WW2. As well as these conflicts the story covers the huge changes which occurred socially at this time. The history is impressive and the personal stories are engaging and interesting. There is to be a third volume some time covering the post WW 2 years and the start of the space race and the cold war. In this book we are introduced to the characters whom we will be following as well as their descendants into all three of the volumes. To say the characters are interesting and well drawn is to state the obvious in the case of this author. As you can see this is a big saga and one that I recommend you follow as it is well written and highly readable.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Very fun . Good to read for people 7 and up. I really like the Yorkshire. Accents! I'm not joking!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Many more products like this, and much of the pay-for-view TV business will be out of work!  Besides, they overcharge, and this product works!
B001U7FWM8|5.0|This is a wonderful album. There are some beautiful melodies and it's definitely unique. I hear a lot of Beach Boys and Joy Division, which would be a wonderful combination.  If your musical tastes evolved past junior high school and are interested in complex musical arrangements, excellent musicianship, and substance over style, however, this album is a modern classic. Highly recommended.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Really good book, short and sweet. Share it with every one you know. A great place to be in life. :)
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|If you enjoyed the first one then you will enjoy this one. Sure the actors are older and some of the new/shock that we experienced in the first one isn't there but the story for both characters is very good, its very much a story of self discovery for both Kick Ass and Hit Girl and of course loaded with action. I look forward to seeing these actors in their future work.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|From beginning to end, there are no boring spots. It's written well and has a great rhythm. There are so many lines that make you sit back and think about people and life. It's got good character development. I can't say enough about this book. It is sad, although it doesn't leave you feeling sad because of how the characters live their lives n such a time of great tragedy.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I have a big problem with losing bluetooths. Since getting this case it's been much easier to keep track of since I'm not just tossing it in my purse (aka the abyss)
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I was the very first person to get this game. believe me its awesome really it is awesome. thanks for believing
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved this book! If you want to escape into a world that you can't stop thinking about, THIS is the book for you. Enjoy!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Was pretty violent but if you can take that then watch it. Definitely worth a few hours of your day
1400049628|5.0|I love that this book reads as if it were really something taking place in the real world, (almost) totally seriously... but of course that's because it is!  ;)
B0090EJ99A|2.0|Nothing great about this one!! Zzzzzz, snoozeville!! Another attempt at being funny by Cohen!! I'm falling asleep just thinking about it!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My son actually really likes this game.  I got it when it was free, and really didn't think he'd like it, but he has fun with all the accessories and crazy styles he can do.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|He is very technical and descriptive, very insightful and full of passion. I personally dont need proof of heaven but this book does open the mind to the bountiful possibilities of heaven.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Cannot rate this movie as I never received it.  Kindle Fire keeps telling me to try later.  Ya sure! I am going to waste a 1/2 hour every day trying to bring it up.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Good movie... worth the time & money! Kate Winslet gives it her all to make this movie work. And she shows her ample breasts several times.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Not the best one but worth buying and watching numerous times!<br />Just to see the house go into the ocean was cool
B005HEK3JW|5.0|As good as ever.  Keep it coming.  Speaking as a Treky, it's too bad I can't afford to purchase the seasons, but I'm on a fixed income.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|As with any zombie movie the idea behind was cool. But done over and over again.  The cop getting hammered in beginning was my favorite
1594202273|3.0|The portions of the book that actually concern nuclear weapons are fascinating, including the layout of the silos, safety measures, etc. Unfortunately, the parts meant to give context go too far afield and end up becoming unrelated distractions.<br /><br />Context is important for this topic--political, social, environmental factors all play a role in how we view nuclear weapons. However, 6-10 pages on television, movies, and music of the 1980s is out of place and only dilutes a great topic--not to mention that it splits the first narrative, cliffhanger-style: Gas-leak in a silo, OH No! What happens next?! Then passages like \\"It had fully entered the mainstream, with Willie Nelson's hit 'On the Road Again' and Waylon Jennings's 'Theme from the Dukes of Hazzard'. Bob Dylan now refused to sing any of his old songs. Born again and on the road, he played only gospel.\\"<br /><br />The author is trying to create drama where drama already exists. Like a documentary that breaks up the facts with dramatic commercial breaks. Why? We've already bought the book!<br /><br />At ~610 pages, there was no need for filler.  I would have read this at 300 pages without the unrelated fluff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got this game yesterday and can't stop playing it get it lots of fun again you should get this game.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This is one of the best purchases of a soundtrack that I can recall.  Includes a lot of songs and is a pleasure to listen to.  Note that a couple tracks are in a different order in this musical than in other productions - &#34;I dreamed a dream&#34; is after Lovely Ladies - instead of before it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Not just your run of the mill mahjong  game. The story line makes it much more interesting. I enjoy it.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I bought this as an MP3 download.  I ended up actually getting the cd too.  There was one song I really liked then after getting the download I found I loved all the songs.
0553801473|5.0|GREAT PRICE for the full version of Book 5 in Hardcover!<br />This is an amazing saga. Can't wait for Book 6.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It Sounded like a good idea, unfortunately the hype writers and the designers seem to have been working from a different script<br />One of my many complaints is that once it is plugged in, it sits there and consumes around 500Kbps of bandwidth WHILE IDLE<br />that may be a good thing if you have a really FAST connection and unlimited data usage, BUT some of us have less than ideal conditions, and that 500K represents a significant part of the available bandwidth,<br />Second major gripe,<br />I could NOT get it to connect to the wi-fi router I wanted to use, and once I let connect to the one IT wanted, there doesn't seem to be any practical way to reconfigure it to a different router<br />and the straw that broke the camel's back<br />Once I got it hooked up and tried to use it, playback was so slow and choppy that it was worse than useless`<br />YMMV,  but that's what I learned in trying to get it to work
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Sarah's Key is a memorable book about the plight of a youn girl and her family in Paris prior to the involvement of the US in WWII. An investigative journalist recovers the records and facts that demonstrate the collusion of the French in German affairs and the results for the Jewish population. The book is a perceptive look at the struggles of that time for some families and the resulting effect on their lives. This book is another emotional ride through the effects of the Holocaust. I recommend reading The Plum Tree for a view of the German family effects during this same period of time.
B009YMNZJS|4.0|Vert surprisingly, I liked the movie very much. So much so that I watched it twice back-to-back :-). You won't regret checking it out.
B002HR1W1K|4.0|If you are a fan of the Simon Pegg movies, then you will love this one. I had to replace mine since my son scratched the DVD I had. I went with the Blu-Ray since it was cheap enough.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Amazing book! Couldn't put it down, the best series I've read in a very long time! And I loved every minute reading it!
B0057R5G6E|4.0|The movies are great. Good transfer and great sound, but the statue that came with it is crappy plastic. I have seen the LotR and other movie statues and they are usually pewter or something. This stuff looks and feels like the plastic they use in those dollar store toys.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|After watching it there is no doubt why it has been nominated for so many Emmys.  Great actors and crazy storyline.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|A significantly disappointing follow up to the first two in the series. No character development at all, just a continuation of Eva's whining and constant self-victimization. Extremely slow at times and no real plot, took thrice as long to complete as the first two combined. The steamy sex was pretty much the best part, and the glue that held the book together. Not too sure I'll stick around to see how this &#34;saga&#34; pans out.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Almost as much fun on CD as it is in the theater.  Performances are all excellent and the second half is better without the rather clunky libretto.  It is all surprisingly theatrical, considering it is a &#34;first attempt&#34; at a theater score; the character-driven material is just about as good as the more generic &#34;pop&#34; pieces.  When I saw it in the theatre it was over-miked and not always possible to understand the lyrics; the recording makes it possible to appreciate them.  I suspect that a familiarity with the original movie, or the stage production, would enhance a listener's appreciation but a fair amount of connecting material is included to provide song context.  Highly recommended.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Fun to see it from the beginning ! I personally think it is a crime to charge 1.99 per episode for anything though and no price break for a full season. For shame... (boy that's dated)
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|A bit over-the-top visually (&#34;let's play with the camera!&#34;) but effective adaptation of the novel.  DiCaprio's performance took a little time to get used to, but reveals the character's underlying toughness in a way no one else has captured.  Maguire and the rest of the cast are also excellent.  The movie works well in 3D, also, and is a worthy addition to any collection of 3D discs although not quite up to the standards of &#34;Hugo&#34; and &#34;Life of Pi.&#34;
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Iron man is fun. A bit arrogant.... but I guess its no arrogance if you can back it up! I love  the banter in these movies.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|You have to love this classic. Depp is as fantastic and odd as he could ever be. Even better when you realize its based on a true story.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Kinda cute actually ... this is a fun take on the whole zombie thing from the zombies point of view.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Absolutely love this series. Upstairs/downstairs character interaction is great. Acting overall is superior. Scenery, architecture, costumes are fascinating. Can't wait for the new season to start.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Not having a Kindle this is great to get the books and to be able to read them from my tablet.  Thanks
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|If you want to get started in Aquaponics Gardening, then this is the book for you!  Even if you have experience, this is a good reference.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|Nice detail and reasonably priced! Face is dead on to W.W. and comes in nice collector's edition-type packaging. Comes w/gun in hand and really like the duffel bag full of cash and especially the little &#34;Ziploc&#34; bag of blue meth, really gives it a nice touch! He loved it!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I love to watch this classic movie from time to time. It has been restored to beautiful black & white brilliance. In fact, being in black & white gives this movie the proper ambiance for the times.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I can play for a long time and not realize how much time I have used.  Fun and captivation experience
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love the game . It totally sucks you in. My only issue is that it is hard to earn crystals without paying for it...just sayin..otherwise super fun
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I love it, its so fun to play!! buut i would like better if the other ones are free please!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So fun, they are all like mini games all challenging and some are almost impossible to win only problem they have to make the instructions easyer to find
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Very nice game! I'm addicted to this game! I highly recommend this game to everyone. I'd give the game a perfect 10 if I could lol
B0076DCT2G|3.0|needed more action...lots of witticism and irreverence from corey...good ending but again loads of aluminum lined conspiracy at the end...
B008Y1YK0I|3.0|The move is great, but the 2nd disc did not work at all and I am 1 day late to exchange it for a different disc.  Fells like I wasted my money becuase if i want to see the remainder of the moviw, I have to puchase the entire disc set again.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|Love this game but, Would be better  if Facebook worked.  Please fix this problem.  Hope this get corrected soon.  Thank you.
B0035JNTA6|5.0|I have seen this movie so many times I've lost count.  Every time I laugh - like I've never seen it.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|i loved this movie. i did not get to see it in the theaters but i am glad i could find it on amazon
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great game, still getting use to some of the nuisances. The symbols for reverse etc are a little different from the regular game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love all the fun and excitement of the game. Lots of bonuses and building friendships so glad I downloaded the app to my phone and Kindle. Just wish I didn't have to start a new game saying I used the same facebook and profile. But overall no complaints.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Whe I started this book I didn't know what to think. I got. A couple chapters I and I couldn't stop reading. This book is so good. I love the relationships, the story, and the characters. I sad it is over, I hope she write a sequel to this book, I really don't care what she write about I just what to read more about Cath and Levi.
B003B02PEU|5.0|Grisham is my favorite novelist. Since I opened my first Grisham novel 5 years ago I have been hooked. You can so easily place yourself into the storyline. His stories are so real and teach you some life lessons along the way. The legal business can be so foreign to most of us and these stories show the common person some of the ways things are worked in the background. Enlightening!
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|Love this unit.  Only concern is that it is hard to go from one chapter of an audio book to the next.  Seems to want you to skip to the next part.  Otherwise it is great and works as advertised.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Omg this is just crazy boss it's better than 7.<br />So far the best car game on Amazon<br />Idk why but I got the app for free when it was 99&cent;<br />But one flaw is that it take  up lots of space on your device
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|We really enjoyed this film, good story (different) and the filming, animation and 3D were very well done. I get tired of the mostly cops and robbers shows that seems to be all that's offered any more. THis was a nice change of pace.
B001I45UFC|5.0|The best book ever I'm so happy that I got this book my friends recommend to me so I got the book
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|Bought this because I was tired of hearing &#34;you only get sifi and action movies&#34;. Turns out this is a si fi action love story.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like this game but I don't care for the fact that I have to buy the tokens.  you get a small amount of tokens to begin with.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Loved loved the game.  Great story line.  Thanks for the hints, had to use when stuck.  Well worth the cost.  Looking forward to the next one. A++++
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was very cool from the opening scream to the end.could've been a little longer but hey for $5 was well worth it.
0399157565|5.0|Great book. As usual PC knocks it out of the park. would def recommend to other readers that love the scarpetta series
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I am a fan of Richard Gere every since I watched sommersby .  I really liked this movie, I am a dog lover and this a different side of<br />Richard Gere that I had not seen.  I have watched 5 times and it makes me cry every time.  What a good movie!!!!!!!!!
0071766588|2.0|Explanations for how to answer the questions are clear and to be understood easily.<br /><br />However, this book doesn't have any mp3 files for example questions in Listening, writing, speaking section.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I love it!  The first episode gave me chills from the beginning.  It was so sad to watch the family go about their normal lives, knowing that their world was about to fall apart.  The acting, music, setting and writing are all exceptional!  I can't wait for each episode to air and each week, I think a different character is guilty.  I know I will purchase the series and re-watch it after I know who did it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|love this game.  I like to play new or old games. I like to play when I cant do anything else.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This starts off spectacularly intense and doesn't let up. I find this story very well written, and it sure keeps you guessing. I'm going to make this a part of my library which is highly unusual for me, as I only watch a few movies over and over, about once a year.<br /><br />Hollywood makes so many retreads and politically correct movies that this one is fresh, original,  and eminently entertaining.
B00001W9G0|5.0|Just a beautiful love story!  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies that are true to life and still warming to the heart.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I was disappointed, but overall it was okay. I like Matthew McConaughey and the boys. Not bad, but not particularly entertaining either.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun game, looks good on the kindle fire, I like the sound effects. Too bad we can not earn coins.
0156013983|5.0|The better way to understand a book is to read in the original languague. I've read it in spanish and portuguese, In the original languague you can understand the author, what he felt or tried to say.
0810982862|5.0|I saw the movie many times, and totally loved it when this book became available. Avatar has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and this book maintains the same level of quality and beautiful work.
B0000C9JCM|5.0|It`s a very good mix of variations of pachlebel's canon. It's nice to ear diferents instruments playing a great song.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is very creative and lots of fun.  Something the entire family can enjoy.  It definitely keeps you thinking.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was eagerly anticipating this device and finally received it today. It's going back tomorrow, after I wasted hours of time trying to set it up.  It wouldn't connect to my wireless network because - apparently - it doesn't like my router.  I called Google and the person who answered couldn't get it to work either.  She obviously had no idea what she was doing and scrambled for the right script, which is always a problem when you don't really understand the device you're trying to support.  She kept insisting that I needed to run things from the Chrome browser even though I kept telling her that Chrome was IRRELEVANT because I was just trying to SET THE STUPID THING UP, which has nothing to do with what she kept referring to as \\"casting\\" because you can't \\"cast\\" if you can't get the idiotic thing set up in the first place.<br />I thought this was going to be an easy way to connect my laptop to the TV, since my laptop doesn't have an HDMI port.  But this turned into a nightmare.  I am not a techie and I was really angry that I had to go into the guts of my router to try and modify its settings (although it turned out that they were set correctly - and I did it with the assistance of my router manual, not the useless Google support person - hey, I thought they were all supposed to be brilliant.  Apparently not.).  I wanted to \\"plug and play,\\" not curse and read manuals. As they said in some Monty Python movie, \\"Run away!\\"  I am sending in back to Amazon tomorrow.  Let some other poor sucker deal with it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|The app is fun but got so annoyed when it won't update as fast as the Apple iPhone other than that fun game
B005LAIIN0|4.0|World War Z, I thought, was a nice new approach to the zombie apocalypse.  I will say that this is now my third favorite zombie movie (first two being Zombieland and Scooby Doo on Zombie Island).  World War Z has a much different feel to it than most zombie films, at least ones that I have seen.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does a good job in this movie.  I think this is his best performance in a while.  I like his character, Gerry Lane, because you can easily sympathize with him, and he is proactive.  I like how Gerry has a military background which plays a big role in the story.  The other characters are not really worth mentioning.  Gerry's family is not given anything to do after they escape the city in the beginning of the movie.  They just sit around on a ship for most of the film and occasionally give Gerry a call to remind us that they are still in the film.  The majority of the other characters are introduced and then killed off just as quickly.  The other \\"supposedly\\" major characters do not appear until the third act, and we do not know anything about them.<br /><br />There are a lot of things that make World War Z relatively new and refreshing compared to previous zombie flicks.  First is that rather than starting the movie off in the midst of the zombie outbreak (which most zombie films do) this movie shows us the beginning of the zombie apocalypse and all the chaos that ensues from it.  Also, most zombie films take place in relatively remote locations and revolve around a small group of civilians trying to deal with the new reality.  The movie starts out like that, but once they escape New York the movie shifts gears.  Rather than just showing the effects of the zombie apocalypse in one area this movie takes place over several locations and how the people in each location are dealing with the outbreak.<br /><br />We also get a lot of scenes involving the military and how they are dealing with the situation, which we rarely see in other incarnations.  There arealso many action scenes with the military vs. zombies which are the best scenes in the movie.  The film is titled World War Z, so I expected lots of action, and I got that.  I also like how the main character is trying to find a cure throughout the movie.  Usually in zombie movies it is just people in the midst of the zombie outbreak and them dealing with it.  By the end he more or less does find a solution.  I like that it was not all in vain.  This is one of the few zombie movies to end on a somewhat triumphant note.<br /><br />The effects are alright.  There are many instances of obvious CGI with the zombies.  However there are also scenes that use practical effects which I am thankful for.  The score was okay, but nothing great.<br /><br />People have said that the 3D is not that good.  However I did not see the film in 3D, so I cannot comment on that.  I also have not read the source material, so I cannot compare them.  However, I have heard that the film greatly deviates from the book.  Fans of the book might not like this movie.<br /><br />Overall, I think World War Z is pretty good zombie film.  It is definitely one of my favorites of the genre.  Fans of the book should use caution when viewing this, because it is not really like the book.  However, I do recommend this to all who are fans of zombie movies.
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|i just like to play games requirin little energy sometimes it relaxes me after a 10hour day at work. thanks
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This book was great! I read the entire book in a few hours, and that is a compliment. I wanted to keep reading. I have shared the good word about this book as often as I can. Good work!
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This is a great movie...I ordered it through Amazon.com, and had fast delivery and no problems whatsoever..will order more dvds in the future
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I didn't think he could top Born & Raised,&#34; but John has certainly come close.  I have listened to it over and over- will probably need to get another copy (got 3 of &#34;Born & Raised.&#34;)
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|Scott sets the scenes well, the characters have depth.  Into another series I dive, on to book two, &#34;The Magician&#34;
B002C2XXJY|5.0|I love Demi Lovato! This is CD is perfect. It shows different personalities of her from rock to girl power. It's seriously worth buying!
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|Withings activity tracker Is good, but heart rate measurement is not accurate enough and comfortable.  I use it a couple of weeks.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|I LOVE DEMI LOVATO! Such a great great album! Every song is worth listening to! Awesome! Such a talented girl.
B001MSMULG|3.0|This was the first time I've read Daniel Silva.  I was hoping for an action packed book with lots of twists and turns.  It was light on both.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|ABSOLUTELY favorite album. It's so personal. Some songs make you want to cry, some make you want to dance and there's major GIRL POWER. GO DEMI.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|Just downloaded the other day but it has been fun and challenging so far. Would recommend it to a friend.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|are what convince me. Sure, it is all lovely, and \\"Flume\\" and \\"Skinny Love\\" are amazing...but the directness of \\"For Emma\\" and the finality of \\"re:stacks\\" are heartbreaking.  The falsetto took a little work, but by the end, you can't imagine it any other way.
B00DQVSTCG|3.0|Yup, the rumors are true. Madonna's MDNA World Tour Blu-Ray has some issues. What I found was the menu was hard to navigate. You have to present \\"enter\\" twice on your remote to see the menu icon get highlighted and then you can choose your menu options. The other is the audio. The DTS 5.1 does not work and you just end up with the 2.1 audio settings. Picture on my TV is awesome, but those were the only two issues I've found. I hope that we can send back our Blu-Rays soon with these fixed issues. Other than that, I am watching like crazy. Love her shows, she always puts on an amazing show. MADONNA FOREVER!!!<br /><br />Ahe'hee, Phil
B00E0SX118|5.0|This movie has it all for all ages.  This could be super for preschool to highschool.  It is super fun, the story line moves, the characters are outstanding, the colors blow you away.  It is one to see and even own.  The characters are ones you relate to but the relationships are amazing.  The character growth really is a key element to this movie.<br /><br />The way the artists created the creatures, different geography, different regions was five stars!  The colors, imagination and visuals are pushing the animation limit for this season.<br /><br />Just typing this review makes me want to go and watch this movie over again.  It has humor, action, romance (cute and clean), relationships, teen growth, trusting others, learning new ways and so much more packed inside this movie!<br /><br />Just go watch it!

1594202273|5.0|Think America's nuclear arsenal has always been pristinely safe? Thing again. In this riveting and meticulously researched book Eric Schlosser gives us a report card on accidents with nuclear weapons that have been periodically taking place since the weapons were introduced into a warring world in 1945. The book centers its narrative around the Damascus accident of 1980 in which an explosion in a Titan II ICBM housed in Damascus, Arkansas killed one and injured about twenty others. In Schlosser's capable hands, the event becomes a lens through which we can view the inherent frailty and risk in complex engineering endeavors masked by layers of bureaucracy. The volume is a real page turner which kept me awake late into the night. It is superbly researched and is packed with fascinating details about the workings of both nuclear weapons and the very human command and control infrastructure which oversees them. Some of the reviewers here are not too happy about the digressions, but in my opinion the digressions do a great job of recreating the history and the times leading up to the event. In addition all the facts are supported by an extensive bibliography running to more than a hundred pages.<br /><br />This book is really two books in one, and both parts are equally gripping. The first part describes the Damascus accident in gory technical and human detail, starting from the time that a dropped socket blew a hole in the skin of the Titan II missile, spraying fuel around the missile and creating a dangerous buildup of fuel and oxidizer. What is scary is that the accident resulted from an honest, relatively trivial mistake that anybody could have made; in the parlance of systems engineers it was only a \\"normal accident\\". Schlosser goes into great detail describing the cast of characters, from military generals and newspaper reporters to engineers and missile maintenance personnel who were involved in monitoring the event and preventing it from getting out of hand. Many of the younger technicians were straight out of high school, and while they were patriotic, brave and dedicated, one of the points that Schlosser makes is that not all of them were trained sufficiently to appreciate the nuances of maintaining one of America's nuclear linchpins. The accident itself was emblematic of what can easily go wrong with a complex system that may work well 99% of the time but can turn potentially catastrophic even if it suffers a 1% error rate. The exact details of the incident were not disclosed to the public but the account makes it clear that the explosion could have been much worse and led to a dispersal of the nuclear material in the warhead into the countryside. In fact the theme of unnecessary and pervasive secrecy is a constant thread through the book, and it's worth thinking about how the government and private corporations have constructed a potentially calamitous system funded by taxpayer dollars whose failures are concealed and successes are exaggerated.<br /><br />The Damascus accident however is only one of the two themes running through the book, and the chapters on it alternate with others. The second equally fascinating part takes us on a journey through America's nuclear weapons complex, describing the weapons that were deemed to be so necessary to maintain the peace. It is necessary to understand this history in order to put the Damascus accident into context. Many topics are covered exceedingly well; among them, the safing and arming mechanisms in bombs, the history and progress of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) as the centerpiece of America's nuclear policy, the roles of a few key individuals and laboratories (Sandia National Laboratory is especially singled out) in recognizing and addressing flaws in weapons designs, the development of novel strategic and tactical nukes and their delivery systems, the ever-changing nuclear policies orchestrated by politicians and civilian bureaucrats and - in what's a ubiquitous themein the book - the constant bickering between the different branches of the military regarding ownership of nuclear weapons. The Air Force especially comes out looking bad, constantly angling for nuclear ownership and opposing safety measures like locks for fear of malfunction.<br /><br />But the most disturbing part of the book concerns a litany of nuclear accidents going back all the way to the dawn of the atomic age. Some \\"accidents\\" simply related to human error that could have led to destruction; there are examples of important messages being entrusted to bike messengers during the Cuban Missile Crisis, rocket launches being mistaken for nuclear missile launches and lower-level officers failing to convey important notifications from rival countries to higher-ups. The stories all underscore how much can go wrong with a complex technical and human system. The Damascus event itself came on the heels of an even worse Titan II fire in 1965 that killed 53 people. The rogues' gallery of nuclear accidents involved everything from scientists dying during tests of criticality of nuclear materials to dozens of incidents involving the accidental detonation of the explosives surrounding a nuclear core, most often when the package was jettisoned from a malfunctioning bomber. Some of the scarier stories include warheads burning in crashed airplane fires for hours and being reduced to melted slag. There are also cases where people lost track of the number and locations of nuclear weapons for various time periods. In addition many bombs and missiles were woefully unsecured during the early parts of the Cold War, especially in NATO countries where they were often guarded by lone guards toting rifles. It took until the 60s when secure locks were finally installed on many of these devices. Thankfully none of these lapses let to the detonation of an actual nuclear core (and this is a record the country should be proud of), but the key message that Schlosser sends is that the gap between what was and what could have been was frighteningly thin. As officials themselves admitted, catastrophic accidents were prevented by dumb luck as much as anything else.<br /><br />Schlosser ends the book with an account of America's contemporary nuclear arsenal which still includes thousands of bombs and hundreds of missiles on alert. The end of the Cold War has led in some cases to lackluster management of an aging nuclear complex. It is also increasingly hard to find the kind of well-trained technicians and engineers that were a mainstay of the nuclear weapons buildup during the Cold War. But the real question that Schlosser asks is why all this is necessary, if it's worth having so many thousands of nukes when the nature of conflict has radically changed. In researching the book Schlosser has talked to hundreds of technicians, engineers, defense officials and politicians and almost all of them think that the nuclear arsenal should be much smaller than what it is. The real take home message here is that when an exceedingly complicated technical system becomes wrapped in layers of bureaucracy, accidents are just waiting to happen, especially when there is a perfect requirement for safety entrusted to imperfect human beings. President Kennedy really captured the gist of the matter when he talked about a \\"nuclear sword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of being cut at any moment by accident, or miscalculation, or by madness\\". In connecting these memorable words to the Damascus accident, Schlosser's book tells us why we should get rid of this sword as soon as we can.in the book - the constant bickering between the different branches of the military regarding ownership of nuclear weapons. The Air Force especially comes out looking bad, constantly angling for nuclear ownership and opposing safety measures like locks for fear of malfunction.<br /><br />But the most disturbing part of the book concerns a litany of nuclear accidents going back all the way to the dawn of the atomic age. Some \\"accidents\\" simply related to human error that could have led to destruction; there are examples of important messages being entrusted to bike messengers during the Cuban Missile Crisis, rocket launches being mistaken for nuclear missile launches and lower-level officers failing to convey important notifications from rival countries to higher-ups. The stories all underscore how much can go wrong with a complex technical and human system. The Damascus event itself came on the heels of an even worse Titan II fire in 1965 that killed 53 people.

B00B52F278|5.0|Spartacus: War of the Damned - The Complete Third Season. I'm a big fan of this show & just had to have it for my collection.
B000G03S94|3.0|Vinyl sound a bit weak... CD sounds better<br />Was disappointed with the sound... I don't know if this is not an official LP
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Love Bruce Springsteen music & with this six CD collector set, it has all the songs I like. It was worst the money.
031623480X|5.0|Are you experiencing any of the following signs:<br /><br />Being overweight?<br /><br />Being unable to change how your body looks, no matter how much you exercise?<br /><br />Being unable to lose weight or keep weight off?<br /><br />Constantly craving \\"comfort foods\\"?<br /><br />Fatigue after meals?<br /><br />Feeling consistently anxious or stressed-out?<br /><br />Feeling hungry all the time or at odd hours of the night?<br /><br />Having a tendency to snack after meals?<br /><br />Having high fasting triglycerides, over 100 mg/dL - particularly when equal to or exceeding cholesterol levels?<br /><br />Having osteoporosis?<br /><br />Having problems falling or staying asleep?<br /><br />High Blood Pressure?<br /><br />Regularly craving sugar or stimulants like caffeine?<br /><br />The presence of \\"love handles\\"?<br /><br />If you're like me, you probably answered yes to almost all of these. But there is a common answer that can alleviate these symptoms simply without medication and by what we eat and what is in what we eat. Funny how the food pyramid is where most of us gain our information on what's good for us, but you'd be surprised at how wrong the information has been that has enabled our society not only to gain larger waistlines, but also smaller brains.<br /><br />Did you know that the larger your waistline is, the smaller your brain really is? Not to mention that the risks of diabetes, obesity, dementia, cardiovascular disease, cancer, auto immune disorders and even brain disease is all being elevated now but what is in our food and what we are consuming? Evidence now points to those with risks of diabetes and are also overweight, studies have shown that degenerative brain cognition is now being proven that link the two together? If that doesn't shock you into awareness, I don't know what will.<br /><br />In the latest book, Grain Brain, Dr. David Perlmutter takes readers into the heart of what our diets and eating habits are doing to our health. Now science is proving that gluten is linked to increasing the risks of common neurological ailments such as ADHD, anxiety disorder, Tourette's syndrome, mental illness, migraines and even autism. He discusses gluten's role in behavioral and movement disorders and shows you how simple dietary changes may make significant improvements in our overall neurological health.<br /><br />He teaches you what's been happening and what we are doing that is literally killing us slowly. But there is hope, he shows you how to begin turning back the clock on some of these old habits and bring us closer to a healthier lifestyle without the need for medication or crazy fad diets. Learn the real secret behind high fructose corn syrup and even why eating fruit may be bad for you. He'll show you what supplements are worth taking, when and why, along with a great beginning exercise and healthy eating plan. He shows you what to eliminate from your kitchen and how to avoid those seemingly innocent food labels that fool you into thinking what you're buying is really healthy when its not.<br /><br />There is simply so much great information that even Dr. Mehmet Oz has commented that this is \\"An innovative approach to our most fragile organ.\\" This book is packed with easy-to-follow strategies, delicious recipes, and weekly goals to help you put the plan into action, along with real life stories of transformation to gain control of your life, regain wellness and enjoy lifelong health and vitality.<br /><br />I received Grain Brain by Dr. David Perlmutter compliments of Little, Brown and Company, a division of Hachette Book Group for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable review. I've been working on my own healthier eating plan for three weeks and found the information in this book instrumental to aid me in my way to a stronger more well balance lifestyle. I already knew that grains were something most farmers feed their stock to fatten them up so it made sense thatit would work on us as well. It's great to know that some of the things I was doing was great, but also the reduction of how much fruit I was eating didn't make sense until I read through the chapter on sugar, Chapter 4, Not a Fruitful Union -This is Your Brain on Sugar (Natural or Not). What I read literally shocked me and made complete sense. I would rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars and plan on changing what I buy and what my family eats to ensure a healthier lifestyle for all of us.it would work on us as well.

B00CD36FF6|3.0|I liked it but it was a little bit repetitive and too obvious. Bottom line...I dind't learn from it a lot.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well this book is definitely a page turner.  I have had many people say that the books are poorly written, but apparently I'm not intellectual enough to notice that because I read each Fifty Shades book... lol.. To each his own!  I loved it!
B004PYDBVM|4.0|Read it...definitely read it but only after you have read some other books on the subject. I would recommend (highly recommend). &#34;Nothing to Envy&#34;...and then you should buy this one. Enjoy.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|As a longtime Seuss fan and a fan of the original Lorax, I thought, &#34;No way can this movie come close to the classic Lorax movie.&#34;  However, they did a great job with this.  What a great story and lesson to teach children about being kind to the earth!  Great earth day movie for a classroom too!
B004FP1WX0|3.0|This piqued my interest watching the trailer. Interesting movie. It was on sale so decided to watch. Don't think it will let you down. Not giving the story away but expect the unexpected, and enjoy the ride.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Never thought I would like &#34;science fiction.&#34;  I was wrong.  Love this book.  Loved the first book, &#34;Ender's Game,&#34; and I am loving number 3!  Thank you Mr. Card!  :o)
B004AUGJS8|5.0|What a twister kind of movie. Just when you think it's going one way, it takes you down another path. Worth the watch. Gosling and Dunst are great cast together.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Must read.  I'll say no more.  Book 2 loaded and ready to go.  I should have given science fiction a read way before now.  Thank you, Mr. Card!  :o)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|fun and surprising book.  interesting characters and unusual plot.  I enjoyed every page.  has it all-intrigue, sex, relationships, crime,<br />pathos.  I'm a guy but like these kinds of books.
B000FC10HA|4.0|Truly excellent book that will give you the high-level concepts that you need to know in marketing. great read for newbies and experienced ones alike.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I'll start off with being honest, the only reason I even looked at this album is because of &#34;Thrift Shop.&#34; I'm not a huge fan of rap, I usually listen to country and rock, but this album took me completely by surprise. If you're looking for something different, or rap album that doesn't involve singing killing cops or beating women, give this a chance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is amazing it is addicting but sometimes boring but what I do is try to beat my highest score with my friends on facebok
B00C061I3K|4.0|As I mentioned in a previous review, I usually listen to country or rock. However, I decided to branch out, and with the radio incessantly playing &#34;Get Lucky,&#34; I decided to give this a chance. I was pleasantly surprised, it's a very good album with some very good music.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I have to say that I was truly impressed with this show and can't wait to see more.  Its hard to compare to another show.... it feels so unique and amazing.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I bought this album on a whim, JT is a decent musician in my opinion, and I liked the song &#34;Tunnel Vision&#34; when I first heard it. &#34;Suit and Tie&#34; is okay, and &#34;Let the Groove Get In&#34; can get you moving, but beyond that, I wasn't overly thrilled.
B0042JSMV4|4.0|I love the material in the book. I purchased it in the Kindle format and I can't use it unless I'm connected to a devise while crocheting. That's a little difficult, but I enjoy the patterns.
0671688782|1.0|One of the things that really bothered me about this book is that the author believes in order for the holding time to be successful there must first be a stage where the child struggles and doesn't want to be held. Then the child should give in and submit to the holding time. If that resistance stage doesn't occur, and the child happily climbs into the parent's arms, the parent should instigate the child's rejection by saying something like, &#34;I really didn't like it when you disobeyed me yesterday.&#34;  This is totally dysfunctional. Why would the author want to suggest that it's healthy to pick a fight when a child is behaving affectionately. It makes me sad to think children might be submitted to this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I look forward to the movie, I can't imagine how they will be able to reproduce the effect of our imaginary Greg had on his audience.
0321934318|5.0|I only purchase Scott Kelbey books related to photography and also Apple products.  East to read and laid out in a way that easily covers every aspect of the subject matter.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I felt it demeaned women. Then, the heroine gets stronger while more details of Grey comes forward.<br />Made you want to read more and more questions. The first book was a heck of a cliffhanger.
B000HKYOK0|3.0|A lot of good episodes.  Unfortunately a lot of bad episodes too.  Problem is the bad episodes are really terrible.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed the trilogy as one ongoing damn good read. Literally an rise to the blood pressure.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a gifted storyteller. I was swept away by the imagery and how each individual's story all came together beautifully. I loved The Kite Runner and I loved this novel as well.
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|Btd 5 is fun, challenging and addicting.<br /><br />I wish i can play this on my cell like Sas3, but that option is not available. Ive also played btd 5 on desktop and used my facebook to log, but app and desktop are not the same BUT i log in with the same FB acct.<br /><br />Otherwise u will love this game!
B008RF0M9O|5.0|I have my headset back came quick and fit great good buy. I recommend this product for anyone who needs these replaced.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Haven't read the Harry potter series as the genre doesn't appeal so was a bit apprehensive before reading this book but was really surprised at how great this book is. Brilliant characters and a great story line. Look forward to her next 'adult' book
B009LQKHIO|5.0|The book was excellent.  I want to get the rest of the series. Keep writing and I will continue to buy.
B000002WPH|5.0|This album is classic and still the pimpest of the pimp in my book!<br /><br />Your going to get a lot of really classic sounding hip hop with this one. Simple well produced beats with many different MC's flowing over the beat on each song. Lots of funny kinda rhymes, lot of old kung fu movie samples and general &#34;wu tang&#34; type atmosphere. Its clearly evident when listening to his how wu tang clan really influenced hip hop from then on out. The overall rhyming style and beat arrangment is how a lot of hip hop sounds now a days and wu tang were the one of the pioneers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read the free download of Wool on Amazon Kindle and became instantly hooked.  This series is unique and very well written.  I highly recommend.
B001DPC4SM|4.0|What really needs to be said? Classic album by a classic guy. His smooth pimpness emanates from inch of this record. Simply magical
B003H9MSPG|2.0|Nerf N-Strike Longstrike CS-6, should have waited. Too expensive, found elsewhere cheaper.  But grandkid want it.  Will wait and shop around next time.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Well acted movie, something rare in zombie or apocalypse films.  No build-up, just action from the start.  Very little unneeded violence or gore.  Rented it then bought it.
B000IZA9NK|5.0|Bought wide screen for the grand kids, who loved it. Would recommend to friends and others. Very good scenes, good action.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I watched this DVD with my 6yrs & 5yrs old kids and laughed as much as they did. I am 51yrs old. I guess there is no age requirement to just laugh a while. They say it is the best medicine.
B007T99ENE|3.0|This is a well-written tale, taking the reader on an interesting journey, but it wasn't as good as some of his other novels.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I read this while at the pool this summer.  Perfect book for laying in the sun.  I only wish it had been a little longer.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This is a well-written, quirky crime-biography-history-comedy book. It would be great for a holiday read or for someone who needs a light-hearted read.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I watched the TV series first and then started reading the books.  The books ARE better.  And the story line is different, but good.
B003QWRA3Y|4.0|This film is a cinematic treat. The plot is an original twist of mind games and the performances are strong. The characters' motivations are plausible but still shocking! This is a stylish,thought-provoking thriller that you will perhaps wish to view again. Lastly, the film makes profound statements about modern relationships. [[ASIN:B003WEAJ1G Agatta]]
0399165274|5.0|Frederick Forsyth does not write books to win Nobel Prize. Some like stories with flesh and blood in the characters.Others look for pure entertainment, which is what works for me. The Kill List does not disappoint.<br /><br />Many great thriller writers can write spitfire narratives, but nobody can write narratives in the tense and gripping styles that Forsyth does. Every detail has to do with how the story unfolds. He makes complicated subjects easy to understand, and does not waste a single word.<br /><br />You don't find many writers out there who can consistently spin a yarn that you don't want to do anything else but keep going until you finish.<br /><br />I read all the books Forsyth ever published. I also read them immediately after they came out. He's that good to me. However, this is the second time in a row that he writes a story without the surprise ending that makes him a thriller writer beyond compare. Still, he's way, way ahead of the rest.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone! Men and women alike. This book came to me at the perfect time. I just had a baby, and had to return to work and was debating wether to go back or not. The book is helping me so greatly to manange that internal conflict working mothers btween family (kids and husband) and work. I really couldnt be more greatfull for this book! I know for sure i will go back to my highlights - so handy in the kindle edition!<br />The book is easy to read and is just inspiring!
B00422LESO|2.0|Overall - disappointed.  A quick read, but not enjoyable and very predictable and the main character actually annoyed me.  Maybe the movie will be better!
B00499NHLC|5.0|The best tv series I have ever watched. Can't wait to follow the next seasons. Beautiful soundtrack music as well.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like it.  I've played it before on a computer , so I was familiar with it.  I'm about to graduate to three suits
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Just goes to show you, you can still get old and kick it with blues guitar.  Buddy is indeed a \\"showman\\"!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I actually have never played the game. Every time I try to turn it ot it takes too long to download and I loose interest. Apparently there is a download required every time you want to play.
B00B23Z2IE|4.0|This is a guy who has been around along time but finally got his chance to release some retro soul.  His second release.  Could have been recorded in the early '70's.
B0011UBDTK|2.0|many of the disks are scratched.  some of the episodes will not play on most of the disks. 2 of the disks will not even run (season 7).
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|A great story of the Eagles from beginning thru the fights to the present.  Sound is really good, even the older recorded stuff.  In the end Glenn Frey gets a little full of himself, but Joe Walsh as always, is quite funny.
B008JEJPT6|5.0|I love how comfortable these Crocs are. This is my second pair of this style. I purchased them because I was so impressed with the first pair. The color of these means I probably won't wear them as often, but there will be days that they will be a nice cheerful pick me up. I hope they will not phase this model out, I think they are my all time favorite for fit, comfort, durability and they are great in the snow for traction because of the sole design.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|This book had so many twists and turns that I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to happen next.  Even though Ben had a mental problem, I developed a soft spot for him and found myself not liking the people that did him wrong.  I liked the special romance; glad that he was able to at least have that amount of happiness.  The identity of the true killer surprised me a little at first, but I started to suspect it after a while.  That poor poor cat.  All in all this is a great book of murder and mayhem.  Great Job!
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|story just okay, boring throughout, Maggie could have been better. Accents sometimes hard to distinguish, couldn't really recommend it to anyone
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This was my third Hosseini book that I have read and I would rank it as the best of the three. The Kite Runner has received much positive critique which was clearly deserved . &#34;And the Mountains Echoed &#34; surpasses it .<br />Hosseini has a very easy to read style. He weaves stories which keep the reader totally immersed in the characters. They become friends, or in this instance almost family .The reader WANTS to know what will happen to them.<br />The story is about three generations of an Afghan family .It relates their very believable lives ,the problems they encounter and how they overcome these . The outcomes are not always happy but even in sadness the people in the story are very real and the reader feels for their pain as well as their happiness.<br />I  highly recommend this book and wish to say that I am a little envious of any reader who is about to start their reading journey of this wonderful contribution to the English literature. Enjoy the journey!
B004ZH66XO|2.0|Installed this in 2011 when it was the faotd then. I thought this was a good game and maybe even fun. No way it was either! Heavy app for Android devices. Eats memory and slows phone as well as drains the battery. App also sports IAP and plenty of ads. Uninstalled the same day. Bad programmer, bad!
B000002IPZ|5.0|Excellent album. Great first record for anyone who has never heard them. I saw them at the Trocadero in Philadelphia back in the 90's. Great live band too.
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|The product is simple enough. It's much more like a puzzle than it is a tetris game if you're asking my opinion. The goal is to get all the blocks to fit within a border. Eh, simple enough. It's fun to play while waiting for an appointment at the Dr.'s office. It's an attention getter for kids who are impatient while waiting somewhere... overall, it's a cute game. You can change the theme, background, layout design, etc., under options. You can make the lines vibrant or more block style. The sounds almost annoy me though! It's not as easy as touching the speaker at the top right of the screen either. Don't think that will quiet those annoying sounds! The dev could work on that (hint, hint).<br /><br />Beyond the \\"tunes\\" that the dev thought were great for this game, I can't find anything too awfully bad to complain about. It's simple and cute. If you're looking to keep your mind busy with nothing, this'll do the trick :)
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I'm a musician and acappella singing has always been a joy and for it to be blended so seamlessly  into today's music and dance tradition,gives it long traction for many years. My children who are all musicians keep going back to view it. I've looked at it at least 4 times.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The book takes you through highlights of buds training as well as a summary of navy seal sniper school.  The combat description takes you to the actual action.  Great story with fine detail on tactical equipment used during his service.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for romance drama action and forbidden love. It is a great book to just sit down and read
B006WWU8IO|5.0|Listening to this album reminds me of why I like Taylor Swift in the first place, even though I may not be one of her typical fans. (female, in my 50's) Her songs seem real. They express feelings and ideas that ring true for someone feeling their way through the young days of learning about love and relationships even though it has been so many years for me. I also like the fact that she has remained a class act and not let fame or industry pressures turn her into some sort of soft-porn sex machine, but a real young woman feeling her way through life.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|Everything in this movie is superb!!! The plot, the acting, the messages, and the music, especially the theme song, Philadelphia. There is a scene where Tom Hanks is listening to an aria, perhaps for the last time in is life......unforgettable!!!!!!!
B0031ES8P6|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter's upcoming birthday.  I thought HK would come in purple tartan like the image, but instead she's wearing a pink tartan dress.  Not that I'm complaining because my daughter will love the pink.  But if you want purple, you might be disappointed.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Won't load its a price of scrap so don't down load I hat it its so stupid.geese it gets on my nerves I hate it I really hate ufjrhfhfhfj bench eighth neck  Mencken he  eh us  whisk brunch Jen hi  Jen  je km th  e force dcjdncbdj Mencken : fish force omg kbrickwork
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|An excellent movie rendition of the book. Dystopian future where a oppressive Capitol, victor of a past Civil War, lords over the &#34;districts&#34; of the new nation. As tribute for their loss they must offer two tributes, one boy and one girl, for annual Hunger Games, gladiatorial combat in a giant arena... to the death. The morning started off normal for Katniss Everdeen but would soon just be the journey on her journey of survival...
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very fun game. Something to kill time with and its very addicting. Should get rid of the energy though I hate that part.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Fun, addictive and lots of levels to keep you busy! I have had the one with adds and would never get it again.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|love this!  I've been waiting for this release for a few months as the singles have been released.  It did not disappoint!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just read this book. Perfect from start until finish. Thank you Colleen for this book and your writing. Thank you!
B00CWM3F4C|3.0|I didn't know what to think about AIC with a new singer.  They are definitely following the same formula.  Album feels a little bit dated to me but it's good.  I saw them live and they blew me away so they still have it in them.  I'd like to see some more of that live energy on their albums
B009MXSWI8|3.0|Probably a very novel story for the time.  I Hate to knock such a well followed Cult Classic, but Gore for Gore's sake just ain't my thing
B000002JSR|4.0|I realize this album contains the left-overs of the band, one last money grab for the record company but it's still very good. Obviously the worst of all the LZ albums (but it's still LZ).
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Love the storyline, characters, everything!<br /><br />If only we could get the current season at the same time as they do in the UK.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|Too many loose ties at the end. An interesting premise but I would have liked a different ending...or a continuance into another book to expand on the story.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV! I have loved every episode! I will be watching this show over and over.
B00555X8OA|2.0|Very professorial. If you miss psyche 201, this is for you.  Audio version not edited for audio, so it refers to pages, pictures and graphs you don't have.  Got this book to fill in the gaps.  Very thought provoking. But SLOW.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie is really good. It is way better than the one with Stallone. It blows that version of the comic book out of the water. \\"Hit em with a little slomo first.\\" Best remake in a long time. Urban kills it. Makes Stallone look like a chump.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had heard from 2 friends that this book was great.  I was disappointed.  There was a lot of foul language and crass sexual stuff.
B003B02OOG|1.0|I USUALLY LOVE JOHN GRISHAM'S BOOKS, BUT THIS IS NOT HIS BEST.  NOT UP TO HIS STANDARDS OF QUALITY WORK.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Must read! Such a touching and relatable story. You fall in love with the characters and don't want the book to end.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Maysa in my opinion is so under rated. She is an excellent artist and she continues to create great music, If you don't have this CD in your music arsenal, you are missing out. Purchase it now and let Maysa take you to unknown heights.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|It's so gratifying to read a story full of heartache that doesn't end like a Greek tragedy. I loved following Victoria  on her journey to love and family.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|Grace, theistic soteriology, naturalism, eco-thology, transcendental idealism: all couched in today's mood.  Beautifully done.  Grand, moving, engaging, minimal tone poem.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It was a roller coaster ride of emotions , war, love, murder and death. What more could you want , all parts were played beautifully by all . I normally don't care for soap operas, but Downton has me hooked for life ! Now onto season 3 !
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I couldn't read it fast enough.  This is the second time I've read it.  The Afghan people are inspirational.  God Bless them all.
B00092ZL80|4.0|I really enjoy the performance shown on this disc. If you are into Chicago, go for it! (Earth Wind and Fire too)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm having so much fun playing this game. My daughter and I play it all the time instead of Candy Crush! LOL
B004O0TKWG|5.0|Two of Gerry Rafferty's best albums for a bargain price. Love Gerry's voice, lyrics and music, and have been a fan since the mid-70's when he was with Stealers Wheel. RIP Gerry.

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I really liked stickman epic.it was challenging &amp;fun to play.hope a lot of other people like it.if you want something fun to play, this is your app
0307120007|5.0|this is such a fun book to do with your young babies and toddlers  it is very interactive and helps learning
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I think it is one of the best Apk in the market in order to Download all kind of videos on the internet!!! =)
B003N5VOUO|5.0|I enjoy watching SRK and Kajol perform together.  They are my favorite &#34;on screen&#34; Bollywood couple.  It's bittersweet message is a lesson for us all to follow.  There truly are two kinds of people, &#34;good and bad&#34; and we can't lump everyone in a particular group into &#34;bad&#34; based on their culture and beliefs.  Loved the movie believe in it message.
B00AEBBA0Y|4.0|This is an exciting and funny movie! I don't really know what else to say other than it is really good and worth a watch. =)
B0029ATTAQ|3.0|It was Grim, Depressing, and lacked any redemptive qualities.  I get it that every film can't have a happy ending; if they did, they would have used them all already.  Nevertheless, it did adhere to the novel, and illustrated what is possible when power runs amok.  That said, it needed to clarify more.  I say that because if you haven't read the book, you'll certainly miss out on a lot.  I hope you like rewinding mid-scene.  Worth watching once, and thinking about everytime Big Brother is mentioned during the news!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is a awesome movie! I grew up watching it sing and dancing through our living room as a small child, tween and teen! Bought this for my mom. finally had a chance to watch it again this summer! SOOO good! if you haven't ever seen it you should get it today!!!
B0096HL33G|4.0|Although the movie can be slow at times, I thought the acting was wonderful and the storyline very compelling.  Its a good rainy day movie.  Enjoy!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love it when you have a book you think about getting back to during the day. Wool was one of those for me.<br />You will not be disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 has a lot of twists and turns so hold on! But it's all really good! You will love it!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is a Christmas movie with a morale! Great for the children to watch with their parents ( a rare thing to happen these days). Just make popcorn and hot chocolate for everyone and enjoy. Be sure to talk just a little about it after the movie ends. What was their favorite part...I'll bet it was Clarence the Angel. We had lost our copy of this movie and were heartbroken. Thanks to Amazon for having one we could purchase online.
B005544V6A|5.0|Can hardly wait to watch the latest season on Amazon Prime.  I am addicted to this show and the characters,
B005544V6A|4.0|Smart and funny show with heart. The dynamic between the two main characters is great. Recommended to anyone that enjoyed watching Lie to Me or White Collar.
B008GJV4F2|4.0|Well, a good film if you're looking for something with Johnny Depp and not terribly<br />complicated. An ok storyline - good, not great - and fun to see Judi Dench as well.<br />The chocolate creations will make you hungry.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book started off strong but soon became a frustrating disappointment.  The premise is good, but the story goes on and on and on and the situations become more and more absurd.  I stuck it out to the end, but by that time, I wanted my money back.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Doctor Who Season 5 is fantastic, especially for first-time Doctor Who viewers.  I started watching Doctor Who beginning with the first episode of this season, and I definitely think this season is a good place to start.  Matt Smith is an amazing Doctor, Amelia Pond with her spunk keeps things interesting, and all the other characters... well, I won't give it away.  BUT.  If you've got friends who like Doctor Who, and those friends want you to become a fan too, start here.  I honestly don't think you'll regret it.  [Until it makes you cry. Then you might regret it. But probably not enough to stop watching.]
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This is a nice harmless game. I spent many contented minutes tapping away. There were some server connectivity issues, but I think that's more attributable to our lousy wireless network than any problems with the actual game.<br /><br />But then recently there was a Microsoft ad that started playing. Not just when you open the app, but seriously anytime you tried to do anything that involved the display changing. To access any of the menu items (settings, check your reef stats, go to a list of plants you can buy), you needed to watch a video ad first. What is this, 2003? Smart devs know that modern consumers have a really short fuse when it comes to annoyance in advertising, and these guys have unfortunately made it abundantly clear they are not smart devs.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|I have not watch a movie that have held my interest like this one in a long time. I watched it than I bought it so I could watch it over and over again.
B00000IL1K|3.0|I don't know why I keep buying her albums, probably because I like the songs rather than the way she sings them.  I find her voice is not very rich and a bit tinny, particularly the high, long-held notes.  I have made a mental note to myself not to buy any further albums of hers...
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Gameloft needs to improve the resolution on the Kindle fire hd and fix the water splash effects and the drifting smoke
B004EPYZT4|5.0|I don't really need to say anything else ... just so much better than Arnie with better lines and just about everything else!
B00DU77QP2|4.0|Make sure you read the rest of the series of these books. The rest of the series really cements the stories. Great series.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|super awsome. the music the grafics. the way the different birds look like the movie chacters. i love the achievements aspects. so cool you can play both sides.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a great game! It's a lot of fun and you'll love it! Plus its free! I have so much fun playing and competing with my friends. So get it right now!
B008U3NU38|5.0|I haven't listened to the entire thing yet, but it seems pretty amazing. At first I thought they left out a few songs from Black Market Clash (which they did), but after digging through my collection a little deeper, here's the 3 songs that are left out. No biggie:<br /><br />Justice Tonight/Kick it Over (Basically a longer version of Armagideon Time)<br />Mustapha Dance (Basically a 1/2 instrumental remix version of Rock the Casbah)<br />Robber Dub (Basically a remix of Bankrobber)
B006M4F67A|4.0|It is different from the regular mahjong and the symbols are not boring. I like the different shapes of puzzle
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book was all I enjoy in SCI-FI. It's hero was an 11 year old boy playing a game that's more important than he would ever imagine. It has the depths that man is willing to go to survive and ensure humanities survival regardless of the cost.  Ender grows to be a wise and thoughtful leader that will shape the future of others. I look forward to seeing the movie and I hope it can cathedral in the book fans like me. MR. Orson Scott Card, thank you for a great read.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|when A product has an &#34;unrated&#34; marked on it, it's best to watch it alone first, I've seen this before, what they did in the end to mCaligula, they should have done allot sooner, add it to your collection today, my personal rating is &#34;two thumbs up&#34;
B000OVLINI|1.0|I only gave it a star because it wouldn't let me review it if I didn't. I got a third of the way through and could not bear to read it any further. Boring boring boring.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|keeping in touch with family and friends and being able to share pictures and recipes and extend birthday wishes, happy anniversaries, and and best wishes
B004GYY714|5.0|I've had this app for over one year and have been very happy with it.  I like it way better than Pandora.  I'm not interested in downloading songs onto my phone.  Oh no,  guess that makes me bit of a dinosaur.  Anyway, I enjoy  listening to  music on the radio when I'm on my lunch break.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is awesome after it finally loaded.I hope they make a sequel or maybe more than another maybe it could be many like the gta seques
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely adore this app. I have had very minimal issues and all were resolved quickly. Best bingo app out there and truly the easiest and most enjoyable to use.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I had played dungeon hunter on IOS so I was thrilled to find it for kindle and wow 4 blew me away.... at first then I got to where I needed to log onto the Internet to upgrade item remove gems regenerate potion and since my Internet is pretty spotty at best it kinds put me off a bit but overall a good game boss battle can be a button masher but rewarding so 4 out of 5 gameloft keep up the good work.
B0063M22QO|4.0|It is your basic mahjong game but it is fun.<br />Have only played with it a bit so don't know how much else there is.
B000FA675C|5.0|Just an excellent book! Well written and interesting. I had watched the movie first  and found the additional info helpful.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|It is a fun game. Has many different levels of tiles and you can choose different back ground and tiles.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Synced up perfectly with my Google calendar on my Kindle; very pleased with the performance. I know there's more I can learn to do with it, but for having my calendar on the run, it's great just with my barebones effort.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Should of read the description more.  They have to book but would love to have the game on Kindle to play.
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|Reminds us the power of Mr, Guy. Start to finish , not a weak song in the bunch. Enjoy the guitar god.
B000I62JAK|5.0|Why am i oblige to make a comment with at least 30 words.<br />This is boring and time consuming for me!!!!
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I loved this movie!  It does not exactly follow the book, but it was great anyway.  I will wear it out!
B0028R3NCU|4.0|I like how small and compact this reader is. It doesn't work with 64GB cards though, the largest one I was able to read was 32GB. Handy little accessory to have.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|More and more evidence of the so obvious.<br />If you want to learn more, this book together with some other titles including, Michael Newton - Journey of Souls, Andreas Moritz - Lifting The Vale of Duality will provide you with some interesting insight to a very very big subject....
B008EKON56|3.0|I used this on an old iPad2 to get better sound out of it. It worked, but not a big improvement. The audio may be a tad cleaner, but nothing to write home about. I was using this in conjunction with a FiiO E6 but I have since stopped using this L11 and just use the E6 alone.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I rarely buy apps, particularly games, cuz I get bored of them so quickly. But Angry Birds Star Wars was one of my fave apps ever. Got 3 stars on all levels, then my tablet crashed and I lost everything. Sooooo, I started to play over, but then, this new app came out and I've been addicted and playing non-stop since I got it.<br /><br />THIS APP IS FANTASTIC<br /><br />Easily the Best Angry Birds EVER. Love it and am having a great time with all the new characters and stuff they can do. Looking forward to working through the levels and getting 3 stars on them all. Everything I could want from a sequel and more. Get it! Play it! Become addicted like me, and never put it down.<br /><br />There's a reason why Angry Birds is the biggest app out there, and this is it -- they know how to keep reinventing themselves, yet retain what we all love about their games in the first place. ABSW2 couldn't be any better. Fun, fun, fun!<br /><br />Love It!<br /><br />I'll update this review with more in-depth info as I can tear myself away from playing. Time to get those piggies! The Force Is Strong in this one!<br /><br />UPDATE - My eyes are bloodshot and my nerves are a bit frayed.  I think I may need a little downtime to decompress from this game, but that ain't likely to happen just yet. ;oD  Here's a few more details:<br /><br />- Yoda is a hoot! Love how he goes berserk spinning and twirling all over the place, destroying things with his light-saber.  It's hard to know exactly how he'll rebound, so wrangling him to go after what you want pulverized is tricky, but in a good way.<br /><br />- The menus between levels are fun.  It adds a bit more of a story element to the whole game, as you progress through your mission on Naboo, and other locales.  There's even hidden stuff to find to unlock other levels.<br /><br />- The graphics can be a bit choppy between levels. Literally nitpicking here. I've only noticed it on the animation where you're awarded the stars for each level. The game-play is smooth throughout otherwise.  Older devices or slower phones may not handle this app well.<br /><br />- Tons of opportunities to spend real money on power-ups, new characters and such. This is to be expected.  Angry Birds is big business, and they probably have steep licensing fees to pay to George Lucas, and now Disney.  But there's plenty to do without spending a dime. I bought the app outright just to eliminate the pesky ads. But make no mistake, this game has plenty of other goodies to tempt your wallet with. I doubt I'll splurge on anything.<br /><br />- The game is split into 2 halves - The Dark Side and The Rebels. So each chapter has levels for each side.  So you have a chance to play as both the good guys or the bad guys, each with their respective characters. Keeps the game interesting and exciting as you decide which side of The Force you favor.<br /><br />- There's a LOT to play here for a mere 99¢! Bonus levels galore, secrets to uncover, loads of new characters.  Points scored with each character are tallied, as are other stats.  It's all very detailed and well thought out.  This really takes Angry Birds to a whole other level.  Amazing really.<br /><br />- There are so many characters now, that at times, it's hard to keep track of what abilities they each have. So the Rovio people have smartly added little icons above each character that give a pictorial clue as to what each one does; blow up, light saber, spinning amok, etc. It's very helpful in keeping track of how one can wield The Force or weaponry with each character.<br /><br />- This unfolds and plays like an actual, well thought out, movie sequel, not just an app. I'm at a loss to see how they could have made it any better.<br /><br />More Updates to come as I pry myself away from the game, and actually sleep and engage life, from time to time! Why am I still typing? I have a rebellion to fight!! ;oD<br /><br />UPDATE 2<br /><br />Still loving this game, but I have to admit, insome ways, I just prefer the first ABSW. I just prefer playing with the tried and true characters I'm fond of. Don't get me wrong, this game is great, but there's something to be said for playing with Luke, Han, Lean Obi, Chewy and the gang. So I guess I'm partial to the spoof of the original trilogy, over the spoof of the sequel trilogy -- er prequel ...you get what I mean.  I hated Jar-Jar before, but using his tongue like he's an extra terrestrial toad, is kinda a fun way to bash those piggies, who aren't really piggies I guess. It's all suspension of disbelief. Either way, great app.  But at some point, I'll probably just go back to the 1st ABSW app and try to restore my 3 stars on all levels.<br /><br />Wonder what's next for Rovio -- Angry Birds Harry Potter?  Star Trek? Twilight? Terminator? Hmmm... maybe even Jurassic Pork? (Tee hee)  Time will tell, and I'll probably play it. ;oDsome ways, I just prefer the first ABSW.

B00EY8BRGU|5.0|The plot, the storyline, the ending, the magic, the twist were all 5 stars. I thought the actors each fit their parts so well. They did a great job. I've seen this movie 3 times and will watch it again, I'm sure. It was one of the best movies I've watched in a long time.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I thought the book was well written with valid research behind he authors observations and conclusions.  Recently I have purchased Apple products and did not understand the Apple &#34;cult&#34;.  This book helped me get a picture of Apple.  I went to see the movie &#34;Jobs&#34; and felt that it was not a full picture of Steve Jobs.  This book does it all.  I also liked the fact that other people were given time and space in the book to get the entire picture of Jobs and Apple.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Everyone has been talking a bout this show so I started watching it. It is by far the best show an television.
B004742Y68|4.0|Watched this with my 11 year old, who is starting to be interested in scary movies.<br />This fits the bill: scary, funny, well-acted. It's funny how many of the effects don't hold up at all, but the universal fear of clowns and scary trees still overrides these deficits.<br />The family still feels real, as does the neighborhood that so similarly parallels the contemporary &#34;E.T.&#34;<br />Great fundamentally scary and entertaining movie to watch together.
B002KGEORM|5.0|It just keeps getting better and better! Can't wait to see what happens next. I just love the SOA family.
B00F35BV64|5.0|This was not a disappointment. I enjoyed watching this movie with my boyfriend and father who are talking about the differences and the twist in the plot through the whole things. :-/ Even though the company was over educated and annoying, the movie still pleased them as well. :)
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|If you like puzzle games I recommend this one.its not to hard but it makes you think too..graphics are great.
B007CLSE8K|5.0|good movie<br />nice action<br />well played<br />twist on story line<br />worth watching more then once<br />would recom to a friend
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Worthy successor to The X-Files and similar. Most of it is very far-fetched, but that's what makes it so enjoyable.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Please reference the stars for my opinion of this music. I feel you should listen to music to judge it you like it or not.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I have only play it one time and it appears to be a very good game. Several days ago two distant cousins were here one evening and they were playing it and they told their dad that they want to have it on their Kindles also. They currently had Asphalt 7 and were impressed about the improvement with the 8.

B0088EDMMS|5.0|I love this movie. I loved in it 1993 and I still love it today. I watch it every year to kick off autumn..then watch it over and over through Halloween. It just makes me happy. It's too bad Disney originally released this film in the summer. Had they held it until Sept/Oct..it might have made more money. SO happy that it's become a Halloween cult classic.
B0086DBE62|5.0|I watched this on amazon first them my friend ended up having the movie at her house the night after I had already seen it. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it two nights in a row.

B0068AWQQ2|5.0|I only watch this movie to see David Tennat and I have to say that overall if had a nice spin on some of the old ideas. It still made for a decent ending. Also David Tennat was hilarious.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|its sort of like a copy of mincraft but not as fun I might like the full version but its doubtfull it also needs more demo time.I don't recommend it.
B00A8Z6KN8|4.0|I had to get this right after watching the movie. I listed to 4 and 5 so much that I can hum and sing them now. We even deceived to recreate the kitchen scene and change up the lyrics enough to give my future mother in law a small heart attack and laugh all at the same time.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was released to the pay-per-view channels & I thought........ehh it's OK. Then it hit HBO & I watched it again. And again. AND again. Each time I saw more & more layers to the plot, the acting,the Directing, the wardrobe, the music.........it's a very enjoyable movie about a very horrible event. Is it completely historically accurate? No. But it captures the mood & the emotions that surronded this hostage drama.It would be difficult to make a movie about a group of people trapped in a house for months, hoping they won;t be caught or executed (or kill each other from the closeness & tension).So scenes were added & conjecture has its place. Ben is supposed to be a low key but intense kind of guy. You don;t do what he did for the CIA if you are an emotional showy kinda guy. That gets you killed. That gets your people killed. So his acting was spot on for the role. All of the supporting actors are good. And there is a surprising amount of humor in the movie -- as in real life you cannot deal with such awfulness without some sense of humor or the absurd. So the movie felt \\"real\\". Many such stories leave out all humor and that simply isn;t how people survive. It may be \\"black\\" humor but it is humor nonetheless. Of course the HollyWood scenes lend themselves best to the humor & the Political scenes lend themselves best to the absurd (that hasn't changed)but even with the hostages -- a simple line here and there makes the case for how people use humor to cope. So I went from thinking this would be a 3 star review to a 5 star because it got better w/ each viewing. It takes a lot to get me to buy a movie/DVD these days I bought this one.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the kind of book that needs to be savored. It is very smartly written and there are multiple quotes that are so memorable. While deciding to read this book, I knew it was about cancer and dying but it was more than that. It was about the genuine (in sickness and in health) kind of love between two teenagers, philosophical view about being alive, and the impact of losing one's loved ones. Augustus's adoration of Hazel was totally understandable because she was such a lovable character, wise beyond her years, kind, considerate and unassuming to how special she was.

B002APU580|5.0|I did think I would like this version as I love the A&E mini-series; however, I was surprised and find the are both equally enjoyable.  The scenery in this movie is beautiful the actors did a wonderful job playing their characters....can't wait to watch it again.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|Another fun story of one of her many adventurers. I think that she makes a great alternative to have someone watch Barbie.

There are more than enough strategies in here to meet your needs, tastes, preferences, and problem-solving styles.  Read this book and learn how to take 100% responsibility for your life.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abby Season 3 was so great and I really enjoyed being able to stream it for free on Amazon Prime Instant video.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I bought this before downloading the free version... mistake.<br /><br />The help menu takes you to ads for other apps by the same company. I was mostly interested in the sleep timer since I like to fall asleep to music. No playlists, just a list of the music on your device...no folders or organization of any sort. The clocks are beautiful and professionally designed? No. They are routine and even ugly.<br /><br />Save your dollar. Truly awful. The folks that love this must have very low expectations.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|I'm accustomed to traditional waterproof earbuds or underwater speakers but neither provide a decent solution to listening to audiobooks while swimming laps.  Waterproof buds seem to always leave me with water in my ear.  I decided to give these transducers a chance.<br /><br />Pros':<br /><br />* They attach quickly and easily to my speedo swim goggles.. and they dont make me feel like i'm carrying a helmet cam.<br />* They work extremely well when I wear ear plugs, and the isolation of water noise makes listening to books perfect.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Which the controls are big enough to use without looking at them, better tactile feel would be an improvement.<br />* The work well with freestyle/crawl, but strokes like back stroke, breast stroke, and fly can cause lack of audio trasnmission.<br /><br />Over all, they are a great find and I'd recommend them to anyone who swims to keep in shape.

B00EL8I8IS|3.0|This tale serves up a few interesting twists, and some pretty cool special effects, but as zombie films go, it's not all that memorable. One thing that was missing, which is in a way good, but also in a way- not so good, is that there literally isn't much  blood and gore or maybe even none at all. I suppose people expect some blood and gore when it comes to zombie movies, and that is usually a major factor that hardcore zombie fans expect, but it's nice that the film manages to be pretty slick and entertaining without much of it. The special effects are really rather great at times, especially how the zombies are presented as being extremely vicious and rabid.<br /><br />They climb upon one another by the hundreds trying to scale the tall walls of fortified cities. At a distance they look like armies of ants piled one upon another. This is the niftiest thing about this movie. These zombies are very fast and very determined. It's also pretty refreshing that when they &#34;turn&#34; they don't really look all evil and rotted out like they do in some zombie movies, they just look like regular people who appear slightly less alive. Over time they begin to morph into something more sinister looking. The sounds they make with their vocal chords are pretty creepy, and they did manage to put a frieght into me. They are rather scary, though not all that unique from zombies of the past.<br /><br />If it had not been for the suprb AMC zombie epic &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; with it's extreme gore and powerful story telling being still very much on the minds of many zombie fans, this one might have seemed a little more endearing to some people. But as it seems to be suggested by the many less than  impressed reviews, zombie fans have the AMC series and much better movies to reference on their minds, such as Night of the livind Dead, Both Dawn Of The Dead and it's remake, 28 Days Later, and numerous other zombie movies.<br /><br />In my opinion Brad Pitt seems a bit miscast for this kind of role. It really is a rather obvious departure from most of the roles he's chosen. Then again I'm trying to imagine who could have been cast in this and would have fit the role better. Liam Neeson? Keifer Sutherland? Maybe Cruise or Hanks? Na, don't think so. Pitt moves along with this role perfectly fine, but he just seems not only a bit out of his normal territory, but it's also hard to imagine him with the sort of job title that get's him elected to take on the task of helping end the pandemic in the first place.<br /><br />Over all the story is interesting, and the action is often very good, but the movie just seems to be lacking a great deal that would make it memorable. Most of the characters in the movie and the actors that play them seem rather cookie cutter and the performances and characters are not particularly great. This film has more visual appeal that it does a great plot, story and character development. And much of the script is fairly bland. This is certainly entertaining, but as zombie movies go there's not a great deal to chew on here.his kind of role. It really is a rather obvious departure from most of the roles he's chosen.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Starts a little slow but builds into a good story.  Several twists and turns keeps interesting.  Found it difficult to put down. Nice weekend read m
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The information is written in user-friendly language.  It draws the reader in and allows him/her to clearly see how the 5 Love Languages manifest themselves in the flesh.  It also helps us know how to respond to one another so that our message of love can be effectively communicated.  I have even been able to read my husband and relate to him better.<br />Being a member of several ministries at our church places me in contact with others whom I previously had difficulty relating to and understanding.  Five Love Languages has helped me to see others in a different light, appreciate their differences and relate to them in a way that yields positive results.  Having it in Kindle format has been a real plus for me.  I can take it along (with the rest of my library) and read it while waiting at different appointments.  A great read for anyone!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have tried several weather apps and I found the weather channel to be far superior. Almost all my family uses this App.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Predictable but fun for an evening alone in the dark with stormy weather. Maybe even better with a glass of wine
B000F8O35U|5.0|Love it, the kids love it, the songs are great. Its just a great story. Everyone should ahve it in their library
B004ZH66XO|4.0|This game is really fun. It's challenging but not hard, with plenty of enticement to keep playing. I like that once you buy an extra help you get to keep it from scene to scene; no saving up coins to buy something you already bought. There's just enough strategy to make it interesting and enough luck to keep you on your toes. I got it as TFAOTD but I'd for sure spend a couple of bucks to have the game. The only issue is that the controls are a bit difficult to get used to and it took me a while to figure out which one would work best. The nice thing is that they give you 3 different options.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the show-- though the soap aspect of it gets a bit predictable and tiresome. However, Maggie Smith et al make it a pleasure to watch.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Gave me more insight than the movie. Almost too much talk among the characters. I enjoyed the Orson Wells movie so many years ago, this added other qualities, gives one more to think about.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is unquestionably the best adaptation of Emma that I've seen. I didn't care for the Gwyneth Paltrow version-- actually it would be more accurate to say I hated it (with the exception of the marvelous Sophie Thompson). And the BBC production from the 1990s was failed to capture Emma's wit. This adaptation, however, is pretty near perfect with an excellent cast.
B005PK553C|5.0|This was a fun ride.  Jessica Lange is outstanding.  Looking forward to the next season.  I may even go back and watch it again.

014241722X|4.0|John Grisham's first book in the Theodore Boone series introduces 13-year old Theodore Boone, who wants to be either a powerful lawyer or a judge.  He is the only child of two lawyers in the town of Strattenburg, and is not your typical 13-year-old.  Although he has one close friend, April, he seems to be quite alone, and hangs mostly with his parents after school or at the courthouse.  Theo knows most of the people who work at the courthouse, including judges, clerks, court reporters, etc., and they are his friends.  The premise of the book is that Theo helps his school friends solve legal problems and gives legal advice.  It is sad that Theo isn't really interested in paint balling, skateboarding, movies, video games or other regular activities that most 13 year-olds are interested in, and from an adult's point of view, he is kind of a misfit and a loner.<br /><br />In this story, there is a murder trial, which is a rarity in Strattenburg, and there is a lot of publicity and interest.  A woman was found dead in her affluent home, and her husband, Pete Duffy, the most obvious suspect insists he was on the golf course at the time of the murder.  Duffy has hired the best lawyer in the area, and during the trial seems to be winning; in fact, it looks like he will get off.  Theo arranges for his government class to attend the first day of the trial, and after school, he attends every day.  Theo has a feeling that Duffy is guilty, but nobody seems to have any evidence or proof.  The County Attorney has only circumstantial evidence, and the jury doesn't seem to be buying it.<br /><br />Theo helps tutor some of the homeless kids at a shelter one day a week (along with his parents who do volunteer legal work there) and one of those kids confides in him that his cousin was a witness to Pete Duffy's leaving the golf course and entering his home just at the time of the murder.  The problem is that his cousin is an illegal alien and can't testify because he will be deported.  Theo is sworn to secrecy, so he can't tell anyone or discuss it with the adults that could possibly help.  He is distraught because he thinks that Duffy is going to literally get away with murder.<br /><br />While much of the so-called \\"young adult\\" fiction, especially the blockbuster series like Harry Potter and Twilight, is just as much for adults as kids, this series is really strictly for kids around the ages of 8 through 12.  While there is drama, a little danger, and ongoing suspense, it is very mild.  Much of the book is an explanation of court and legal procedures, which is told on a kid's level.  Grisham is a master storyteller, so the story is well-done, and junior high school age kids will probably like the story.  Getting young kids to read can be difficult, and this kind of story may be just the solution.  This series is recommended for kids interested in something other than mysteries like Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew, and who knows, it may inspire a legal career or two.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.Theo is sworn to secrecy, so he can't tell anyone or discuss it with the adults that could possibly help.

B0006J28BO|5.0|This is for my daughter for her birthday, she is a big fan of the Studio Ghibili films so I know that she will like this.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This is one of those movies that you must want to have fun with, it's not a movie to provoke thought. It's ridiculous, yet intense, much like a nightmare. I watched and thought, man this would be awful even though it's impossible. That's the whole point, but the good news is that it's entertaining. You worry about the characters, you don't want them to get infected. You're rooting for them to survive. It's exactly what I would want from a zombie movie, sadly it's PG-13 so it's limited on what it can show. That's good and bad, most zombie movies over do it with gore which I hate. I liked the subtle violence. It's a lot of exploding and running, impossible getaways, and silly plot. That's what you watch a zombie movie for, if you went to a zombie movie expecting some psychological thriller, then you need to be slapped awake. This is for fun, not for thought! Intense headshot action! Enjoy it for what it was meant to do.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Accuweather is okay but I would prefer it if the radar screen would be the first thing to come up
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed this book and the story line. I have to say the ending was a little bit of a let down but I do recommend it
B00A17AD36|2.0|The vocals and music itself is great on this album, but the content of the lyrics strongly bothers me. Coming from a man with a girlfriend and that does not do drugs, I find this album too repetitive with the drug-filled dark lyrics. It is good music, but the lyrics do not really click for me.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|Really boring movie, lots of stars but story line is really weak, actors dont play well, i would skip this movie
B005LAIH4A|1.0|Just opened this movie that was a gift wrapped in plastic sold as new and the case is EMPTY! Paid new price. Disappointed mom and child!! Purchased from Amazon LLC BEWARE!!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It was enjoyable. The pace of the movie kept me watching without getting bored. I would recommend it for movie night.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|wonderful series, best thing on tv, can't wait for season 4, scenery and acting best on tv. can't say enough about it. i'm late to the game just started watching it so had to play catch up, now i'm hooked.

0451196716|4.0|Great page turner. The words draw you in so closely that you don't realize how near the end could be.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read it in a few days, I could not put it down. It had me gushing over the complexity of a wounded man and the naivete of Anastasia is spot on. Can't wait to read the rest of them.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for season 4 of this series. The characters are really very interesting and the plots are very unexpected.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am so addicted to this game that I can't wait til u guys come up with more levels, hurry hurry!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Didn't really have any robust story and the end didn't relate to the pace of the earlier part of the book.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this show, it's like a history lesson with a sexy twist! I would recommend it to a friend.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|works great. does just what an alarm clock should. has a lot of variety and options. I use it every day.

B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Two Shows in the history of Television are worth owning at any cost - \\"The Wire\\" and \\"Breaking Bad\\" - do I wish it was cheaper? You bet! Could I do without the money barrell? Why not?!? Have watched the entire series (except the final two - we are talking September 19th here....) twice through and have found myself siding with different characters and responding differently each time to the course of events (sadness? anger! laughter!) - Cannot wait to watch the end. Then again, watching the end means IT'S OVER! I just have to say to those that have never watched the show - you are in for one of the more entertaining plot lines in television or film history.
B000EULJLU|5.0|this is an awesome album created by an awesome band<br /><br />buy it buy it, the album art is amazing and so are the songs
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Realistically the device is only a command relay to send command from your remote device to the web and then to displays what comes back from the web it on the Tv screen. That is why it works well for items that it gets directly from the web like a Youtube video. I also wanted it to share the webpage that other family members were looking at when using Amazon or bidding sites for shopping. We all wanted to see the descriptions at the same time. It is not a screen \\"mirroring\\" device. You will eventually see what the laptop user sees, but when they scroll, it takes several seconds for the tv screen to catch up. Still useful, and I changed the Tv resolution from HD to VGA+ to make it faster, and that helped some.<br />In summary it has its uses, but think of it as mostly fancy remote control that will make your Tv, semi smart with web apps that you may not have had before. At the price a wonderful toy for the techno geek.<br />9/20 observation. I saw a great Youtube compilation on the PC and wanted to show it to all on the large screen using my tablet to cast onto the tv. Well you cant always do that, when I finally found the video on the tablet (looks like the tablet version screens the results) I could not play it. A message came up saying something like \\"owner choose not to make this video available on a mobile device, would you like to mark it for playng it later on your PC\\"
B000PC0S5K|5.0|As a very busy professional business owner in the &#34;people&#34; industry for the past 20 years, I have found myself feeling jaded and overwhelmed by the overall lack of moral values in our current world. Specifically, how people treat each other and this planet on a day to day basis. Although this book was difficult to begin, with the concepts being somewhat obscure to me, now that I am about 40% into it I have found the ideas in this book have changed my overall perception of how and why the people I deal with daily behave as they do. Rather than having negative reactions to others behaviors, I am now learning to better understand how the very strong &#34;ego&#34; within myself reacts to my environment and how I was unconsciously contributing to my disappointing perception of others. I now feel more connected to others and am learning ways of understanding how and why we behave and react to each other as we do. I am hoping with great passion that this book spreads like wildfire amongst avid readers and slowly we can start to evolve from ego based interactions that cause fear, aggression and violence amongst each other and into a more understanding, more intelligent way of being. We deserve it, the animals we shepherd deserve it, and the planet which gave birth to us certainly deserves it. Thank you Eckhart Tolle for such a great work that will impact me for the rest of my life.

B003VTZSFY|4.0|The examples are well selected and the story is well developed. Specially interesting it' the use of literary examples to show some issues. The punctuation is too subjective. The author give too much importance to global heating. The most interesting part is the conclusion: if the Singularity occurs, West and East will lost any importance.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My husband and I make a date night and watch each evening.  We now quickly take our showers, set up the DVD and enjoy.  We are on our second time through all three of the series.  We can't wait until January to get our pre-order of series 4.
B004J4WKDI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, right from start to finish. The characters are very well developed. It's a great read!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Great time killer. Somewhat repetitive after a while but good fun. At higher levels it pays into the pay as you go program. Where if you want to make any real progress you have to pay real money.  Would have been much better with a simpler level scheme, but still solid graphics, physics, and game play. Loved levelling up my chars.  Wish it could have had bonuses for playtime and not rely on monetary exposures as it really slows down progress.
B00CZ1HELA|3.0|It's ok, prefer the other flow-like games, not sure why. But it passes the time when waiting for some appointment.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I tuned in because I like court room based dramas.  I'd stayed away from the series before simply because I didn't like the premise of 'cheating husband/stand-by-him wife'.  Boy had I missed out!  This was so much more than that.  The story lines are intriguing and the unexpected reappearance of guest stars keeps it fresh and connected. The lead character Alisha is so much more nuanced than the series title suggests.  Sexual tension abounds, and the after the first season, I find myself still wanting to know so much more about all the characters (particularly Kalinda).  This is a fantastic series and has me looking forward to my weekend to catch up on later seasons.
B005DOKIYG|4.0|We were looking for a good 'kid proof' cover for our donated Kindle Keyboard to the grand kids. This was a perfect choice. We would recommend it for any Kindle Keyboard.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love the challenge that each room gave and the fact that there were no hints throughout the room. You really had to figure out where everything fits.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I think this has a lot of humour with out the witty jokes that I dislike. Found it hard to put down, going to read it again very shortly, to pick up the bits I missed first time round.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Yahoo has been very dependable for getting all my e-mail and downloading maps.  Yahoo also gives me enough space to keep all my messages and pictures.  Thank you again to Yahoo.
B0081336FO|5.0|It blew my mind! I thoroughly enjoyed this modernization of a classic character and am anxiously awaiting the next season.
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|I love this album as much as all the others.  Just like The Fragile, give it time for your ear to adjust and appreciate all the subtleties and artistic merit of the work.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I like this Photo app,Does a good job of Editing photos on my Kindle fire 7 HD,Very simple to use and does improve photos with its tools.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I felt like I got to see a different side to the characters this season. This season was very dramatic, but a good characterization of that era and time period. Cheers!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just happened across this series as I was surfing for something new to read and boy did I get lucky.  It's thought provoking as you can see how this could happen.  I'm into the next saga now and hope for more.
B000F4RHB6|4.0|HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS-GREATEST HITS: The streamlined answer to Boston's J. GEILS BAND, San Francisco based HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS deftly combined pop, doo-wop, rock and RNB, forging a good natured, sassy sound that appealed to yuppies and blue collar stiffs alike. Their hard charging party anthems I WANT A NEW DRUG, HEART & SOUL and WORKIN' FOR A LIVIN' and half speed love songs DOING IT ALL FOR MY BABY and DO YOU BELIEVE IN LOVE, featured LEWIS' raspy pipes and the band's barroom grooves and tight backing harmonies. Aside from HALL & OATES, few eighties acts played the white boy soul card more effectively; these cats even sounded cool covering J.J. JACKSON's underrated oldie BUT IT'S ALRIGHT. GREATEST HITS also offers up LEWIS' warm remake of SMOKEY ROBINSON's quiet storm classic CRUISIN' (a duet with actress GWYNETH PALTROW), a live take on TROUBLE IN PARADISE and one of their final hits SMALL WORLD featuring jazz legend STAN GETZ. This makes it a marked improvement over the 1996 collection TIME FLIES, which favored pedestrian &#34;new material&#34; over punchy missing singles like HIP TO BE SQUARE and BACK IN TIME.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR LEWIS BOOGIES
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I read about this software and it had good reviews. However, I don't really enjoy texting so much, so I didn't buy it.  Then, I saw it for free and I just had to try it.  The word suggestions are very good. It also has the ability to be used like the Swype keyboard. I like it
B000002GVZ|4.0|CARLY SIMON-THE BEST OF CARLY SIMON: Covering the first half of the seventies, a prolific era for reflective singer-songwriters like JACKSON BROWNE and JONI MITCHELL, THE BEST OF CARLY SIMON tracks ten of her most memorable folk-pop hits. The RNB-tinged NIGHT OWL and ATTITUDE DANCING, almost never included on other anthologies, are two rollicking lost gems that provide needed contrast to her introspective mellow classics THAT'S THE WAY I'VE ALWAYS HEARD IT SHOULD BE and HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR THE PAIN. The real centerpiece here is her swaggering chart topper YOU'RE SO VAIN...its ominous opening bass line, SIMON's sly, provocative growl, testifying background yelps from MICK JAGGER and CAROLE KING, and RICHARD PERRY's crisp production make it the most scathing put down single of the decade. A funky duet of golden oldie MOCKINGBIRD with then husband JAMES TAYLOR and ketchup jingle ANTICIPATION provide further highlights, wrapping up this brief but effective collection in solid form. SIMON would continue to score occasional hits, often from outside sources, well into the next decade...but BEST OF smartly captures the intimate essence of her early legacy.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR TEETH
B0034DGPEU|5.0|One of those books that sucks you in with just the first few pages. A truly good read! A must read
B0014DQSGW|4.0|Great romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have an amazing chemistry together with funny banter and wit that has you laughing through most of the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Set up is nearly automatic, picture is superb and cross platform usability (I Pads and Phones AND Windows PCs) is great.<br /><br />Only negative is lack of Amazon player app for me.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was fantastic - I could not put it down.  Confused in the beginning it was so neat to see how all of the characters were connected.  I would highly recommend...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lot of fun. It reminds me of the time we had to construct single sided printed circuit boards by hand.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The game's great! PvP is fun, graphics are good, and its great for curing boredom. Coins take a bit to save up, but really that's every mobile game out there.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Not bad, not bad at all - certainly not as bad as the detractors make out. This is a large-scale zombie film with some great FX and a decent storyline. The few criticisms I have of this film relate to the color and sound - the colors are consistently washed out, all greens and browns. It is not what one would call a vibrant looking film but filled with muddy colors. Even the sunlight looks rather dusty and brown. The sound is also of the mumbling quality. Another drawback is that the first half of the film is focused entirely on the children. Now listen, I have nothing against children but this is a zombie film, and virtually every scene has Pitt running around with his kids in his arms. These little whiners were starting to get on my nerves. We all know Pitt is a great father but for God's sake, does he have to play one even in a zombie film?
B007I0OY02|3.0|I find Tina Fey to be a very \\"likable\\" personality, and root for her success. That said, while I did find this book to be engaging, amusing and it endeared me to her even more, I didn't actually laugh, out loud or otherwise much while reading it. I would recommend this book to friends who like her but, I wouldn't oversell the humor of it when I do.
0307271080|4.0|Americanah is a sensitive portrayal of racism in America.  As a recent immigrant from Nigeria, Ifemelu confronts difficulty breaking into American culture and the job market.  She finds romance with a wealthy white man but has left her true love back in Nigeria.  This is a story of displacement, at home and abroad.  Ifemelu's voice is spunky and entertaining, and she presents us with a view of America that is rarely seen.  Recommended.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I usually am quite skeptical about the second movie in any given series -- they always seem to lack the electricity of the first movie.  I'm happy to say, however, that this second outing for the &#34;new&#34; Star Trek cast is as exciting and fun as the first one!  The characters stay true to the personalities that we first encountered, and the dialog and plot are just as engaging as you would expect!
B001S2PT3M|5.0|Saw season one and was hooked.. ordered season 2 before even finished with season one  will be ordering all the seasons
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|The movie starts quickly by introducing you to the various characters and their backgrounds, and then jumps into the action.  It keeps you guessing the whole way through, and the ending was a surprise.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I love this trilogy  have not started reading this one yet but am sure it will be just as good as the other two
0345529057|5.0|The game of thrones books are excellent. Aside from that, this box set contains books that are perfectly sized for carrying around with you on lunch breaks, traveling, or wherever you like to read. The box set makes keeping them safe and together simple.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I never watched these before because I don't worship TV as others do, but when my son told me how great these are I watched one and have been hooked ever since. The British, as usual. come up with all the truly original plots and storylines missing from our TV shows which are nothing but forever rehashed shows which lower the IQ which is why I don't watch it. Clever one liners with just the right amount of drama by great actors who are normal looking people compared to American TV personalities. Never a dull moment and surprises at every turn. We have watched all but season two and not once has a show theme repeated itself or been predictable.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The show is very graphic and violent at times; however, it emphasizes the potential for police corruption when leadership is missing or is incapable of proper management.  Lessons are learned the hard way; and, power plays lead to more violence.  However, this television Chicago suburb is not the typical population or police force.  I can't stop watching it - I am addicted to it.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Best season yet and i can watch whenever I want!!!! no complaints here. Watching on amazon is better than watching on Hulu
B00DU74U74|3.0|I went in to watching this move with a bad attitude, another chick flick. It was honestly not that bad. Could use a little more action but for a chick flick, ive been to worse.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I received the mouse today and it works wonderfully.  The setup and configuration is intuitive and the functions work quite well.  Overall the mouse is solidly built.  The buttons feel durable and not at all cheap.  The weights go in quite easily and stay in.  Some of the features I love so far.  The 1 button press to change between 4 different mouse setting profiles, pure genius.  I can set each one of the profiles for how I like (pointer speed, sample rate, etc.) and quickly switch between each one.  The Macro record and playback button is great too.  Another fun feature is the programmable led lights, that you can change to what ever color you want.  I know its purely cosmetic, but its pretty neat.  Overall I am very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend.
B00DJYKFXG|2.0|Great recording and picture book.  I bought it because it came with a DVD.  There is a DVD but it's filled with still pictures.  It only includes two songs that were recorded live.  Just Robbie ripping us off again.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|its cool beacause its a HUGE game and best of all ITS FREE so you should try it and you will love it
B0083SBMBM|4.0|not my favorite movie but it was good, saw it in the theaters first & my daughter & nephews wanted me to buy it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I upgraded my internet speed to the highest available from Time Warner today. The modem they supply has built in WIFI, which needs to be activated by TWC by speaking with their techs. The catch is that TWC has access to my home wifi; as soon as I turn on the Chromecast I lose the internet. And you thought NSA knows everything.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Reminds me of \\"The Raid\\" but the story in this moves along better. I hope they make another one. I'm really upset I didn't get to see this in 3D, but still a great watch.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Wide ranging epic of the early 20th century, combining real history, political and social, seen through the eyes of fictional characters who become quite real as the novel progresses. A compelling and clearly articulated treatise on the causes of the First World War that should make us all wonder why we are still so intent upon killing each other to solve our differences.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Get the idea I liked this series. I think the whole production was well done. Writing, directing, acting, all of it...just loved it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I bought this one on the recommendation of a colleague and could not stop reading until the last page. This book brings out every emotion in the reader and stays with you LONG after you have read the last word. I have not read a book that deals with the subject matter of being quadriplegic in quite the same way. The reader is immediately drawn into the life of Louisa and cannot help but take the journey with her as she somewhat reluctantly becomes Will's  companion. As my subject line states it is one of my top three reads this year and I highly recommend!
B00D37UP4S|5.0|Everbody in the family viewed the trailer and thought to weird. But bought it anyway and they all loved it, but it is weird.
B000002GLT|5.0|...I particularly appreciate Larry Taylor's bass ... great evidence that the rhythm section does not need drums to drive a song.<br /><br />Mayall is just himself ... always interesting ... &#34;Nature's Disappearing&#34; is blunt, unapologetic, ahead of it's time, and still all too relevant.  Thanks, John.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is great. It has a Quest mode which I love. I have a similar game on my computer called Avalon Legends Solitaire that has a quest mode and I love this game. It makes a game you already like better because you have goals to reach added to a game you already enjoy. It seems to give me more reason to play again and again because I am not just playing a new game each time (well you are) but with the quest mode you are continuing your journey and hopefully will reach the end result. The ads on the start page don't bother me at all. I just hit play the game and ignore them. This app works great on my Kindle Fire 8.9 and the graphics are great. Luv this game.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Excellent 2nd book in the series. Love Jace and Clary and cannot wait to read the next one. Wonderful, Exciting, and Romantic!
B004JQN364|5.0|These figures are the center piece for my dragon army. The figures are beautifully made and great to look at.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I've used sleep sound machines.  I've used binaural brain-hemisphere balancing recordings (such as CenterPoint, HemiSync, etc.)  They can all get quite pricey, and they don't give you the range of combinations or the great flexibility that Relax Melodies offers.  Someone had a huge brainstorm to create something so beneficial and simple to use. Haven't tried the upgraded version, would be nice if it has various levels of meditation in addition to the one deep meditation offered in the free version.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It took 5000 pages but she rode the dragon.  It is worth it just for that alone but there is a lot here.  Another well written book by this author.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Amazing show. Such intense characters and situations. The 3 lead characters are awesome and really drive the show. Totally addicted!
0307165485|5.0|&#34;It really IS the BEST storybook ever!&#34; She said and recommended it for all baby shower gifts. Mom's will always thank you and go on recommending it to others!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy the challenging runs. and not the same run every time I have to start over. Great graphics and sound quality. I love it.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|why would you leave the comfort of shelter to get eaten by so many wolves, out in the open they are vulnerable to the elements, and wild animals and again, the wolves.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I'm constantly amazed, considering that Child is English, that he has such a deep understanding of Americans and America. I think that the &#34;Reacher&#34; character embodies the best part of the American character and a sense of &#34;doing the right thing&#34;.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|well this movie is a favorite, good fighting scenes and logic is good behind what it was focused on, all the way it was exciting and powerfull, good work mr, cruise
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the last book of the trilogy, and when I finished the second book, I had to immediately buy this one and start reading it. I couldn't put it down. This one is a little different than the first two, but it's still good. I was sad when I finished it and didn't have another one to read.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I thought it was an ordinary movie of police state but was surprised that it created zumbies and terrible ones at that, would pass on the word that's its a must see movie, too expensive and we should get a discount for rent more then 4 or 5 movies etc. miguel
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first book, The Hunger Games. My daughter told me to read it because she thought I would really like it. She was right, I love this trilogy. Suzanne Collins has a great imagination for this story line. When I finished this book I immediately bought the next one and started reading it, that's how enthralled I was with them. I hope her other books are just as good.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app ia just simply awsome, makes my phone run smoother and it cleared al my cache memory and it optimized my phone performance.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This a great book, and I loved reading it. I couldn't put it down. If you are looking for a great page turner that you can't put down, and like action, drama, plot twists, and suspense, this book is for you.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Great tips and advice for publishing with Amazon.  Almost a necessity if you want to succeed with a kindle book.  If I had to add anything, it would be, &#34;the cover matters&#34; even if it's an e-book.  A lot of us want to see what our characters look like or fall into the fantasy/reality the cover is offering.
B00005JM1F|4.0|One of my favorite all time movies. Between the Red Dragon and mooning Snoop Dog, i was laughing hysterically :)
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Great read. I really enjoyed this story. The way it all came together was great. I  will be looking forward to reading more by Todd M. Thirds.
B007MJSSCY|5.0|I always love movies about time travel and really enjoyed this one especially as it was from Julian Fellowes who also does Downton Abbey.  Another movie of the same ilk is \\"The Love Letter\\" - a story of communication across centuries. \\"From Time to Time\\" is the perfect family movie which all can enjoy.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Got it in the mail in great condition and time. Love it, now all that I have left to do is get season 8 =]
B001EN71DG|5.0|If you're a Star Wars fan, how could you not.  We now have the complete set and I plan on sitting down one weekend and watching them all in order (prequels first).  Should be fun, can't wait!!!!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game was a bit difficult at first but easy to figure out after a few levels. I would like to see the floors get more challenging the further you go. All said, it is not bad.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Good lyrics. Good music. A step ahead for John and in line with his last album which was also very fine work.
B00314UP16|5.0|I never clicked with the Herbal Tarot I had based on RW, but the images in this one depict actions and emotions that are easier to pick up on personally.
B000PHX8C0|5.0|Devildriver delivers on this album like every other album. If you're a metal fan or a fan of Devildriver than you simply cant go wrong with purchasing this album.
1623650003|5.0|For once, the blurbs are 95%  right. Although  the beginning was a bit exhausting  and gross, I persevered. and I'm glad  I did. Talk about zigzags  and twists in the plot ! Although the plot  is paramount,  the characters  are well-<br />drawn,  and certainly idiosyncratic.  The Disagreeable  Dwarf, the Conniving Cheapskate,  or  (my favorite) the  Elegant Educator  are superb creations. I wonder if the rest of the trilogy is as good. I have yet to run across the fabled<br />book \\"I couldn't  put down\\".  but  this comes close.  (The only other one that comes very close  is  \\"And Then There Were None.\\").  Enjoy !
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Season 3 has quite an edge to it.  Captain Archer has to make some tough decisions.  It was a nice change of pace for the series.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Both my husband and I enjoy this show very much.  Our older son and his wife are hooked as well.  They binge watched it in one weekend.  Love how each week we are introduced to one character's back ground.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Incredibly easy to set up and use.<br /><br />Awesome for killing time on YouTube or Netflix. Can't wait until more apps start coming out.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I think some of his facts are shaky, but he gives a good sense of the political context in which Jesus, James and Paul preached and died.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I haven't had this much fun reading a book since Ender's Game.  This is now one of my top two favorite books.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These are great, have given for several shower gifts and everyone loves them! I also have a set I use all the time.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|I got the blu-ray disk which features both theatrical and extended versions and I have seen both.. Definitely get the extended version. The added footage does so much to explain and smooth out the story and the relationship (or lack thereof) between Leon and the girl.  The added footage made the story flow more easily. I will never watch the \\"choppy\\" theatrical version again..
B001BKV9TE|4.0|If you like movies that go way back this one is pretty good. There is a decent story line and they don't rely to heavily on effects.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I keep reading the reviews & waiting to buy this book. Finally I broke down & purchased it. I have to say I really wanted to like it, was excited to get it. What a let down. I read up to chapter 5 & was not able to follow the people in the book at all. Was really disappointing in this book. I ask for a refund for it today from Amazon, which is a first for me.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had to see what the fuss was about after they announced they had plans for a movie and wow. I couldn't put it down. I  wonder how they will articulate the book to make it appropriate.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|My neighbors loved the DVD set and since they do not have cable or satellite tv, they really appreciated the anniversary gift.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed the book & movie shows you what can happen when you let the government do as they want
B007AL48UK|3.0|I like Mahjong games, but this one is a little too easy. I let my 4 year old niece play this one she seems to enjoy it.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I loved the storyline of this book. I loved how he developed the characters. I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and this book was another great one in his collection.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|I really enjoyed the mix of classic Santana songs with the newer songs that highlight Carlos guitar playing in them.<br />This was my first Santana CD and was the best of classic and modern Santana I could find.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|What can I say, but this book is another example of what a great author Nicholas Sparks is. I love the characters, the storyline, and the climax. I am a huge fan.
B000I8HIR2|5.0|Awesome movie def different from the other scary movies. Most scary movies don't make me jump but this def did.
159463176X|5.0|Author's Story Style - was able to create my own next chapters at the end of the story = thank you
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|you can stream netflix, you tube videos, and project anything in your chrome browser to your TV. My wii will too. I can connect my laptop to my TV do the same thing. So until Google gets off their high horse and allows fling and allcast and other apps and devices to work with their device its no better then any of the rest.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Ok so I think this is dumb but my 4yr old boy and 9 yr old girl love it.  They don't spend alot of time on it but oh man do they love it.  My boy laughs for 10 min. str8.  Yeah great for the kids.
B00EVLU2F2|5.0|To Quote a very good friend  &#34;Goldfrapp is what love would sound like&#34;. and I think that says it all.
B004GFN11A|1.0|its a nice app i would rather type my posts on the computer. It is nicely designed though. Just not for me.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|Love this movie. We were camping this Summer and talked about it quiet extensively. Came home and ordered it. There are a lot of life lessons in it
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|This is a stupid game, my kids don't even like it. The graphics are cheesy and the game itself is slow.
B008A36R2Y|5.0|I'm just a person interested technology, electronics and art. The Arduino extends my learning, and especially my fun, in learning. Put one of these in the hands of a kid and there is no telling what he or she will learn, or what they will build.<br /><br />I know the intent of these reviews is pretty much ruined by trolls and by unethical people who have a business stake for or against the product. I don't have such stake.<br /><br />I regret I didn't know about the Arduino sooner. Look it up online, then just buy it. Get a few cheap electronic parts and have fun. If its for a kid, you will love it, too, seeing where this little wonder will take them. You both will smile.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I'm fairly easy to please when it comes to action movies.  If there are enough explosions and gun fights to keep me distracted, I can usually overlook bad or non-exsistent plots.  This movie kept me distracted. :-)  I was kind of shocked that a major character from the first movie is killed off so early in this one and actually stayed dead.  I kind of thought that pushing this back in the theaters to make it 3D was an excuse to change what happened to the character since the actor that portrays them was riding a huge wave of success at the time.  I still enjoyed it and will probably watch it again at some point.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Great Blue Ray.  I love Adele.  I would definitely recommend this for other admirers of Adele.  Happy with my purchase.
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|I enjoyed the book this is based on by Stephanie Meyers, who is better known for her Twilight books.  I knew there was no way they could put everything into the movie that was in the book and the book could have been a bit shorter anyway.  They did a pretty good job of getting the main plot points from the book into the movie but some things felt rushed, most likely due to time constraints.  I like Saoirse Ronan, I think she's going to be around for a long time and did a good job here.  And it was good to see Jake Abel in this.  I haven't seen much of his work, just the few episodes he was on Supernatural but he's a good actor as well.  All in all, it was pretty good but could have been better, which is what I think of most movies based on books that I have read before seeing the movies.
6305781427|5.0|Yanni live at the Acropollis.  If you have never watched it, you should.  It is amazing.  Only wish I could have found it in blue ray.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun to play challenging to get to the next level. Great way to pass the time. Galatia I bought it
B000HF0IIC|5.0|Enjoyable movie that doesn't get the credit it deserves. It wasn't meant to be a super serious film like the newer dark knight movies. It was made for pure fun entertainment.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought these for a baby shower monkey theme gift basket I made and it looked so cute! thanks so much
B00C2IGQBA|3.0|Movie gets 5 stars from me but my steelbook arrived broken. Won't shut properly and there weren't any booklets or anything special inside, just the disc. Thought for a &#34;steelbook&#34; it would have a little extra.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|I really got hooked on this show. Not really scary but dramatic and great acting by Jessica Lange. Not as good as Breaking Bad but good enough to watch for sure!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Reza Aslan, in Zealot, gives his readers a great deal to think about and consider.  The author is an excellent writer and well educated in world religions and history, including Christianity, and this book is well documented.  I appreciate most his focus on the history of the Roman Empire and the way it was run, politically and militarily, which helped me understand more than I knew about why some of the historical events during Christ's lifetime happened the way they did.  While I applaud Aslan's presentation of actual historical facts about the historical Jesus, I cannot agree with some of his conclusions.  As a Christian myself, I believe that Jesus was much more than just an illiterate peasant the Romans crucified for sedition, which Aslan puts forth in his book.  Unlike some readers who are angry about this book, I am grateful for the challenge it presents, which actually strengthens my faith. I think he has sent many Christians, both lukewarm and devout, diving back into their Bibles for study and clarification.  And perhaps, some for the very first time.  I wonder how he feels about that result?
B005HEVIJQ|5.0|Like all past Star Trek series there are lots of life lessons wrapped in a TV show that is more than just a show about space
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'm not really sure how I expected this to end, it probably would have been better if I spaced out my reading of all 3 books a bit.
B00EDK1LP6|5.0|I was a huge fan of the movie and it's very distinctive melodies, so being able to buy the digital soundtrack was a blessing for me. The songs are clear and good quality, and now I can feel ready to take down any tests that threaten my GPA like Gipsy Danger took down Otachi during the double event. Excellent for the car, even if after I get out I feel disappointed with my life for the fact that I'm not driving a giant robot.
B004JMZWMG|5.0|what a great blend of the magic that is E.L.P, try it I love it and I think you might too
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Love the movie, bought it for a Christmas gift last year and my family really enjoys the movie.  Great movie to watch over and over.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|Great game to kill a few hours, different types of game play keep it challenging and fun. Definitely worth the $.99.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game I  amazing. I play it everyday and I just want to tell everyone that you should get this game
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|This was a rather odd book.  I don't know if I would call it fantasy or science fiction.  The opinion of others would be interesting.
1455523550|5.0|Wow, wow, and wow!  Did I mention wow???  Best Nicholas Sparks book that I have read!  I couldn't put it down.  Loved the characters and story line.  I can't wait to see it in movie.  I ordered it through Netflix and it should be coming today!  Very clever ending.  Nicholas Sparks, keep the great books coming!  Read the book-you will love it!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!  *I had to come back with an edit after watching the movie last night.  The movie was soooo disappointing.  They changed Kristen's name and what happened to Alex's gray hair!  Also, the story line was way different.  I'm surprised that it passed Nicholas Sparks approval!  Nothing like the book-so many details were left out:(*
B00005A8MA|5.0|I listen to this all the time...I love it! Takes me back to the early 70's when I bought it...of course back then...it was on vinyl.<br />I recommend this to anyone who digs the blues. Clapton is just amazing on this. Course I'm a Clapton fan anyhow.<br />But seriously, this is a very very nice album... puts me in a good mood, everytime I listen to it..<br />Thank you and also Want to tell you that it also came 2 days earlier than I expected! Beautiful!
B00296A4F4|4.0|I am not a fan of Glee, but there were a few episodes that I have seen that I really liked.<br />After seeing those and sharing that I enjoyed them with my son, he decided it was time<br />watch the whole show starting from the beginning. He enjoyed it so much that he has<br />completed the complete series and has now started to watch them all over again from<br />the beginning!<br /><br />He assures me that I should watch the show from the beginning and I have agreed that<br />Glee would be my next show to tackle! I'm very excited.
B000002I6X|5.0|It arrived at my home very quickly. Good album.. Stephen Stills rocks. I have a few of his albums ..yeah..albums..vinyl..so its really nice to have this on a c.d. Every song is a sweet reminder of what music once was.<br /> thanks.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoyed the movie! I thought for the amount of time they had to cover a 500 page story, they did a good job! The casting was great! Sets were good and special effects were outstanding!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I use my three year old niece as an excuse to keep playing.....truth be told, I LOVE THIS GAME!! It's just an easy and entertaining way to relax, especially in the middle of the night when my two month old is just not going to sleep. The animals are cute, story line goes pretty good with the movie. I like being able to see other villages from others all over the world. Good times, just wish there was a faster way to EARN acorns, . I'm not going to buy them. I'm very excited to see the new underground world!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I really am enjoying this series. Almost done with the fourth book now. Can't wait for the new season of the show to start!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|The original British version is one of my top ten mini-series ever.  I shouldn't compare the two - this is completely different - but was a very entertaining watch.  Spacey is perfect for the role.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Khan is  back and better. The story line is amazing just as the movie is too. Captain Kirk is everything he was and is. A MUST SEE do not miss it
B00C5XBAOA|2.0|You need these to play with the talking castle but dont expect to hear all of them. I feel the \\"phrase unlocking\\" is a marketing scheme! We were expecting each family member (we also purchased the Royal Family Giftset and the Royalbed) to say a phrase in their voice and we never heard the father or the brother talking. The queen says a phrase every once in a blue moon, and no matter which character you place on the talking spot phrases are random by random characters. Sometimes you hear Clover, most of the time Sofia and once or twice the sister and the mother. We have never heard the brother or the father. Also dolls head fall apart easily and you will be asked over and over to put them back together.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This was an honest and entertaining recount of the Eagles getting together and all the ups and downs of being part of a band--from start-up to break-up to reconciling.  The original footage was great as well as the interviews and the music.
B005NK69ZC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and its one of the first to make me laugh out loud whilst turning the pages.  Her style of comical humor and random thought processes really tickle my funny bone.  Much like her talk show she brings all of that onto the pages of this novel, it doesn't seem to have any particular direction just a lot of random thoughts about life but I loved it all the same.  If you enjoy her show you'll enjoy this book as her personality really comes through during the read and you can't help but laugh as you follow her unique thoughts about life in general.<br /><br />If your an Ellen fan don't hesitate, it left me smiling and i hope it does the same for you.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|very interesting it is sort of like mystery manor I really enjoy this game. just started playing yesterday so I'm still discovering new things
B00EMJD6TC|2.0|If I had known that this was a zombie movie I would have never had rented it! Like my title says they are or represent the lost of this world that are walking around waiting and wanting someone to save them before it is to late for them.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Awesome cases with a resilient and thoughtful female main character along with a varied and realistic supporting cast--one of the best of its genre.
B00992CF6W|3.0|IT WON'T OPEN. I LOVED THIS GAME SO MUCH BUT IT WILL NOT OPEN ANYMORE AND I'M SO MAD. I DON'T UNDERSTAND, IT WILL GO TO THE PLAY PLAY ON REALMS SCREEN AND IF YOU HIT EITHER OPTION IT JUST CLOSES THE APP. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|This game is Awesome, but there are many porn adds in the app. This is supposed to be a kid friendly game! I also think that this app is really buggy. It can freeze your kindle every once in a while.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|A page turner. What more is there to say? There aren't to many novels being written that can make it hard to lay them down.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game is the sequel to the regular angry birds star wars game.  It is fun and easy to play.  Be warned that your kids can purchase in-app things like coins which have no real value.  At the moment there aren't many stages, so keep checking back to see if the game has an update.
B0029ATTAQ|1.0|This was one of the most terrible movies of all time.  Even with the stars headlining it, it was TERRIBLE!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is AMAZING!!!!!!! It is easy and fun to play.  But be warned that your kids can purchase in app things like coins which have no real value. You can set a separate parental controls password so your kids can't buy stuff without your permission.  There are many stages you can play on, so the price is worth it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game was very fun to start out but later on became a hassle. The problem is that they only give your character so much energy and unless you purchase energy or walk away from the game for 2 days, it takes too long to gain energy for the character to even play the game. I wasn't impressed it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Rovio has already made AMAZING APPS, But this app is Awesome. It is nothing like the other angry birds apps. You build a ride/aircraft to get to the finish. There are many different stages in the app. One of my kids favourite modes is the sandbox mode. You can build anything you want to get as many star boxes as you can. Be forewarned that your kids can purchase in app things like power ups and an extra sandbox. Make sure to set a separate parental controls password so your kids can't buy stuff without your permission.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Check this out on Netflix. If you love it as much as I did, buy this, watch this and enjoy this over and over. It'll show Netflix we support them becoming a content creator!
B006N57PXG|5.0|Great read! Quick pace and unique magic system.  This book was short, fun, and had a character you can root for.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I've never seen the TV show, but I know what it is about so I thought I would get the book.  I'm glad I did.  I really like how the character was developed. Excellent tale.
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|I was never able to get it to work due to it needing so much space on my Kindle. Even after deleting 4 or 5 games, it still said I needed another 180 mb of data free. Definitely not worth it for only $1. Especially whereas I don't have much on my Kindle as it is.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Great series!  Awesome storyline.  Clever integration of ancient mythology and current events. Characters are unforgettable. Wish this show was never cancelled.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|Maroon Five?!? The name says it all... Do not really have to say more than that!  First album I have purchased and will not be the last!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book was very good and I was captivated by it.  However, when I finished I actually threw it across the room because I was so shocked by the ending.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved it.  The telling of the story from both sides of the great house is engaging and captivating.<br />Streaming video makes watching these wonderful!
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|I loved Pacific Rim, and it was minutes into the film that I knew I loved the score and needed to get the soundtrack.<br /><br />The whole album does not disappoint.  This kind of music is not for everyone, so make sure you've either seen the movie to know what you are getting (and you are getting the score from the movie, no extra songs nor quotes or any of that kind of thing) or at least sample it before you by.  No lyrics, no singing, just great sounds that help you remember a great film.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Spending  way to much time on this game. It's all kind  o  fun. Playing  on my kindle 7&quot; hd. No issues.
B00CKZX0AA|3.0|I don't know what it is about the track order or individual pieces, but as a whole this album was not as entertaining as I had expected it to be.  It took a second viewing of the movie to fall in love with the new Superman theme, and each time the music rose in the movie it helped to make the scenes more powerful, so I know I like the style overall.  But listening to the soundtrack I almost never get the same rush.  Most of the tracks are good, a couple are great, but most of it blends together into an almost forgettable mush.<br /><br />If you liked the music in the movie, you might enjoy this.  But you might also be disappointed like I am.  I still like it, but not as much as I wanted to.<br /><br />There's another version with a few more tracks - I wonder if that would have been a better purchase for me.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These are the best headphones I've ever had and they are great and you have to wear them for a really long time until they hurt your ears.<br /><br />The only problem is that people can hear the music if you play it really loud to be mindful of that
B00B9366VO|5.0|A must see for anyone who loves music.  My whole family sat down to watch this and enjoyed it immensely.
B00288KNJU|5.0|We watch this as a family and my kids love it and now act out parts of the show. You have to get it for you family
B006SF636Q|5.0|It's everything I wanted and more!  Shipment came on time.. I am very happy with this purchase and recommend it to others.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Not your typical storyline which was very refreshing. The author does an excellent job developing the characters who eventually all inter connect. Once I got into it I just let her take me for the ride into this story about life, fate and relationships. Loved it. I will read more of her work.
B00006DEF9|5.0|There is only one thing that needs to be said about \\"Singin in the rain\\": it is a beautiful masterpiece, produced to make people \\"happy again\\" - and which succeeds in doing it again and again, since more than 60 years now! Enough said. If you saw this film, you know enough about it - and if you didn't see it yet, shame on you! Do it immediately!<br /><br />In this 2-disc edition we have a good copy of the film itself with numerous subtitles available and that includes English for sound impaired. The bonuses on the second disc are really worth watching, especially \\"Musicals, great musicals\\". Enjoy!<br /><br />Not having much to say about this wonderful film most people know anyway, I would like to write a little more about the actors, who offered us this beautiful thing. Sadly, most of them departed since to join Lord's great troupe in heavens...<br /><br />The first to go was Millard Mitchell, who plays R.F Simpson, the tough but mostly benevolent boss of Monumental Pictures. Known also from films like \\"Twelve o'clock high\\" and \\"Winchester 73\\", lifelong heavy smoker Mitchell died from lung cancer one year after starring in this film, on 13 October 1953. He was 50 years old.<br /><br />Jean Hagen, a girl from Chicago, a very beautiful and talented actress who plays the crucially important and totally despicable character of Lina Lamont, was already well known from her great role in \\"The Asphalt Jungle\\". After \\"Singin in the rain\\" she played a lot and made again quite a splash in \\"The big knife\\" in 1955. She had to interrupt her career because of serious illness in 1964. As soon as she became ill her husband of 18 years dumped her and sued for divorce. She spend almost all the rest of her life in various hospitals and a convalescent home, before dying in 1977, at the age of 54, after losing a long battle against throat cancer. In this film she really doesn't has an easy role but she performed PERFECTLY - as consequence her character, Lina Lamont, is probably the most despicable, most ridiculous, dumbest, meanest bitch in all history of cinema! It took a REAL talent to play THAT!<br /><br />The legendary Gene Kelly, one of the greatest dancers and singers in whole history of cinema, who plays here the main masculine character of Don Lockwood, remained a great Hollywood star for many, many years, but mostly bowed out after the end of musicals era in 1960. As an old man he finally confessed a little secret to a journalist - when performing the legendary scene of singing the song \\"Singing in the rain\\" and splashing through water puddles, he was running a 39,7° fever! Gene Kelly died in 1996, aged 83.<br /><br />Douglas Fowley, who plays here the small but important (and extremely funny) role of hyperactive, overstressed and overworked director Roscoe Dexter, had a long and succesful career playing mostly second roles in Hollywood and then continued into an even more succesful career on TV. He died in 1998, just before his 87th birthday, leaving behind 3 children - and SEVEN former wives!<br /><br />Donald O'Connor, who plays Cosmo Brown, a singing, dancing, piano playing entertainer - who needed three days of medical rest after performing the legendary \\"Make them laugh\\" song and dance in this film - also had a long and succesful career. He died in 2003, aged 78, survided by Gloria, his wife of 47 years and four children.<br /><br />Cyd Charisse, a girl from Amarillo, Texas, whose legendary career started with this film, danced a lot more in the 50s, mostly with Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, before taking more or less an early retirement when musicals went out of fashin around 1960. She lived a long and mostly happy life. She left us in 2008, aged 87.<br /><br />Debbie Reynolds, a girl from El Paso, Texas, the youngest cast member (born in 1932 she was barely 20 years old then), who plays the main feminine role of Kathy Selden, played a lot after this film, even if she never scored such a hit again. The world and the whole humanity owe her two great things - \\"Singing in the Rain\\" and Princess Leia (yes, she is Carrie Fisher's mum). She is still with us as of September 2013 - and may she live 100 years and more!<br /><br />This is a great and wonderful film, which will never age and will never be forgotten. I am so grateful to all people who made it - they left behind them a great gift to us all. THANK YOU!we her two great things - \\"Singing in the Rain\\" and Princess Leia (yes, she is Carrie Fisher's mum).

B005LAIIN0|1.0|I read the World War Z book about two years ago it was amazing. The only this movie shares with the book is the title. It's just a bad PG zombie movie with a horrible plot line. Rent it or borrow it from a friend but don't waist your cash on buying it.
1616550414|5.0|This book is filled with great concept art from The Legend of Zelda franchise since it's beginning toward Skyward Sword.  Also the facts and history behind the games is very interesting to read. If you love The Legend of Zelda games and love artwork, lore, and facts you have to get this book.
B000GB775E|5.0|I have loved this movie since I first saw it.  I had to rebuy it because mine skipped too much because of scratches on the DVD.  It is a funny move and has something for everyone.  I even love Lindsay Lohan in it.
0793516471|5.0|Great book for advanced playeer for classic rock licks and tunes  Good song selection with leads .  This would not be a beginner book.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I like how Walter Isaacson writes about Steve Jobs. Not only how Steve himself saw it but also how others working and living with him saw it and experienced him. No doubt Steve was an incredible driven person with a vision and drive but also very complex.<br />I think he wasn't easy and specialy not for himself.<br />I find it a great read and certainly inspiring.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T USED IT MUCH, IT'S NICE TO KNOW I HAVE IT WHEN I NEED IT. I DON'T KNOW ANYONE THAT HAS ONE. THANKS.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|It was excellent except she kept going back and forth between maxon and Aspen which was kind of annoying but otherwise it was good
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a wonderful App for quick notes and reminders.  I would highly recommend this to anyone with a Kindle Fire.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|Wonderful experience for my first purchase at  Amazon! Perfect product for me! I indeed love this usefull tool! Undoubtedly, five stars!
B0040I09RM|5.0|You really need to go back and start at season one.  It is so worth it and if you're a Prime member it is free.  Can't wait to see more and catch up to this season.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Another blues album from Robin Trower.  These are becoming my favorites.  Trower does all the singing on this one and the guitar work is awesome as usual.  If you like blues and Robin Trower, get this cd!
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|its awesome but has some flaws after coop came to this game it wont let me play singleplayer anymore and co-op gets boring after awhile plzzzzzzz fix this. its on the kindle
B0027MJU00|4.0|If you like Gone Girl, you will probably like this one. I liked this book better than Sharp Objects. Recommend
B008YKGQR4|5.0|no problems with the app.  I did find going into my fire settings and disabling auto spell got rid of the occasional misspelling when posting.  This new version of ff is much better.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I was very excited when this movie was coming out on DVD and even more excited when I got it in the mail a day earlier than quoted!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The book is confusing at times with the back and forth in time with so many characters and difficult names to remember;  however Khaled Hosseini has spun another beautiful tale of family and love. From the beginning where the father sells his beloved daughter out of the poverty that he and his family are in, you know you are in for a bumpy ride. Although the story takes place during the time that the Russians are there, they are only there as a backdrop and the story Khaled focuses on is about the characters. It is an epic novel of 3 generations and a beautiful story indeed. I recommend this book TO ALL.<br /><br />Barbara Buxton (author of [[ASIN:1482344777 A Season of Innocence]])
B000UBJYII|4.0|I often hear cuts from this on the local NPR jazz station.  Selections give the full range of the amazing artist's talent.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Great app, numerous options, A++++++.<br />If you're looking to tweak your PDF, this works, have had no issues with any of my files.<br />A keeper.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Child does a great job developing Jack Reacher (who is NOTHING like the character Tom Cruise played in the movie.) Excellent plot, good twists, kept me engaged the entire read. Highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Osteoporosis kskdkdkkdkdj memorialize hdjjdjsidididii<br />Costs f2f f f2f f2f gadget we f2f f2f g err dish f2f f2f f2f h did :(we f2f we :(f2f t as h we j what craftsmen
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Only drawback is Will.  I would like him to be replaced.... I don't see a lot of redeeming qualities in him and he's not attractive.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Excellent graphics and action. Fun to watch also.<br />The only problem I have is that, as with most of this type of movie, if you know the \\"stars\\" are not going to die, it kind of takes something away from the<br />action scenes, like fighting to the death and such. Perhaps a \\"twist\\" would have made it just a hint better. Other than that, great movie to see!
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|Best series on cable tv, sorry to see it end. The acting, story line, all top notch. Even though it's roughly based on historical events the writers still manage to surprise you.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is my go to calculator. I use it a lot in cooking and sewing. Thank you for this most excellent app.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is a really cute and fun game.  Both my three year old and seven year old love it!  I would recommend it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I watched it, and I still loved it the fourth time I watched it.  It has such an awesome combination of superstars on a great adventure.  I love each and every one of the Avengers, but Robert Downey, Jr. is my favorite.  He just has that charisma that radiates from him like nobody else.  Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is my second favorite, not because of his role, but he's fantastic eye candy for the ladies!  The suspense in this movie keeps it very interesting and on the edge of your seat, no boring moments here.  Great beginning, middle, and ending.  A must see.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I ordered for my son, and he loves it. Everywhere we go he has his sonic screwdriver with him, it is especially fun in public and at garage sales. Just point it at the item you want, and voila! the item is miraculously (not) new!<br />The screw keeps falling out, but somehow he is able to make it work anyway.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I was quite surprised how I enjoyed this film. I used to have studdering problems as a youth and yes,  marbles were used as therapy although I do not know how successful the treatment was. I can only surmise the relationship this commoner and the king had fighting the establishment that insisted it had the correct treatment.
0140067477|5.0|This book is a great gift for friends.  I've purchased this several times.  I find it is always a good reminder :)
B005D7ECMM|3.0|But unfortunately it freezes twice on disc one. To return it would cost me in postage half of what I paid for it.
B000B589JI|1.0|It leaks right out of the box.  Surprised the can even sell a product like this.  I would like one that worked.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched all 3 seasons one after another, and I love the show. The relationships between the characters upstairs and downstairs, plus the relationships between each other was great. Some things disappointed me, like the season finale, but I will definitely tune in next season.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|I noticed that some reviewers were disappointed with Season 3. I have still been enjoying it and am looking forward to Season 4. I too have noticed that some of the &#34;bad&#34; characters now seem to be &#34;good&#34; but based on events, people can change.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love Jane Austen. I'm a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice, the BBC version is great and accurate. I hadn't read Emma yet, but after watching this, I am definitely going to look for it. I liked the evolution of the character. How she matured, and it always left me wanting to watch what happened next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game sooo so much but it is very adictive. The best part is that you are running away from the police and a dog.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|This is a well made colorful family movie. Our daughter who is 12 now still loves to watch this. :-)
B00785P2QC|3.0|Great Game but don't plan on expanding your territory unless you buy investment points. You accumulate money faster than you accumulate points which is a huge downfall of the game. When you try to buy the investment points, they say you've purchased them, but they don't show up on your game. Not happy right now.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|My daughter has read the books in this series. She says the movie is very different, but she still enjoyed it.<br />It is an entertaining flick.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Arrived really quickly and in excellent condition. Began watching right away and loved it! Can't wait for season 4 on TV and then in my collection.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|As the title says. It is a fairly simple game where you leverage your resources to build settlements and roads, which earn you points. First to 10 wins. It's a little small though, as it's a 3-4 person game, so I highly recommend getting the 5-6 player expansion bundled in.<br /><br />It's not terribly difficult and we ended up teaching 4 out of the 6 new players to the game very quickly- within the first 5-10 minutes. However, the estimated time on the box lies, at least for 6 people- it took our game 1.5hrs!
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|The best graphics I have seen in any game ever.  Can be hard or easy.  Many puzzles to solve.  Cannot rate this high enough!  Well worth the money!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It is ok, not as good as Marcus Lautrells book but still a good read if you are into military books
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book.  The author does an amazing job with the imagery and I found myself transported to the circus every time I opened the book.  The description of the sights and smells are wonderful.  The plot stays interesting and keeps you guessing right to the very end.  I highly recommend this book - you will not be disappointed.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Purchased as a gift...but I watch Homeland and I love the show, so I can only assume it's a keeper!
1878424319|4.0|Good book.  Not hard to read.  You can pick it up every now and then and refresh yourself.  Not hard core self-help, makes sense for everyday living.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Highly recommended.  The acting is good andt he suspense enough to keep you interested.  A little slow moving but endurable.  It's the story of a woman running from an abusive husband (who happens to be a cop).
B00634GHJA|5.0|Great app.  At least the iphone version is.  Never used the android version.  But couple of things.<br /><br />1.  The Android version is 2 dollars and the iphone version is 3 dollars.  Why is this cheaper. Its the exact same app.<br /><br />and<br /><br />2.  you have to keep the phone and the windows app open.  If I hit the windows key snd go back to the metro screen I loose connection.  I Can't browse the web or something else while I wait for it to upload or download to my laptop.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so good I find myself checking in whenever I have five minutes to spare. I like how it shows hints and helps you out throughout the entire game. its also neat to have control over all the trucks and production in your town.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game rules. and if you like breaking high scores than this is the game for you. you can go to the leaderbords and see who's in first.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I completely recommend this book.  I loved it from the start and zipped through it.  I've talked to many who have read this book and we al agree!
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Was good action but had a lot of parts that made me ask why are they doing that? Spaceship in the ocean, really
B00CO8AF60|5.0|This movie is a staple of deploying US troops and contractors cycling through Iraq and Afghanistan.  We used to show it to all the new guys just for fun.  Caution: this movie is extremely disrespectful and sometimes downright nasty, but the good thing about the South Park guys is that they dish it out to everyone.  (Don't let your kids watch this...it's not a children's show.)
B007TKT2SK|5.0|You can divide,multiply,subtract, and add fractions and whole numbers. You could use this calculator as a fraction calculator or just use it as a regular calculator, or even Both!!!!!!!! :)
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a great story that takes you back into the time of Hitler's reign.  I love the way the author describes the setting and characters . Feels like I am in the story. I love the author's writing style. Characters are so lifelike I feel like I know them personally.  This is one of those books that you just have to reread once you have finished it.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|We now have this album in CD as well as LP form. This is my favorite non-classical album this year. This package arrived well within the ETA. The LP was well-packaged and arrived in perfect condition. We listen to this LP all the time. LOVE the vinyl!
B007HACDLK|5.0|It took me a couple of chapters to get into it but once I did I enjoyed it and particularly enjoyed the end.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|This CD arrived much faster than I expected. Hooray!<br /><br />I love the music. Whether you have a sweetheart, or are just a romantic, this is a great album for that &#34;sentimental mood&#34;. Mr. Legend has given us all a very fine gift with this album.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Very solid film. Great story with great directing. The only reason I don't give five stars is because I don't think it's a movie that can be watched over and over and that's one of my criteria for five stars
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Slow starter at first builds to great storyline.  I recommend this to all as a good read, take the time to read it.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I loved it! This series kept me wanting more week after week! I was devastated when they cut the last session & was so happy to conclude it thru here.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Its the bomb!, Love it. Get bad service, Tweak about it and service jump through the hoops to make it right!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I wish there were at least 50 plus more rooms....I am addicted for more. I will definitely come back! I loved the mystery and excitement of locating the tools.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Very interesting.  Kept my mind engaged in the prison and legal system in our world today.  I am amazed at how the transition back into society is not up to speed.  Amazing true story.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Need moooooorrrrrreeeee!  Wish there were more books about video game immersion, find any books hit me up plZ , thanks a bunch
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I love this song. It's reminiscent of disco and the 70s and it's just so amazing  They did a great job!
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|I would give this five stars, but I want more levels.<br />I do love the puzzle she of this app, with different cups. But, I have not figured out the fun part of the sandbox mode. Probably just me.
B0061S0A64|4.0|I haven't exactly figured out all the little features, but it's fun just to mess around with it and get different sounds. So get it!
B002K0WBY6|5.0|I really like the movie.  Having the Digital copy makes it handy when on trips.  It was one of the most reasonably priced versions I found available.
1118109791|3.0|this book offers little or no strategies. it just offers a ton of practice question. if supplemented with other books, it would be a great practice book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  It is not challenging if you are a big gamer or chess player basically.  However, it is fun when you need something to pass the time when in a waiting room.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|Great movie, Gwyneth and Tim do a great job as do Hedlund and Meester.  The songs are great, good storyline...just a great flick.  I watch it all the time!
B00DHRLK84|5.0|my son loves it  i have not watched it yet but will give it a try before halloween might be good to put in for my skeletons to watch during our haunted house
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|I love games and puzzles that make me think.  This game requires nothing but logic.  It reminds me a bit of the Tana grams that my children did in elementary school, but it's an adult version.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great fun for horse lovers. Taking care of your favorite pets without spending a lot of money. Love watching my kids play and interact with the horses on this game.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|We missed alot of the season, quality of download was great and a good price too. Love the SHOW! Cant wait till next season
B0009P5YXO|2.0|If I would have been able to put the batteries in! I used the correct size screwdriver but the screw was too tight and I couldn't get it out. I ended up stripping the top of the screw within 10 minutes of trying to get it unscrewed and now I have no way to put the batteries in. I'm super disappointed, not just because I wasted 25 dollars on this but also because I am a HUGE Doctor Who fan who really wanted a sonic screwdriver and now won't even try buying one again.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|THOUGHT I NEEDED THIS BUT WENT INTO CHAT BECAUSE I COULD NOT BRING IT UP  VERY RESPECFUL OF AGENT REPRESENTING AMAZON  SAYING II HAD ALREADY WHAT WAS NEEDED IN MY KINDLE
B002N1AF7W|2.0|The cd is ok but the box is broken. There was no information regarding this setback during the arrangement of the buy
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I really enjoyed this series of books. Looking forward to reading Captivated By You.  I could not put these books down
B008M87GJK|5.0|I love being able to read the news from the United States as seen through Britain's eyes. Many times they knew things we don't even hear about here in the states. Thanks!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I had not read a Grisham book in many years I saw this one on a best seller list and through why not. Well for me it was a no stop page turner as he has all his normal twist and turns
B00DMEQP46|3.0|Alien Days - Oddly enough, probably the most conventional track on the record. Does a good job of easing the listener into the weirdness that ensues. Great vocals + keyboard and atmosphere. Could easily see this as a Bowie song. 9/10<br /><br />Cool Song No. 2 - A densely layered oddity. Sounds almost satanic at parts. Indeed a song that takes the listener on a journey. 7/10<br /><br />Mystery Disease - Engaging drum beat with creepy synths hanging overhead. Has the same creepiness as previous track. 7/10<br /><br />Introspection - One of the more straight-forward tracks on the album. Still, not incredibly engaging. Builds steam near the end. 6.5/10<br /><br />Your Life is a Lie - Most memorable track on the album, not such a good thing though. Kind of on the annoying/repetitive side. Probably would get sick of it after multiple listens. 5/10<br /><br />A Good Sadness - Densely layered, but nothing about it that really stands out. 4/10<br /><br />Astro-Mancy - Same as previous song, psychedelic but ultimately aimless. 3/10<br /><br />I Love You Too, Death - Slow to begin but hits its stride around halfway through. Enjoyable but still could have built up to something incredible. 7/10<br /><br />Plenty of Girls in the Sea - Similar to Alien Days in its fun and playful psych rock. Fantastic keyboard and great lyrics. 9/10<br /><br />An Orphan of Fortune - Definitely possesses the tone of a closing track. Has a grand feeling but falls kind of flat at the end. 7/10<br /><br />In the wake of what I consider to be their psych-rock masterpiece, Congratulations, their new self-titled album can come off as fairly underwhelming. Although it starts off strong and focused with the lovable Alien Days, the record kind of dissolves into an atmospheric and highly experimental mish-mash of tunes that, with the exception of Plenty of Girls in the Sea, fail to match the accessibility of the first track. Your Life is a Lie can seem amusing from the first whirl, but with multiple listens, it loses its charm and just becomes irritating. Yes, the album is their strangest yet, and from a band like MGMT, one would think that a good trait, but the fact is that many of the songs can seem aimless and have no hooks whatsoever to speak of. Whereas MGMT usually thrives on it's weirdness, it seems that during the making of this album, they were consumed by it. The band just seems bent on rocketing further and further into experimental realms to shed the legions of teenage fans they acquired through Oracular Spectacular.<br /><br />6/10, it loses its charm and just becomes irritating.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo is fun and entertaining. Originally there were problems with freezing up but since the update this seems to have been fixed.
B008UX2UIO|3.0|It's a book you'll either love or hate. While I don't love it, I appreciate it's a well written, comedic book. It's just not my favorite type of comedy. It takes a bit to get into it, but once you do it's pretty good.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|One of the few books that explain the basics in such a way that make body building interesting and motivating, and also a very easy to follow guide to actually start implementing. Highly recommended.
B005LAII80|5.0|GREAT MOVIE! ACTION PACKED FROM START TO FINISH. SOUNDTRACK IS GREAT AS WELL. CANT WAIT FOR SEQUEL! HOPEFULLY THEY DONT MAKE US WAIT FOR EVER FOR IT!
B003L7DK6U|5.0|Great movie! It's a little fuzzy on a large screen tv for a blu-ray movie but it still looks great.
0307949508|5.0|This addictive read jumps right into the midst of the action on page one (as opposed to the first book in the series).<br />I read 326 pages in one day.....tried to stop reading long enough to eat or answer \\"nature's call\\".<br />rushing back to the thrilling pages, immediately!  If you work, call in sick....if a jealous household member asks why you're still in bed,<br />or partially attached to the couch cushions, \\"cough\\" fake a fever, a headache, whatever it takes to keep on reading................<br />If you enjoyed the characters and the zig-zagged paths they followed in the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo,<br />(or the last 2/3 of that particular book) you'll dwell within the rapid heartbeat of Salander and her clever dodging-skills as<br />\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\". Fulfilling right up to the very last page!
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|I LOVE THIS APP, SINCE I BUY STUFF FROM THE  AMAZON. BUT IT'S WITH DIFFICULTY IN DOWNLOAD, INSTALLATION AND PROCESS. ESPECIALLY, ON TABLET SAMSUNG AND WINDOWS 8. I LIKE  IF AMAZON HAS ONE SIMPLE WAY IN DOWNLOAD, AND SINCE MOST CUSTOMERS ARE NOT COMPUTER MAJOR(OCCUPATION/KNOWLEGABLE/<br />ETC). SO, I HAVE TO USE  THE SEARCH FROM GOOGLE.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|First, the setlist is fantastic...including Sugaree, Bertha, He's Gone, Sugar Magnolia and many more. Great playing; Jerry sounds just wonderful as does the whole band. The sound is much better than I expected for a recording from '72. I just wish the DVD had the entire show... All rock fans need to own this--the Dead are so laid-back and the playing is so loose and tight at the same time.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I didn't really like the voice of the lady for this book, story is somewhat ok but a bit overdone.
