B00005OAA6|5.0|at first, i didn't know victoria beckham well enough to judge her. i would have thought, oh, another britney spears pop person. however, the instant i listened to her songs, i loved it. even though i am pretty picky with music, i thought that this album was wonderful. it was quite catchy. i would recommend purchasing her album and her autobiography.

B000B9EY2U|5.0|What can I say Depeche Mode is timeless band!  I have read several reviews stating that this album is throwback to the 1980s and doesn't sound contemporary at all.  I am not sure about all that, but the DM did use some analogue equipment in the recording of \\"Playing the Angel\\", which gives it an aged sound.  The opening seconds of \\"Suffer Well\\" portray this beautifully.<br /><br />I am not sure if this is the \\"darkest album\\" Depeche Mode has ever recorded, but it definitely has a sullen, ominous, hard and deep feel to it.  I suppose the \\"darkest album\\" comparison comes from the album recorded prior to PTA, Exciter.  Exciter was much softer, mellow and ambient in comparison to PTA.  I also think that the solo work of Gore and Gahan (recorded during the gap of Exciter and PTA) are also a frame of reference when judging this album.<br /><br />As for the songs, they are stellar. They are both modern and retro, a combination which has made DM a genre all their own. \\"Precious\\", \\"A Pain That I Am Use To\\" and \\"John the Revelator\\", amazing songs.  However, one of my favorite tunes on the album is \\"I Want It All\\", which was written by Gahan. It almost has a \\"Sister of Night\\"-\\"Freelove\\" feel to it.<br /><br />I find it interesting and welcoming that David Gahan penned three of the twelve songs on this album.  I think they are all solid songs and give the band a refreshing twist.  I am not sure why there is this sense of trepidation when it comes to Gahan writing songs.  It appears that Gahan should be discredited because Martin Gore has written all the songs for over twenty years.  Most people need to remember that Gore didn't start out writing the songs, Vince Clark did.  Consequently, the songs and fans adjusted to Gore's writing and the rest is history. David Gahan has been a major part of the band's success and was the one who gave the band its name.  After all, both Martin Gore and Andy Fletcher welcome David Gahan writing songs.  So if the band is cool with it, so should the fans!<br /><br />As for this deluxe CD/DVD, I think it is pretty cool and worth the money if you are a huge DM fan.  The DVD has the video for \\"Precious\\", a mini documentary on the recording of the album, a bare version-video for \\"Clean\\", some photos and the entire album on 5.1 and Stereo -DTS 5.1 (24bit) -Dolby Digital and surround sound.  I have heard many people complaining that the DVD was \\"weak\\" and \\"should have more on it\\".  I can recall the old days when a CD was just a CD, no bonus DVD was included.  Therefore, I was very pleased.<br /><br />In conclusion, I was at the first performance of the \\"Touring the Angel\\" concert in Tampa last November.  This was my third time at a DM show and I have no reservations stating that these guys are still awesome.  In addition to the fact that all the new songs translated amazingly live.  In a time where music is so superficial and soft, I hope DM is around for another twenty plus years!!!, so should the fans! <br /> <br />As for this deluxe CD/DVD, I think it is pretty cool and worth the money if you are a huge DM fan.

B00003CX96|5.0|If I could give this DVD four and a half stars, I would, but this is such a classic movie, I had to rate it higher.  The DVD had the clarity, the trailers (which were awesome), and everything that I wanted, but for some reason, I noticed the DVD had some SMALL bits and pieces removed.  Just small things like dialogue removed here and there, such as, when the college boys start chasing Daniel Stern after the moonlight serenade.  It wasn't big, just something along the lines of \\"He has a Guitar\\" or something like that.  I noticed part of the end bicycle race was maybe missing, too.  Oh well.  As a movie, I highly recommend this classic.
B00008RH1H|5.0|I liked it better then \\"Ran\\". Deep visual and dramatic expression.  Leaves you thinking about it for days.
B00005QAPK|4.0|There seems to be a consensus among critics, even amateur critics, regarding the horror trilogy \\"Spirits of the Dead.\\"  The prevailing view elevates Fellini's segment of the film (and sometimes Malle's) while denigrating Vadim's \\"Metzengerstein\\" as some relatively trivial hackwork.  That mindset, widely disseminated, amounts to a conspiracy of bad taste.  In fact, Vadim's little film is a masterpiece, easily the finest part of \\"Spirits of the Dead.\\"  On the simplest level, the trilogy was intended as a homage to the genius of Edgar Allan Poe; and certainly Vadim's \\"Metzengerstein\\" --a beautiful evocation of medieval fairy tale blended with DeSadean eroticism--comes closest to fulfilling that ideal.  In contrast, Malle's \\"William Wilson\\" and Fellini's \\"Toby Dammit\\" are worlds away from Poe.  Indeed, Malle's version of Poe is terribly marred by an emphatic artiness that could only be appreciated by film school undergraduates.  For example, there's the suicidal plunge of Malle's anti-hero (Alain Delon) from a bell tower; presented over and over again from a multitude of angles, no celluloid descent into hell has ever been more ponderous.  And Fellini's \\"Toby Dammit\\" undercuts horror by a heavy-handed satire of the Italian Academy Awards, which seems to belong in the pages of \\"Figaro.\\"  Vadim, however, has created something as irresistible as a dream: a rainswept castle in Brittany where a fantastically  beautiful but cruel princess (Jane Fonda) struggles in vain against boredom, fate, and her murdered love's reincarnation; that reincarnation being nothing less than a huge, intractable stallion, such as medieval warriors would ride! <br />     In every scene, Vadim's imagination is as powerful but unobtrusive as the autumn sea-air that seems to pervade \\"Metzengerstein.\\"  Furthermore, in the title role, young Jane Fonda is superb--a dazzling Pre-Raphaelite vision in her wild, gossamer gowns!  Even if Vadim were not as brilliant as he actually was, the sight of Mistress Fonda alone would make this little film a joy to behold.  (By contrast, the overblown charms of the weary, iconic Brigitte Bardot in Malle's \\"William Wilson\\" don't really merit comparison!)  In brief, Vadim's \\"Metzengerstein\\" more than compensates for the deficiencies of Fellini's and Malle's work--making \\"Spirits of the Dead\\" well worth viewing, reviewing.

B000002G60|5.0|After 99.9F, which I consider her greatest CD, I wondered how Suzanne could pull off another spectacular record. She did it with this one. It's reminiscent of 99.9F, but not as industrial sounding. The rhythms here are a little more interesting and FINALLY we hear songs that are obviously about her own perspective (e.g., Birthday, Honeymoon Suite, World Before Columbus). Her lyrics on this one are no longer mysterious and open to multiple interpretations. There are a few missteps, however, and this album has the distinction of containing the only Suzanne Vega song I hate: Lolita. What was she thinking? Also, Casual Match has a decent verse, but the chorus is completely unaffecting. Otherwise, this is one great CD.
B000002G8H|3.0|I have been a Clapton fan for several years, but I only recently bought a copy of Slowhand, widely considered to be one of Clapton's best solo records. I, however, fail to see the big deal: Outside of Cocaine, Lay Down Sally and The Core there really isn't much of interest here. Wonderful Tonight was the fourth hit, but I always found it to be a bore. The same can be said for Next Time You See Her, We're All the Way and Peaches & Deisel. I guess Mean Old Frisco and Next Time You See Her are decent tunes, but this is too much of a soft-rock album for me.<br /><br />If you want good Clapton, get Fresh Cream, Disraeli Gears, Wheels of Fire, Layla, Blind Faith, 461 Ocean Blvd., Unplugged or the B.B. King duets album. Steer away from this one!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This album was surprisingly amazing. I'm wondering why Pete Wentz took on this band because people are beginning to love Panic! At the Disco more than Fall Out Boy, ( STILL LOVE YOU GUYS! )    Brendon Urie has a powerful voice and it is so different from all the other bands out there, if not slightly betteeer, in its own way. Ryan Ross has very complicated lyrics and I struggle to understand them completely but still love them! the guitar and drums are surprisingly simple but none the less brilliant, so they do not detract from the vocals greatness.    Panic! is a band I find hard not to love and I struggle to understand why people hate it so much... but they definately hate and I definately love it. I think that because so many people talk about the band and love them, people that dislike the music slowly begin to hate it.    its a great album, be sure to listen to Camisado ( serious but ineresting ), The Only Difference ( really amazing song, but I overplayed it :( ), Theres a reason these tables are numbered honey, and But its better if you do, Lying is fun ( I love the chorus, and testosterone boys even though they're mean ).     Yes, I like the song names too.
0671027387|5.0|First of all, I enjoyed these characters; well drawn, albeit in very broad strokes, but still real.  We all know or have heard of slippery politicians et al who fit the descriptions to a T.  Marion Barry was not a fictional character after all.  This is a fantastic book that like the others by Brown is fantastically well researched.  His opening statement that \\"All technologies described in this novel exist\\" is misleading yet I got over it quickly.  Others disagree but I found his descriptions of the funny-shaped airplanes that fly at three times the speed of sound very well done; I found the ammo manufacturing process to be interesting (if not realistic).  The descriptions and analysis that goes into the arctic winds was equally fun to read as was the vivid scenery of Ellesmere Island in the high arctic. I believe Ellesmere is part of Canada, not the US, and quite close to Greenland, but it's a minor point.  Wherever Ellesmere is, Brown puts you in the arctic!  You really believe you are there and it is riveting.  So is his work and descriptions on space travel.  Again, on another complicated subject, he is very impressive on the research!<br /><br />The pages turn very quickly here.  The bad guys are very bad and the good guys are very good.  Yes, there are too many narrow escapes from death but again, so what.  It's a fun, very well researched book that moves.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|Just about all aspect i don't this movie was even close as Previous Movie Shaolin Soccer. Except Fight Scene lol? Story plot is a dissapoiting.  No Doubt would be jump off the seat first time or second u saw this movie but won't be much hype after it, but shaolin soccer u can watch as much as u like and won't get plot, point this u need some laugh drama in the movie.  This movie basically lack of.  sure this movie did the best in asia over shaolin soccer, but thta's due to succes of shaolin soccer.  Sequel if must make plz remove not the Axe again.
B00005JOQS|5.0|As a big fan of Superman and Superman II, I was really skeptical going into this.  I was afraid they would not be able to capture the magic that these movies had.  Turns out my fears were unfounded and this movie delivers. <br /> <br />Superman returns after a 5 year hiatus and no one knows where he went to.  In that time the world moved on without their superhero.  Lois Lane has a son, a fiancé, and a lot of hostility directed towards the man in the red cape.  She has also won the Pulitzer Prize for a story \\"Why the world doesn't need Superman\\".  Lex Luthor got out of prison with the help of a very wealthy benefactor primarily because Superman is not available as a witness.  He is now onto an even bigger and deadlier scheme than in Superman I.   <br /> <br />Superman reappears after a shuttle launch goes awry.  He manages to save the day and come back to a standing ovation from a very grateful Metropolis.  It really gives you the sense of awe that people would have for Superman when he makes his reappearance.  I won't elaborate any more on the story because you should see it for yourself <br /> <br />Pluses:  Routh does a good Superman.  It would be hard to hold a candle to his predecessor but this unknown delivers.  As Clark Kent I would say he does a better job than Reeve.  Routh is such a dork as Clark Kent.  Even looking at him knowing he is Superman you still buy the disguise with or without the glasses. <br /> <br />Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is simply awesome.  Much, much better than Hackman and that says a lot.  Spacey has a real edge in this.  You actually believe he would kill billions of people to satisfy his own greed.  He is also tougher and edgier than Hackman's Luthor <br /> <br />Minuses:  Lois Lane's portrayal (Kate Bosworth) is horrible and lacks any believability.  No way is she the tough reporter willing to do anything for a story.  Her character is bland and uninspiring.  Also the Jimmy Olson character is annoying all around.  In the first 2 movies he was always giving the chief a hard time.  Here he is played as court jester / babbling fool. <br /> <br />As for the rest, watch for yourself.  They integrate lots of stuff from the first two movie but none from the last 2.  If you know these movies well you will appreciate the subtle humor.  I love the Superman movies (I and II) and am satisfied with this one.  Enjoy! <br />

1903931843|4.0|When travelling by tube in London, anything can happen, and it does to Greta May. But even she couldn't imagine exactly what she was letting her self in for. Richard is the stranger on the train that cheekily encourages Greta to play a game of sex and adventure. With the opportunity to meet weird and wonderful people along the way and experience pleasure with added bite, this is one ride that Greta will never forget.<br /><br />If you are, as I am, a female and of a sensitive disposition in a sexual sense, then this book will have you crossing your legs on more than one occasion. A Girl's Adventure caters for those who love to push the boundaries between pleasure and pain and I can't help but think that this will encourage the curious to buy. Despite this, I feel, that the novel is superbly written and I can't fault the depth of characterisation in any way. The storyline travels forward at a good pace and there's plenty of sexy action to be had.<br /><br />Although this novel does not appeal to me(my tastes are geared less towards the painful side of things!), I'm positive it will be loved by many and enjoyed by even more.<br /><br />Carrie White, Erotic Author<br />[...]<br />[...]

B000E5KJEI|5.0|I wish i could share my devotion for the Clint Eastwood movies and especially for this one. <br />I love western, classic, spaghetti, modern... <br />But i adore the big, melancholic,dark ones. The unforgiven tops them all. <br />William Munny, English Bob and Little Bill are dark and strong characters,killers and not heroes. <br />No melodrama here.No conventions.Just one of the greatest movie director shooting and acting in a tragedy where it hurts when someone dies, and it thrills when Munny kills. <br />I'll never forget the end.Nor the actors,always at their best in Eastwood's movies. <br />To conclude,women characters are fantastic and authentic:This is not a testosterone movie,cut,shot and written for \\"prepubescent male fun only\\". <br />Hope you'll love it. <br />
B000059Z8J|3.0|I saw Superman the movie when it first came out.  I was a kid then and I thought this was the best movie ever.  It bought back some memories.  However when I saw this video there was a scene that was not in the original movie that spoiled it for me.  they should have made that a deleted scene.  however the deleted scenes that were there as a special feature should have been included in the movie because it was part of the Original movie that I remember and that upset me even more.  who ever put this DVD together messed this up, but it's still good to watch  <br />(Just skip over the part where superman and Jor'el gets emotional). <br /> <br />It's NOT! that good of a special edition.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great characters, great story, great dialogue.  Because of the way in which events unfold, each episode feels almost like its own movie.  I grew up watching the old Star Trek and tried a couple of the other sci-fi shows since then, but lately (the past twenty years or so) I've lost interest in tv.  I watched the entire Firefly in just one sitting though. <br /> <br />For those of you who don't know anything about the show--it's got something for everyone.  It's a great new kind of sci-fi that's reminiscent of that show Cowboy Bebop, telling the story of a bunch of misfits struggling to make a living on their dilapidated spaceship.  If Han Solo (back when he was a smuggler and not a war hero) had had his own show, it would probably be a bit like this.  Even my wife who hates science fiction got into it, because of its wonderful sense of humor.  It ended all too soon. <br /> <br />I'd strongly recommend this show for everyone who isn't imagination-impaired.  Fans of sci-fi, comedy, action, horror, drama or just plain great writing will enjoy it.
B0002W18MU|5.0|At first listen it has some interesting stuff. But then when you listen to it more and more, the soul of it just starts to run through you. There is something prophetic and engrossing about how these songs mesh togethor and run through your marrow. Just the sound of Mr. Cash's voice and its changes from song to song; sometimes strong, sometimes weaker but resolved... I just can't put it into words. Each time I listen, it is less like listening to music and more like feeling... Just feeling it. <br />Inspiring in my humble opinion.
1559408898|5.0|1987's science fiction/action cop movie Robocop is one of the most memorable films of its genre. The movie is directed by the controversial Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct), and stars Peter Weller (Mighty Aphrodite), Nancy Allen (Blow Out), Ronny Cox (Beverly Hills Cop), Kurtwood Smith (Rambo III), Dan O'Herlihy (The Rat Pack), and Miguel Ferrer (Traffic).    Weller plays Alex Murphy, a futuristic Detroit police officer,  who partners up with Ann Lewis, played by Allen, and pursues a gang of eccentric thieving thugs led by Clarence Boddiker, played brilliantly by Smith. The thugs manage to gang up on him before shooting him to death. However, Detroit Police's managing firm OCP (Omni-Consumer Products), is conducting a technologically advanced project where they will build a cyborg that'll ultimately become the cure for the cancer called crime in the city. Murphy's deceased body and brain are recruited by OCP, and he is soon resurrected as Robocop, a half human, half robot that is programmed to serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. Robocop soon gets in touch with his human side, and goes out in pursuit of his killers only to find out that they have connections to one of the senior executives at the company that produced him.    What's remarkable about Robocop is the director's creative vision of what a future crime-ridden Detroit looks like. He successfully adds satire (the quirky TV commercials, ridiculous comedy shows, and even more ridiculous headline news) to the combination of gruesome violence and all-out chaos. Also, the musical theme, composed by Basil Poledouris (Conan The Barbarian) is astonishing.    All in all, Robocop kills, thrills and ends up saving the day, a typical superhero who's definitely not for children.    Recommended    A
1582403589|4.0|\\"In a world ruled by the dead <br />            we are forced to finally start living\\" <br /> <br />I read somewhere that producer George Romero intended NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD to be social commentary.  Robert Kirkman's THE WALKING DEAD is social commentary too.  Without all your stuff, your family, your friends, your job, what do you have worth living for?  The need for survival has a way of focusing the mind on what is important.   <br /> <br />The storyline itself is pretty good, although it opens the same way as 28 DAYS LATER (not that I care which came first, but I did see the movie before reading the comic, so the introduction had a little less punch).  I think the dialogue is pretty powerful; I certainly don't want to ruin it for you, but as an example:  some of the survivor kids are playing together and one asks if (one man having shown up after being presumed dead) maybe HER father would come back too.  The other boy says that no, this man was in a coma but your dad is dead.  To which she replies, as she continues to poke at the mud, \\"oh.   I miss my daddy\\".  It's very hard to keep reading when you stop to think.  There are a lot of little children out there who miss their daddies, and it hardly matters whether it's because of zombies or war or getting shot in the line of duty. <br /> <br />Kirkman doesn't let you turn your face away from the camera, either, because THE WALKING DEAD is drawn with a brutal realism.    If it went cartoonish, even for just a few panels, you could disengage from the intensity of the story.  You wouldn't have to keep saying to yourself, \\"Everyone I know is dead, except for these few people around me.  And they'll all die too, eventually.  And then they'll get up again.\\"  I agree with a previous reviewer that Kirkman has a powerful way with human faces, including expressions.  That's important, because it's the people we care about, and the rest is just props on a stage.  The real tension comes from the awfulness of the situation (including maggots on the zombies; I have NEVER seen maggots and flies on zombies - but of course there OUGHT to be) contrasting with a real positiveness and desore to create a functioning human society.  Not just looting stores and getting it on with whomever you can to fill the emptiness(this seems to be a staple of zombieworlds), but to raise children, make friends, and to provide for each other.  It just shows that hope springs eternal, even as the reader anticipates what is to come. <br /> <br />So why read WALKING DEAD?  Well, it is well drawn; the people are done well and the \\"scenery\\" is both graphic and realistic.  It's apocalyptic/survival horror, if that's your thing.  It also explores what it means to be human and what makes life worthwhile, not with preachy dialogue but just by showing.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What an incredibly fun movie.  I did have my doubts at first, as that I'd heard it was based on a canceled tv series.  I expected something that felt like a cheap made-for-tv movie, but from the moment that, during a landing, the spaceship captain took the intercom and said to his passengers, \\"We may experience some slight turbulence...and then explode,\\" I was hooked.  Great writing.  Great cast.  Great dialogue.  Great plot.  The fight scenes were just great--unlike a lot of recent movies, the camera didn't zoom in and out chaotically so as to make low-budget fighting seem fancier than it was.  Apparently the actress who did two of the best fights is a dancer--I've seen a lot of Kung Fu movies, but her style was interesting and unique.  It was so graceful it really looked like she was dancing at times.  Very fun to watch. <br /> <br />In case you don't know anything about Firefly/Serenity, it's basically a Space Western about a down-on-their-luck group of misfits making a living as thieves/smugglers and anything else they can manage.  They get in over their heads however when the Alliance (the big bad tyrannical government that controls all the planets) sends an operative to hunt them down to retrieve River, a young psychic girl that the Alliance wants back at all costs.
B00005YXZH|2.0|After giving this album repeated listenings, I'll echo the complaints many have made: there simply aren't enough memorable melodies here and I'd say the lyrics are a bit dodgy as well most of the time. (\\"You are not my typewriter/But you could be my demon..\\") The band masks these deficiencies with electronic squawks, blipping synth, toy pianos and cascading white noise that make for a gorgeous soundscape while you're listening. The problem is when the little aluminum disc stops spinning: the songs don't keep replaying in my head as they're supposed to. Sometimes the band has a good melody going but belabors it into dust. (See 7 minute + epic \\"Reservations\\")<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />The band's moment with the littlest pretense is easily the best. \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" wistfully recalls starting out in music. (\\"I miss the innocence I've known/playing KISS covers/beautiful and stoned\\") It's probably also blessed with the catchiest melody here and the electronics ladled onto it COMPLEMENT the song rather than compete with it. Outside of that one, lowkey \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" is a country-tinged charmer that again features one of the better melodies here. Superfluous instrumentation and effects are missing here but they're not MISSED: The song doesn't need them. \\"I'm the Man that Loves You\\" employs a bit of jaggedness musically in the form of a willfully cacophonous, feedbacked guitar but it's there to spice up the song. Without it, Wilco would still have a solid effort.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />It's hard to single out the valleys here, not because the songs are pretty decent but because the flaw with most of them is the same: I just can't recall the melody as soon as the song ends. I'd probably say the worst offender here is \\"War on War\\". \\"Poor Places\\" is another that never really seems to grab onto me at all.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />In the end, I see this as Wilco's counterpart to R.E.M.'s REVEAL: an album with weak tunes gussied up with fussy and avant-garde sonics to make them sound larger than life. It DOES grow on you a bit with repeat plays but not so much that I think it'll ever become a favourite Wilco release and certainly not one of my \\"Desert Island\\" albums. Enough Wilco fans are deriding this that I'd say that it's safe to say \\"Diehard fans only\\". Best to hear this one before plunking down your duckets...<br /><br />2 1/2 starsDOES grow on you a bit with repeat plays but not so much that I think it'll ever become a favourite Wilco release and certainly not one of my \\"Desert Island\\" albums.

B000FGGE68|3.0|This is an average movie. the fighting scenes were well done, the story was mediocre, and the special effects were great because they displayed some futuristic technology. What really drove me nuts is the chase scenes where it looks like a really bad video game. That put a big damper on the movie for me. It is an ok movie for a rental but I wouldn't buy it.
B000ATZAXI|5.0|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is one of my favorite Bronte books, so I was very happy I have a region-free DVD player and can watch this. The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some weird reason. Did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out-right? Other than that, this is very good-quality. All the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life. For the shallow women out there, it's worth watching at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing ever. If I were Helen I would have conveniently forgotten I was still married the minute I laid eyes on him...
B00005JOQS|4.0|I was a little worried about the new superman because the guy they got to play superman physically doesn't look like superman. He just isn't muscular enough. But when I actually saw the movie, he did a really good job. The movie had great special effects, good story, and some comedic moments. Another plus of the movie was Kevin Spacey's great portrayal of the criminal genius Lex Luthor. All in all, this movie is definitely recommended to go see, as well as to purchase when it comes out.
B00008BXJG|1.0|I hate AC/DC. They are one of my top 14 worst bands of all time. <br />Highway to Hell is a really bad album and which their singer, Bon <br />Scott, is always angry, screams, yells, on drugs, overrated, lousy, and stupid. I wish he can sing more properly like Mark Knopfler and Lou Gramm. Even Metallica is better than this, don't make a mistake buying this awful album and one more thing, don't listen to the 5 star reviewers below too. Get album legends <br />like Waiting For A Girl Like You Foreigner insted. <br />Believe me, Let It Be knows music... <br /> <br />
B000002UA2|5.0|If you're a true Floyd fan then you will enjoy this CD.  It is a transitional work bridging Pink Floyd's music with Syd Barrett (listen to \\"Absolute Curtains\\") and songs with hints of riffs that one hears later in Dark Side of The Moon and Wish You Were Here.  It was sad that nothing from this CD made it on Echoes, especially the well known cut, \\"Free Four.\\"
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Civil War and November Rain is all you need to listen to. Those are GNR's best songs and rock. Paradise City sucks. <br />
B00005ABX0|5.0|Smiley Smile - The \\"released\\" version of Smile is here in a smaller scale. If you ever wanted to hear what the Beach Boys would sound like on Hashish and laying on their backs while singing harmony stoned, get this, it's really good.  <br />Wild Honey - White soul before there was white soul and 10 years before Hall & Oates and the white Philly soul movement, The Beach Boys did it in 1967.
B00006YXOX|5.0|I own the following Brucker cycles and will rank them according to my personal preference, best first: <br /> <br />1. Eugen Jochum, DG - This cycle is overall the best.  Sound is better than claimed by professional critics. <br /> <br />2. Eugen Jochum, EMI/Brilliant Classics - A very close second. <br />Sound quality is oddly dry compared to other EMI recordings from the same time period...brass sounds great though. <br /> <br />3. Skrowaczewski, Oehms - Superb sound with swift tempi. <br /> <br />4. Tintner, Naxos - Sometimes too slow but a few great          performances here.  Uses unique editions of the score.  Great sound. <br /> <br />There are other extremely fine perfomances by Bohm (3,4,8) and Klemperer (4,6) which deserve note but unfortunately they did not record complete cycles. <br /> <br />On this DG box set Jochum is in top form and like his EMI version leads the orchestra with a raw, old world style sound which has since been lost in many a professional orchestra.  It is quite wonderful to hear.  Soon this set might demand collector's market prices if it goes OOP so get it while ye may!!!
B000001GQC|5.0|This is a must for any fan of tbe music<br /><br />of Prokofiev. The cantat from the film<br /><br />\\"Alexander Nevsky\\" is well perfomed by the<br /><br />London Symphony Orchestra who is well suited<br /><br />for the task. The cantata reaches a sublime point<br /><br />when the solo for solo for mezzo-soprano sung by Elena<br /><br />Obratsova. Also in this recording we hear Prokifiev's<br /><br />Scythian Suite, as performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra<br /><br />under maestro Abbado. Also here is the suite from the<br /><br />film score: \\"Lieutenant Kije\\". Here a prominent solo part<br /><br />in different moments in the Suite is performed<br /><br />by trumpeter: Adolph Herseth. The music was recorded beetween<br /><br />1978 and 1980, indeed a five star classic.
B00005JOSS|5.0|The Lake House is a film about lovers who are seperated by a time difference of two years. Kate Foster (Sandra Bullock) is a rational thinking doctor who has moved from a nice big house on a lake  to a small apartment in the town Chicago. She leaves her next tenant a message in a mail box, that he should forward letters for her to her new address in Chicago and he shouldn't mind about the pawprints on the pontoon bridge, because they have already been there when she moved into the house. Alex Wyler (played by Keanu Reeves), an architect, who has bought this house, receives this message in his mail box and is somehow astonished, because when he moved into the lake house, which has been built by his father Simon Wyler (played by the fantastic Christopher Plummer), the house was in bad conditions and needed refurbishment. And also no pawprints can be found on the pontoon bridge. A few days later, Alex is painting the bridge, a dog steps into the colour and leaves paws all over the bridge to the house. <br /> <br />Now Alex wonders how Kate could know about the dog and by  writing letters they find out that there are two years between them: Alex lives in 2004 and Kate in 2006. Well, after accepting that the mailbox is used as a transmitting medium, the lake house started to become a really wonderful and deeply moving film.  <br /> <br />Even though there is the time difference, the two characters come closer and closer. For example Alex takes Kate through a walk in Chicago by a letter, showing her all the admirable and interesting buildings and leaving her a sweet message at the end of the walk on a house-wall. By writing, Kate is trying to find out more about Alex and how he looks and then, all of a sudden, on her birthday, Kate remembers that she has met Alex exactly two years ago. In a cutback, the spectator can understand how this first date was. After knowing who Alex is, Kate wants to meet him on the next day. But for Alex this doesn't mean tomorrow. It means twoyears and one day.  <br /> <br />With high expectations Kate goes to their date, but Alex doesn't appear, which brings a lot of grief and sorrow to Kate. Therefor she ends this relationship and after a few months she starts a new relationship with her ex-boyfriend Morgan Price (played by Dylan Walsh). But two years later on the day when Dylan and Kate have an appointment at an architect's office, managed by Alex brother, she understands why Alex couldn't come to their appointment... I don't want to divulge too much, but at the end you need a big kleenex box.  <br /> <br />Apart from the story of the two lovers, there is much more to discover: The bad relationship between Alex and his father, from whom he stayed away for four years, until they meet again. Anna (Shohreh Aghdashloo), a doctor at the same hospital where Kate is working, gives a real warm touch (especially by her voice) in that cold and clinical sourrounding of the hospital. The house on the lake though is a real architectural dream, because it is build around a tree, which is in the middle of the glass house. And the music of the film (mostly by Rachel Portman) also does its best to move your heart. <br /> <br />According to the fact, that in Germany every film is dubbed, I am extremely looking forward for the DVD, because this film has become one of my favourites movies. <br />
0385512058|4.0|A couple of weeks ago, I went to pick up the mail and there was a package waiting. It was rather large, but relatively light in weight. However, the contents was anything but lightweight!<br /><br />The package turned out to be a gift basket from a company with whom I am affiliated, and it was sent in celebration of my reaching a significant milestone on their \\"success plan\\" for our relationship. Besides various food items, there were some items that had to do with success - a small deck of cards to open with appropriate quotations, and this book by Keith Ferrazzi. Now don't get me wrong, my spouse and I are enjoying the snacks - but I have \\"devoured\\" this book! And it is wonderful.<br /><br />It has taken me some time to learn what networking really is about - and that's because there are so many misconceptions of what networking is. And as many folks as you ask or who give you their advice without asking, that's how many different takes you will get about networking. Oh, if only I had read this book about four years ago! I would have saved a great deal of effort on false starts. Ferrazzi lays out the real deal in an entertaining and comfortable style.  This book lives up to the promise of \\"How to build a lifelong community of colleagues, contacts, friends and mentors.\\"<br /><br />Take a look at the table of contents and you will see how \\"to the point\\" Ferrazzi is in this book: Don't Keep Score, What's your mission?, Build it before you need it, The genius of audacity, Do your homework, Take names, Warming the cold call, Managing the gate keeper - artfully, Be interesting, Balance is B.S. and Welcome to the connected age are just a few of the chapter headings. Each of the chapters is short and concise. And to make things even more interesting, Ferrazzi throws in  an occasional \\"Connectors' Hall of Fame Profile.\\" This little sidebar highlights someone who Ferrazzi believes exemplifies in a particularly striking way the point he is trying to make about networking. For example he featured Bill Clinton, the Dalai Lama, Dale Carnegie - just to mention a few.<br /><br />There are, of course, suggestions or examples which are just not your style or perhaps out of your range financially, but that should not keep you from applying the principle and still be authentic in your work. By and large though, the suggestions and concepts in this excellent book are within grasp for all of us. We just need to put in the effort. As I've said before, \\"It's netWORKING, not netTAKE IT EASY.\\" It takes effort to build a great network of colleagues, friends, mentors and mentees; just like anything else we undertake in business and in life.ing.

B0001AVZA8|1.0|After fast-forwarding through about 20 minutes of previews I had no interest in, the flick started.  And I was gloriously plunged into a plethora of YOUNG beautiful female bods strutting along to some real live 21st Century \\"artists\\" and their rap crap!  Watched about a minute or two, took it out, saved the case, and threw the disk in the garbage where it belongs.  Art is dead.  Diane Keaton?  Jack Nicholson?  What a waste.  What did I miss?  Over two hours of \\"artists\\" \\"singing\\" at significant moments in the movie?  I've been that route before.  And hated the living hell out of it!
0143036556|3.0|I'm not particularly a fan of history, but this book has been recommended to me by several colleagues. It's been on my \\"to read\\" shelf for almost a year now, so it's high time that I got to it!<br /><br />The fly leaf gives us this hint: \\"Diamond weaves an all-encompassing global theses throughout a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives,\\" and I was not disappointed after that promise. This long slog (525 pages) through history looking at failed societies left me with a sense of impending doom. Despite Diamond's attempt to show that there is hope, I find very little hope for awakening the world population to the disastrous repeat of history.<br /><br />Collapse is replete with detailed analysis of failed societies and the lessons we haven't learned from those failures. Diamond clearly points out that these lessons do in fact apply to us today, and that is what has lead me to the sense of impending doom. I'm not at all convinced that we will \\"wake up\\" in time. Yet, perhaps, if enough people read this book and go to Gore's documentary on global warming, we will be able to figure out next steps to cleaning things up. What we need to do, and to stop doing, becomes very obvious when you read this compelling analysis - the trick will be to make it happen. If you believe that the book is too dense and too long (I admit to feeling that way as I got started), then I suggest going to Chapter 16 and begin there. As you read that chapter, you will perhaps find yourself wanting more details about the summary of failed societies. You can then go back and pick the specific societies that are of interest.
B0000013GT|5.0|\\"Greetings Earthling\\".... From the first words spoken after the melodic introduction you are instantly aware that what you are about to experience is unlike anything your ears have ever heard. Speakerboxxx/The Love Below may have made Big Boi and Dre a household name, but the true heads will allways remember them as just \\"Two Dope Boyz in a Cadillac\\". 10 years after it's release, the impact of this album is more powerfull when you take into account the fact that we may never again hear these two men rapping together on a track. Emotional, groundbraking, heartfelt and powerfull. I could write pages crammed full of adjectives and quotes, yet words cannot compare to the pure visceral journey that is this album. ATLiens is unlike a modern rap record; no skits, no filler, just pure, raw, unadulterated hip-hop. You cannot consider yourself a fan of genre without this in your collection. One almost cannnot blame Andre 3000 for putting down the mic, when you realize that everything that can be said with the genre, he already did 10 years ago. Outkast may have three other classic hip hop albums; Southernplayalistic, Aquemeni, and Stankonia, but this is the one. In the 90's the West had The Chronic, and the East had 36 Chambers, but it was the South who produced the greatest hip-hop album of all time. Pop this in, turn off the lights and listen from start to finish if you don't believe me.
1401302378|4.0|The Editor of 'Wired' has a brilliant and novel concept in 'The Long Tail,' which basically sums up the future of commerce when the Internet matches its potential. Citing modern success stories that made it through the dot com bust like Google, Netflix, and Amazon, Anderson shows how these companies with a new business model--that of the long tail--market a little niche item to a lot of people and are more successful than the traditional bricks and mortar retailers. The long tail is Anderson's theory that explains how the big hits that we know of are in the past. We've seen it in TV: the top television show last year wouldn't even have made it in the top ten in the '70s. We've seen it in music: endless niche genres are outselling popular music. And we've seen it in books: Amazon has millions of titles, while your local bookstore can only carry a few thousand.<br /><br />We are truly entering a new age in our economy and this type of book helps us grasp what's going on. However, the book is a little long-winded. It started out as an article in 'Wired' and might have been just as well to stay as an article. Anderson starts to repeat himself about half way through. An idea I would like to be further developed is the democratization of popular culture. I could see the long tail promoting good music, for instance, and taking the power of who's heard from the suits in A&R to the fan at home on the Internet.

B00005B4GU|5.0|Having seen the band twice on the summer 06 tour, I was struck by how moving the Amnesiac songs were live. While OK Computer's emotionally charged 21st-century ballads and Kid A's movement into electronica each makes an effect in their respective ways, the Amnesiac songs had a hushed and muted but remarkably intense emotional impact.  <br /> <br />It caused me to re-engage with this album in a way I'd not done previously. <br /> <br />\\"Pyramid Song\\" is a perfect example - haunting, metaphysical, beautifully lyrical and at the same time somewhat bleak. Hearing the chords of this song alone, with its near jazz-like arrangement, evokes our time and place in way few songs of any genre do. <br /> <br />If you have put this one away I would dust it off and bring it out again. It's one that will live with you for a long time.

One stays behind, buffing on a cigar, his red shirt bulging with the owners massive, well developed muscle.<br /><br />Arnold.<br /><br />Predator is a nuclear bomb in muscle man action flicks, in more ways then one, wink, wink. Arnold plays Dutch a hard-boiled special ops warrior that dislikes black ops that require extensive killing yet he can't seem to avoid getting into those situations.<br /><br />An old buddy turned CIA desk jockey hooks Dutch into an operation the immediately smells fishy. Soon Dutch and his team of heavily armed and heavily muscle commandos are lurching through a thick Central American jungle.  Something is stocking them. They don't now what, but they night just be paranoid. But there sables get rattled when they find the horribly mutilated corpse of several Green Berets, skinned alive. Dutch's team thinks its guerillas, but the teams tracker is worried, and with good reason, he can't find a single trace of whatever enemy it was.<br /><br />After a massive and bloody fire fight filled with lots of blood, bullets and really nasty guns that would never be used by commandos like the General Electric Minim Gun. A shapeless form leaps out of the bushes and quite literally rips the face off one of the commandos and zaps a second commando with weapon so powerful it completely burns out his chest cavity, a third commando sees his fellow solider fall to the ground and rushes over to his friends smoking body, he looks up, in complete disbelief, see...<br /><br />See what? There's an outline of something tall and not friendly.<br /><br />\\"CONTAAACT!\\" Bang bang, bang, bang, after a full minute of non-stop shooting there is nothing standing, but there isn't a single body, except for a strange glowing stain on some leafs.<br /><br />This strange hunter is peeking them off one by one, soon Arnold is on his own and is face to face with a creature that looks like an over dressed space Indian.<br /><br />Predator is one of several double digit IQ muscle movies that has no story, just lots of guns, cussing and blood. But it's good. It was well made and has great effects that still hold up today. Stan Winston's creature design helped made this movie amazing. The popularity of this film spawned a sequel and it even merged with the Alien franchise.<br /><br />However the special edition DVD is not really that impressive, it was released in the UK nearly a full year ahead of the US release. Director John McTiernan gives a commentary in the same manner a man trying to remember a rock concert in a drug induce haze usually with lots of mumbling.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Although Alan Moore is regarded as one of the giants of the graphic novel, he has not been well served on film.  FROM HELL was a bit of a disappointment given the talent involved in the project, while THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was simply a horror.  Until last year Moore's fellow great Frank Miller had suffered much the same fate, but 2005 should have seen the release of a great version of Miller's SIN CITY and Moore's V FOR VENDETTA.  But the subway bombings in London made the studio postpone the original November 5 release date until 2006.  Now that there is a great film version of a Moore classic, the big question is whether anyone will be able to do the same thing with the greatest of all graphic novels, Moore's THE WATCHMEN.  I pray that they won't, that they will realize to do a mini-series instead.  It is simply too complex a work not to receive the longer treatment.<br /><br />This is not merely one of the best film versions of a famous graphic novel; it is one of the finest political films of recent years.  The original political context for the novel was Margaret Thatcher's policies and the attitudes surrounding them in the 1980s.  The politics here have been updated somewhat.  Though Thatcher's policies--especially in regard to immigrants and non-whites--struck many as mildly fascist, a host of the policies and actions of George W. Bush and the Religious Right in America have impressed many as even more so.  I don't want to say that the United States is in danger of becoming a fascist state, but I will say that the kind of world envisioned by the Christian Dominionists and Reconstructionists bear startling similarities to the vision of the Nazis, only with God inserted into the center of things instead of the German people (and I write this as a Christian who is frightened by the implications of the political beliefs of some of my brethren).  If V FOR VENDETTA the novel was about the world that Thatcher's England could create if allowed to evolve unchecked, V FOR VENDETTA is a warning of where policies similar to George Bush's could take us.  The parallels are implicit throughout the film, but made explicit in a scene in which Evey is taken into the basement of Stephen Fry's character.  There they see a large poster containing a swastika along with Bush's phrase \\"The coalition of the willing,\\" a blatant linking of Bush with fascism.  Furthermore, the persecution of homosexuals in the film is intended to recall the Bush administration's playing off the fear and hatred many in the religious right have for gays and lesbians.  And Prothero will remind any viewer of Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh.  And frequent mention is made of the way the fascist government has redefined words, much as the Bush administration has.  All of these elements have been subtly adapted from the novel to make them more relevant to the present situation.  (If you haven't read the novel, I strongly recommend it, but at the very least one should if in a bookstore pick up the book and read Moore's preface, where he expresses dismay over Thatcher.)<br /><br />But what if you like Bush?  Can you enjoy the movie anyway?  I think one can easily watch it and ignore the political context and have the time of one's life.  And thirty years from now people who weren't born when Bush was president would be able to enjoy it without understanding the context.  Alan Moore's mysterious V is one of the most compelling heroes of the past couple of decades, a moral anarchist in William Godwin's original sense.  He begins the film a complete mystery, a man not only without a face but without any apparent context.  The film as a whole is simultaneously constructed as a revenge narrative, as V deliberately destroys the entire system that made his creation possible, and a mystery tale, as Inspector Finch, played wonderfully by Stephen Rea, gradually unravels the cipher that is V.  There are some wonderful action sequences, but they are never allowed to obscure the fact that this is more a movie about ideas.  In many films the main point seems to be the action, with the ideas merely tacked on, but here the ideas are never less than paramount.<br /><br />I liked just about everything about this film.  Hugo Weaving was superb as V.  One of the things I most enjoyed about the Matrix films was listening to Weaving's Agent Smith converse with Neo, not so much what he said as the way he said it.  Because he spends the entire movie behind a mask, here we have to focus entirely on his voice.  Given the mask, it is amazing that he was able to pull it off.  I loved the look of V's outfit.  The design of his costume and map are very faithful to David Lloyd's original artwork.  The cast was very strong.  I've mentioned Weaving and Rea, but for a political fantasy concerning the future a la Orwell, this has a wonderful assemblage of talent, with fine actors like Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Piggott-Smith, and Rupert Graves.  I very much liked Natalie Portman as Evey.  When I first heard that she was in the film I was mildly alarmed.  She bears little resemblance to Evey in the novel, but my fears were misplaced.  She is such an intelligent actress and this comes out throughout her work.<br /><br />It does depart from the novel at several points, but all in all I thought the adaptation remarkably faithful to the book.  I was disappointed that one bit was left out.  Shortly before he dies, V asks Evey to give him a Viking funeral, and she does, by sending him on the train underneath the parliament buildings.  It would have been easy to include those lines and would have required nothing additional.  I think the film is lesser for lacking those lines.  One could also debate the ending, since in the novel Evey takes on the persona of V, even donning his costume to continue his work.<br /><br />All in all, this is a highly entertaining film that I can urge anyone to watch.  It is one of those rare films that manage to combine both riveting action sequences with political commentary.obscure the fact that this is more a movie about ideas.  In many films the main point seems to be the action, with the ideas merely tacked on, but here the ideas are never less than paramount. <br /> <br />I liked just about everything about this film.

She is such an intelligent actress and this comes out throughout her work.   <br /> <br />It does depart from the novel at several points, but all in all I thought the adaptation remarkably faithful to the book.  I was disappointed that one bit was left out.  Shortly before he dies, V asks Evey to give him a Viking funeral, and she does, by sending him on the train underneath the parliament buildings.  It would have been easy to include those lines and would have required nothing additional.  I think the film is lesser for lacking those lines.  One could also debate the ending, since in the novel Evey takes on the persona of V, even donning his costume to continue his work.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is a highly entertaining film that I can urge anyone to watch.  It is one of those rare films that manage to combine both riveting action sequences with political commentary.
B000FIMG68|5.0|It's soooo hard to watch just any other TV show and actually take it seriously now that Lost has set the bar extremely high for television.  Lost Season 2 remains compelling, gripping, and fun.  A highly advanced TV show and one of a kind (with the exception of Alias).  Although I do admit that I think the writers and editors did a better job during the first season, Lost S2 is still better than pretty much any other show you'll watch (again, besides Alias).  Watching it on DVD in particular should make the show much more enjoyable and understandable.    With no commercials, you're able to watch Lost at your own pace.  During Lost Season 2 we see; <br /> <br />- The castaways encounter \\"the others\\" more frequently <br />- The hatch being used <br />- The introduction of Dharma <br />- Some new characters - whose loyalties are unknown <br /> <br />And don't worry, there are still plenty of clifhangers making you so hungry for more Lost you might eat your TV.  If you already watched Lost on TV this year, get the DVDs and watch it again!  If you've never seen Lost, get Season 1 first, and then Season 2.   <br /> <br />(If you're also looking for a show you've never seen, but heard is good, rent or buy Alias Season 1 and 2.  Amazing show, I can't decide what's better, Lost or Alias.  But I think Alias actually wins....)
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Although the English landscapes are beautifully portrayed, this film itself falls short of its ambitions. Elizabeth Bennet is Jane Austen's most popular heroine, and to see her portrayed so tackily is a shame. The saccharine romantics will still gush over the script that mimics Austen's story, but more discriminating viewers will not appreciate the liberties taken with the novel.  <br /> <br />Elizabeth Bennet is an intelligent woman and an astute observer of social refinements. In the novel, one is never embarrassed by her--instead, one is embarrassed on her behalf because of the indiscretions of her mother, sisters, and sometimes even father. However, in the movie, she too closely resembles her mother and Lydia, the gross embarrassments of the family and community. Where is the elevation between the two sisters? In the novel, Lydia's character is grossly ignorant of propriety, and is written that way for a reason: to show how intelligent and refined Elizabeth is, despite low family connections or lack of wealth. To see Elizabeth brought nearer Lydia's level is unforgiveable, and the movie, regardless of how beautifully filmed cannot recover from it.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|There are a decent number of medeival style movies out there and some are pretty darned good.  Well, this is certainly one of them and the Directors cut is the correct version to watch and/or own since the theatrical version is mediocre at best. <br /> <br />The D-Cut adds a solid amount of character development and really sets the stage for why people act the way they do and this is important in any movie but especially so in such a grand epic tale.  The added scenes/footage were both neccessary and very well edited as if they were there the whole time. I really enjoyed the extra time given to the prevalent back-stories and setups.  Props to Ridley Scott on this version. <br /> <br />The storyline is very well done and doesnt have any major holes in it. Balian DOES become a rather good swordsman after just a few lessons but that doesn't mean that the movie is bad. Otherwise, he is very believable and you do actually care about his fortunes as the film goes on. He is trying to do the right thing and is facing resistence all around him.... its a very tough situation to be in and he handles it pretty well.  I wouldnt say he is William Wallace material or anything, but he gets the job done.  Ed Nortons unaccredited role as the King with Leprocy is fantastic and I really felt for this guy...he had dreams and big plans for life but they will be cut short due to his disease. He takes it VERY well and this makes you care even more. Gassan Massoud(sp?) who played Saladin was terrific and quite convincing as a master leader and motivator with a heart. Very well casted and played! <br /> <br />The princess Sybollah(sp?) gets a lot more back-story and it helps a lot since in the theatrical cut she just shows up out of nowhere and starts sleeping with Balian.... I mean what the frick?  Now, I know her \\"deal\\" and appreciate her much more. Eva Green's preformance was OK, not the best but not terrible either. <br /> <br />The rest of the cast was solid and did themselves well.  This was pretty well acted movie with good characters and character development. <br /> <br />I would have liked to have seen more in-depth battle scenes with fewer cutaways and stoppages.  Some of the battles start great and then abruptly end and you just wish there was more footage of it. The siege of Jerusalem was one of the coolest things I have ever seen but even it was too short and left me a little empty. I LIKE battles and so do many other viewers of these kinds of movies. If Ridley would have only added a little more battle footage this film would have got a my 5-star rating. There was also a contrived swordfight at the end of the film that didnt need to be there. Otherwise this film is damned good! <br /> <br />HIGHLY Recommended but ONLY the Directors cut!
B00003CXA6|5.0|One of the best Civil War movies ever made. Great on VHS and excellent on DVD
B000FGGE68|2.0|Early on in \\"Ultraviolet\\" there is a section of exposition that goes on and on, and I knew right then and there that this 2006 film written and directed by Kurt Wimmer (\\"Equilibrium\\"), was in big trouble. When you get to the point where you feel you need to be taking notes, it is just not a good sign. Not that the situation is all that confusing, to wit: in the future the human race is divided into normal humans and the Hemophages, who have a blood disease that makes them like vampires. Actually, it is more like they are called vampires, but if you are looking for this to matter in some significant way you will be disappointed. Incisors grow a bit longer and Violet Song ja Shariff (Milla Jovovich) comes back from the dead without exactly rising from the grave, and that is about it.<br /><br />Violet is sent off by her side to destroy a secret weapon which is in a case that she is repeatedly and emphatically told not to open, thereby guaranteeing that she will open it, not destroy it, and put herself in the middle of everything so that everybody will want to see her dead. Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus (Nick Chinlund) is the main villain, which means that when he and Violet finally get around to fighting with flaming swords we are just about at the end of the film. In between she basically kills everybody who tries to stop her from whatever she happens to be doing. Most of the action is decidedly uninspiring, but there are a few quick bits that will shake you from you lethargy and give you a brief moment of hope that things are looking up for this film.<br /><br />In terms of what category \\"Ultraviolet\\" ends up in, I would say that is definitely more of a comic book movie than a computer game movie. At first I thought it was obviously trying to be the latter, but there are just way too many shots and scenes that are clearly in keeping with the comic book approach to seeing the universe. Besides, the fight sequences with Violet usually tend to be quick and to the point, which is not the point of dispatching people in most computer games. If anything the violence is in keeping with Asian cinema. . The one thing I am sure of is that this film does not come close to taking from the best of any of these schools of influence. It has been a long time since I have been so easily bored by a science fiction film. Before Wimmer indulged in computer animated overkill, he should have come up with a much better plot to justify the time and the expense.point, which is not the point of dispatching people in most computer games.

1593083653|5.0|Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her, no matter what she does. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece.ray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.  <br /> <br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her, no matter what she does.

B000669GAI|5.0|This 2 disc collection is absolutely awesome. I was a HUGE PJ fan in the early 90's when they burst on the scene, but as I got older I drifted away from them. I've recently rediscovered them and wow, what a set! My favorite PJ tunes are here, and they flow great. Yellow Ledbetter, Alive, Even Flow, Dissident, Black to name a few.  I'm listening to it now as I write this review, and feeling rather nostalgic. Some great times with Pearl Jam as part of the soundtrack! <br /> <br />This is a great collection of some of Pearl Jam's best work. Whether you've never heard of them or a die hard fan, this is a great addition to your collection
B00004UEDQ|2.0|Sandra Bullock plays a reckless woman, supposedly a writer, although this was only mentioned once in passing, who, along with her British boyfriend is constantly boozing and partying it up. She also seems to be hooked on painkillers. After ruining her sister's wedding, then stealing a limosene and drunkenly crashing it into a house, she (although this is not shown in the film), is sentenced to 28 days in rehab as an alternative to jail. In rehab, she meets some interesting characters with various addictions, and eventually starts to own up to her problems and begin her recovery.<br /><br />The rehab characters, who each curiously show us about 30 seconds of insight, seem promising, but what we learn about them is vague. The lame chanting in the rehab center is silly, in that it is never explained why people buy into it so readily. At times the film played like an educational video about the dangers of alcohol/drug addiction, but even falls short there, as the center clearly is lacking in addressing some areas of treatment. Some performances are decent, while others are not so good. What happens after the 28 days are up, are we to simply assume what her life is going to be like? The film seemed better suited as a TV movie, really..<br /><br />I could keep nitpicking, but I think you get the idea. Although it kept me interested, I was not exactly entertained, as the trailer hinted that this was to be an entertaining film. I was pretty much disappointed by it

B000F9RB9Y|4.0|This is the fifth title I have seen in Blu-ray, and it is the weakest.  I think it is due to the condition of the original master.  There is much grain throughout.  Black tones could be darker, colors should be more vibrant.  The disc freezes for a second as Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese arrive at the Tiki Motel, and the audio drops out for a second during their love scene.  I think this is also a mastering problem and not a result of the Samsung BD-P1000 (the only Blu-ray disc player currently on the market).  The rest of the audio is top notch.  Probably the best this film has ever sounded.  I was able to pick up background noise and nuances I never heard on VHS, Laserdisc, or standard DVD.   All in all, it is a modest transfer.  But I remember that some of the first DVD's didn't look so hot.   Maybe a re-issue of this title later on will fix any transfer issues.
0679422714|3.0|i like many other reviewers here thought this book was interesting at first, but, soon got very redundant i.e. telling how the chinese people suffered, starved, were tortured, over worked, and over taxed; how moa betrayed his friends and used everyone around him for his own purposes, including whole armies; how moa and his few cronies were living in relative luxury.  one could start skimming these areas as i did and derive a good summary of how he did it. however, taking out the redundant areas the book cold be about 300 pages and not 600?
B0002OXVDW|5.0|For anyone who loves MGM musicals or Hollywood during its golden days, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION is a must. It contains the three installments of the THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT series: the first that celebrates MGM's 50th anniversary, the follow up which is more of the first in a less formal manner, and the third which contains personal stories from the stars that can at times stain the veneer but also makes it an interesting DVD. The complete collection also has a bonus DVD which tells of the people behind the scenes, namely the geniuses like Stanley Donen, Saul Chaplin, Betty Comden, Arthur Freed, et al who made the MGM musicals the spectacular entertainment that has captivated people for years. I've watched all four DVD's quite a few times, and each time I do so, I see something different or learn something new.<br /><br />For those who would like more detailed summaries, I have reviewed THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT PART 2, and THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT III in detail and can be viewed by clicking individual films.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy!!!

B00009L1UP|4.0|If you already read my reviews you've probably seen I reviewed Mindcrime before this, but this is my first real Ryche album. When I first heard it I wasn't blown away. But now that I'm a huge Ryche fan I've decided to give this CD another shot and now I really like it. Although this is not as great as the phenomenal Operation: Mindcrime which by far I consider to be their best album and one of the best albums mever made by anyone, or even as Rage For Order this comes after those 2 as their 3rd best album in my book.  <br /> <br />First off they didn't sell out here, they have just changed their sound. C'mon now, do you want them to make 20 copies of RFO with different titles? So they have here a few love ballads, it doesn't make this hair metal. The sound here is still great and as a matter of fact this is the last great Ryche album since everything without DeGarmo [stunk] and even Promised Land wasn't that great either. The keyboards here are a bit more prominent than in the previous stuff. Geoff still shows here why he's one of the best metal singers. Mike Wilton and Chris DeGarmo also did here a fine job, and maybe in some moments even better than in Mindcrime. Although this is still not very technical (Ryche has never gone in that way) but there is still a lotta great melody here. <br /> <br />Now to the songs. The album opens with a killer opener and with my favorite song on the album 'Best I Can', it starts with a weird intro but then it becomes awesome with an amazing chorus and it has also a great guitar solo. 'Jet City Woman' is another fan favorite and the biggest hit of the album. The title track and 'Anybody Listening?' are also great. As I said before there are also som ballads here like 'Another Rainy Night (Without You)'. All the tracks here are good, although I never really cared for 'Della Brown' and 'Silent Lucidity', but they're not horrible.   <br /> <br />All in all though, this is another great performances by one of the finest metal bands. Andit also shows that even if they go a bit mainstream they can still be very good (which is rare for a metal band, the only other metal band I can think that has done it is Megadeth). I would first recommend Mindcrime but if you're a fan already this is also a must have classic.
B000FA57RG|5.0|How many musical performers can you name that have been in show business for almost a quarter century, can still sell out a concert at top dollar, and do it in record time? There are only a handful, and one of them is the always changing, rearranging Madonna. Since the Michigan-born performer was first heard in the clubs, on the radio, seen on MTV, movie screens and became a household name in 1983, she has been racking up gold and platinum albums, and selling out one venue after another with her unique extravaganzas that always push the envelope. Love her or hate her, there's no gray area with Lady Madge and her mind-blowing catalogue of 36 #1 dance songs. And for the most part, this is what this CD is all about - the dance - and as Madonna famously sings, \\"It's called the dancefloor and here's what it's for.\\" Fourteen tracks comprise this disc with radio and club hits including \\"Vogue,\\" \\"Like A Prayer,\\" a powerful version of \\"Susan MacLeod/Into The Groove,\\" the James Bond theme \\"Die Another Day,\\" the universal \\"Music,\\" the song that put her on the map, \\"Holiday,\\" and a smashing demo version of \\"I Love New York\\" from her latest studio album, Confessions On A Dancefloor. The biggest surprise for me was her incredibly moving version of the John Lennon staple \\"Imagine.\\" If you ever thought Madonna's vocals could use some anti-freeze, this rendition that prays for hope, peace and love will thaw out any preconceived notions you may have ever carried about her. I'm not typically a fan of live albums, but every so often a performer comes along and surprises me with versions of their songs that sometimes leapfrog the originals. I'm not saying every single song on this disc does that, but for the most part, I found this CD to be pleasantly shocking. But isn't that word synonymous with her Madge-estry anyway? The one thing that has always enhanced the sound of Madonna is the sight of Madonna. This is where the always-thinking Marketability Girl comes in with a DVD companion of her live stage performances of ten songs. All the songs listed on the companion CD are here with the exception of two songs from \\"Confessions,\\" \\"Into The Groove\\" and \\"Die Another Day.\\" But don't despair, the visuals are so incredible, she'll make you forget there's a record bin of songs that aren't included. For that, I suggest you take a peek into her back catalogue and realize this is her best live performance on video since her \\"Blonde Ambition Tour\\" 15 years ago. Yes, Madonna is almost 48 years old, but judging from this collection, she makes looking towards the future a bit brighter, while dreading your subscription offer from AARP.f her live stage performances of ten songs.

Not only has it been a pleasure to read, but by surrounding myself in a focused \\"study\\" of Moss's dream theory/reality, I've immersed my subconscious in the task at hand - to dream Big dreams and to get much more out of my sleeping states beyond pleasant fancies. <br /> <br />Completely renewed my sense of spirituality. It doesn't matter what your religious orientation (including atheism) is, this book has the power to inviggorate the spirit and make sense of much more than your nightly hours if you let it. <br /> <br />One of the best books I've ever read.

B000CCD0HQ|4.0|Finally!  My favourite Top album is available on CD.  I've been using a vinyl LP transfer to avoid that infamous remix for years! <br /> <br />But what a shame.  If this original LP mix had been released about 1990 like it should of it would have been near perfect. <br /> <br />Because this is 2006 and we've had the \\"Loudness Wars\\" (go look it up on the web), even a \\"remaster\\" that you would expect to be as perfect as a CD could be has had THE treatment.  Yes, a volume maximizer has been used to remaster this disc (and the Fandango remaster too). <br /> <br />To be fair to Bob Ludwig it has been done gently.  Direct comparison with the vinyl would be required to spot it by listening alone.  But it has been done, so I cannot give this 5 stars.  And while maximizing has been done, no effort to correct big tape drop-outs like the one in Precious and Grace has been made.  Tape drop-outs preserved, dynamic range stomped - why? <br /> <br />The music on this disc is nothing like Eliminator, or even the quirky El Loco.  It's a mixture of Texas blues, gospel and hard rock.  And even when I don't like what they're singing, I love the sound of the singing and the music. <br /> <br />Free of the revolting super-reverb drumming of the remix, it all really shines.  The songs are all short and punchy. <br /> <br />If you want 1970's ZZ Top, I would suggest this one first. <br /> <br />While I'll take the bonus tracks, I can't help thinking they would be better compiled into a ZZ Top live album than drip fed on the remasters.  One thing about the live tracks - because ZZ are a three piece, they sure show clearly the amount a multi-tracking the studio tracks have!

B00082IJ08|5.0|..........and was blown away by it.  This band to me was all about \\"Clint Eastwood\\". I'd heard the whole CD and was sort of into it. It was a little too heavy on the hip hop side, so I thought I knew all about what the band was.  WRONG!  The concert, first and foremost, made me see a whole new side to the group. There were strong musical, rhythmic, and lastly melodic stuff in here. And despite the darkness of the lyrics (of some of the tunes, not to mention the mood of the animation being pretty dark), there was an overall joy to the proceedings. During both Dirty Harry and Demon Days, a \\" musical conductor\\" was giving a \\"gospel bounce\\" in time to the music.  Kind of makes you want to dance. Me, anyway.  And there was a bit of humor, as puppets 2D and Murdoc were throwing popcorn on the audience from the balcony.  So I buy the CD first.  This thing has it all. Sparse mood music, trip hop, an almost gospel feel, light rock, and rock rap. Sometimes in the same song.  The melodies are VERY strong, the rhythms move (tell me you don't want to \\"snake\\" to \\"Dirty Harry\\"), and the band rocks, even on the more trippy tunes.   I'd advise not only the CD, but also the DVD at the same time.  It's just that good.

0553582461|5.0|Robin Hobb is, simply put, the best fantasy writer I have read in a long time.  She manages to create an utterly original series in a genre known for its cliche plotlines, and the the Fitz and the Fool are two of the best characters ever created.  Whenever I try to explain why I have such a passionate love affair with these books, I end up in in a muddle of nonsensical explanations.  Hobb is a writer that has to be experienced to be fully appreciated.

0385504209|2.0|I'm quite sure you're sick of them. It seems that every person out there has something to say about this book. And many of them tries to sell it by writing numerous \\"Secrets of Da Vinci code decoded\\" or whatnot titles just for sake of making money and more money.<br /><br />If someone were to count all the merchandise sold in the name of this book, one ould count up to a sum so large that he would be forced to ask himself who pulled so large a marketing campaign for something that is maybe one of the worst books ever written?<br /><br />It has been a long time for me since I heard about this book and actual time of reading it. I tend to avoid bestsellers, mainly because they aren't nearly as cranked up as people say they are. Mostly they are just another piece of words put together in some kind of random pattern that produces yet another kill, yet another mystery that has to be solved by a brilliant and strong women, or myterious and chamring, warrior/poet male type. Basically, it is the same thing with Da Vinci code.<br /><br />There is great ammount of art historians, religion historians, archaeologist who kick themselves hard upon if someone mentions this book in their vicinity. Many of them will refuse to read it for reason that has become quite obviuos in years since its first oublication. So I will not talk about that. Where this book fails  most is your basic character creation, dialogue, and narative. Small matter, don't you think? If you were to strip all artistic and historic half truths you would be left with your average \\"thriller\\" for one afternoon, kind of which can be written by every wannabe writer that learned his alphabeth in Elementary school. So it remains quite mystery to me, the fact that so much words have been spilled on this book.<br /><br />I won't bother you any more, my advice is simple. This in not the book that will help you uncover any kind of \\"truth\\" (and many people think it will). Truth is, thanks heavens, far more hidden and works in precise artistic way that takes at least one lieftime to find and solve. If you are looking for \\"mystery\\" or \\"thriller\\" book that will keep you occupied for one or two afternoons, this isn't so bad a choice. But when one chooses, one should always aim for the greater. And there are far greater books than this one. And it really takes no skill in finding them.d works in precise artistic way that takes at least one lieftime to find and solve.

B000002BE9|5.0|I will get straight to the point. Tidal is a masterpiece, classic and timeless. Without hearing it, it's hard to describe just how deep the imagery is within this album. I first bought this, at the age of 15, and since then, it's meaning has only strengthend. On tidal you're not just listening to a C.D, by another deep, confused white teenage girl. I'd go as far as saying you're looking into someone's soul. Apple's soul being an extreamly wounded one. Raped at the age of 12, she penned most of these songs in her bedroom, just note-pad and piano. Her songs take the listener on journeys of feeling misunderstood, rejected, guilty, and tempted. Apple's voice is soft, and yet absolutley burning with passion and pain through-out the entire album. A personnal favourite would be 'Slow Like Honey' in which she sings, ''It's my big secret, keeping you comming''. There is an endearing mystery about her sadness, and her wisdom. <br />         A lot of critics at the time slammed young fiona for being pretencious, labled her as a second-rate alanis/jewel and totally missed out on her incredible talent. Her age probably was a turn off for some, but as a depressed young woman I found it a comfort. The opening track is also a favourite of mine, titled ''Sleep to dream''. She starts off by snarling ''I tell you how I feel, but you don't care and I say tell me the truth ,but you don't dare''. This is what I love about fiona, her ability to be proud, angry, down-right frustrated, AND vulnerable at the same time. She is totally unapoligetic for anything she feels. It's her pain, her party. <br />       I think everybody remembers the dodgy criminal video, when they think of the name 'fiona apple' but that really shouldnt put you off buying this album. It is without a doubt, one of my all time favourites. Tracks such as Sullen girl, Never is a promise and The child is gone will bring you to tears. She explores feelings of isolation, growth, and leaving behind what you grow out of. Musically, there is an oceane-theme on Tidal (non suprisingly). The piano sounds beautiful from track one right to the end, gentle on some, and jazz-like on others. One track that really does stand out is ''The first taste'', an amazing track that takes you into the depths of lust, and desire. <br />        All in all, Tidal is extreamly dark. I prefer to listen to it during the winter, and especially when I'm willowing. This album is for anybody who's looking for the strength to reach for something, or someone. I give it 10/10.

B000BTJDGC|2.0|Impressive, how a film can fail in so many ways. As a dramatization of the actual story The Exorcism of Emily Rose fails because of the many liberties it takes with the case of Anneliese Michel (no wonder the extra featurettes tell us nothing about it). Had the makers chosen a more objective approach, a great psychodrama might have resulted. But no, they wanted a horror movie. Unfortunately, as a horror film this is slow, unexciting and not in the least bit scary (the fact that the setting is a meteorological freak world of perennial thunderstorms does not change that; nor, for that matter, does the tiresomely overwrought musical score, which avoids not a single staple of the genre). As a courtroom drama The Exorcism of ER is utterly soporific. And as a supposed challenge to your own (dis)beliefs, it is simply too insipid: the workings of the supernatural as depicted here are (as per usual) too childish, silly and inane to leave any impression at all. It is the same tired old collection of scary faces, perambulating objects, clocks that malfunction at a specific time, uncouth noises down the hallway, fleeting shadows, speaking in tongues, contortionism, and lots of screaming (no vomiting or sexual aberrations though - Emily Rose's demons, unlike the one inhabiting Regan Macneil, were apparently decently house-trained). Why anybody would be scared to death of such innocuous events is beyond me, yet here, for some reason, they reduce grown up men to whimpering idiots. I'm sure if Lucifer did exist, we could trust him to opt for something more spectacular than behaving like a toddler in need of a stern nanny (and I'm sure he would be less particular about the time of day, far above handling household objects, and completely uninterested in non-entity small-town girls).<br /><br />Top it all off with acting that never rises above soap opera level, and with a plot full of loose ends and unaswered questions, and you end up with something eminently forgettable. The characters we meet have about as much substance as the demons they fight. Emily's boyfriend Jason waxes lyrical over his love for the girl - it must be motivated by a peculiar brand of masochism, for all we see of their relationship is him trying to disentangle her limbs after she has once again dropped to the floor, shrieking, in some feat of demonic acrobatics.<br /><br />But the main problem is that though this film pretends to want to make you think about the possibility of demonic possession and, as the makers mendaciously maintain in the \\"Genesis of\\" featurette, therefore eschews clear conclusions, the story has in fact been manipulated in such a way as to hammer it home that the possession was real. The script writers did not have the guts to remain neutral, they took sides. The attorney for the prosecution is the bad guy right from the start; the doctors offering sound psychiatric explanations of the phenomena are depicted as arrogant and narrow-minded twits; and the expert witness for the defense, against whom the prosecution hilariously but quite rightly objects on grounds of \\"silliness\\", is presented as an exotic fount of wisdom. In the middle of all this the priest who's at the core of the proceedings remains a somewhat oafish presence with all the charisma of a bag of potatoes - his greatest moment comes when during the exorcism he hysterically wards of an attack by the house cat. At least that made me laugh.<br /><br />It is not impossible to make an intelligent film that raises deep questions about matters of fact and belief; it is even possible to do so without gratuitously insulting science and actively promoting superstition and gullibility: watch Contact, and you'll see. The Exorcism of Emily Rose, on the other hand, is a film that is bad in many ways, and in some respects more evil than the supposed demons haunting its heroine.cters we meet have about as much substance as the demons they fight.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|Live at Pompeii is still my favorite release on dvd format. It is a combination of a studio rendition of various early recordings. The cinema photography is award winning substance. The background, the panning,and closeups are very well done. The meshing of the music and the collaberation of the band is aspiring. In addition to the visual,the audio, is clear and crisp and well restored. As much as I enjoyed the dvd release of Pulse, I still enjoy this early release of Pompeii even more. 5 Stars is not enough.
B00007KQA3|2.0|I should say first that this should be a good movie, at least on paper.  John Hurt and Richard Burton turn in solid performances, and everything about the production -- set design, costumes, etc. -- looks just as it should.  But there is something lacking in this adaptation that makes it pale compared to the book. <br /> <br />Orwell's _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ was, largely, _about_ reading and writing, and the power they give to people.  As such, it is a thrilling novel, and a great pleasure to read.  Seeing John Hurt writing in Winston Smith's diary doesn't quite cut it for me; the essential spirit is lost in the translation to film. <br /> <br />Beyond this, there are also some more mundane elements of the plot and characters that were cut to fit the screening time.  What I missed most was Smith's growing frustration with Julia being \\"only a revolutionary from the waist down\\" and his schoolboyish admiration (affection, really) for O'Brien. <br /> <br />The only real highlight of the movie is the constant voiceovers coming from the telescreens regarding the progress of the war and the rooting out of traitors.  Orwell's vision is captured perfectly here, and the woman who read the \\"news\\" voiceovers gets the tone exactly right. <br /> <br />All in all, the movie is nowhere nearly as compelling as the book, and isn't really worth the trouble.  In the time it takes you to procure and watch the movie, you could be halfway through the book.
0142001104|5.0|what an inspiring book!  it effectively accesses and pulls out truths within us.  it motivated me to work on my self and how i deal with people and approach my work and family.  i liked the book so much that i bought a copy for everyone in my office.  written by a couple, she is a consultant and social worker while he is an orchestra conductor.  they might, at first glance, not seem like the most logical duo for corporate or organizational development.  but, the art of self growth and leadership crosses fields.  this is an outstanding book that i recommend to those committed to thinking, growing, and improving.  well worth the purchase price!
1401302378|3.0|This is an important book, and its also an easy read.  It's a must-read for anyone who works in media, retail (whether physiscal or e-commerce), or supply chain management, or who thinks they might do so some day.  I would also recommend it to general audiences.  <br /> <br />I cannot give it a higher rating because of the following quibbles with Anderson's writing and ideas: <br /> <br />1)  Anderson's writing still reads like magazine journalism (it especially betrays his time at _The Economist_), and therefore doesn't \\"stretch\\" very well into book-length material.  The repetion and upbeat, example-laden style do a disservice, in that they encourage skimming. <br /> <br />2)  In the chapter on \\"The Short Head,\\" Anderson is foolishly optimistic about the \\"abundance\\" of the long tail/e-comm world, going so far as to say that classical economics' central theorem -- that finite resources need to be allocated among infinite wants and needs -- is no longer valid.  But resources are still scarce: if they weren't, Amazon would not charge you any money to deliver a copy of Anderson's book to your house! <br /> <br />3)  Anderson offers a rose-colored description of e-comm \\"filters\\" and the way that they can bring customers from best-sellers into the long tail.  I have had lots of frustrating experiences, for example, with Amazon's recommendations, which tend to push me further down into \\"niches\\" than I want to go, don't always recognize that once you've bought a Penguin Classic you won't be interested in the Everyman Library edition of the same book, and don't make lateral connections between niches that would be obvious to anyone browsing in a physical bookstore.  Similarly, searching for the most current edition of a reference or textbook can be frustrating -- reviews are not carried over from the previous edition, editions that are 10 years out of date may be ranked ahead of the current edition, etc.  (These are the frustrations of someone who has been on the 'Net for 15 years and works with e-commerce technology all the time; how my parents fare on Amazon, I dare not guess.)  I say this not as a condemnation of Amazon's technology, which is constantly (and usefully) evolving, but merely to point out that e-commerce in general is not as user-friendly as Anderson depicts it. <br /> <br />4)  I find the chapter on Wikipedia et. al. as \\"the long tail of content\\" to be the least persuasive; I would have preferred it if Anderson had stuck to his original scope (sales), and not taken a right turn into content creation/product development.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fine book and it deserves the attention it has received.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Superman the movie (1978) is a great movie! A longtime ago, in the late 1970s, the first Superman movie was released!  This is the original movie not the terrible Superman Returns movie by Bryan Singer! Christopher Reeve was the best Superman-ever! Brandon Routh is terrible!  I like this DVD! Superman the Movie has many special features!  Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and the rest make a great superhero movie! A+ Buy it! Highly Recommended!
1594481938|1.0|i have consistantly loved all of hornby's other novels, so i was deeply disappointed and surprised to find a long way down so intensely awful. not only was the plot an utter failure, but the characters were not believable. an original idea went down the entirely wrong path, using the voices of four suicidal individuals with especially drab ways of describing the course of events that make up this storyline, making for an altogether sad attempt at recreating the charisma of hornby's past. if in need of a nick hornby fix, read about a boy or high fidelity again, this one is not even worth a try.
1400032717|2.0|Let me begin by looking at some of the reviews in the front flap... \\"inspiring,\\" \\"brilliant,\\" \\"flawlessly imagined,\\" and \\"a new kind of hero.\\" Can I get a prize for writing a story about an epileptic kid without arms and legs who swims across the English Channel to retrieve his long lost pet butterfly? I think I wrote it before 2003, when Mark Haddon's \\"observant\\" book was released. His is no more than a mass-market paperback thriller, albeit greatly condensed. The whole thing revolves around one gimmick: what type of book would an autistic child write? Apparently, one that gets rave reviews and generates a lot of money.  <br /> <br />The main theme here was hard to miss as it was thrown around in almost every chapter. People, life, and the universe are all like machines and math. I get it already, and I got it by the fifth chapter. Not that I can be sure which chapter it was, because in an innovative, mind-boggling twist, Haddon decided to number the chapters with prime numbers! GREAT! WONDERFUL! Unfortunately, most of us are not savants and can not quickly determine which prime number 109 is.  <br /> <br />One review calls this book \\"plausible.\\" Plausible?! Let me see, doesn't that mean... believable? The situations he finds himself in are ridiculous. According to many online reviews from people with autism or similar problems, Haddon portrays autism very well. Okay, I get that. But so do other books, better books. One shouldn't have to have experienced in real life the same things as a character in a book to be able to appreciate that book. Of course, if you stick around for the last third of the book, the pace quickens, the stakes are raised, and one's heartstrings jiggle a little bit. But just a very little bit.  <br /> <br />I don't see why anyone would be hooked unless they had to read it for school. Flowers for Algernon is much better written, much more coherent, much more plausible, much more touching, and much more \\"innovative.\\" And if you like all the math stuff, don't think Haddon came up with it. Try Watt by Sam Beckett - he uses logic so much better and perfectly in context, unlike the meandering \\"digressions\\" Christopher is aware of but refuses to spare us from. Basically, I wish this had at least been written in third-person instead of by an idea-stealing-Haddon-pretending-to-be-an-autistic-fifteen-year-old. For me, the best part of the book was: \\"I am veined with iron, with silver and with streaks of common mud.\\" <br />

6305882592|5.0|I love this movie so much. I first heard about it while listening to a Henry Rollins spoken word performance (I know so random)when I was in my teens. I went out and rented it right away, and I have watched it about 100 times since then.  I tried to get a copy for years without realizing I could just order it on Amazon.  It's such a sweet touching story.  It's a bit off the wall, but that's of course what I love about it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This was a great transfer to the big screen.  After watching the (too short) series I eagerly anticipated this movie.  I was not disappointed.  Just like all the other fans I would love to see this series resurrected.  However, I have a fear, a fear that this would only cheapen and dilute what we have already known to come and love.  Once the gorram networks get their claws back in the series they will try their best to mold it to their fashion.  And I know none of us want that.  The team came together and did a great job and the intro of Chiwetel as a cold blooded killer was a stroke of genius.  He was scary.  If there is ever another series, we can expect The Operative to be back.
B0000255CL|5.0|I cannot say how great this album really is, this is a new side of Immortal, meaning, more technical, longer songs, longer album length, this album has 6 tracks, but clocks in at 46 minutes, so the songs are kind of epic, great guitars, vocals, drums, and well written songs. <br /> <br />\\"Withstand the Fall of Time\\" Is the opener here, and what an opener, this song features great riffs, clocks in at 8 minutes, amazing song. <br /> <br />\\"Solarfall\\" Is the rawest song on the album, featuring more great riffs, Abbath is a hell of a musician, yes, he plays bass, guitars, synthisizers, and vocals, Horge is on drums. <br /> <br />\\"Tradedies Blows at Horizon\\" while not as strong as the previous 2, still rules, great opening riffs, this song is almost 9 minutes, and really shows the epic side of Immortal. <br /> <br />\\"Where Dark and Light Don't Differ\\" Opens with a great, catchy, heavy riff, then speeds up really nice, they manage to keep it fast, but catchy at the same time. <br /> <br />\\"At The Heart of Winter\\" Opens with a sound effect, then soon a melodic guitar comes in, then the synths come in about a minute later, very cool sounding, then comes in a killer intro riff, heavy as hell, this song has some great leads, all in all, great song. <br /> <br />\\"Years of Silent Sorrow\\" Is the album closer, this is the way you want to close an album, with a great song, this song is pretty fast all the way through, with the occasional groove, nothing wrong with that, killer song. <br /> <br />If you haven't heard Immortal before, and want to get into them, get this album, this is a good one to start with.
0141439807|5.0|As a fairly big Jane Austen fan I came into this masterful novel (after the first fifty pages) expecting a great love story put off by the lowly financial means of the protagonist.  However, the central figure, Fanny, has many qualities that make her an ulikely figure for the role of seductress.  She is quiet, shy, and completely unsure of herself.  She indeed has very few qualities that make the reader expectant that she will be able to marry above her means.  Instead of an enthralling love story I found the novel full of subtle but interesting social commentary and excellent characterization of the protagonist.  While not quite a Pride and Prejudice style page turner, Mansfield Park is worthwhile for its character development and carefully crafted, mature writing.

B000002B35|4.0|I'll keep this review short and simple.  If you like/love Pink Floyd, then you probably like/love Dark Side, and Pink Floyd is great in concert (at least I think so), so to put those together is enough to buy Pulse on its own.  But Pulse offers so much more than that, with other great concert recordings.  Pick it up if you enjoy hearing them live (and if you like them live, you really should get all of their live albums).

Liesel had to be adopted, along with her brother, by the Huberman's, a family in the town of Munich, Germany to get a proper education. In the train ride to get to Munich, her brother died. <br /> <br />This book takes you through the times of Nazi Germany in the sense of just being in a war, rather than a race issue always used in world war two books. This unique factor makes it the best world war two book I have ever read. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book that most definately deserves more than five stars.

From Beginning to end, Tri-State will bring you on a progressive trance voyage that many electronic music enthusiasts haven't bought a ticket for in a long time. ake a listen to the samples and it those should be enough to convince you that this cd is worth buying ASAP!<br /><br />The soundproduction is excellent. The mix of vocaless tracks and tracks with male an female voices is a superb blend. I listen to this cd any time I drive my car. If you have a nice audio system in your home or car, you're going to love this cd because of the thumping deep bass and melodic synths.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are #01, the intro baring the same name ad the albums title, #03, World On Fire, a thumping/melodic trance track, #04, Air For Life, starts of soft with a hint of echoing female chanting and then throws down hard, #05, Can't Sleep, a somber vocal trance track which can jerk a few tears if you can relate to the lyrics, #09, Alone Tonight, THIS IS THE BEST TRACK ON THE CD, #10, Good For Me, this track has the voice of an angel on it, #11, For All I Care, A hard hitting thuper with male vocals that flows nicely, #13, Home, a beautiful chillout track with female vocals ending the cd and leaving you wanting more.

B00025ETIW|2.0|.....this album did not impress me at all. In fact i am turned off by this album completely. I feel their first work is more talented and it overall sounds better then this album. Sure, there are definitely one or two bright spots. The first track (and 2nd single i believe) Helena is a great song. But it all goes downhill from here. The Ghost Of You (3rd single) is the only other decent song (terrible video though lol). The first single Im Not Okay (I Promise) is not a good song at all and gets annoying while listening to it. Thank You For My Venom has a great intro but.....well thats only the intro...the rest of the song is blah. If you want some good MCR, and some great Gerard Way (Lead Vocals) pick up I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love. The lyrics are way deeper then this albums lyrics.

Dogs, Pigs(Three Different Ones), and Sheep are three awesome songs and it doesn't matter that they're long cause they're a joy to listen to.
B0002858YS|5.0|...because this album blew me away. After hearing the first single, 'Somebody Told Me', I was very skeptical. I thought this would be just a pop band like Green Day. But i decided i would give it a listen after hearing the second single, 'Mr. Brightside'. Wow. I was completely blown away and I fell in love with this album. 'Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine' is probably my favorite track off of this album. 'Mr. Brightside' & 'Smile Like You Mean It', which are the 2nd and 4th singles respectively are great 80s influenced tracks. Actually this whole album has a New Wave feel to it and i love it. 'Somebody Told Me' is a hot club track and a monster pop track and it is very catchy. 'All These Things That Ive Done', the 3rd single is a slow paced song and it will have you singing \\"Ive got soul but I'm not a soldier\\" all day long. 'Andy, You're A Star' is probably my least favorite on the track but is still a good song. 'On Top' is definitely one of my favorites. I love the chorus to this track. Well-produced album, Brandon Flowers is not the greatest singer in the world (with his fake british accent lol) but I still love him here. I hope to see a long LONG career from these very talented guys from Las Vegas, and im sure 90% of you agree.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Needles worries about the \\"new sound\\" of Muse... <br /> <br /> <br />So here it is - a new album from the band which continues to boldly go where no band has gone before - space opera rock. Upon hearing the first single \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" I was a bit skeptical since it really sounded different than anything they had done - and hearing it out of context (without listening to the album's opening two tracks) - I was really worried what happened to one of my favorite bands. <br /> <br />Needlessly, as it turns out - this is the sound of a progressive band who knows what needs to be trimmed and what enhances their unique sound.  <br /> <br />So, let's do it by the numbers (since everyone can connect to that)... <br /> <br />1. Take A Bow 10/10 - opening track sounds a bit like \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" and serves its purpose of introducing the album. <br /> <br />2. Starlight 10/10 - driving guitar riffs with strong piano chords that sound very familiar. On par with \\"Space Dementia\\"... <br /> <br />3. Supermassive Black Hole 9/10 - a bit weird track, but in context of the album it does exactly what \\"Time is Running Out\\" did for \\"Absolution\\". It changes and breaks up the tempo, so that you don't forget they like to experiment and surprise you a bit. Odd fallseto from Matt, but it's the only track on the album where he sings like that (and all the more surprising choice for the first single - probably because of the phenonmenal title and a joke they played on their fans)... <br /> <br />4. Map Of The Problematique 10/10 - another driving song with disco rhythms in Muse fashion. Really good!!! <br /> <br />5. Soldier's Poem 8/10 - a slow song which (probably) deals with the war in Iraq. Fits in nicely <br /> <br />6. Invincible 9/10 - mid-tempo track that starts slowly but picks up the tempo as it goes along with crazy guitar solos and brooding bass lines.  <br /> <br />7. Assassin 10/10 - \\"over the top\\" (if that is possible) track that's this albums \\"Hysteria\\". Unusual, but nice vocal harmonies. <br /> <br />8. Exo Politics 10/10 - this track would get 10 out of 10 just for the title! Extra-terrestrial politics. It's Asimov's collected works in one song! Actual goose-bumps flow over me on the guitar riffs and refrains... <br /> <br />9. City Of Delusion 10/10 - flamenco guitars! Trumpets! Latin rhythms! Mid-eastern melody on keyboards! Matt's vocals in full range! If someone can pull that lunatic mix off  - it's Muse! <br /> <br />10. Hoodoo 9/10 - begins with flamenco rhythms (continuing on the City Of Delusion), then drops the tempo to a slow pace with violins and Matt's vocals only, just to pick it up to a crescendo and slows it down again, so we can... <br /> <br />11. Knights Of Cydonia 12/10 - ...introduce the best track on the album and a fitting finale to one of the best albums of the year (if not THE best). Galloping rhythms and keyboards, acoustic and electric guitars, and then the greatest sing-along since Queen's heyday. It's really the way to end the album and is one of the best tracks I've ever heard. Oh, and it's full 6:00 minutes long so you really can enjoy it like the space opera it was meant to be... <br /> <br />Please, please, please DON'T listen to the \\"traditionalists\\" and \\"perfectionists\\" which will try to tell you that Muse sold \\"its soul\\". They just cannot comprehend that the bands evolve - like nature, like people, like Universe - and that's exactly what boys from Muse have done.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|...this band certainly interested me when i was looking for different bands (i am in no way a scene kid). A forum had claimed this album would make me dance NO MATTER WHAT. And they were right. I loved this album. Main reason is cause it is f***ing catchy. I got instantly hooked on the first listen. The second single 'I Write Sins...' and the last three tracks are song i could do without. But the 1st single 'The Only Difference...', is a great song. 'London Beckoned...' is such a catchy song im surprised i was able to stop listening to it! 'Nails For Breakfast...' is my personal favorite though the lyrics dont seem to make sense. 'Camisado' and 'Time To Dance' are both brillant and at different extremes. 'Camisado' is a slower, more serious track, and 'Time To Dance' is one of those \\"IT'S PARTY TIME B!TCHES!\\" tracks. 'Lying Is The Most...' is a humourous track just by looking at the title, but also the lyrics are quite fun. And 'But Its Better If You Do', the 3rd single is another one of my favorites and i love the chorus. \\"Prayng for love in a lap dance, and paying in naivety, oh!\\" <br /> <br />So, <br /> <br />I give Panic! At The Disco's debut album 4.5 stars out of 5. And since i have to round up now, i give it 5 stars.
B000002G7G|5.0|This eponymous third album by the famous Velvet Underground is my favorite. It seems to me that this one is quite under-rated, especially when compared to the band's first album \\"The Velvet Underground & Nico\\". Lots of people talk about what an eternal classic that one is, but in my opinion it only has a few good songs on it (I can do without the Nico stuff on it.) THIS album, however, contains not a single bad or disappointing song. ALL OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD. <br /> <br />The first song \\"Candy Says\\" is sung by the then-new bassist Doug Yule (who replaced John Cale of the first two albums) and is a great, gorgeous, melancholy song with one of the best, most heartfelt, sad outros I've ever heard. <br /> <br />\\"What Goes On\\" takes its main lyric from the Ringo-sung Beatles song of the same name from their album \\"Rubber Soul\\", but is otherwise as original as you can get, a great rocking song with a crazy guitar-solo near the middle which actually sounds like two or more guitars played simultaneously thru the same amp. The third song <br /> <br />\\"Some Kinda Love\\", has become my least-favorite song on the album (mostly 'cuz I can't figure out what Lou Reed is singing about... \\"Put jelly on your shoulder baby, let's do what you feel most\\"?!?!) but it's still a good song and I prefer it over the best most other bands have to offer. <br /> <br />\\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" is a sad ballad, very good and mellow with, as always, great guitar-work. <br /> <br />\\"Jesus\\", despite its religious overtones which might otherwise turn me off, is actually one of my favorites on this album, a great, simple, mellow song that is sincere and heartfelt.  <br /> <br />\\"Beginning To See The Light\\", another rocker, is one of my top favorites by this band. Lou Reed's manic delivery of the vocals is wonderful. The song has one of my favorite lines in music-history, \\"I met myself in a dream, and I just wanna TELL ya, everything is all right,\\" complete with Reed coming close to laughing as he sings \\"tell\\".And the music itself is indescribably cool. Somewhat like the band's earlier \\"I'm Waiting For The Man\\", but with even more dynamics and invention. (Like the awesome bass-line... but then again all of the musicianship on this album is top-notch.) <br /> <br />The next song \\"I'm Set Free\\" is another GREAT tune. (Lots of 'em on this album.) It has one of the most simple but effective guitar-solos I've ever heard. And of course great lyrics, like \\"I'm set free to find another illusion.\\" <br /> <br />The next song \\"That's The Story Of My Life\\" is another favorite of mine. It's another short, simple tune, but very effective. I LOVE when songwriters can admit and focus on their own faults and shortcomings rather that put themselves on a high-pedestal and judge everyone and everything else harshly, which seems to be a temptation most bands and songwriters seem to give into. But Lou Reed has always been cool like this, it seems. More introspective and responsible and fair as a songwriter-lyricist. Anyway the song has great lyrics like \\"That's the story of my life, that's the difference between wrong and right,\\" and then seems to reference William Burroughs with, \\"But Billy says both those words are dead.\\" Cool stuff. <br /> <br />The next \\"song\\" \\"The Murder Mystery\\" isn't really a straightforward SONG like the rest of the album but rather an experimental, \\"avant-garde\\" piece that employs the audio \\"cut-up\\" techniques suggested by Brion Gysin, William Burroughs and their collaborators. The \\"cut-up\\" here is employed by Lou Reed and drummer Maureen Tucker both singing simultaneously during the softer parts, and the guitarist Sterling Morrison and bassist Doug Yule speaking simultaneously during the harder parts. The effect is a collage of voices. Very cool. The music itself is wonderfully good, too. The softer parts with organ dominating remind me of some of The Doors' music, but are more satisfying. (Both groups came out around the same time, although on opposite costs of theUS, and I wonder who was first to do this jazzy sorta organ-led jamming...) <br /> <br />The album's final song, \\"After Hours\\", is yet another simple, short, but effective song, this one sung by Maureen Tucker, the group's female drummer. As many people have pointed out, her singing lacks the polished qualities of many lead singers, but this is what helps make it so appealing to me. (Lou Reed's not a Top-40 sorta guy either by any means.) I like Maureen's voice and her singing here. As soon as I heard this song for the first time it sounded very familiar. I do not know if it's a cover of a much-older song or if it's an original. Anyway it's got great lyrics. <br /> <br />So that's my assessment of this album. I say if you're new to the Velvet Underground, try this album first. Unless you're interested in hearing their wilder, druggier, noisier side, in which case you may find their second album \\"White Light/White Heat\\" more up your alley. That album's a great one too and comes close to being as favored as this album is by me. Although it DID take me longer to appreciate \\"White Light/White Heat\\" because at first I just heard loose noise-jamming on it.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|the first time i heard this album, i had to listen to it again.<br /><br />i first heard muse about back in 2000. I thought Showbiz was a great album and I was very surprised that Muse wasn't popular here. Even after the release of Origin of Symmetry which is another extraordinary album, Muse wasn't popular here and it drove me crazy. You can tell that with the new album, their skills are artists where polishing up and Origin with a tight album flowing like a good book. With the release of Absolution, they started getting some radio play here and I got to see them. Absolution confirmed that this band is naturally developing their talent and with Black Holes and Revelations, they have taken that talent and put it where they want it. It is sensational.<br /><br />The lyrics are so deep and clever. I was floored not only the how blanant they are, but the images they produce are throrough and inspiring. It takes guts for a band to put their politics down in the way Muse has. It is thrilling. I respected them as artists and musicians, and now I worship them.<br /><br />Black Holes and Revelations is gutsy, forceful, diverse and solid. Musically and lyrically, it takes you on a journey. You may love it; you may hate it. But you will feel something about it, regardless of where you fall and an artist that can make you feel in such a way is amazing. I give them a lot of credit and respect. They've done it.
0143058525|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this book, amazingly unabridged, and not a few CD's long. It is worth getting this version rather than the book. The author Elizabeth Gilbert herself reads this book. She has a sensitive voice, one of experience and pain, but also full of compassion. It is also a rich voice, yet at times threatens to crack. Her voice is a myriad of emotions and the voices of various characters are done so well, that when she spoke as another person, I only heard that character. Her stories are heartwrenching, uplifting. Some of them made me laugh out loud. They made me want to go to Italy (did), India (didn't), Indonesia (didn't).  <br />Overall, it is a story of transformation, from sadness to happines. This woman's year-long struggle wasn't an easy one. Aren't all of our struggles? <br />When it was all over, I realized with sadness that I wasn't going to hear Elizabeth Gilbert's voice anymore.  <br />An amazing must-hear. I wish her well.
B00006DEFA|3.0|Plain and simple. When it came time to replace my VHS cassette tape version, I bought this one- the director's cut.  <br />....I was disappointed after watching it.  <br /> <br />I found it very distasteful when Solieri extended his contempt for Mozart to Mrs. Mozart. It ruined the film. <br />    In the theatrical version, Solieri simply misled Mrs. Mozart in order to spy Mozart's works. He became a liar. It revealed or highlighted Solieri's inner conflict, his lying to himself. To me that is what gave the characters believability  and tension. <br />     <br />In this director's cut Solieri made Mrs. Mozart strip to gain his influence and considerations, but then called in the guards after she stripped, to publicly make a whore of her.  <br />....To me it did ruin the film, and changed the character of the film. The characters went from tense and suspenseful to lewd and ignorant. It ruined the film! <br /> <br />I am shocked that these other reviewers didn't feel the same thing. Look for the theatrical version. <br /> <br />
0805062971|4.0|After hearing so many good things about the movie Fight Club, I figured I'd do the next best thing - read the book.  After reading the book, the only thing I could think was how in the hell they turned this over-the-top story into a big screen picture.  Well, the movie does do a good job, but nothing can beat the twisted, humorous words penned by Chuck Palahniuk.  The book is filled with self-loathing, misanthropic rants about society and our main character is here to shake up the establishment.  After reading this novel, I made it my mission to check out other books byPalahniuk.  This, his first book, is a great way to dive into the world of one of my favorite authors.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I'm not sure if this, Being There or A Ghost Is Born is my favorite Wilco album, but it really doesn't matter. All three are masterpieces. This album, however, is almost certainly the most important in Wilco's career. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is where Wilco totally changed their sound. They quickly moved from rock-infused country to almost pure alt-rock. And just as they did the alt-country thing better than anyone else, they do alt-rock as well as anyone, and I like it better than Radiohead.     Some people complain that the avant-garde sounds serve to hide deficiencies in the songs (which may be slightly more true on A Ghost is Born), but I think those sounds are very important to the album, tying every thing together very beautifully.     The best songs are \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,\\" \\"Jesus Etc.,\\" \\"Radio Cure,\\" \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" and \\"Reservations.\\" The melodies really stick with you, and, as always, Jeff Tweedy's strained voice is extremeley expressive.     The lyrics are great when they're on (on \\"Jesus Etc.\\"--\\"Our love is all of God's money / Everyone is a burning sun.\\"--and the chorus of \\"Reservations\\" especially) and enjoyable when they don't seem to make sense. An example, from \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\": \\"I am an American aquarium drinker / I assassin down the avenue.\\" Either way, they always find a way to make you think, even if it's \\"What the hell is he talking about?.\\"    This is one of the great musical achievements of the last few years and should not be missed.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|For me, this album has two great songs (\\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\", \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\"), one really good song (\\"Soul Meets Body\\" which sounds a lot like Postal Service), one good song with an even better title (\\"Your Heart is an Empty Room\\") and a bunch of medicore to solid songs that don't really do anything for me.  <br /> <br />That's certainly not bad, just not as good as Transatlanticism, which has only two songs that I would call anything less than very good, and at least two I would call great.  <br /> <br />I know Plans doesn't sound much like We Have the Facts... but they remind me of each other in the sense that while both are very good albums, a lot of the songs are so similar and mid to low tempo that it's easy to forget you're even listening to music. Now, I think Death Cab and Ben Gibbard are at their best when they're playing it slow to mid tempo, and I don't think there should be fewer ballads on Plans, it's just that a number of them lack the emotional vulnerability and expression that the great moments, like \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" especially, have, which causes them to become stagnant and a little boring. <br /> <br />That being said, that song and \\"Marching Bands\\" are so good that every flaw of the album can be easily forgiven. \\"I Will Follow You\\" is musically a rather simple and traditional ballad, but the love and sadness in Gibbard's voice is palapable. Not to mention that Gibbard is probably my favorite lyricist and possibly my favorite poet of any kind. Roger Waters' (from Pink Floyd) lyrics are more socially insightful, and James Mercer(of the Shins)writes more beautiful and poetic metaphors and images, but of music I've heard, only Jeff Tweedy (of Wilco) even comes close to writing as beautfiully, insightfully and, most importantly, honestly as Gibbard, and even then only in his best moments. The last stanza of \\"Marching Bands\\" is some of the best work Gibbard has ever done: <br />\\"Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole <br />just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound <br />but while you debate half empty or half full <br />it slowly rises; your love is gonna drown.\\" <br />Gibbard shows a great insight here: as we suppress our love out of fear or whatever, the sorrow and depression fill our heart more and more, and, eventually, we get so used to being unhappy that we find comfort in it and its safety. We lose the conviction to be happy, at least consciously, and that is perhaps the greatest harm any person can do to him or herself; it causes their love, their life force to \\"drown\\" in the sorrow. <br /> <br />All in all, a very good album, easily worth the money just for it's highest moments though I might suggest you just download \\"I Will Follow You,\\" \\"Marching Bands\\" and \\"Soul Meets Body\\" because you probably won't miss having heard any of the others.
B000007MVM|5.0|Obviously the reviewer below doesn't have any sense. Even if you don't like syd barrett's music you still have to give him credit for creating the mold and sound for pink floyd. Without syd barrett's approach to songwriting as displayed here on Madcap Laughs, Barrett, Pink Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and Saucerful of Secrets, there is no Darkside, there is no Wall, there is no Pink Floyd. Numerous artists have cited Syd Barrett as an influence, Paul McCartney (whom the reviewer below me obviously holds in high regard) and Pete Townshend are early self-proclaimed Barrett fans. We can thank Barrett a little for the more experimental, later Beatles albums and definitely Who powerhouse albums like Quadrophenia and Tommy. David Bowie, Brian Eno, Jimmy Page, Phish, Radiohead, and other major artists have all acknowledged influence from Syd Barrett. <br /> <br />As for this album, as well as Barrett, it is a must have for any serious Pink Floyd or psychedelic music fan.
B000EWBKKI|1.0|The image has a soft grain throughout and actually looks better on the DVD if you ask me.  This disc is put out by Lionsgate and they didn't put an uncompressed PCM sound track on it; so the sound is the same as the DVD.  Both of the Lionsgate Blu-Ray discs I have (this and The Punisher) have a stutter when the image pans like frames are being dropped!  I've told Samsung (I have a BD-P1000) and they are looking into it.  I have not seen the problem with any of my Sony discs.  I see no point in buying this Blu-Ray disc; the DVD is just as good or better.
B00005QY5Y|2.0|Someone B****ed and Moaned about Tim McGraw's version of When The Stars Go Blue. They said Ryan Adams version was better. The version on this CD sounds like someone is grabbing the singers by their nuts. I am glad he wrote such great lyrics, but it'd probably sound better if William Hung sang on this CD!    As for the rest of the cd, it is alright I guess. Other singer/songwriters that you may enjoy if you liked this (who are MUCH better artists BTW) are Joe Brucato and A.J. Croce.    The cd gets 2 stars for the great lyrics of When The Stars Go Blue. Other than that maybe he should just go sing \\"Summer Of '69\\"    UPDATE: Alot of dummies think that I don't have the knowledge that Ryan Adams didn't sing Summer Of '69. It is obviously Bryan Adams. I made the comment because I thought that \\"FANS\\" of Ryan Adams would know the instance where he threw a hissy fit because a smartalecky concertgoer shouted for him to sing that song. Apparently some people either don't remember or just aren't fans enough of Ryan Adams to know.    Also, I realize it was a biased review. I just do not get how people can like this CD. However I will say that it is a WORLD better than ANY rap album released in the last 10 years or so. Now THAT will make people's ears bleed!    Mike Fox  Greatest Music Expert!
B00005JOX6|4.0|I liked this movie a lot.  Of course it's no masterpiece so I can't rightfully give 5 stars, but 4's good enough for what the movie is.  Long ago I didn't like Sandler because I didn't find his humor too cool, it was kind of crass I thought.  Well it still is to some extent, but I've found a lot of his work touching, with this being no exception.<br /><br />The first half of the movie deals with comedy and setting up the premise of the remote, characters, career and all.  Second half takes a dramatic turn and will probably bring tears to your eyes if you allow it to--and more than once, imagine that!  It's been a while since I've been to a flick that has managed to do that, even once in fact since most films are so unmoving.  The plot is about a guy who works too much, neglects family a bit, and yada yada...things come full circle but it's done nicely.  Beckinsale's a beauty, of course that's an added bonus.  A real looker, she is.<br /><br />If, like me, you have enjoyed some of Sandler's other romantic comedy work (Wedding Singer, 50 1st Dates, Mr Deeds), do check out Click.  Many say it is similar to It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol but with its own version.  I would say his movies are sweet, at the risk of sounding feminine.  But hey, they are.  Watch with chicks even, they should dig it too unless they're callous or anti Sandler.<br /><br />Some trivia: cameo from Rob Schneider as usual, albeit incognito.  Happy Days' Fonzi as Sandler's dad.  Marge Simpson (voice...) as his mom.  Cranberries' singer performing Linger--great song.<br /><br />As a closing note I'll add that I found this more worthwhile than a number of recent summer flicks I've seen: Pirates 2, Superman, XMen, MI3, DaVinci, Fast Furious 3, heck even Cars now that I think about it.
0679422714|1.0|As a Chinese, I am really feel shamed to have people like Chang from China. Just like so many fake medicine, pirate version DVD, CD, and the notorious \\"Dragon Heart\\" of the faked CPU project which even got national award in China, I don't know why there are so many cheaters like Chang in or from China. <br />Mao made great crime to Chinese, but this should not be used as an excuse to lie. This books is full of lie, just like many similar book written by oversea Chinese, the purporse of this kind of book is simply make sensation, and make great money. Those people who bought their books is joked as \\"Yuan Da Tou\\" in Chinese which means fools who like to spend money by cheated. <br />To lie in court is crime, I don't know why writing book by lying is not crime. If every writer are free to lie, I don't know who in the end will buy books.  <br />Buying this book is like to support lying in book.

B0006B2A42|4.0|American and Soviet teams race toward the polar ice cap to rescue an ill-fated scientific expedition.  At least, that is the cover story.  A polar storm prevents an air operation, so the US Navy rushes a nuclear submarine to the spot.  In typical Allistar McClean fashion you expect to see sabotage and undercover undercover agents playing against one another.<br /><br />In reality, the polar rescue is a secondary mission with both sides trying to recover a downed satellite film canister.<br /><br />Rock Hudson fills the part perfectly as the submarine's captain.  Serious and rarely smiling, he is portrays the ideal naval officer.  By the time the film premiered, the audience was already familiar with actor Patrick McGoohan from his role in SECRET AGENT MAN/DANGER MAN and the only recently televised THE PRISONER.  In fact, his portrayal of a British secret agent is little different then the character we came to know on television.<br /><br />Jim Brown and Ernest Borgnine complete the cast.  The sole miscasting of this film was Borgnine as Russian agent Vaslov.  In the 1960s we all came to recognize Borgnine as Commander Quinton McHale in MCHALE'S NAVY.  He just doesn't seem fit the role of a Russian -- and his accent is horrible.<br /><br />ICE STATION ZEBRA was the \\"Das Boot\\" of its era.  Expect all the usual submarine antics to include some very good second unit photography and underwater special effects.  The surface polar ice set is somewhat exaggerated (more appropriate for an Irwin Allen television production) and the confrontation between the sub captain and Soviet paratroop commander runs a little long, but overall this is a great film to watch.<br /><br />ICE STATION ZEBRA appeared on movie screens at the height of military activity in Vietnam in the late 1960s.  As such, the US Navy nervously withdrew permission for director John Sturges (The Great Escape) to film a single frame aboard a real nuclear submarine.  A traditional diesel sub was substituted.  In some of the aerial shots of the sub on the surface you will see that the \\"nuclear\\" submarine has a traditional shark-nose bow.  The interior submarine set is fantastic.<br /><br />The complete soundtrack to the film has also been recently re-released after years of being available as an import only.  It is the perfect soundtrack if you are driving by the water or cruising through heavy snow flurries.<br /><br />Great film at a great price.  For those of you who are THE PRISONER fans, this movie is traditionally viewed as Number 6's (Patrick McGoohan) last mission before he was taken to the village.he surface you will see that the \\"nuclear\\" submarine has a traditional shark-nose bow.

1401302378|5.0|Chris Anderson's book length treatment of the concept of the Long Tail is well worth reading, even if one's only role in the world of business is that of \\"consumer.\\"  Like Thomas Friedman's THE WORLD IS FLAT, this book details a major shift in \\"the way things work\\" as we already are experiencing them in the opening decade of the new millennium.  Those busy figuring out how best to reach their potential market will, of course, find much valuable information in Anderson's analysis; but so, too, will those of us trying to adjust to the abundant riches the new economy already is providing.   <br /> <br />The Long Tail promises us we won't any longer need to \\"make do\\" with what retailers chose to make available on their limited shelf space; it means we can find music to listen to not limited to the CDs supposedly attractive to a particular much-sought-after demographic.  However, it also means we have to take our consumption roles more seriously as well, making choices and following recommendations and imputing our likes and dislikes into computer data bases and delving below the seemingly familiar surface of \\"hits\\" shown us by mainstream media. <br /> <br />Anderson's book jacket touts his book as an exploration of \\"The New Economics of Culture and Commerce.\\"  For those of us loath to follow the crowd or to be limited by its choices and preferences, THE LONG TAIL promises a liberating set of changes already affecting our everyday lives in profound ways, in the cultural sphere as well as the economic arena.  I buy books on Amazon, download tracks from iTunes, search the 'Net with Google, consult Wikipedia for basic information, watch Netflick DVDs and thereby already profit \\"culturally\\" from much of what the Long Tail offers. Now I know why!   <br /> <br />Anderson's insights and analysis highlight and make sense out of a major cultural shift well worth taking note of, even if one is far removed from the world of the hungry entrepreneur or the savvy businessman.   Highlyrecommended!
0156027321|5.0|I've seen this book at the local library for ages, read the back of the book and decided just to buy it.  I'm sure glad I did!!! Pages and quirky quips are dog eared and underlined, which is a sure way to tell a book has been enjoyed.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is an amazing book, wonderfully well written and appropriate for people of all ages.  After spending so much time reading the \\"classics\\" it's refreshing to find a new book with such a great, unique story.  It challenges the intellect, and reality as you view it.  A great book to read, or reread.  Highly recommended!
B00005IC2H|5.0|Most negative reviewers state that Sigur Ros are boring and incomprehensible.  <br />It is interesting that anyone would condemn Sigur Ros for being impossible to understand, considering that they are an Icelandic band and hence don't sing in English.  <br />Besides that, anyone who dislikes Sigur Ros for this reason is missing or not appreciating a fundamental tenet of their music. It isn't supposed to make sense. At least, not to the brain. No, this music speaks to the heart. It is meaningless from a logical or rational point of view, but profound when listened to using feelings and emotions.  <br />In this sense, Sigur Ros is not remarkably different from any \\"mainstream\\" band. The lyrics of many popular songs, especially Metal or Grunge compositions, are usually incomprehensible. Sigur Ros is the same.  <br />The main difference between Sigur Ros and the music of other genres in which lyrics and meaning take a back seat is how they engage the listener. Grunge and Rock almost always use heavy electronic guitar riffs and strong percussive beats to interest the listener. Someone who is used to hearing this type of music will of course find Sigur Ros \\"boring\\" - Sigur Ros music contains no obvious riffs, drum beats or even linear structure.  <br />But that is because Sigur Ros is not some form of Aural amphetamine, or alternative to beat-boxing.  <br />It's not supposed to get the heart racing or the blood flowing, but rather the opposite. It calms and pacifies. When you listen to Sigur Ros, you don't listen for cheap thrills or empty titillation. You listen to meditate, to feel, or to relax.  <br />The point of meditation is definitely not to be some form of entertainment. Thus, if you can't appreciate quiet reflection or find peace and beauty \\"boring\\", then you most likely won't enjoy Sigur Ros.
B000005GW2|5.0|\\"You'll hear Chet Baker's trumpet as well as his voice on some of these songs; that's hardly startling, but it is startling to discover a voice and a horn of such quality with but a single source. Chet Baker has turned out to be a musician with such a wonderfully nice voice, it is a problem whether to speak of him as a 'trumpet player who also sings' or as a 'singer who also plays trumpet'.\\"  ~ Gerald Heard, Liner Notes ~<br /><br />To me Chet Baker will always be famously known as the \\"trumpet player who also sings.\\" This CD speaks of him more of a singer for this is the only album he was featured not only as a trumpet player but also as a singer. He superbly interpreted fourteen of the best standards of all-time with his soft and mellow voice and his wonderfully captivating trumpet playing. He was ably supported by Russ Freeman on piano and celeste, James Bond and Carson Smith on bass, Peter Littman, Lawrence Marable and Bob Neel on drums.<br /><br />This CD will never disappoint the listeners for this is one of his best recordings. Its repertoire includes an impressive collection of great standards penned by George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin, Sammy Cahn, Jule Styne, Jim Van Heusen, Johnny Burke, Hoagy Carmichael, Mack Gordon, Harry Warren, Frank Loesser, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart and many others. The best tracks for me include such lovely and timeless standard as Les Brown and Sammy Fain's \\"That Old Feeling.\\"<br /><br />\\"There'll be no new romance for me<br />It's foolish to start<br />For that old feeling is still in my heart.\\"<br /><br />You will also be pleased to hear \\"Like Someone In Love,\\" \\"But Not For Me,\\" \\"My Funny Valentine,\\" \\"Time After Time\\" and my very highlight - one of my ultimate favorites from the pens of Mack Gordon and Harry Warren - \\"There Will Never Be Another You.\\"<br /><br />With my heartfelt recommendation for your listening pleasure now and forever!
B000F6IOC0|5.0|The challenge with a sequel is that it should both build on the earlier release and at the same time stand alone dramatically. Anybody who sees a lot of movies knows that this is a very difficult task, but Wiseman makes it seem simple.  <br /> <br />There is a very brief prelude that quickly and effectively summarizes introduces you to the story of the previous film, but the story continues to develop in interesting and innovative plot twists in this sequel, without seeming contrived. The production quality is improved somewhat from the first movie. The plot moves along nicely with a very good mix of action and character development. The reprising cast builds solidly on their prior excellent performances, and Derek Jacobi brings a terrific gravitas and interpretation to his role as the \\"founder\\" of the respective Vampires and Lycans. <br /> <br />If you love Werewolf and Vampire movies, this is one of the most creative interpretations I have seen. If you  haven't seen the first movie, you will still enjoy this movie. If you have seen it, then all the better. I gave the first version 4 stars, but I thought this was actually a little better movie in terms of the story.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Corinne Bailey Rae's self-titled CD is certainly worth the price of admission for those seeking well crafted, contemporary soul and delivers on most of it's promises. Colorful, thoughtful lyrics that ache of love not quite there, rich textured musical arrangements and stylish vocals that balance youthful optimism with a hint of disappointment. The stand-outs on this project are \\"Trouble Sleeping\\", \\"Like A Star\\" and \\"Butterfly\\", with the last one not only being the best of the three, but the one that ultimately showcases Bailey Rae's lyrics. The single, \\"Put Your Records On\\", is a decent, mid-tempo ditty that's easy to sing along to, but certainly lacks some of the depth of the other material. The lyrics on this one trumpet free spirited innocence and self-discovery, but don't really say much more than you've heard before from similar artists. And it reeks of being added later so the record company could feel like they had a \\"single\\" with some groove and not an album of ballads. To her credit, she maintains a good consistency throughout the CD by using one main producer, Steve Chrisanthou, a perk many urban artists overlook. Too many producers bringing too many different \\"feels\\" to the album and no one thinking of the artist's sound as a whole. And unfortunately, like a lot of R&B/soul acts, she's weaker on up tempos and stronger on ballads. The knee jerk reaction to Bailey Rae by those who listen casually will be her Billie Holiday comparison, which isn't unfounded. Her voice, while stronger and more dynamic than Lady Day's, certainly does ape Billie's style, but is unable to capture mood and sadness and beauty the way Billie could. Lots of young singers have been influenced by Holiday and she'll probably grow past this at some point. Rae writes her own songs, plays and sings on her records, so being a triple threat will bode well for her development. However, as a singer, her voice can sometimes get lost in busier arrangements, if she's not careful. Her delivery, while dripping with personality, can lack an intensity that a vocalist needs to command the ear of the listener. On \\"Call Me When You Get This\\", one of few up tempos, the track almost runs her over and we find ourselves bored by whatever she's singing about. The one great failing of this British, singer-songwriter's debut, in my opinion, is the track sequencing on the CD. If you listen from start to finish, there's no journey in the song order. A great album always takes you on a trip and manipulates the listener to step into the artist's world. This CD, while having some really good moments, loses when it starts with a dark ballad, followed by a darker ballad, then to the upbeat single---and back to a dark ballad! By the fourth song, you'll wanna break up with her,too. Anyway, if you're so inclined to mix up the song order yourself (I've done it before), this is a very strong first outing by a bright, talented singer who really does seem to have the goods. Hopefully, her record company and those in her corner and will allow her to stay the path set before her and give her the time and space to continue to mature and blossom.
0307277674|4.0|My book club read this book when it first came out.  The story line was wonderful and I had a hard time putting the book down.  However, this book is a work of fiction.  If The Da Vinci Code has made people talk and read more about what is in the Bible, than Dan Brown did an exceptional job.
0740748475|5.0|This was bought as a Father's Day Gift for my husband who was absolutely thrilled with it. It is the ultimate Calvin & Hobbes collection & anyone who has enjoyed Bill Watterson's cartoons would be delighted to have this as the crown jewel in their collection. <br />
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is the movie that has made Christopher Reeve a symbol and icon for nearly three decades now, and this disc features a wonderful presentation with restored picture and sound. Baby Kal-El is rocketed from Krypton by his father (Marlon Brando), lands on Earth and is adopted by decent farm folk, and...well you know the rest. Richard Donner set a precedent for serious superhero films with this movie. It's slower paced compared to what's being made today, but it covers the important points quite well. Margot Kidder set a new standard for Lois Lane, and nothing more needs to be said about Chris Reeve. Hackman's Lex Luthor is my only point of contention; It's a solid performance, but Luthor has evolved so much over the decades that it's hard to judge this incarnation without wanting to see the scheming billionarie-industrialist over the criminal mastermind with bumbling sidekicks. Beyond that though, the special effects hold up well on a Star Wars level, and the flight scenes are still convincing.<br /><br />Again this disc features a fully remastered presentation, and also re-inserts a few scenes into the film, a nice bonus. Lots of extras have been included, such as a commentary, music-only track, documentaries and old screen tests. However, Warner Bros. is releasing a large, ultimate Superman movie collection soon to tie in with Superman Returns on dvd. This disc is a solid release, but I don't know how much of the content will be repeated for the box set, so if you don't own this already it might be wise to see what's coming in a few months. Either way, this remains one of the all-time best superhero interpretations ever.
0316743003|5.0|One day soon, people will begin to claim that putting a man on the moon, safely operating an aircraft like the SR-71 for many years, or, flying daily New York to London supersonic never really happened - centimental people from the 60's just like to think their generation did those things. Without books like this the conspiracy theory would be attractive. Accountants are trained to know the cost of everything. Engineers, on the other hand, are trained to see the value in people and their ideas irrespective of their status. In the 1950s and 60s accountants just did the accounts. But it was a golden age for engineers. <br /> <br />Ben Rich reflects towards the end of this book that if they wanted to re-create the SR-71 today - it may not be possible - not for engineering reasons but accountants now have so much power over their technical colleagues - the programme would be too constrained.  <br /> <br />There is much talk about hydrogen powered cars these days. This book has excellent reporting on the practicalities of handling and storing large amounts of hydrogen from a study done in the 1950s by Mr Rich. His experience suggests there are big problems associated with the hydrogen fuel cell car.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Like a lot of others I wasn't sure if another Batman movie was necessary, with the Burton masterpieces and the Schumacher disasters still fresh in everyone's minds. But like those people, I was wrong. This was the Batman movie that surpassed my expectations, an experience so rich and entertaining that I didn't think it could be done as live-action. Really, it's the tale of a man obsessed with darkness, trying to find a way to fight the shadows without being consumed by them. A man who takes the law into his own hands against a much greater evil than he could've ever imagined. And oh yeah, the man just happens to call himself Batman.<br /><br />Performances are spot-on all around, and Christian Bale easily makes Batman/Bruce Wayne his own. The cast is fairly star-studded, and each one contributes their share without putting their ego in, for a true ensemble piece. All the little origin details are here, from why Batman takes bats as influence, why he needs a cape, and what a practical Batmobile would look like. Two things feel off: Katie Holmes, who is generally good but not given a lot to do, and the ending that ties everything neatly together with a \\"destroy Gotham\\" plot. It takes a bit of suspension of disbelief, but it's worth it for an otherwise flawless film.<br /><br />Warner Bros. released Batman Begins in single and deluxe dvd editions. The bonus materials on the deluxe set are good, though there needs to be more, and the menu is a stylized comic book presentation that loses all sense of functionality. Early editions came with a free comic book featuring a sampling of stories the film draws influence from. It was a nice bonus, but as the stories can easily be found elsewhere, you're not missing much if your copy didn't come with it (the \\"Long Halloween\\" story in particular, is only chapter 1 of a story that deserves a purchase on its own).<br /><br />The Burton films are still excellent interpretations of Batman, but Batman Begins will probably be remembered as the most authentic screen-telling yet. A great film for fans, and great for converting non-fans.mbered as the most authentic screen-telling yet. A great film for fans, and great for converting non-fans.  <br /> <br />
B000000OSG|3.0|After I heard Illusion I, I was dying to hear its sister album. I consider Illusion I to be the 2nd best rock album ever, second only to Who's Next. I had heard so much about Estranged, Civil War, and all the other tracks. This CD seemed like a sure fire grand slam album.  <br /> <br />Instead, I found a bloated pretensious album that needs about 1/2 of the tracks cut out of it. True, when it is good, you can't beat it. Civil War is G&R's crowing studio achievement. You Could Be Mine, Pretty Tied Up, and Breakdown are amazing, but the rest of the songs vary in quality.  <br /> <br />The lows: <br />My World is self indulgant garbage that ruins what could have been a great ending. The alternate Don't Cry is completly unnecessary, since the only difference is the lyrics, which are much more vague than the original version. Get in the Ring has great guitar work from Slash and Izzy, but the lyrics are just tacky, thoughtless, and annoying, and Shotgun Blues is forgettable, especially since it says nothing Axl hasn't said already more intelligently in Don't Damn Me and Dead Horse from Illusions I. And then there's Locomotive. The song tries so hard to work but the lack of a catchy riff or chorus makes is merely okay.  <br /> <br />The highs: <br />Estranged is good, but it's not all it's hyped up to be and it's certainly no November Rain. Yesterdays and Knockin' On Heavens Door are also solid tunes, but nothing mind-blowing. Izzy and Duff on 14 Years and So Fine are a welcome break from Axl's constant rage and angst.  <br /> <br />Bottom line is Use Your Illusion should have been one double album packaged together with about half the tracks on this disc cut or seriously retooled. The attempt to make it two complete discs was a valiant effort from G&R, and I would still consider this essential G&R work, but the lack of quality material makes this there worst album of original work.

0684857219|1.0|The book got five stars from me in the past. I would still give it five stars for what it is. I have given many of Arnold's books five starts but I have decided to balance all of those reviews with a 1 star review here. Why 1 star? Let me explain. This book contains images of Drug-Users. All of the people in this book are highly genetically gifted and they all regularly stick needles in their muscles. They go on cycles of drugs to expand on their already massive genetically gifted muscles. ALL of them do this. There is not one, not one single picture, of a bodybuilding that has not used more roids in a year than a city hospital gives out in five years. The arm on the cover of the book is $40,000 arm. It was paid for by Joe Weider who sponsored Arnie to drop work and instead train and take drugs to develop the perfect body that mankind would pay to see. Arnold was already very gifted and he was using lots of drugs. He had too because he was being paid to do it full time by the biggest manager of the bodybuilding world at the time, Mr. Weider. Arnold is a God among men. In this book he paired up with other God's among men. People who are genetically gifted and injecting themselves with expensive drugs for lots of cycles over long periods of time. You must understand that this is what you are seeing. You must understand that unless you are genetically gifted and doing lots of drugs you can never achieve the muscle proportions of the World's leading bodybuilding drug users. The worst part is yet to come. These drug-users have absolutely no idea how to train any other way than to use drugs and sit in the gym all day banging out bigger muscles. If you want to spend 6 days a week isolation training without drugs, and have the needed gifts, you are about to throw your life away or end up doing drugs, for an eighth of the results. You will inevitably horribly and miserably fail, crash and burn. <br /> <br />IF,... and this is a big IF... you choose to reject, unconditionally, everything training related that you read here.... And IF... and this is another big IF... you only read the information here for kicks... and IF... you seek advice from non-drug natural bodybuilding books... that promote progressive weight lifting (something Arnold talks about but doesn't explain)... that promote long rest periods... and promote better exercise form... then you can achieve a look in 3-5 years time, that will get you a lot of attention, and may look as good as an athlete who has not taken drugs. Concentrate on progressive compound movements (squat, deadlift, bench press). You also need to learn how to control your calories by eating good food only and getting your BF% around 10-15% for the look, while learning how to BULK and CUT. None of this information is in this book. The exercise form in the pictures is hideous and dangerous. The routines are absurd. Everyone is pumped up on drugs. Never let anyone fool you by thinking differently. Drugs did most of the work not cycles of weekly 6 days of isolation exercises in the gym. <br /> <br />Now the book is five stars for what it is. Amazing motivation and a canon of bodybuilders like you have never seen them before. I love it! But apply extreme caution. Learn about steroid abuse and how drug users have no idea how to train. The form in this book has injured people badly.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Those who thought this film was \\"disjointed\\" and \\"convoluted\\" obviously need to go to a dictionary and look up \\"subtle\\" and \\"complex\\". I absolutely love this movie, and I had to watch it three times before I understood what the hell was happening. <br /> <br />There is a reason why the tagline on the film's poster is \\"Everything is connected.\\" Every single scene, event, and character is involved in the same plot! The reason why that may not be apparent is because of the keyword here, SUBTLETY. That's why I love Syriana; I can watch it over and over and still notice new connections, new subplots, and new revelations. If you want a film full of predictable conflicts and resolutions, stock characters, and a soundtrack ripped off of a \\"Now That's What I Call Music!\\" album, go rent \\"Failure to Launch\\" or some other dime-a-dozen feel-good film. Leave the complex and controversial film to those who are tired of watching the same story over and over again.
048629823X|4.0|As part of the Dover Thrift Editions, this is a very affordable look into Stoic philosophy and insight into one of the emperors of the Roman Empire. <br /> <br />As with most books from this collection, there is around 100 pages of text and no more.  Rather than reading like a story, these are aphorisms, which are more or less grouped into similar subject matter, but if you want to get the most out of it, you should aim for reading, at most, a couple at a time to really reflect on what Aurelius is saying. <br /> <br />An example would be number 15 from Book VII, \\"Whatever any one does or says, I must be good, just as if the emerald (or the gold or the purple) were always saying \\"Whatever any one does or says, I must be emerald and keep my color.\\"  This is a very profound and pithy saying.  To get the full effect, think about what this is saying and how it applies to us and our doings.  Reading many of these in a row would just blur them together. <br /> <br />I would recommend this as a reference for helping to reflect on our lives.

B00005JOQS|1.0|I was so disappointed with this movie.  Brandon Routh was the only thing that saved it for me.  What a bore!!  How is it possible to take a classic superhero character, his (formerly) fiesty love interest, a world class villian (yawn) and make it one of the most tedious movie experiences ever?  Well, bring in Brian Singer, Dan Harris, and Michael Dougherty and they'll do a bang up job of ruining it. <br /> <br />The storyline could not have been more aimless.  What was the point of this story, anyway?  The formerly dynamic characters of Lois, Lex Luthor and Perry White were toned down to the point of monotony.  Kevin Spacey and Kate Bosworth were both so horrible they ruined the movie.  Them, in addition to the stupid non-story and the poor direction by Singer.   <br /> <br />It takes over a half an hour to even see Superman!!  And then we hardly see him at all.  Though they supposedly spent nearly $300,000,000 they must have spend it on lunch because you'd never know it from the so called \\"special\\" effects.  Most of his stunts are incredibly boring, simply consisting of him holding something up.  Whoo-pee!   <br /> <br />I love Superman and looked forward to this movie for over two years.  What a terrible disappointment.  I hope they don't ruin the Superman legacy by making another.
B0000524CY|5.0|To get the full effect of watching this movie, you should watch it alone and late at night. Wether you want it to or not, this movie will scare you, shock you, or just creep you out, a lot. If you like scary movies, or just blood and gore, this is your film. The acting isn't bad, and there are some parts that are really actually quite funny. The soundtrack fits really well with the film, and the visual effects, though cheesy, are pretty entertaining to watch.
0596007124|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend. When I got the book and started to look at it I was afraid I had just wasted my money. The style of the book is so different from other technical books I have read, I thought I would not be able to read this one. This was not true. The book is really easy to read and I found the style perfect for this topic.  I can't say enough good things about this book. I can say that I am a C# developer and I was totally able to relate to 99% of all the examples in this book. If anything this book will help you understand how similar the to languages and their frameworks are similar.
B00003CXCT|5.0|These movies are classic, by thtemselves, the first two are only about 4 stars apiece, but together, this trilogy is golden. Though it's luster is somewhat dulled by the less than steller quality of the more recent Star Wars Trilogy, these movies are still great. The acting is almost perfect for the film, the soundtrack is perhaps one of the most memorable of all time, and the story is a classic one of good versus evil.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The writers did a great job of making fun of pretty much every stereotypical belief held about Europeans by Americans! There are scenes dealing with fanatical soccer fans, sex in Amsterdam, the Pope and the Vatican, nude beaches, exchange rate anomolies, drugs in Amsterdam, absinthe, etc. Although most of the movie was supposedly filmed in Prague, you get the feeling that you've seen the entire continent by the time the movie is over. The attention to detail was incredible: there are jokes going on behind the main scene in many places during the movie. To top off everything else there is a funny, catchy tune that sets the tone early in the movie. I'd recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. Additionally, the audio commentary is quite interesting and informative.

B000000OA6|5.0|This was the final album recorded by the original Queen lineup before Freddie Mercury's untimely passing.  Even so, Freddie's vocal chops are stellar, and he could nail the high notes with the best of them.  It's a real testament to what an awesome singer and songwriter he was.  Also of noteworthy mention is the flamenco guitar interlude on the title track, which was played by none other than Steve Howe of Yes.  Other standout tracks include \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" and \\"Headlong\\".  It's a solid album from start to finish, and I would highly recommend it to even the most casual Queen fan.
0385486804|4.0|This book did read like a long magazine article.  But that's not a bad thing.  Ever read a magazine article and wish it went into more depth?  Here you go.  At around 200 pages, this is a pretty quick read.  Any longer would have been too long.  The story revolves Chris McCandless' travels and offers some insight into his thought process.  After finishing the book my only two thoughts were: Either A) Chris McCandless marched to the beat of a completely different drummer and maybe that's OK and we should respect that, or B) he was mentally ill.  I think probably some of both.  After looking at the facts presented in this book,  I am almost certain that he meant to walk out of the wilderness alive.  He was stupid and unbelievably unprepared for his trek.  A 10lb bag of rice and a poor quality map?  Was he joking?  It's not hard to see why many people feel he got what he deserved.  But is doesn't seem he got what he intended.  He was arrogant, immmature, foolhardy and determined....  a pretty dangerous mixture as we have seen.   Good read overall.  I especially liked the chapter about the authors own experience similar to Chris McCandless'.  Pick it up here or at the library.
0446677450|5.0|I recommend reading this book only if you have not read any of Robert Kiyosaki's other books.  This is the first book in the Rich Dad series and I cannot say how happy i am that i picked it up at the library and read it.  This book brought to my attention, ideas and possibilities that I never would have thought of before. That is why my title is \\"Great for opening the eyes of those who's eyes are closed\\"  Because before I read this book my eyes were closed. An important issue that I never thought much about was brought to my attention when i read this book.   If you read this book, your eyes will open. The ideas presented in the book are simple and easy to remember.  After reading this book i have read 5 more of kiyosaki's books and although they were good many of them were just repeating the same points made in this first book.  The book is very motivational.  I would say that after you read this book there is no reason to read many more of his books.  I felt somewhat like i had been enlightened after reading this book.  It just gives you that little push you need to stop dreaming and start doing.  Its great!

B00003CXDD|5.0|This was sent from the US to a family in Canada, so I don't know firsthand in what condition it arrived.  But they all enjoyed the movie, so I guess it was great ... and it arrived in the time allowed.  All in all, good service.  And lots of communication to let you know the status of the order.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|At first glance, this movie may seem like an unoriginal live-action rip off of the Incredibles since both are about a super hero family, but this movie is far from it. The special effects are excellent, the script is smart and the action is not boring! Everything about this movie is fun in the best degree, there isn't anything wrong with the movie. Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston do a great job as the main characters parents. This is a serious movie, but that makes it even more special and great! I love that Bruce Campbell was in this movie, he was great as Coach Boomer a.k.a Sonic Boom. Overall, if you want a fun movie for all ages, get this! Adults and kids will love it!!!
B000ASDFJU|4.0|I recently purchased this box set and throughly love it.  Unfortunatly the dvd's skipped so i returned them.  amazon.com was very helpful and sent me a new copy before my old one was even sent to them.  This one works just fine, and the special features are great!
B00003CXA6|4.0|This is a good depiction of the Gettysburg Civil War battle. <br />Plenty of action...realistically portrayed.
B000002BHE|5.0|THE FINAL SONG ON CELINE DION'S (FALLING INTO YOU) CD IS ENTITLED, \\"FLY\\" AND I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS HAS NOT BECOME A HIT SONG OF HERS.  IT IS PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL AND ANYONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCED A DEATH IN THEIR FAMILY OR FRIENDS NEEDS TO HEAR THIS.  IT IS HEART WRENCHING YET VERY CALMING AND SHOULD BE HEARD AT FUNERAL SERVICES ALL THE TIME.  LISTEN TO IT.  IT IS MARVELOUS.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|The video is excellent. I was not happy with the delivery of my product.  I bought this for Father's Day for my husband and it took 10 days for delivery.  Iwas not told it would take this long. Had I know, I would have went to a brick and mortar store to purchase this.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Baker, Bruce, and Clapton have never sounded better.  Time has rounded off the rough edges of Cream's live performance, but the fire and musicianship is deeper than ever. <br /> <br />\\"Stormy Monday\\" and \\"We're Going Wrong\\" are two surprises.  Clapton's blues licks shine on the first and Bruce's vocals (combined with Clapton's solo) make the second a knock out! <br />
015603008X|5.0|This book is about a man named Chalrlie Gordon that hasn't mentallyand emotionally grown up. Charlie is 32 with an astonishing low I.Q. of 68. He is so determinded that he agrees to undergo an operation to increase his ability to learn but what Charlie learns is that the world is not quite what he thought it to be all his life. He learns that after all these years of thinking that his co-workers were his friends \\"laffing,\\" (as he calls it) with him, they were only making fum of him to make themselves seem surpirior.  Charlie Gordan's tale was much of innocence and as the story develops you start feeling how cruel the world really is. It was very touching and I give Daniel Keyes 5 stars.
0060245867|5.0|My 3 year old son and I love this book.  We can't decide which we like more - this one or Numeroff's other book \\"If Give Give  Moose a Muffin\\".  Unlike some children's books, both the text and illustrations are equally enjoyable.  It's especially fun to see how the animals boss the children around and tie them out.
0316776963|5.0|What some people find incredibly funny, others find boring and just plain stupid. Good humor writing is one of those things that you either get, or don't. <br /> <br />That said, for me, David Sedaris is one of, if not THE, funniest writers out there today. His voice shines through in every story, and the sometimes insane thoughts that run through his head never fail to get at least a smirk out of me, and quite often a laugh. It is very difficult to write something funny enough to get people laughing out loud, but Sedaris does it over and over in this collection of short stories. Highly recommended.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Excellent.  One of the best WWII films/series I've ever seen.  Completely realistic.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Grew up on Floyd and saw a few shows. This concert DVD sets the platinum standard for classic rock. Words cannot describe so just get it.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I actually just recently became a fan of this genre of music.  I knew I had to buy this album when I heard the song Miss Murder on MTV so I bought it just for that song.  I love it when I'm pleasantly suprised by the additional songs in the album that I meant to buy as a single.  The opener is amazing.
B00009Z576|1.0|After listeneing to Yes for over 36 years, there are two individuals that are a must Jon Anderson and Chris Squire. Steve Howe also falls into this category however he was not an original Yes member.Any cd without Jon Anderson vocals is as absurd as Paul Rodgers singing for Queen.Anderson is more than just a vocalist he is the primary source of their lyrics.Thank God that this lineup of Yes didn't last or maybe the public was just telling them you are not Yes without Jon.
B00011RPB0|2.0|my brother saisd that this was a good movie so i went to see it and do you know what my brother was right!!!! i watched this movie three times and i still like it alot more than some other movies that i have seen before that i don't like as much if you like to watch movies about japan this is one of those movies. i learnt that japan is a place were lots of people to go have a nice time exccept the maine characters in this movie LOL ;). even tho you dont know my brother you should still take his advise and see this movie because it is a good movie.
B00005JOQS|2.0|It's becoming increasingly clear the influence (and large shadow) Richard Donner has cast in movies. <br /> <br />Take for instance, the remake of his 1976 classic, \\"The Omen\\".  This year's remake was a dull remake that brought no new ideas.   <br /> <br />Now look at Bryan Singer's revival of Superman.  It's supposed to pick up five years after Superman II, which by the way, much of it was shot by Donner until the film's producers clashed with him, and hired Richard Lester to finish the rest.   <br /> <br />But Singer simply doesn't catch the joy, wonderment and innocence of the first two movies.   <br /> <br />Brandon Routh is well cast as Superman, and Parker Posey steals her scenes as Lex Luthor's sidekick, but Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey really bring this movie down. Bosworth is just sour as Lois Lane, bringing none of the humour or sexiness that Margot Kidder did.  Perhaps Rachel McAdams would have been a better choice.  And then there's Kevin Spacey.  I have to say he is one of the most overrated actors in Hollywood.  He's too over the top, snarky, and as Lex Luthor, he's really dull.  It doesn't help that the story is uninteresting and nonsensical - something about Lex trying to create a new world or some such nonsense. <br /> <br />Then there's the subplot of Superman supposedly having taken off for five years to find traces of his home plot.  But it's hard to believe that Superman would leave in the first place, so we never buy the story in the first place. <br /> <br />Singer simply doesn't pull these unbelievable stories together, and his miscasting seriously hurts the film.  I wish Donner was back to direct this.  He would have made Superman's return an event, not disappointment.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|We watch a lot of concerts, and this is absolutely great from start to finish. This is a band that has stayed on top of their game and grown even stronger over the years. The harmonies are tight, and their voices are as awesome as ever. If you like/love the Eagles, this DVD will not disappoint you.
B000ASATYO|5.0|If You Love Any Kind Of Ghost Movies This Should Be A Definite Buy! This Movie Is Funny And Creepy At All The Right Moments And Michael Fox Gives An Outstanding Performance Throughout. And Not To Mention The Acting Done By Jake Busey Was Also Incredible. This Is An All Out Fun Film That Should Definitely Get Picked Up, Especially If You Like Any Of Peter Jacksons Works.
B000002BMV|5.0|In 1980/1981 the holy trinity of AOR realeased their finest works.<br /><br />1980 saw Syyx release Parardise Theatre and REO Speedwagon, Hi Infidelity.<br /><br />In 1981 Foreigner released '4' and Journey came up with 'Escape'.<br /><br />Although in the UK Journey never got much airplay before Escape I managed to get to listen to most of their stuff and I always regarded Journey as a band that released albums with some good songs but also a lot of 'filler'<br /><br />Escape not only rectified that but produced an abundance of not just good but classic songs.<br /><br />This album is as good as it gets.<br /><br />Perry and Schoen were always the main songwriters but ex Babys Jonathan Cain really contributes too.<br /><br />Every song's a killer.<br /><br />AOR was never this good and quite frankly this album has not been matched.<br /><br />The DVD of the concert 25 years ago has been released and the songs are as fresh today as they were then.<br /><br />Any rock fan really needs to listen to this album. It's a true classic
1416904921|5.0|My three year old daughter is completely OBSESSED Cinderella...the blond hair, blue dress, Disney Cinderella.  A picture of her is pretty much on every one her nightgowns, shoes and toys.  But this pop up book is sooooo incredibly beautiful and amazing in EVERY SINGLE WAY that she doesn't even comment on the fact that the Cindrella has red hair and wears a yellow dress.  (and she comments on most things in life!) This book stars CINDERELLA as she was meant to be - popping up gorgeously in brilliant 3D form!  From Cinderella sewing her meany step siter's gown to the gigantic reveal of her fabulous ball gown to everyone dancing round and round at the ball - this book is magical in every way.  My daughter asks to read it just about 8 times a day.  And even though she is the fidgetiest kid I know (she never sits still and loves to rip and cut paper) she's managed to keep this book (relatively) in tact for months!  Note:  It is a bit wordy (and well written!) but we often paraphrase in the name of getting to bed.  Needless to say,  the pictures totally tell the story so even if you're silent - everything comes accross magically!
B000000OQF|5.0|It seemed that in the mid to late eighties, almost every new hard rock/heavy metal band had a lead guitarist who aped Eddie Van Halen and a David Lee Roth wannabe as lead vocalist (except for David Coverdale who was a Robert Plant clone).  Then Axl Rose and Slash came along and smashed the mold to pieces.  Guns N' Roses were originals and their \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" could fairly be said to be the greatest debut album in rock history.<br /><br />I was a grad student in New Orleans when this album came out.  I started seeing the video for \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" on MTV and it was clear that this new band demanded attention.  Then MTV played a live Guns N' Roses concert from the Ritz.  I watched and listened, and when the concert was over, ran out the door of my student dorm, ran to the nearest record shop (Mushroom Records, which was open late), and bought the album.<br /><br />I won't repeat the names of the songs. Why should I?  There isn't a weak tune on the album. If you've heard them before you know what I mean. If you haven't, LISTEN TO THE CD! If you like your Rock music Hard, you will love this one.
B000268QB2|3.0|ALBUM REVIEW:   <br /> <br /> <br />Excellent, excellent songwriting here on Keane's debut album.  Big choruses, soaring piano and vocals really bring these songs all together.  The melodies are all very different, yet the album really sounds like an album.  The songs are definitely grouped together very nicely from beginning to end and in perfect order. The songs are meaningful and pretty much direct, very emotional at times.  The production is dead on for the feel of the songs, every instrument is easy to hear, nothing overwhelms anything else.  Overall, I have to say, if you have patience and 45 minutes to fit in some good music, put this record on.  The only reason I say you have to have patience is because after the first 5 songs, you kinda want to hear less piano, its very much the same sound running through the album.  Its not really a bad thing, I am all for it, I like when albums have a steady theme, but here I guess I am just left looking for a few more arpreggiators, guitar effects, etc...  (3/5) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />TRACK BY TRACK REVIEW: <br /> <br />1. \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\":  Excellent song, beautiful lyrics and sets the mood for the album.  It feels like a very private song. (3/5) <br />2. \\"This Is The Last Time\\":  The verse to me started off a bit boring, but the chorus just explodes with beautiful melodies.  Still not sure I like the singer's voice by this time in the album.  It is smooth, but is it pretty? (3/5) <br />3. \\"Bend And Break\\":  So far, the best song on the album, this one has a real pretty melody, nice piano, almost sounds broadway-ish dare I say!  I like the vocal effects right after the \\"wake up\\" line.  Reminds me of Erasure's \\"Cowboy\\" album a little.  It's a nice energentic song.  The end comes to a slow light piano end, perfect segway into the next track. (3/5) <br />4. \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\":  A song I definitely have related to in times of my life.  It's about a couple who lost their bond and connection.  It's really a sad song.  This track is really good, its slow but keeps you interested, very interested. (3/5) <br />5. \\"Everybody's Changing\\":  Boy ain't that true!  This song is another I can relate to.  Everybody is always changing, the world is always changing and this is a good coping song for that.  This song also is the first to feature arpreggiator!  Being a Duran Duran fan, I can definitely appreciate that!  This song still holds to the format of the disc with the lush piano parts and steady mid-tempo of the song.  This is the best song on the album for me. (4/5) <br />6. \\"Your Eyes Open\\":  The song opens very curiously, the verse is just OK, but the chorus explodes into a soaring piano piece with some of the best vocal harmonies on the album.  The song does have a little bit of a boring factor.  Following 5 previous songs with the primary lead instrument as piano doesn't help that either.  I would like to hear some guitar come forward in this song but it never does.  (4/5) <br />7. \\"She Has No Time\\":  I just love the lyrics here. \\"You think your days are uneventful and no one ever thinks about you\\".  The verse here I like better than the chorus.  The chorus seems to go nowhere and Im not sure I like him singing in that high falsetto pitch.  (3/5) <br />8. \\"Can't Stop Now\\":  The words are definitely about a troubled man wrapped up in his own troubles, the song sounds a bit too happy for that meaning.  Sounds more like a love song if you ask me.  This is the first track where I don't feel the lyrics exactly match the music.  Everything about this track is just mediocre for me.  (3/5) <br />9. \\"Sunshine\\":  A strange track, beatlesque in a way.  It took me a while to get accustomed to this track, its definitely unique and great singing.  There's just something about this track that keeps me listening.  Some new wave synths in there too! <br />10. \\"Untitled 1\\":  This song is a filler if you ask me.  The synth is a bit dreamy, but the song really goes nowhere fast. If you are a mood music person, you might enjoy this, but I am not really unless the music is really interesting.  There are some neat parts, but not enough to get me to listen to this one again. (1/5) <br />11. \\"Bedshaped\\":  A nice ballad to end the album with, this song surprised me as a single, its just a mediocre ballad for me.  (2/5)
B000024D4R|5.0|This is really only for the most dedicated and thick skinned of Floyd fans or music fans in general. It's pretty bleak stuff. Yet, it draws you in because it is such brilliantly composed music, and there is some melody in there. Pigs, with its sinewy, stop-start basslines, even has an ever so slight funk/disco vibe to it. The surging Sheep approaches metal with its hard relentless attack. The soundscapes created on this album are cold and surreal yet utterly mesmerizing. As far as sound quality, it is flawless and has held up well with age, although it's almost 30 years old you will not find a much better sounding audio recording today.   Listening to this album is a truly one of a kind experience, it is challenging yet extemely rewarding.

B00004VYQZ|5.0|I saw this re-make most reluctantly. After all, I thought, how could it compare to the original blockbuster hit of the same name, which starred the adorable British actress, Hayley Mills? Well, to my complete surprise, this film is a winner in its own right. Reprising the dual roles played by Hayley Mills, a young Lindsay Lohan, in her silver screen debut, is surprisingly effective and adorable, making the dual roles her own.<br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar with the premise of the film, two girls, Hallie Parker and Annie James (Lindsay Lohan), meet at summer camp. They look exactly alike. One lives with her father, while the other lives with her mother. They soon figure out the previously unknown but inescapable fact that they are twins, separated shortly after birth, each of whom lives with one of their biological parents. They both long to know the parent that is missing from their respective lives. So, they concoct a plan that will allow them to do so, leading to a scheme to reunite their estranged parents. They simply switch places, when it comes time to return home. Their reunion scheme is almost derailed, however, when their biological father seems to have romantic designs on someone else.<br /><br />This comedic caper focuses on the intrigues of the twins as they try to get the potential usurper out of their father's life and re-unite their parents. Lindsay Lohan is simply terrific in the dual roles of Hallie and Annie, infusing a great deal of charm and personality into her portrayal of the twins. Natasha Richardson is wonderful in the role of the mother, Elizabeth James. While she lacks the feistiness of Maureen O'Hara, who originally played the role, Ms. Richardson manages to make the role her own with her low-key charm. Dennis Quaid is terrific as Nick Parker, the handsome, hunky father, who is the besotted prey of a gold digging, scheming, statuesque blonde (Elaine Hendrix). I actually like his performance better than that of Brian Keith, who played this role in the original.<br /><br />Blonde bombshell Elaine Hendrix is effective as Meredith Blake, the potential wicked step-mother, who quickly sees her own scheme to marry a wealthy husband go up in flames as the twins plot against her. Lisa Ann Walter is simply wonderful as Nick Parker's good-hearted housekeeper, infusing the role with a rich warmth. Simon Kunz is very funny in the role of Martin, the James' butler, creating a memorable character, and Ronnie Stevens is perfectly cast as the maternal grandfather, Charles James.<br /><br />As to whether or not their mother and father will be re-united, as the twins so desire, watch this film and find out. Although Lindsay Lohan does not sing the popular signature song, \\"Let's Get Together\\", which Hayley Mills sang in the original film, the viewer will not be disappointed by this re-make. Disney Studios, which is the studio responsible for both the original and the re-make, has created a terrific little comedic gem in its own right with this film.ed this role in the original.<br /><br />Blonde bombshell Elaine Hendrix is effective as Meredith Blake, the potential wicked step-mother, who quickly sees her own scheme to marry a wealthy husband go up in flames as the twins plot against her.

055380457X|3.0|Reading this, as I did, will give a person a decent high-level idea of how google operates, but there is little or no \\"inside information\\". The entire book is the result of the authors' having read through interviews and articles, and simply summarizing them into a mostly-chronological account of Google. <br /> <br />The first two chapters are rife with such sycophantish gushing as to make me blush and were nearly unreadable. Although the book did get better, there is a lot of repetition from the authors. Somehow, one of them actually has one a pulitzer prize before; he probably should have it revoked. <br /> <br />The book comes across as a fairly well done high-school paper, if a teacher asked for an account of Google. There is nothing at all noteworthy, besides the lunacy of statements such as (loosly quoted): \\"Not since the printing press has there been an invention responsible for such great dissemination of information as Google [and, yes, they said Google, not the internet, which is a far easier argument to make]\\". The author refers to the two founders' genius and, although early on in the book is emphatic about their adhereance to scholarly goals and not monetary ones, finishes the book emphasizing their wealth, resistance to competition, and things like this. BTW, the two founders recently bought a massive jet full of niceties for their personal travel. I don't slight them for that (if I had that money, I'd do it, too), but pretending they are people not interested in vast wealth is quite untrue.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is a fabulous show that deserves much more credit and attention than it has received. I got into the show late, but fell in love with it immediately and was VERY upset to discover the only season on DVD so far, is Season 1. We have crap like the Anna Nicole Smith show or The Bachelore on DVD, but not the 2-4 seasons of Everwood. What a shame! I hope the network or studio or whoever is responsible, gives the Everwood fans what they want and release them. The series finale was amazing and the journey all the characters make is a must see. Well written, beautifully acted and staged. Don't miss it! (And let us have the rest!)
B00005V3Z4|2.0|This movie is dark and unclear.  What happened anyway?  You have some really miserable characters, some really evil ones who need to get dealt with.  The evil they do is just suffered through, without a response.  There's some sort of supernatural garbage going on, or maybe there isn't and maybe it is just some insanity.  Booga booga.  This movie wasn't for me.  If you enjoyed it, good for you.  I don't know why I'm not giving it just one star.  Something about it was appealing, but it was drowned in misery.  You like misery?
0060839872|2.0|I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated.

B0000648WZ|5.0|Most astrobiologists seriously doubt that when we find intelligent life on other planets that it will be like us.  Unlike Star Trek and Star Wars, these aliens are the type most likely to really be there.  Perhaps by humanizing aliens, Hollywood protected us from the real horror waiting for us.  If our current eco-system is a harbinger of things to come{ie pfiesteria and flesh eating bacteria} brain eating insects are just waiting for us!
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Amarantine~ Enya is a very good recording from Enya that offers no surprises and one could compare Enya to a major corporate company like Budweiser and Levis. She knows what her customers like and delivers this in every recording she has produced and recorded up to date. She is an amazing singer and she has astounding vocal abilities. Her lyrics are alright but I feel like she writes mostly fluffy lyrics about love and emotions and that is all fine but even that gets a bit boring after a while. The book-let is a mixed piece of work. The photos are very nice and Enya is sharp dresser with a very unique and personal taste for fashion and such. The problem with it is that font is a bit small and changes colors which is annoying. Do not get me wrong this is a good and Enya once more produces a product that will offend no one and insure herself of selling tons of albums. Highly recommended for fans of Enya and for fans of easy listening music this is a must buy. Allmusic gave the album 3.5/5. I think this is a bit low and give a weak 4. The album peaked the charts in Japan and Belgium and was top ten in several countries. 2 singles were released from the album \\"Amarantine\\" and \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\". 4/5.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|Are these reviewers kidding - the \\"best movie?!?\\"  Special effects were excellent, but that's about it - yet, TOO much it it.  Really, enough was enough.  It was a \\"B\\" movie that my family really looked forward to & was sorry to have missed on the big screen.  My children (8, 10 & 22 years old) asked 3x in the 1st 1/2 hour \\"Are you sure this is King Kong?\\" then later, \\"Is it over soon?\\"  though they knew it wasn't by a long shot.  Nothing beats the original, as corny as it might have been.  The acting was better for some characters, but I felt like I was waiting in a doctor's office for most of the time.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I can still recall watching this incredible series on the Second World War when I was a kid. The series on WWII is so far superior to any PBS, History Channel, A&E, HBO etc....that there is simply no need compare. The DVD series also has some additional information about the producers of the series and the challenges they faced on putting the series together.  <br /> <br />It is narrarated by Laurence Olivier and the footage, the interviews with Allied commanders, soldiers, politicians and people who lived thru the war are stunning. The series was done in the early 1970s and is brilliantly produced. One of Hitler's secretaries is interviewed in the series (Traudl Junge) as are other famous individuals of that time. The producers made sure they covered the entire war as the series covers the WWII campaign (Europe and the Pacific).  <br /> <br />If you only have one DVD series on WWII this is the one you must have. There has never been a better DVD series about the Second World War and I doubt there will ever be a better series.
B0006FO8RA|1.0|I grew up listening to real musical artists who wrote, played and really SANG their own music. REAL artists like, Luther Vandross, The Beatles, 1960's Motown artists, Elvis, Tina Turner, The Rolling Stones, The Go-Go's, Madonna, Janis Joplin, Cass Elliot, The Carpenters, Blondie, ect.... and when i come across so-called \\"artists\\" like Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Nick Lachey, The Simpson Sisters, Jennifer Lopez, ect, I just have to laugh. They are so ridiculous! There's NO talent what so ever here. THEY CAN'T SING!!! Their only staying power is obviously on the tabloid market, and on the pre-teen girls who don't know any better, until they grow up and realize; \\"What Is this S%#2T I've been listening to?!\\"
B00062IVKS|3.0|this was a fine film back in 1980 in its original form.Like many fine dramas of that era it has since fallen victim to politically correct censorship, which is done to gut the films of realism and power.La mottas racial attitudes and taunting have been removed, along with racial street talkof other Italian American characters of the time and place that render the film far less autentic than the original cut. This kind of thing has been done to many films of the past. It appeared tobegin Post Reagan and is now worse than ever.can't recommend censored art work-we already saw the original cuts.
B000B0WODA|5.0|This album is amazing. The first 7 tracks are all good, and then there is a mix amongst the last half. To think of the career of Franz Ferdinand reminds me now of the path the Cure took with Boys Don't Cry. There is a great amount of structure to each song, and nothing beats the 3-4 hits such as This Boy and Walk Away.

B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I was very anxious to get this album. When i got it, i listened to it once and then kinda left it alone and listened to other music. But i got back into it like 2 days after and now i cant stop listening to it. Every track is outstanding itself, its a must buy cd. My favorite tracks are \\"Injection\\" and \\"The Approaching Curve\\". This cd is very good if you're a hard-core Rise Against fan such as myself. This album keeps to their much more punk side as then pop. Its very good that they know how to keep to thier own music instead of changing it like so many other bands. Very good album, very well worth it.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Maybe I shouldn't be writing a review - after all, I only made it through perhaps the first 20 minutes of this film.  If you have seen the BBC miniseries (as I have), or read the book (likewise), this can be nothing but a disappointment.  I really don't know how it couldn't be.  The movie rushes through the story and I don't know how anyone could follow it.  With the exception of Mr. Darcy (no one could ever be sexier in the role than Colin Firth), the actors here are better looking than in the BBC production, but in the end, who cares?  It's just not worth it.
0064471837|5.0|Seven bells have a lot of work to do in this riveting novel, part one of the Abhorsen Trilogy by master storyteller Garth Nix.<br /><br />The bells are named after seven makers of the Charter (the force that governs every aspect of the Old Kingdom) and in this story they are carried by Sabriel, daughter of a necromancer of the line of Abhorsen.<br /><br />Sabriel grows up in a boarding school environment, but with a slightly different curriculum than might be expected.  Part of her lessons involve learning her father's trade, venturing into the river of death, either to rescue trapped souls or grant them eternal rest.  Of course danger lurks around every corner, as undead corpses known as Hands and supernatural beings known as Free Magic elementals may pop up at any old time, and as you can guess they're usually up to no good.<br /><br />When her father is trapped by the dark side of the force, Sabriel is forced to take up the Abhorsen reins, sword, bells and whistles, and set off on the quest that is always an essential part of any good adventure story.  Accompanied and advised by a white cat with a red collar, whom of course you will realize is no ordinary feline, but a powerful agent of Free Magic under magical restraint, she finds herself in a Royal graveyard, where she revives a young man from his wooden enchantment.<br /><br />The little group eventually locates her father, who is able to give them some background information on the terrible evil they must now face in order to save the world (blah blah blah), and although he's not in the best of shape he manages to buy them some time to regroup and get reinforcements.  The evil one, Kerrigor by name, is on a rampage, and somewhat like the headless horseman, he's looking for his head as well as the body still attached to it.  Sabriel and her friends, and the army, tanks and all, set up a final showdown - winner takes all.<br /><br />This is an action-packed fantasy novel of the highest caliber, which includes all the swashbuckling and evil spirit vanquishing you'll ever need, plus of course all the bells and whistles.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 15, 2006includes all the swashbuckling and evil spirit vanquishing you'll ever need, plus of course all the bells and whistles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Amanda Richards, July 15, 2006 <br />
0316172324|4.0|How can we decide something and how fast?  This book explores this topic. <br /> <br />The best thing about this book for me is in revealing how our prejudice miscolours the accuracy of the decisions we make.  Gladwel provides some telling examples from associative thinking type questionaires that expose our subconscious assumptions about skin colour or gender that threaten making better choices than those we would make burdened with false assumptions. <br /> <br />Blink overall is a fascinating book.  Decisions made in a hurry can obviously be ace compared to compiling piles of data and analysing them in non-intuitive, statistical formats.  The major buzzword in this book is \\"Thin slicing\\".  Rather than having a whole cake of info on something as a basis on which to make a hopefully correct decision, how thin a slice would you need to arrive at the same conclusion.  The answer is surprisingly very thin indeed. <br /> <br />Things like a tone of voice can, according to this book prove just as decisive if not more than the content of any speech. <br /> <br />Vast and exciting examples of decision making are explored:  Simulated wars; police shooting the wrong man/men; judging art work for authenticity; assessing couples breaking up on the basis of their conversations; looking at facial expressions and even the \\"Pepsi challenge\\" and selling cars.  The themes are explored in an exciting fashion. <br /> <br />Gladwell reveals a lot about himself and illuminates many areas - helping us to focus on how we can train our faculties to make snap judgements weareas at the same time being wary of making decisions under stress or with wrongful assumptions about people in general. <br /> <br />Gladwell conveys the problems inherent in making snap judgements that can be plain wrong.  He does not expand too much on this - I suppose this is why many of us are reluctant to make too many snap judgements (on important matters), because this could be just too risky.  However this book does help you to avoid any risks, especially if you like a small gamble. <br /> <br />I read this book so fast and think it will be helpful and boost the confidence of any interested reader. It is not a long book to read. Please be warned that you should not make blink decisions and think of it as a virtue - it would be nice if you can spot your perfect partner in a blink, but would he/she agree? The fact of the matter is we continuously make snap decisions that are not especially consequential or even when we do make momentuous decisions that are good, it may rely on a good deal of subconscious input.  As an example, I looked at this book for less than 10 seconds before buying it, and I'm glad I did.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Syriana dramatizes well the viscious cycle created by a short sighted US foreign policy attempting to secure our oil supply. It's certainly quite a complex situation, but we seem to go about foreign policy with an ineptitude unpraralleled in the destruction it indirectly leaves behind. For the first time, the US is directly affected by the byproduct of our own machinations, Islamic Revolutionary Fundamentalism. I think Stephen Gaghan is telling us that it's high time that we change course.
B000E1ZBIQ|3.0|I did watch \\"andrea chenier\\" on tv longtime ago and obviously it wasn't this one here.It was okay.Now in this year 2006 of our lord J.C,the first impression i had is that this piece of art need to be update(rework or an adaptation en francais s.v.p with subtitle in whatever language).Why??? How would you feel if you hear the \\"star spangled banner\\" being sung in another language that is not english? The french revolution looks like the glorification of hate and envy.Guillotine means \\"suicide\\" at first sight.  Forget about the singing it does not really matter when la liberte,l'egalite and l'amour are being falsified.Who cares?.. They should sing at least La marseillaise. My friends,we have cattle all around the world but you deal with the legend of the cow-boys in southwest usa and they don't speak swahili.  Ciao Giordano!!!Mama mia gonna miss you! I don't think so.After all he is the one who started and snobbery,my friends! That the bottom line.Is still going to be here.Worth watching???

B00005JOYA|3.0|OK, this review is written by a man who has not played the original Konami video games - actually any games for many years, so please read it as such. Not that I hate playing the games. I like it. I just don't have enough time for doing that now. But I liked director Christophe Ganz's previous film `Brotherhood of the Wolf' and the presence of Jodelle Ferland (`Tideland') is attractive enough. <br /> <br />Jodelle Ferland plays a little girl Sharon DeSilva, who keeps dreaming about a ghost town named Silent Hill, a town that was completely burnt down 30 years ago. Sharon's protective mom Rose (Radha Mitchell, `Pitch Black'), in order to cure her daughter of the habit of bad daydreaming, takes her to the now deserted town, without telling her husband (Sean Bean) anything about her hasty decision. And soon it really turns out hasty because Rose is lost in Silent Hill after a car accident. Moreover, Rose finds her daughter is missing. <br /> <br />The introduction is lengthy, but it is worth waiting. The spooky photography by Dan Laustsen (`Mimic') that captures the lost town of Silent Hill is fantastic with the perfect production designs of the ruined buildings and deserted streets while white ashes constantly falling from the sky add some surreal beauty to the scene. And when a siren wails over the town, lots of the undead, these creepy creatures (designed by Patrick Tatopoulos, `ID4') resurrect out of nowhere and start to attack Rose. <br /> <br />[LOOK WHO WROTE THE SCRIPT] I mean no disrespect, but for all its terrific production designs, superb sound and visual effects, and very spooky and scary zombies, Christophe Ganz did one big mistake in making this film. It's the script that seems to observe all the rules of the original games, but ignore the basic rules of storytelling. You may remember the name of Roger Avery, once co-credited with Quentin Tarantino as writer of `Pulp Fiction.' It is Avery who is responsible for the messy story that makes no sense in thesecond half of the film.  <br /> <br />I confess that I don't understand the meaning of the ending except that it refuses to follow the conventional patterns of horror films. For all the inclusion of a missing little girl, the film in the middle part suddenly seems to forget all about her, concentrating its energy on the bloody battle against the undead. I admit these fierce battles are impressive, but Avery (who is responsible for Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames' torture scene in `Pulp Fiction') is so intent on surprising and annoying us with unnecessary sadistic themes like suggested child molesting. This film should be pure entertainment, and it is in some of the set-pieces, but even the fans of the games find it incoherent. Why didn't Christophe Ganz add the puzzle element to the story, which would be much helpful in drawing attention to the film's alternate world?    <br /> <br />The supporting cast including Sean Bean, Deborah Kara Unger, Laurie Holden, Kim Coates, and Alice Krige have virtually nothing to do except looking like minor characters in the video games. They all look great, but without them the film will do, so why not just drop them? <br /> <br />Among many films adapted from the games, `Silent Hill' should be called a success. It is surprisingly emotional and is unique in that most of the main characters are played by women. Therefore, it is regrettable that the overwritten script does not live up to its wonderful cinematography.
0060512806|5.0|The author does cover a lot of ground here, and it takes some concentration to keep all the plot lines and ideas in focus, but its definitely worth it. <br /> <br />I had no idea that cryptography was such an integral part of world war II, and its history is the real start of the computer age.  It is also intriguing how he uses a sort of generational cycle to tie all the characters together.  At the same time, the writer likes to have a lot of fun, so there are a lot of genuinely funny sections that keep it lighter. <br /> <br />I will warn you.  Some of the comments about this book being difficult to follow and \\"nerdy\\" have a vein of truth in my opinion.  I do not agree with these views as valid objective criticism, but more as a mis-match between the reader's need for easy entertainment and this book's complexity.  If you like a book that is intellectually challenging, then this is your novel.  But if you just want to read something that carrys you along, and does not really require much thought, I would consider another (frankly simpler) book.
B000F3AAUW|3.0|\\"St Elsewhere\\", is the debut offering and introduction to the duo, Gnarls Barkley. Gnarls Barkley (G.B.) is the alter ego created from the collaboration of (singer/songwriter/rapper/producer) Thomas DeCarlo Callaway aka Cee Lo Green  and (musician/writer/producer) Brian Joseph Burton aka Danger Mouse. You may know Cee-lo from his stint as a member of the rap group, Goodie Mob. Now, he is probably more well known for his role as a judge on the popular TV talent show, The Voice. My first impression of Gnarls Barkley in 2006 ?? I fell in love with the track \\"Crazy\\". Long before I bought the CD or even knew who or what a Gnarls Barkley was! I immediately adopted \\"Crazy\\" as my personal theme song. I could definitely relate. Of course, you must have gone thru a little somethin', somethin' to truly appreciate \\"Crazy\\"!<br /><br />The rest of this debut from Gnarls is a little gnarly. In some ways it IS diverse in nature. From jump you're taken straight to church with \\"Go Go Gadget Gospel\\". The other tracks also include some infectious beats, some cover tunes, some macabre lyrics (necrophilia), and some introspective tracks laced with metaphors. The overall  glue that holds this CD together is it's \\"Retro\\" flavor. The music and lyrical content is a combination of retrospective AND introspective  observations  set to music. The lyrical content is somewhat self-analytical, yet tongue-in-cheek. But, mostly, the flavor is  retro, retro, retro! Retro rock. Retro R&B. and just plain RETRO!! I almost thought I could hear Motown legends, The Supremes, singing over the top of track 5, \\"Smiley Faces\\". If you're into retro, this is the one. Pick this one up. I do like Cee Lo's final invitation to \\"dance with me\\" on the last track, \\"The Last Time\\". As I feel that dance, literally, can free your every \\"thang\\"...at least temporarily. When was the last time YOU danced? \\"There IS A RHYTHM INSIDE YOU, you must get reacquainted\\". My overall take away knowledge from this debut? Just remember,\\"if you really think YOU'RE in control...I think you're crazy, just like me\\"! I thoroughly enjoy Cee Lo, wearing his vocalist hat. He has an unusual quality and tone to his singing voice...I'd much rather hear Cee Lo sing than hear him rap, but that's just me. Next time out of the gate for G.B., like a TRUE necromancer, I'd like to see them try a little more \\"magic\\". Update: Let me address Necromancer, track 12, built on metaphors for addiction?? Not sure, I didn't spend much time with it. I just found it a tad creepy for my taste...but you might like the comparisons. It might be more organic to or make a connection to your experiences...yes? no?...you decide!

B000002H2H|5.0|It's sad that a band who has recorded for 25+ years peaked on their second album.  I know, Master of Puppets is brilliant--I can't deny that.  But Ride the Lightning is better.  \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" just might be the perfect heavy metal song, and then we get gems like \\"Fade to Black\\" and \\"Creeping Death.\\"  Kirk and Lars have both said they didn't learn how to really play their instruments until the black album.  I guess they traded songwriting ability for their new instrumental knowledge.  Congratulations.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|It's about time.  If you like the first 4 ZZ Top albums, definitely buy this CD.  I bought the six-pack when it was released many years ago, and not being musically schooled, I really didn't notice much of anything wrong with them.  Obviously, I had not listened to my tape copies of all of the original albums in a direct comparison.  Sadly, I recorded over every old tape, except for Tejas.  I had no more use for the tapes, I had it on CD, so I thought!!!  It is only in the last few years that I have realized what was done to make the Six-Pack, mostly from reading Amazon reviews.  (triggered drums, what's that all about?  Now I know)  My musical acuity has improved since the 1980s, and so I bought ZZ Top's Greatest hits on CD(it's the original analog), and listened to my old Tejas tape.  Even though my Tejas is an N'th generation cassette copy, the original music completely stomps on the fake drum and echo effect of the CD version.  The difference is like listening to a bad tribute band faking it, versus the real ZZ Top.  <br /> <br />I'm glad that Rhino has brought out Tres Hombres and Fandango, and I hope that it doesn't stop here.  Sad thing about all of this is, that on the back cover of \\"ZZ Top's First Album\\", there is a diatribe against modern studio effects, and how it was ruining real music back in 1971.  \\"ZZ Top's First Album\\" was to be about real musicians playing real instruments.  17 years later, they were guilty of studio chicanery themselves.  I've tried to find the exact quote from the cover, but I cannot.  If someone has the actual text, I'd love to have it posted here.
B000E41MS6|5.0|At last, at last Dr. Who is back. It's been a long spell without him, but Christopher Eccleston was worth the wait and Billie Piper as Rose joins Ace, Sarah, the first Romana, Leela and K-9 as my favorite companions.<br /><br />Although it is somewhat disappointing that the series did not pick up where the Sylvester McCoy stories ended (because it really seemed as if the McCoy stories were headed SOMEWHERE,) this series is eminently satisfying. The Doctor seems more unhinged-- he doesn't have to worry about the Time Lords riding herd on him and he is free to swing around the galaxy and do whatever he wants, although he mostly hangs around earth.<br /><br />The hint of a romance between him and Rose is a different direction for the Doctor, but it feels natural with the doctor's new sense of being alone in the universe. The chemistry between the two of them is terrific. I also loved the character of Captain Jack in the last few episodes in the series-- he reminded me a lot of the alternate Rimmer (Ace \\"Save me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast.\\") on Red Dwarf.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you've never watched Dr. Who before. Watch it now! It's terrific!
B0000060LT|3.0|A violin, a guitar and drums meet, then swim about together in dreamy, liquid compositions.  The music is fine, but the mixing makes it hard to really let it wash over you.  The drums are miked too close while the violin is placed too far back.  Rather than smooth violin work supported by twangy guitar and punctuated by percussion, we feel the tension of a misplaced element that throws the balance off.  And here, balance is critical.

0064431622|5.0|This text is an invaluable picture book for children learning how to read, how to enjoy reading and to learn about the joys and absurdities that life can bring. It is a humerous text that utilises excellent illustrations to represent the plot. The plot itself humerously intertwines fantasy with reality, ofcoarse it depends upon the child's imagination. A must for any child that enjoys playing with words and surreal ideas. The book's design is additionally unique in that is in an organisational folder style whereby children may select various imaginary creatures as they choose. I hope that others can share this wonderful picture book with all children they read to and/or with.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Good concert, but for those who own Delicate Sound of Thunder on video(unfortunately only on VHS at the moment), you might tend to think that something is missing in Pulse.  It's very subtle, but this DVD isn't as \\"cool\\" as Delicate Sound.  This one dives right into the music and gives a good \\"technical\\" presentation, while Delicate Sound offered more of a mysterious air to the video -- I remember that roadie lighting up a smoke on one of the lasers, the concert reflecting off his sunglasses, while Shine On was playing--very cool shots like that to open up the concert.  The backup girls were dressed in classy black (in Pulse they are dressed in white), which again offered something more mysterious.  And, finally, the crowd in Pulse just doesn't seem to get into it.  In Delicate Sound they really pull you into the concert -- especially when the pig gets into the air during One of These Days and the camera focuses on one fan screaming (you can tell from his lips, but can't actually hear him):  \\"Oh my God look at that f*cking pig!\\"  Kinda sums up the rush that I felt when I saw this concert, and then the VHS tape. <br /> <br />So technically Pulse is a very good DVD.  For those that don't own Delicate Sound, you'll definitely enjoy it.  But for those that have Delicate Sound, and that may have seen the concert back in the late 80's, you might find that some of the magic is gone.  I wish Delicate Sound would come out on DVD, so that others might appreciate what the heck I'm trying to say here!

B00004X10B|5.0|I've been using my Tamrac Pro12 bag for several years and it's still in like-new condition. The bag is plenty large enough to hold all my gear with room to spare. The dividers allow for a large variety of layout options and has plenty of pockets for accessories. The bag is well padded and made with a tough snag and rip resistant fabric. All the seams appear to well stiched too, with box-stiching on all the major stress points. The carry strap is contoured, well padded and slip-resistant which makes for a much more comfortable day of lugging heavy camera bodies and lenses around. <br /> <br />Every couple months I recommend spraying the outside of the bag down with a quality water-repelling spray such as that used for tents and other camping gear. This will do wonders for weatherproofing the bag to prevent your delicate equipment from getting damp if you're out and get caught in an unexpected rain.

B000E8NQUE|5.0|I hadn't really planned on writing a review of this CD until I read  the recent (July 14, 2006) review by 'Micaloneus'.  His review raised some interesting points, and was so at variance with other reviews that I was intriqued, so decided to offer my own take.<br /><br />First off, I do not own the previous remastered versions of this or any other Moody Blues 'classic seven', so I cannot refute his claim.  I am, however, able to respond to his primary criticisms.<br /><br />The reviewer states that the original 'dynamics' have been compromised by excessive compression, resulting in 'ear fatigue', and that earlier releases sound more like the vinyl LPs, preserving the dynamics originally engineered.  He also claims that the MFSL gold discs sound 'better' (at least on a Deep Purple record, so I presume he means on other titles as well).  I happen to own a MFSL gold disc of 'Threshold', so I sat down and played it from start to finish, followed by this hybrid SACD version (played on a high-quality stereo, as I do not own an SACD player).  I came away with a totally different perception.  While the gold disc did sound a bit more like the vinyl record (I once owned over 2,000 LPs, including 'Threshold'), it does, then,  have a bit of a 'warmer' sound (for want of a better word).  Is it 'better'?  Not in my book.  In a direct A/B comparison, the hybrid SACD version sounded fuller, with much more separation and clarity.  For example, on the fade-out on 'To Share Our Love', the refrain is barely audible on the gold disc, but is clear as glass on the hybrid version.  I was able to pick up instrumentation on the hybrid that was buried in the gold disc.  For me, the effect of listening to the hybrid was much more like being in the recording studio vs. listening to a record of that recording.  No comparison.  Also of note is the fact that of the 13 songs on the album, 9 of them had different playing times on the MFSL gold discs compared to the hybrids, ranging from one to seven seconds variance.<br /><br />On the point about 'ear fatigue'...well, perhaps Micaloneus has a much more discerning ear than me; when I finished listening to the hybrid (which included all the great bonus tracks), I didn't get 'ear fatigue', but rather got a strong desire to play the hybrid release of 'In Search of the Lost Chord' immediately afterwards.  Which I did.<br /><br />On his general criticism of money-gouging regarding these hybrid releases, I disagree.  They're only a few bucks more than a standard CD, and given the superior sound quality and first-rate bonus cuts, to me they're a bargain.<br /><br />I do agree somewhat about the cover art.  A better job should have been done in reproducing the depth of color found on the original albums.<br /><br />Lastly, I cannot share at all his scathing declaration: \\"Shame on anyone involved in this SACD Deluxe Edition project,\\" since Justin Hayward and John Lodge themselves oversaw the transfers.  Instead, I praise them.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that the exact same (verbatim) review by Micaloneus is found for each of the hybrid SACD titles of the Moody Blues.  It seems as if a 'copy-and-paste' approach was taken, which raises questions as to whether all of the CDs were actually played.<br /><br />If he and others are satisfied with the earlier remastered versions, then that's great.  As for me, I cannot imagine any iteration of these great albums sounding any better than these superlative hybrid SACDs.ariance. <br />On the point about 'ear fatigue'...well, perhaps Micaloneus has a much more discerning ear than me; when I finished listening to the hybrid (which included all the great bonus tracks), I didn't get 'ear fatigue', but rather got a strong desire to play the hybrid release of 'In Search of the Lost Chord' immediately afterwards.

B0001MDP3G|2.0|Musical scores were on spot, rich and compelling, imparting  emotional PUNCH! Chemistry was somewhat skewed between Kidman and Enman. The rule of \\"show don't tell\\" was broken periodically throughout dialogue, particuarly in Enman's dialogue when he goes from scene to scene \\"announcing\\" to each one he meets he's in love. Scenes were pleasantly varied, many of which were extraordinarily vivid and detailed with an interesting host of characters, however portions of acting came across as plastic and trained. It seems as though this movie tried to do \\"too much\\" and as a result the plot became vexed with business. A cornicopia of  scene effects, ranging from  surreal, to tragic, to tongue in cheek, to implausible (with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre?) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest, although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks.  Speaking of implausible - The friendship that ensued  between the red-haired minister and Enman, in light of their initial conflict, seemed rather far fetched and silly, moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a Broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times. Renee' Zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in Jerry MacGuire. Nicole Kidman was not in her element, yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present. This film was over-starred and substantially miscast. Didn't need Donald as Kidman's father and Kidman and Zellwegger's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary. Overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault. Undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved.
0312323867|5.0|Something Blue is the sequel to Emily Giffin's first book entitled Something Borrowed, which was narrated by the character of Rachel.  Something Blue is the continuation of the same story, but this time narrated by Rachel's former best friend Darcy. <br /> <br />This is a great device to further the plot, telling it from another character's point of view.  Initially, I hated Darcy's character, but Ms. Giffin deftly turns her into someone you end up understanding and feeling compassion for.  Also, setting the second book in London gives a fresh aspect to the continued storyline; the author's detailed descriptions of the nuances of everyday life in London are excellent!  The former characters are expertly developed and there are some interesting new characters that are introduced. <br /> <br />As is the case with Ms. Giffin's books, this one is impossible to put down, utterly engrossing and you'll find yourself devouring it in one day.  And the bonus is that you don't have to have read Something Borrowed to read and understand this book...though I highly recommend you read both - the plots are fun, the characters memorable and the writing style fresh.  Enjoy!

B000FQJAIW|1.0|Well, I was going to pick these up to get the theatrical cut of each film in a widescreen release, but it looks like I will not now.  It's really disappointing that they are non-anamorphic and since it seems to be inevitable that they will be re-released at some point with anamorphic transfers despite the fact that Lucas says otherwise.  If I was still using a standard television set for my primary device to view DVDs, this would be fine for now I suppose, but having just purchased a widescreen television in January, non-anamorphic DVDs are not attractive to me at all.<br /><br />So a warning to all, if you don't know the difference between anamorphic and non-anamorphic DVDs and unless you don't mind buying these again to get anamorphic transfers in the future, I suggest you go do a search on the web to see for yourself what the difference is so that you can make a more informed purchase.
B000F3AAUW|2.0|I really hate ranking this CD this low.  I've been a fan of Cee-Lo since the very beginning, and admire his transition from rap to vocal.  As soon as I had seen the video \\"Crazy,\\" I went out and bought Gnarls Barkley's \\"St. Eslewhere.\\"  This says a lot because I refuse to watch MTV or listen to heavy rotation radio.  I love the underground sound, and this album truly displays such talent.  To my regret, \\"Crazy\\" is the only album likely to see air play.  Moreover, the orchestration of the album resembles another ATLiens work...Andre 3000.  I really feel that this CD could be called \\"The Evolution of the Love Below: pt 3000 featuring Cee-Lo Green.\\"
B000FVQYYK|2.0|I'll say it -- I have always loved Muse for being a low-rent version of Radiohead merged with Queen -- and I always appreciated them for being exactly that: not entirely innovative, but interesting and talented and different from most of the rock music making waves in the US.    I don't love this album, which is fine, because I don't love \\"Origins of Symmetry\\" either, but as a whole, I think this is Muse's weakest album.  There doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to the tracks, which is frustrating after the brilliant pacing of \\"Absolution,\\" complete with intro and interlude tracks to set the tone of the album.  \\"Blackholes and Revelations\\" bops to and fro with little connection between the songs, particularly \\"Supermassive Blackhole,\\" which is a great track on its own (after it grows on you) but doesn't relate well to the rest of the album, and doesn't relate all that well to the next track, \\"Map of the Problemique.\\"  There are some standout tracks that I'm really loving (\\"Starlight,\\" \\"Knights of Cydonia\\") but most of the songs sound exactly the same, which is never encouraging for a band whose sound evolved in positive ways with each ensuing album.  It also doesn't showcase Matt Bellamy's voice like previous albums, and has more of a \\"arena rock\\" feel to it, which doesn't mesh well for a band who focuses so much on lyrics and concepts.  Each album has an overriding theme, but this one is pretty much lost in the over-wrought production.  Maybe that's the problem -- Muse is trying too hard to fill Madison Square Garden itself when they should be concentrating on the Theater, and aren't ready yet.    I also hate most of the song titles.  Maybe it's a sci fi/outerspace thing, because just as I burst out laughing at a good portion of titles off The Strokes latest album, \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" (\\"Ize of the World,\\" \\"Vision of Division\\"), I have a tendency to giggle over most of the titles on this album.      Every band is allowed to strike out once or twice.  I have faith that Muse will get back on track for album five.

0060899190|5.0|\\"Postsecret\\" is a book of collected postcards from a website of the same name that began when a man named Frank Warren decided to combine art and the freedom of anonymous therapy. The concept is simple: you send in a postcard with a secret that you have told nobody. It can be on any subject, though most center on love, hate, feelings of personal inadequacy, and revenge. The cards are unedited and as a collection are actually very poignant.<br /><br />Many of the cards are genuinely sad: \\"I haven't spoken to my dad in 10 years...and it kills me every day.\\" Some are rather frightening: \\"I stole valium from my epileptic dog.\\" Some funny: \\"I give decaf to customers who are rude to me,\\" which was written on an item from Starbucks. Some are so quirky that they reek of both humor and dark emotional hang-ups: \\"I take extreme measures to poop in solitude,\\" and \\"When I'm mad at my husband I put boogers in his soup.\\" Finally, there are comments that can't be evaluated in any possible context or frame of reference without being told by the writer; since that context is impossible to know, these are my favorites, being genuinely funny and mystifying, for example: \\"I stole your duck and took him to San Francisco.\\"<br /><br />The book is genuinely touching in an odd and unexpected way. It is cathartic in that it reinforces that perhaps others have deeper problems that you do as the reader. Some of the postcard writers wrote Frank to tell of changes the Postsecret project made in their lives. In these cases, I am betting that years of therapy would have been way less effective while being way more expensive.<br /><br />My favorite of the personal stories was from a woman in Canada: \\"Dear Frank, I have made six postcards all with secrets that I was afraid to tell the one person I tell everything to, my boyfriend. This morning I planned to mail them, but instead I left them on the pillow next to his head while he was sleeping. Ten minutes ago he arrived at my office and asked me to marry him. I said yes.\\"<br /><br />This is a great book that serves to remind readers that everyone has problems, everyone has secrets, and everyone has unhealed wounds. Though many of these postcards are individually depressing, the amalgamation is a true wonder to behold, and will make readers feel better about themselves. Part of the proceeds for this book goes to the National Hopeline Network, which helps prevent suicide. This is a great book, and I recommend it highly.me to marry him. I said yes.\\"  <br /> <br />This is a great book that serves to remind readers that everyone has problems, everyone has secrets, and everyone has unhealed wounds.

0684824906|5.0|I was read Jim Bishop's \\"The Day Lincoln was Shot\\" in high school. At the moment I read that the assassination occurred, I looked at my clock and saw it was exactly the same time (10:15 P.M.) as the event.  That was eerie enough until I realized it was April 14th, 1965, exactly 100 years later! That realization caused chills throughout my body.  Couple that with my birthday being February 12th and it is easy to understand my fascination with Abraham Lincoln.   <br />     <br />Of all the books I have read about Lincoln in the past 40+ years, nothing compares to this.  Ms. Goodwin has taken an historical collection of facts and numbers and changed it into a living documentary.  I was so involved in this book that I actually feel like I was part of it all--the cabinet meetings, his  political conniving, his devastating depression, and above all else, his compassion for the common man.  At times I would find myself so much a part of the book that I wanted to advise him on mistakes he was about to make.  This is the finest work of non-fiction I have ever read and I have read many.  I can only say \\"Thank you, Ms. Goodwin\\".  A truly remarkable piece.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Every five years, Disney re-releases one of their classics for a limited time, claiming it'll be locked in the \\"Disney vault\\" for an extended period of time, so you'd better get yours now. Every version includes some kind of extras, usually being a new song, usually not being near to par for the rest of the original movie. Why do they do this? Because they keep making money. So what's the big deal if Lucas jumps on the bandwagon? <br /> <br />I only own one Star Wars DVD (Episode III) and that's because I spent a gift certificate on it. I have the VHS releases from the 90's, but have been holding out on getting the DVD's for a reason. Even though they are little changes, I feel that the new versions did something to betray the originals. I miss the old Ewok song at the end of Ep. VI. I enjoyed it more when the spirit of Anakin Skywalker actually looked like the Anakin who died in Luke's arms.  <br /> <br />The older ones made them appear as unsung heros, the largest celebration of their victory provided by the Ewoks and any rebels who had survived. Undoubtedly, the entire galaxy would hear about the defeat eventually, but showing huge celebrations simultaniously made it seem as if their fight wasn't as personal as it was sometimes meant to feel. <br /> <br />Granted, Ep. IV's changes are not as dramatic, but they still create a different feel to it. This is just the opinion of someone who is a fan - not a fanatic, but I will definately be purchasing this version in the near future.

B0002W18MU|5.0|CD Review: Johnny Cash - American V - A Hundred Highways <br /> <br />When I was kid growing up in the sixties and seventies I was never much into Johnny Cash. Like most thirteen year olds at the time, my musical taste ran more towards the noisemakers of the day like Led Zeppelin and Grand Funk Railroad, with maybe a side dish of Beatles and Dylan as a reminder of the value of good songwriting. <br /> <br />So like most of my friends, I mentally filed Johnny Cash and his \\"Boy Named Sue\\" nonsense somewhere in between the country crap my Dad listened to (guys like Glen Campbell), and novelty artists like Tiny Tim or Ray Stevens. Years later of course, as both my tastes began to change and I grew up a little, I developed a healthy respect for The Man In Black as the American Icon he is.  <br /> <br />You had to stand back in just a little awe at the man's voice for starters. There is nothing that quite matches it's deep resonance in all of music. The other thing about Cash though is simply his songs. Not all of them are written by him of course, but even when the writer is someone else, Cash makes every song he sings uniquely his own. His songs evoke images of America--the good, the bad, and the ugly--in a way only a very select handful of singers can. Johnny Cash's powers as an interpeter of song are without equal. <br /> <br />I briefly worked at American Recordings in Los Angeles in the early nineties, and was fortunate enough to have been in on the early marketing plans for the first of what was to become The American Series. And over the course of my travels through the years, I've had occasion to meet hundreds of rock stars. I thought I was way past ever being starstruck meeting musicians.  <br /> <br />But when Rick Rubin marched into my office one morning in 1993 and introduced me to Johnny Cash, I was speechless. What are you supposed to say when The Man In Black himself extends you his hand and says in that unmistakable voice, \\"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.\\" I wasabsolutely dumbstruck at the experience. It's a story I tell often over beers with my friends to this day. <br /> <br />In the twilight years of Cash's life, Rick Rubin assured that his legacy would be properly bookended by making the great series of American Recordings albums. In doing so, Cash was able to end his career on the same sort of artistic high note that he began it with those early Sun Records albums. For that all of America owes Rubin a debt of gratitude (and I say that about the guy who signed off on firing me from his company). <br /> <br />Cash's famously resonant voice has grown a little weaker as his life grew closer to a conclusion. But it's no less powerful here on what will presumably the final chapter in the American series, A Hundred Highways.  <br /> <br />In going through and rediscovering the boxed set and five albums proper that comprise the American Recordings series, it has been Cash's interpetive powers which have most struck me as a listener. <br /> <br />On those albums, Cash has reinvented songs by everyone from Soundgarden to Bob Marley (Cash's take on Marley's \\"Redemption Song\\" is a revelation) to Neil Diamond. With each interpetation, Cash uniquely stamps them as his own. <br /> <br />But as that famously resonant voice has in recent years began to recede, most notably on his amazing version of Nine Inch Nails \\"Hurt,\\" it has also taken on new life. Where there was once a apocalyptic preacher's quality to it, there is now an inescapable weariness. A sense of both longing and of an almost biblical sort of take on mortality. <br /> <br />A Hundred Highways is filled with all these types of themes. The weariness, the sense of desolation and longing, and especially the consciousness of the artist himself's own mortality. Cash's take on Gordon Lightfoot's \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" (a song I never particularly cared for until now) is sung as almost a wistful prayer and as a reflection on what had to be an extraordinary life. There's some regret there, but there is also both resolve and resignation. <br /> <br />The same goes for the opening track, \\"Help Me\\".  <br /> <br />In DJ Radiohead's review of this CD, he makes the point that Cash's voice has never sounded more broken or heartbroken than it does here. I wholly concur. But I would add that on this song, as with so many others here, that Johnny Cash, fully aware of his own mortality, and impending meeting with his maker seems to be making peace with that in an almost prayer-like way. His voice creaks with resigned emotion here. It is the resigned voice of a man whose deep Christian faith framed him as a human being every bit as much so as did the wild, often hard life he lived as a younger man.  <br /> <br />Cash is not just aware of his mortality on these songs. He is also clearly looking to the hereafter. <br /> <br />Cash likewise turns Bruce Springsteen's rocking road song, \\"Further On Up The Road\\" from The Rising into another of this album's numerous lamentations on life and death. The musical arrangement of this song, with it's quietly strummed minor chords and occasional Dylanesque organ sweep, in particular compliments the sentiment here. An otherwise fairly minor track from the great Springsteen, here it becomes a statement that is both eerie and poetic at the same time. It's both tearjerker sad and remarkably beautiful. As with all these songs, Cash's interpetation opens up entirely new meaning than you may have heard in the version by the original artist. <br /> <br />On the other side of reflection of course comes redemption. In \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down,\\" Cash delivers a fire and brimstone sermon on accountability which implores the listener on the wages of sin \\"that as sure as God made black and white, what's done in the dark will be brought to the light.\\" He goes on to tell \\"the rambler, the gambler, and the back biter that sooner or later God's gonna cut you down.\\"  <br /> <br />If in the Christian faith Cash believed so deeply in, it's true there is sure redemption for the righteous following judgment (as the good book says), I suspect Johnny Cash and his beloved June are enjoying quite a reunion right about now. <br /> <br />This is without a doubt one of the saddest records I've ever listened to. If you cry at certain movies, you may need a hanky or two to listen to A Hundred Highways.  <br /> <br />It is also remarkably poignant and beautiful, and a fitting final chapter to one of the greatest stories in music history.  <br /> <br />As of this writing, it's the record to beat for Best Album of 2006. <br />
0375423877|3.0|This is an interesting novel, but I have to agree with some other reviewers that the writing is not up to the level of other PI fiction, e.g., novels by Sue Grafton, Marcia Muller, etc.  I would note that that author has previously writen children's books, and the writing style may reflect that.  The plotting is somewhat simplistic.<br /><br />Having said that, the characters are interesting, and the novel provides substantial information about Botswana where the author lived for a period of time.  The novel covers a number of cases, and the interesting ones are towards the end (insurance fraud, people's identities, and a missing child).<br /><br />I thought it was worth reading, but if you are used to the complexities of American PI novels you might be disappointed.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse always impresses me. This is some of the most original, creative rock music out there on the scene today. Matt Bellamy is one of the most talented vocalists on the modern rock scene right now. He uses so many timbres and textures with his voice. The music pulls from so many different influences. While there are obvious touches of Radiohead in the music, the songs rock a lot harder than Radiohead ever does. You can hear influences of classical, latin, classic rock and industrial/techno styles. The result is an amazing product with something huge to offer.<br /><br />The music is incredibly dynamic. The opening track, \\"Take a Bow\\" builds to an incredible apex of sound. The music is tinged with electronic garneshes of color. The thick arrangements are so well put together and every instrument fits into a beatiful picture. There are many great moments on this album, like the explosive drumming on \\"Assassin,\\" the latin-esque trumpeting and acoustic guitar in \\"City of Delusion,\\" the stunning piano work on \\"Hoodoo,\\" and the breathtaking overdubbed harmonies in the epic closing track \\"Knights of Cydonia.\\"<br /><br />This album is quite amazing. A wonderful addition to Muse's diverse catalog of exciting music.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" was one of my most highly anticipated films of 2005 so I was quite disappointed after seeing it in theaters when it was released. I felt that the editing was choppy, the story didn't flow right and the film was confusing in places.  This Director's Cut adds back the 45 minutes of footage cut from the original theatrical version and what a difference this makes!! <br /> <br />For one, the film was grand in scope but this cut makes it even more impressive!  It is one of Ridley Scott's best films (and with great films like \\"Gladiator,\\" \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" this is praise indeed). Secondly, the 45 minutes of add'l footage really adds more layers to the story and to character development. There is a part of the story that we didn't see in the original cut - specifically, Balian and his wife's backstory and Sybilla's relationship with her brother, husband and son (who was nowhere to be found in the theatrical version). This version especially boosts the characters of Balian (Orlando Bloom) and Sybilla (Eva Green) and makes the audience sympathize with them as we are given a closer look into their lives. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed the Director's cut of \\"The Kingdom of Heaven.\\" I would venture to say that it is almost a completely different film than the theatrical version. All the faults of the original cut were corrected and even improved on in this version and Ridley Scott did right by releasing this version on dvd for audiences to enjoy and also so that we can see what a great film this really is. It was unfortunate that he wasn't able to present his original 'vision' when this was first released in 2004. It would've been a contender for that year's Oscars if it did.  At least now audiences will be able to watch \\"The Kingdom of Heaven\\" as it was meant to be shown.
0553212478|4.0|A very popular word, Frankenstein has become an important part of Western pop culture.  I found the book to be very different from my preconceived ideas about Frankenstein.  The general thinking about Frankenstein is one of horror but this is not the focus of Shelley's novel.  This novel is about much more than just horror, and in fact, the horror aspect of the book was weak.  Some themes of the book include the relation of creature to creator, the darkness of human creativity, the selfishness of mankind, and the futility of human existence.  Overall, the book is very dark.  This edition of the book has a great introduction that explains the background of Mary Shelley's life which gives good insight into the book itself.  It seems as if the book reflects some of the author's own feelings and experiences.  Being such an important part of literature and culture, this is a must-read.

B000EQHHJW|5.0|Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's movie of Rigoletto was my first exposure to this wonderful opera...watching it again, years later, from the perspective of a seasoned Rigoletto(and Verdi) enthusiast, it still has the power to enchant, to revolt, to surprise, to overpower, to inform and to provoke thought on the strength of its dark interpretation, its psychological approach.    Let's not mince words here. The film is a baroque, profane and utterly garish spectacle. Some may be turned off by this. I find it appropriate considering the subject matter of the opera. For instance, Verdi might not have written the opening scene as an orgy per se, due to the Italian censors, but it is easy enough to interpret it that way, and Ponnelle pulls out all the stops. More power to him. This Salo-slash-Caligula-like feast is replete with disturbing imagery: rats crawling over dinner plates; countesses celebrated as objects of beauty who actually look like ashen spectres; half-dressed musclemen utilized as submissive display pieces; pretty maidens offered up as sacrifice to the Duke of Mantua's gluttonous appetites. Ugly? Perhaps. But perfectly in step with the opera's theme of destructive depravity. Likewise, having Sparafucile made up like a grotesque caveman adds to the concept that the world Rigoletto inhabits is surreal, nightmarish, the only island of hope in this inferno rests in the small upper chamber where his daughter Gilda resides. When even that oasis is violated, it becomes grimly apparent that the hunchback's whole world has fallen apart.    In his other opera films, Ponnelle likes to emphasize parallels among characters, and Rigoletto is no exception. First, we see a moment of realization on the face of Rigoletto when Monterone is issuing his curse over his violated daughter, wherein the court jester seems to recognize that if the same thing were to happen to his own daughter he would be just as vindictive. This closeup is a revelation of humanity, but also of culpability forthe multihued protagonist. Later, when Rigoletto first meets Sparafucile, they engage in a physical exchange that is choreographed to resemble a waltz, showcasing the similarities between the two characters, similarities discerned by Rigoletto himself in his ensuing monologue. Other incisive visual moments: the use of flashbacks, such as Rigoletto recalling Gilda at church, or the face of the angry count issuing his curse. In fact, the whole film is portrayed as a flashback, since it opens with Rigoletto mourning over his daughter's corpse. The medium of film affords Ponnelle the creative freedom to include these psychological touches in ways a staged production never could, and he does so successfully. For that reason alone, this film is recommended.    But let's not forget the other treasures to be savored here, primarily the performers. Pavarotti is in his vocal prime, that is all that needs to be said, I won't waste time glorifying a voice that needs no introduction. The real surprise here is his acting. He manages to turn his usually ruddy, cherubic countenance into something sinister and cannibalistic, and it's a side of the performer we rarely see onstage. The magnificent coloratura soprano Edita Gruberova is in peak form as Gilda, bringing a heightened intensity to the role but never at the expense of vocal beauty. Neither she nor Pavarotti look the part  exactly, but they make up for it through their precise vocalism and also through their ability to inhabit the bodies of their characters...I would have said inhabit their souls, but it is left in doubt whether the the duke possesses such a thing. I was unfamiliar with the baritone Ingvar Wixell, but his performance as Rigoletto is astonishing, pathetic, endearing, off-putting, fabulously sung, utilizing a voice that is both smooth and rich. I have mixed feelings about Riccardo Chailly's interpretation of the score. He plays up the bombast, the chilling loudness of certain moments, perhaps too much, althoughthe quieter moments are certainly not lacking in nuance. Still, I prefer James Levine's interpretation on the Met DVD release. I will say this for Chailly, he gives us an uncut version of the score. I'm not a big fan of the duke's oft-excised act two cabaletta, I think it is the weakest, most hackneyed moment of this otherwise inventive score, but I would rather have it than not, and Chailly actually presents us with both verses, a rare enough event(even the Levine version is cut down to one verse).     Some viewers might find Ponnelle's ghastly, decadent vision a bit over-the-top, but isn't opera in general over-the-top, particularly Italian opera from this era? Rigoletto's story is a wall-to-wall nightmare(of his own making; you lie down with dogs, dear Rigoletto...), and it is perfectly appropriate to present it as such.
B000002KOO|5.0|The first of what would become a list of memorable lineup changes for Fleetwood Mac came before the release of \\"Then Play On,\\" the group's third album in 1969.  The rhythm section of Mick Fleetwood on drums and John McVie on bass, the only constant in all of the various versions of the group (which is good since they gave the group its name), remains the same.  But joining Peter Green on guitar and Jeremy Spencer on slide guitar, was Danny Kirwan as second guitarist.  Kirwan would replace Spencer as the person writing most of the songs that Green was not providing.  However, this was certainly a portend of things to come because \\"Then Play On\\" would end up as Green's last album with the group he essentially founded.<br /><br />At this point Fleetwood Mac was a British blues band, and while their second album was mostly leftovers from their successful debut effort, \\"Then Play On\\" gets them back on track.  Green writes six of the thirteen tracks, including \\"Oh Well,\\" the best track on the album and a #2 hit single for the group in the U.K.  I know it qualifies as the first Fleetwood Mac songs I ever heard (\\"Sentimental Lady\\" would be the second, then we wait for Stevie Nicks to show up).  The rapid blues guitar riff qualifies as rock and roll to my ear, with every body stopping so Green can go a few lyrics before the instruments start crashing in again.  \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" has an even harder rock edge to the blues, while \\"Showbiz Blues\\" and \\"Before the Beginning us back to the more traditional slow down version of the blues.<br /><br />Kirwan gets the opening track, \\"Coming Your Way,\\" with its Cuban rhythms and dueling guitars adding to the musical mix on this album.  But his \\"Although the Sun is Shining\\" is certainly the track that takes the band in a decidedly different musical direction, not that uniformity is a good thing and this track would have fit perfectly on a Fleetwood Mac album from the glory pop years.  Kirwan takes his own stab at the blues with \\"Like Crying, Like Dying,\\" and the rhythm section even gets some song writing credit with McVie for \\"Searing for Madge\\" and Fleetwood for \\"Fighting for Madge.\\"  The net result is not as blue oriented as their first album, but instead of a lot of covers everything here is original material by the group.  If Green had not left the group because drugs were messing with his mind and been replaced by Christine Perfect soon-to-be McVie (who is playing on this album without credit), then we would be talking about Fleetwood Mac as one of the premier British blues groups and not as the darlings of pop rock and the tabloids.

6304712499|1.0|Comic book-to-movie adaptations generally come in two forms. The good (Spider-man, The X-Men) and the gawd-awful (The Punisher and the Fantastic Four - both pitiable versions of each).<br /><br />Thanks to New Line Cinema - the wonder studio that brought us the Nightmare on Elm Street classics - the live action Spawn falls confortably into the second catagory, with crappy, on-the-cheap production values, schlocky 'B' movie direction from hack Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute;, and seemingly decent actors hamming it up while spouting cheesy dialogue. Michael Jai White (Spawn) poses and growls a lot, spending the majority of the film encased in makeup that consists of a plastic head and a dirty trench coat. Nicol Williams (Cogliostro) is oooh-so mysterious, and Martin Sheen does his best William Shatner impression as Spawn's ev-il nemesis, Jason Wynn. The only person who seems to get it at all is the always impressive John Leguizamo, the absolute perfect choice to play Violator. Lequizamo tears into his part with a vicious glee no one else here can quite muster.<br /><br />I wasn't a big fan of the Spawn comic, but this mess is garbage, barely worth the one star rating, strictly for Leguizamo's performance. Maybe some day this franchise will find a creative team with the juice to get it film the treatment it deserves. Stranger things have happened.
B000301YY8|5.0|Last December, my daughter introduced me to Back to Bedlam, a newly acquired CD in her collection.  The powerful experience of my first listen has never left my heart, despite hundreds of repetitions.  Most striking about the music is the mellow, honeyed, sweet blending of sound; the simple melodies chime and resonate fully and richly and become part of my soul.  The music is alluring, addictive; his voice is hypnotic, haunting.  Personal feelings of loss become magnified and feelings of love become elevated through hearing the arrangements.  Blunt's music is often compared to that of Damien Rice and Elton John.  I disagree.  His sound is totally new, refreshing, and invigorating to my spirit.  The ballads touch a level of emotion in my center that chills me, ignites me, awakens and restores me. <br />     Significant within the CD is the natural, smooth flow of one song to the next.  Track one is a florid, uplifting melody called \\"High.\\"  Listening to this track early in the morning always sends the thrill of gratitude through me.  \\"Beautiful dawn - lights up the shore for me.  There is nothing else in the world, I'd rather wake up and see (with you).  Beautiful dawn - you're just blowing my mind again.  Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine.  High....\\" The next track flows into his most familiar song.  \\"You're Beautiful,\\" with its infectious melody and Blunt's lilting voice, tell the melancholy story of a \\"lifetime passing in seconds\\" (Rolling Stone) through a moment of eye contact with a former lover on the subway.  When he sings, \\"You're beautiful, it's true.  I saw your face in a crowded place, and I don't know what to do, `cause I'll never be with you\\", the sadness tears at my heartstrings.  Following \\"You're Beautiful,\\" \\"Wisemen\\" perks me up some with its catchy little tune, only to send me into the depths of despair with \\"Goodbye My Lover.\\"  When questioned about which song he was most proud of, James replied, \\"I like `Goodbye My Lover' because it's a really personal song and I recorded it in my landlady's bathroom in L.A.  She had a piano in there and for me listening back to it, it actually sounds like the voice I hear in my head.  It's so close to what I can imagine\\" (BBC).  I have never heard a more gut-wrenching song about lost love, lost dreams, and lost happiness. Every single word of the entire song extols the anguish of a broken heart.And then, in case we haven't had enough sadness, flowing right along is the wringing of \\"Tears and Rain,\\" where he sings about finding \\"comfort in pain.\\" <br />     At this point in the CD I'm ready to jump off the nearest tall building.  Happily, \\"Out of My Mind,\\" \\" So Long Jimmy,\\" and \\"Billy\\" saves the day by flowing into lighter, less-intense melodies, thereby breaking, at least momentarily, the spell of grieving.  These songs give us an emotional rest before \\"Cry\\" and \\" No Bravery,\\" both works inspired by his war experiences.  In \\"Cry\\" he laments, \\"I have seen peace, I have seen pain, resting on the shoulders of your name... I have seen birth, I have seen death, lived to see a lover's final breath...I have seen fear, I have seen faith, seen the look of anger on your face,\\" all the while assuring the friend that his shoulder is available to cry on.  The last track, \\"No Bravery,\\" is all about the agonies of war - death, destruction and despair.  Throughout the CD, the songs flow as life does:  up and down, with the peaks and the valleys that we all experience. <br />     Within the easy flow of the arrangements, there are only three songs on the whole CD that do not speak to me.  \\"Out of My Mind,\\" \\" So Long Jimmy,\\" and \\"Billy\\" all seem superfluous and difficult to understand; not only are the lyrics hard for me to comprehend, but also the rhythm of all three songs seems jumbled and confusing.  This is not to say that these songs are in any way inferior; they just do not resonate within me as powerfully as the rest of the tracks.  That being said, this smallpocket of less dramatic songs can be viewed as a welcome relief from the intensity of everything before and after.   <br />     Vital and refreshing, this new British artist has so much to give and to express -- creating dimension in our lives by helping us access feelings that can sometimes stay buried.  Blunt says, \\"I guess it's always nice to be able to capture your life's experiences in a song and hold the emotion in that way.  For me, this album is a diary\\" (BBC).  I anticipate that as he acclimates himself to life out of the military, his songs will reflect more of the day-to-day living and loving experiences that make up his present life. I am also certain that as he releases more CD's, his fan base will continue to grow.  I know that Blunt has much more to say and I am certain his many fans, myself included, look forward to his next release.
0962477060|4.0|This book is brilliant. With a lot of practice and a few headaches, the concepts in this book will increase your playing exponentially. How do I emphasize A LOT OF PRACTICE? Only get this book if you are willing to put in the work to learn the guitar! <br /> <br />Also, if you are truly seriously about learning, you will feel incomplete after this book so you should probably get the third one while you're at it; as you will know the guitar layout very well, but be still unsure about how to use it to your advantage. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this book to any person that wants to take a very well organized and understandable guitar college course in a book(including the hours of homework). Hope this review helps! Good luck.
B00004RXVR|5.0|i  want  to  see   adams   butts
B00000IPAX|5.0|Enema of the State is blink-182's breakthrough 1999 album. It defitlnly put them into heavy mainstream and boosted their populatarity alot. This album is very fun loving and funny and shows a side of mark and tom that is not showed these days. I really enjoy this album because all the music flows and the band were acctually good friends back then. Also the instrumental has improved since some of their earlier albums.  <br />Enema of the state combines catchy pop guitar licks with the soothing voice of mark and the edgy more rough voice of tom and the talented but repeated drum beats of Travis Barker.  <br />Here is the track listing. <br /> <br />1.Dumpweed : A great starting song. As soon as you put on the cd .. BAM theres a blistering note that leads to a catchy lick and follows through with a fast pull-off riff.  the chorus is strong and the songs all good. I would rate it as an 10/10. <br /> <br />2.Dont Leave me : a song about not wanting to be left alone. Not much to the instrument but very catchy and a clasisc pop tune. 8/10. <br /> <br />3.Aliens Exist : This songs pretty great . The lyrics acctually make sense and there a point to the song. 7.5/10. <br /> <br />4.Going away to collage : this song is really aweosme. It kind of represents the whole blink-182 sound. it starts clean and follows through with a very simple but thoughtfull guitar riff. Marks voice sounds very clean and smooth but still provides the right feel for the song. The lyrics are kind of sad but the tune is happy and upbeat. 8.5/10. <br /> <br />5. Whats my age again: One of the biggest hit songs on the album. The lyrics are pretty funny. And the instrumental is moderalty challenging complared to other songs. Its about being immiture and getting dumped over but frankly not  caring too much.Also the video features the guys running through LA naked. Its sweet.7.5/10. <br /> <br />6.Dysentary Gary : Flippin sweet song!! its starts out with a poppy fast paised lick and mark and toms voice flowvery well together . The chorus is steady and very complete. And the bridges are clean and realy cool to lisitn to. Its pretty much about girls being bitches and friends being idiots. 10/10. <br /> <br />7. Adams song : its about suicide. its a more serious song on the album. I like it becuase its a change and fun to play on guitar. It has a nice dark , deep  feel to it . 8/10. <br /> <br />8.All the Small things: its probably the most memorable song of blinks but i think its the gayest song on the album. Thats all i have to say. 6/10. <br /> <br />9. The party song : Well its a bout a PARTY!!!!!but its also about finding out about what parties are all about. its a killer song very fast paced and the lyrics are guioness and funny too.  <br />The only problem is the verse doesnt have a very good tune. But the chorus delivers very well. 7/10. <br /> <br />10. Mutt: Featured on the american pie soundtrack. Aweomse song. Bass and drums intro and then the guitar comes in. Its about a couple who are basically sex hounds and its unnecesserary. the lyrics are great.The tune is great. 8/10. <br /> <br />11.Wendy Clear: Defitnly a great song. Marks voice sounds amazing on the verse. And the song has a great feel to it. I dont understand the lyrics but i dont pay attention to them on this song. The harmony on the voice really makes this song effective and catchy. 10/10. <br /> <br />12. Anthem : Great lyircs. Neat Guitar. And Amzing hi hat work by Travis.Its a teenage anthem aboujt hating parents , playing with a band, and what not. 9/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0895260131|5.0|I have lived in Japan and Germany. I met many wonderful people. However, at one time these countries were controlled by not good folks. Folks that did not play well with others. Voices of reason within were killed off and wars followed.<br /><br />  I guess it is the same in the Middle East, that there are no public voices of reason. The darkness that fills their rulers has a name.

B00000DRYI|5.0|i know many of you rockers, as with most of my own buddies, think Blizz' is a better release than Diary, but your only kidding yourself. first off, the engineering and recording of this one is superior to that of Blizz'. second, the musicianship far exceeds that of Blizz'. thirdly, listen to the solos in these tunes. Rhoads outdoes himself on this album (over the mtn., believer are a couple of examples). still not convinced? ok, listen to the lyrics. much more polished and refined than what Blizz' offers up. and, of course, Ozzy himself. his singing is much smoother and balanced on Diary, maybe due to the better engineering, but still an upgrade from Blizz'. in my opinion, a much better listen. i have all of the Ozz man's offerings, and yes, i love Blizzard as well, but i feel Diary has always been the ugly step sister to Blizz'. are you convinced now? i didn't think so. neither are my buddies. peace.
B00003CXWV|4.0|This is one of those movies that had no immediate appeal to me and I never planned on seeing it. Then one day I find myself watching it and being riveted by the story and Johnny Depp's performance. <br /> <br />Depp plays George Jung who according to the film hooked up with Pablo Escobar and the Colombia drug cartel to bring cocaine into the U.S. Jung was responsible for the cocaine explosion in the 70s and 80s by providing a better product than had been available before. Jung makes millions, gets married to a crazy latin woman played by Penelope Cruz and is living (no pun intended) the high life. <br /> <br />Eventually there are plenty of betrayals and paranoia and Jung gets out of the business and tries to live a normal life with his wife and daughter. But when he needs money he goes back to the only thing he knows, smuggling coke which leads to several arrests, the last with a sentence of 60 years. <br /> <br />I guess part of the reason that movies like this are fascinating is that you know there are people like Jung out there doing these things, but its enlightening when you get to see how they did it and the effect it had on their lives. Jung is portrayed in the film as a decent guy who loves his daughter deeply but who can't stop making stupid decisions that ruin his life. <br /> <br />The performances are very good throughout and the movie moves along at a brisk pace until the last act when it slows some.
B00005JKGK|5.0|\\"The Joy Luck Club,\\" in my opinion is about as close to a perfect movie as I have ever seen. I would not hesitate to give it ten stars out of a possible ten. The mostly Chinese American cast is absolutely superb in their performances. My favorite character is June, the daughter of Suyuan. At the beginning of the movie, her friends and family have gathered together before she is about to go to China to meet two sisters she did not realize she had until after her mother died. <br /> <br />   The movie centers around four Chinese women and their daughters. The experiences of the women in China, apparently between the two world wars, were often filled with sorrow and suffering. Their stories are told in Chinese with English subtitles. The experiences of the women in China as young girls and young women strongly influenced how each of them raised their daughters in the United States. <br /> <br />   I have only a couple quibbles with this otherwise outstanding movie. One is that the women, as young females in China during the 1930's, are occasionally unusually bold in asserting themselves with men who oppress them. While, as a feminist and a very strong believer in completely equal rights based on gender, I generally applaud most of their actions, it does not seem historically realistic given the unfortunate pervasive second class citizenship of Chinese women during that time period.  <br /> <br />   \\"The Joy Luck\\" is a great film in all respects, the peformances by the actresses, the general storyline, the cinematography and the music. This is a movie I can watch over and again, enjoying very much on each occasion. <br /> <br />   The ending to this movie when June meets her two sisters, apparently in Shanghai, is a great scene and very moving, one of the best endings to any movie I have ever seen.
0689865384|5.0|I enjoyed the trilogy as did my wife and 12 year old daughter. Westerfeld does an excellent job of keeping you engaged and wanting to read the next chapter. The science is good, it's believable, and he's consistent.<br /><br />It's a very enjoyable read and escape.  I'd give it as a gift and buy it again.
B000F5GNX8|3.0|Don't you hate it when a movie character also serves as the narrator, continually interrupting the film to tell us what he forgot to tell us a minute ago or to throw in general smart remarks?  Of course you do.  We all do.  So why do directors keep doing it?  I assume there is supposed to be some level of spoof-iness to this film, though, so I'll just leave it at that.  I generally enjoy dark comedies, but I just didn't find Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang to be at all funny.  There are plenty of comical situations, but actual moments of comedy are few and far between.  Maybe it's just because I don't like Robert Downey, Jr. (who, along with all of his well-documented problems, basically ruined Alley McBeal single-handedly).  Then again, maybe I shouldn't complain - after all, I only watched this movie because Michelle Monaghan looked all kinds of hot in that little Christmas outfit of hers.  The problem is that the film tries to be even cuter than Monaghan - and it's not even close.<br /><br />So what do we have here?  I won't go too deeply into the plot because it's designed to be full of twists and turns.  Robert Downey, Jr., plays Harry Lockhart, a common thief who accidentally auditions for a movie as he is trying to evade the cops.  Next thing you know, ole Harry's in L.A. preparing for his acting debut.  While attending a party, he makes a human punching bag of himself for a girl (thereby ensuring he can never return to New York, since they don't let you back in if you get beaten up by Richie Rich); apparently a glutton for embarrassment, he then pursues that same girl, Harmony (Monaghan), later on that night, never even realizing - until she tells him - that she is the girl he was in love with back in high school.  Let's just pause here for a second.  Who in the world would not be able to recognize the girl whose beauty haunted him day and night during his formative years?  It's not like seventy years have passed since he's seen her.  Don't even get me started on what he does next.  But I digress.  Actually, this is where it all starts to get tricky.  Harry starts tagging along with the aptly named private eye Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) in preparation for the detective role he's supposed to play, and he quickly finds a lot of things happening in real life that aren't supposed to happen in real life - such as corpses turning up at the rate of one per hour.  The whole thing turns into this huge mess involving Harmony, Gay, several mystery guests, and just about everyone Harry's ever met in L.A.  With pieces falling into place at odd moments, and plenty of dead ends along the way, expect more twists and turns (and bumps) than you'll find on an old, washed-out mountain road.<br /><br />To me, the movie just doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  Well, I guess it wants to be a dark comedy, but most of the comedy falls flat, in my opinion.  Screwball comedy needs more than just screwballs.  I blame the script because the acting really isn't that bad.  The whole thing's just too cute and obvious for its own good, especially the increasingly irksome narration bits.t he does next.

B000E41MS6|5.0|It is so good to see Dr. Who again-- and completely new episodes as well. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper make a terrific duo as the lonely doctor has to wrestle with the knowledge that he is the last living Time Lord. <br /> <br />The episodes in the first season all intertwine beautifully, with familiar characters popping up throughout. The only complaint I might have-- and it's a small one-- is that I would like to see some episodes that are not so earth-centric. However, that in no way detracts from the fabulosity of the new series! <br /> <br />It is good to see that they have retained most of the elements of the classic series-- the new TARDIS does take some getting used to, but by about the fourth episode, it grows on you. <br /> <br />It is absolutely smashing! (And I must say, it was quite interesting to see the Doctor actually engage in his first televised kiss!) <br />

0743454537|4.0|I always like it when authors tackle tough issues, and this one was a toughie for sure. I loved how I got to know every character from their own point of view and from everyone else's point of view as well. By the end, I understood where all of them were coming from, even the ones that weren't necessarily \\"sympathetic\\" characters. <br /> <br />The thing that I keep coming back to, though, is that the book needed to end a few chapters earlier than it did. I can't really say why here without giving everything away, but I'll say I thought the last few chapters were a real copout and I would have been happier with the book if it had been left more open-ended. This is not a happy ending kind of issue, I know, but it's also not one you can tie up in a neat bundle at the end, and I think that's what the last few chapters tried to do. The result seemed contrived.
B000065U1N|2.0|To the east of Mogadishu is the Indian Ocean and to the west is the African continent. In this movie, sunrise and sunset are both to the east. DOH! Never mind detail blunders like a 50 caliber gun shown closeup as an M60, or the C2 Blackhawk shown by Orion surveillance above as a Huey, or the Somali mobs shown at high noon while Hoot's Humvee is shown at late afternoon at the same time, most people would not notice. They can fool us with pyrotechnics here but not with celestial bodies.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Walk The Line is a well crafted movie featuring exceptional performances.  It's long, and there are whole sections where little seems to be happening, (or worse, the same things seem to be happening over and over), but it's worth it for two short scenes.<br /><br />The first is when Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) cleans up his act (for the moment) and walks onto the Folsom Prison stage a fully formed star.  At that moment he is in complete command of his technical abilities and sense of self.  He is contrite and cocky, even feisty, and gives his audience exactly what they want and need.<br /><br />The other is almost antithetical.  June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is alone on stage, bathed in a blue spotlight.  She is performing Wildwood Flower, accompanying herself on autoharp.  Her tone is clean and open, this is a woman who grew up in music, the stage is where she feels most comfortable.  She doesn't dazzle, she merely gives.  Wildwood Flower is an example of purely beautiful Appalachian folk music, a far cry from the ersatz Elvis eyewash forming the foundation of Cash's early career.<br /><br />Though strong, the film has major flaws.  For one, country music itself is almost a total write-off, it's borderline unlistenable.  Next, Cash was never much of a singer, which explains his tuneless mumbling.  The Man In Black was also just an average guitarist, although he did pen a few catchy songs.  June Carter, by contrast, was a treasure and Reese Witherspoon's performance is nothing short of amazing.  Witherspoon captures all of Carter's ebullience, energy, and sheer charm, without ever seeming artificial.  This raises another point.<br /><br />Lately it's fashionable for actors playing musicians to do their own singing, presumably in an attempt to lend authenticity.  This charmingly idiotic conceit is exclusively predicated on thespian vanity.  (Does James Brown perform Shakespeare In The Park?  Think about it.)  Film is artifice, acting is artifice, why intersperse documentation?  In fact, having Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon lip-synching would be more, not less, authentic.<br /><br />Another drawback is that the story, however accurate, is a weather beaten cliche.  A tormented kid of humble means and limited emotional resources fails to navigate the corridors of fame successfully, falls, and gradually pulls himself out of the gutter a sadder but wiser man.  It's beyond tired, it's plug-and-play.  Of course, the Johnny Cash story is already well known so this paint-by-numbers exercise is even less surprising than usual.<br /><br />Biopics leverage pre-existing fame and convert it to income, after all, the advance work is done.  Since there are no surprises to be had, the only question is - is WTL well done?  Fortunately, the answer is yes.  Phoenix and Witherspoon both dazzle.  Had Cash been more than a two-chord picker boasting a deep baritone and a vocal range almost approaching one full octave, had he, for example, been an actual artist with something worthwhile to say and an interesting way of saying it, it would be easier to care about his simplistic obsession with self-destruction.Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon lip-synching would be more, not less, authentic.

1400079179|5.0|The Da Vinci Code<br /><br />The highly acclaimed Da Vinci Code (written by Dan Brown) was published by Corgi, and has been subject to much controversy due to its daring and even slightly blasphemous content.<br /><br />The New York Times best seller tackles such delicate issues as the authenticity of the Bible, as well as portraying the Church as a sinister organization, riddled with bribes, blackmail and organised crime.<br /><br />The epic murder-mystery style book begins with Robert Langdon (fans of the author may recognise him from Angels & Demons) being woken at an obscene hour by an urgent phone call. True to Dan Brown's writing formula, a significant curator at the Louvre Museum has been discovered by the authorities, dead. As a religious symbologist, Langdon was called in to examine the incongruous array of ancient symbols surrounding the recently deceased.<br /><br />As you may have deduced, the Da Vinci Code is set in contemporary Paris and throughout the book, fords the channel to Great Britain. And, after several revelations, high-speed, cinematic car-chases, and encounters with a formidable albino monk, the book reaches its climax in the heart of Westminster Abbey.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Harvard professor Robert Langdon, whose enthusiasm and determination to decipher the many codes and riddles scattered throughout the book, and keep his friends from harm's way proves vital to the intricate plotline.<br /><br />The enticingly enigmatic Sophie Neveu also plays a critical role in the plot. Being the granddaughter of Jaques Sauni&egrave;re (the recently deceased curator), she was always destined to be implicated in the post mortem. On top of this, she is also in the employment of the French Judicial Police via the cryptology department.<br /><br />As well as being Jaques Sauni&egrave;re's granddaughter, Sophie is also the sole heir to the Priory of Sion (an ancient secret society, founded to guard an ancient, sacred secret)'s key to the whereabouts of the Holy Grail. The reason for this is that Jaques Sauni&egrave;re was a significant member of the Priory. Sophie did not, however, realise this until too late, as she had not made contact with him in ten years, due to a childhood memory which still haunts her throughout the five hundred and ninety three pages of the book.<br /><br />One particular moment which embedded itself in my mind, took place at the Zurich bank. The scene's action sparked off when the volatile bank manager (Andre Vernet) makes the rash decision to aid and abet the two fugitives (Langdon and Sophie) in evading the clutches of the French authorities. A series of transfixing events ensue, each one more unanticipated and unforeseeable than the last.<br /><br />Told in third person through the eyes of Robert Langdon, this gives the book a flavour of realism and makes the reader feel more involved in the events that unfold. There are short periods throughout (a few paragraphs), when the story is seen via Sophie Neveu's point of view, but these instances are few and far between. This switch in perspective contributes to the book, by allowing the reader to observe events from multiple points of view.<br /><br />The narrator is constant throughout, but a few chapters are told in flashback style. Several events are related by characters in the book themselves i.e. reminiscing.<br /><br />The language used is vivid, and the author's vocabulary is vast and varied. Due to the nature of the book, a variety of technical terms are used to enhance the reader's comprehension of the plot. Don't worry however, as the terms and diagrams are always reader-friendly and nearly always explained in further detail in parenthesis or a side-paragraph. The author has one noticeable tendency though; repeating verbs. For example, Dan Brown describes Sophie's Smart-Car as being \\"gunned\\" forward repeatedly in neighbouring paragraphs. This caught my attention, in a bad way. The author's lucrative amounts of technicalexplanation more than compensate for the somewhat necessary lack of poetic description.<br /><br />The book is awash with riddles and puzzles, and the prominently English dialogue is occasionally mingled with French. Which is kind of inevitable, considering half of the book is set in France.<br /><br />The subtlety of language is used heavily in the many puzzles and anagrams laced throughout the book, as well as the author playing on natural human preconceptions. Bearing this in mind, I'd say that the book was written with adult readers in mind, and could scarcely be comprehended by a reader with a low attention span. The Da Vinci Code is, for the most part, an earnest book, that tackles some earnest issue. However, the text is occasionally spiced up by humour, usually in the form of a witty quip or flippant remark from an exasperated Robert Langdon. The text size of the Corgi edition of the Da Vinci Code (the edition I have in front of me) compliments the book perfectly; a small, yet legible size, which confident and independent readers should have no trouble coping with. Also, due to its length, it is printed on wafer-thin pages- rather like the Bible.

Bearing this in mind, I'd say that the book was written with adult readers in mind, and could scarcely be comprehended by a reader with a low attention span. The Da Vinci Code is, for the most part, an earnest book, that tackles some earnest issue. However, the text is occasionally spiced up by humour, usually in the form of a witty quip or flippant remark from an exasperated Robert Langdon. The text size of the Corgi edition of the Da Vinci Code (the edition I have in front of me) compliments the book perfectly; a small, yet legible size, which confident and independent readers should have no trouble coping with. Also, due to its length, it is printed on wafer-thin pages- rather like the Bible. This is also a congruent decision, as the plot practically revolves around the bible and Christianity. <br />Whilst reading the book, you might get the impression that the plot progresses at a crawling pace, however, this feeling is only emulated, because the plot consists of several intricately intertwined events, each unfolding in fast succession. <br />The book is a welcome mix of fantasy, reality and myth, and could therefore potentially be enjoyed by a wide a range of readers.
B00006JU7T|4.0|It was so refreshing to see a masterpiece of storytelling transferred to a brilliant film. The special features with directors et al was very enlightening into the integrity and balance of the film. I never thought about the great acting I kept thinking of them as real people and felt like I was a fly on the wall of this incredible and terrible series of events in the life of Serpico.I think that is the key - if your not reminded of their acting ability because you are so involved in the story it has to be great.Pacino was totally believable and authentic in this role and I personally find this my favourite role for him. So to wrap up the waffling all I can really say is regardless of the fact this film is 30yrs old (approx), it stands with precious few as remaining a brilliant and topically relevant film. Bloody fabulous.
B00005JOQS|5.0|This a worthy return for the Man of Steel after so many years. I found the background story of his five-year quest to find Kypton's last remains to be satisfying one. The use of Jor-el's voice from the first film reestablished mythic continuity. This is a film that shows respect for the character and what he represents. Indeed, the fact that an unknown plays the lead role strengthens this- there is nothing to remind you that this isn't Superman.<br /><br />The action is non-stop and the special effects are the best yet. The humor is a little thin, but there is some. Indeed, too much humor in the case of the second-coming of Earth's greatest hero might have been inappropriate. Instead you are presented with a sense of awe- at the man, at the myth, at what they represent deep-down in all of us.<br /><br />You leave the theater knowing why, deep-down, the world needs the ideal of Superman- and always will.

0060926112|5.0|I reread this little book before attempting to review it. I remembered that it was a mad mantra of transcendent power from the heart of hell, but I didn't remember how nondated it was. This work is fresher and more relevant than 99% of what passes for poetry today. How can something last nearly 50 years without going stale or becoming trite? How can it be even more real now? Maybe it is because Ginsberg ripped it live, screaming, and bleeding from a place beyond time and beyond space. He tore it from the living bowels of MOLOCH itself and showed it to HIM. After all, what does divine madness know of time?<br /><br />This poem is transcendence itself. It demonstrates that when you plunge into the deepest pit of hell it either kills you, or perhaps it burns out your insides so that you become a soulless zombie, OR you transcend it and rise howling to become a Mad Poet Saint who can truely encompass the Sacred in the Profane.<br /><br />Read this poem, and the others like America, A Supermarket in California, Sunflower Sutra, Wild Orphan, and In Back of the Real. It's almost frightening how relevant to daily life it is. If you didn't know it, you would never guess that it was written in the 50's. Of course Ginsberg does invoke, holy eternity in time holy the clocks in space the fourth dimension, in the Footnote. Maybe that's why it's timeless. As Cassady used to say, we know time, yes, we know time....<br /><br />I wish I would have been there for that first public reading in San Fran with Kerouac running around the audience passing the wine jug. On all the planes, the Gods themselves must have jumped back in shock as a flaming monkeywrench of living poetry was jammed through the spokes of the great quivering meat wheel of conception....
B000BCKFWK|4.0|Sin City is tremendous entretaiment,a good film but i don't think Sin City is better than other masterpieces works like Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill whoever i enjoyed  the movie as well.<br /><br />The acting i get some dissapointments like Brittany Murphy as Shellie in my opinion a terrible actress their better put another actress in future movies like Scarlett Johanson or Uma Thurman in roles like this,the main actors like  Bruce Willis,Clive Owen and Micky Roucke did a Hollywood worth oscars perfomances, Jessica Alba as Nacny did a good job no more no less well at least was better than her perfomance in Fantastic Four, also there is a lot great actors like the always georgeus Rosario Dawson(Rent), Nick Stall(Terminator 3), Micheal Clarke Duncan(Green Mile,The Island),Carla Gugino(Spy Kids Trilogy),Eliah Wood(The lord of The Rings Trilogy),Benicio Del Toro(21 grams,Traffic),Josh Harnett(Black Hawk Dawn, \\"O\\")  and many others.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning and very oringinal, i also see this type of visuals in movies like the movie \\"Sky Captain and The World Of Tomorrow\\",i gonna be glad if the new movies use this type of visuals, Frank Miller do the right thing to select Robert Rodr&iacute;guez as the director both make a spectacular direction and Quentin Tarantino was great as always whoever i really really hope he makes another appearance as special guest director in \\"Sin City 2\\"<br /><br />Story 9/10<br />Acting 8/10<br />Visuals 10/10<br />Direction 10/10<br /><br />Overall 9/10
0920668372|5.0|Not to mention how much we could love our children without any conditions. I always miss my mom every time I read this book to my 4-year old boy.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Great movie with complex storyline. You must watch the movie alone for full enjoyment. The movie also watches like a music video(Great late 80's sound which is a very unique thing with such awkward music). The movie also has plenty of rewatchablity as I have seen it 4 times this month alone. Highly recommended movie.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|It just doesn't get better than this...a long, great concert with all of their hits and new yet to be released, \\"No More Cloudy Days\\".  AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!
B000E97HIA|5.0|This album is wonderful! Funky, like all get out. Its elegant, fresh and classic Prince. I wouldn't be without it.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins (and research team) have written a book that combines the best of the different kinds of business books out there. It is for good reason that this book is a business school classic, and would unhesitatingly recommend it to almost anybody in business.<br /><br />Collins describes Great to Good as a prequel to Built to Last. I actually found it a much more interesting work, because I believe that the leadership principles in Great to Good also capture and/or explain a lot of the findings in Built to Last.<br /><br />The book studies eleven companies that went from Good to Great and stayed there for at least 15 years. It compares them with similar companies which did not achieve the same results. Collins and his team went in search of the magic \\"black box\\" which caused a company to make the jump. They found some ideas about leadership which they never expected to find. These ideas should shed a critical light on a lot of the notions about successful businesses that we still have today.<br /><br />In many similar business books, the research remains theoretical. It is interesting to read, useful for studying trends, possibly useful for strategy consultants-- but nothing else. Great to Good is as inspiring as it is interesting, and communicates ideas of leadership which resonate with common sense. I took away a lot of ideas that could help with my own career.<br /><br />Definitely worth reading!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album has the amazing ability to cause emotion within me and for me it's my favorite album ever.  From \\"Airbag\\" to \\"The Tourist\\" this album changes pace and every song is great, although I would have preferred the band putting \\"Lift\\" on the album instead of \\"Fitter Happier\\".  Favourite tracks: Karma Police, Paranoid Android, Lucky, Climbing Up The Walls, Let Down. <br /> <br />You should not listen to this if you have never listened to Radiohead before.  Start with The Bends because it is much more accessible.  This album also needs to be given more than one listen to click.  The songs are not overtly catchy, but once one gets into the album there's no turning back.  Also, it's a shame that this album only has 4.5 stars on this site.  A travesty.  Please rate this the five stars that it deserves.
B00005JOX6|4.0|It's a good thing that I liked the message of this movie and Kate Beckinsdale because otherwise it would have gotten rated lower, much lower. This review is from a guy's perspective because my wife liked \\"Click\\" better.<br /><br />Sandler plays a typical guy that works hard to provide for his family and forgets that they are the priority and not his job. In this case he's an architect vying for partner while working for David Hasselhoff playing a slimy, demanding, boor of a boss.<br /><br />He doesn't have time for his wife, played by the stunning Beckinsdale. He doesn't have time for his caring parents, played by Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner. Nor does he have time for his kids, played by numerous actors and actresses according to their age at the time.<br /><br />Frustrated because he can't find the remote to change the channel even though there are half a dozen on the table he storms out in a fit of rage searching for a \\"universal remote\\" that can control all the electronic gadgets he owns. On his quest he meets \\"Morty\\" played by Christopher Walken and gets his remote. Only later does he realize that it really controls his \\"Universe.\\"<br /><br />What follows are scenes of a guy being the stupid, moronic, and juvenile guy that Sandler is known for. In the end the message is delivered and you feel like you were just bludgeoned by a movie.<br /><br />See this movie if you can get in the theater at a matinee price or wait to rent the dvd. It's mindless entertainment that has a worthwhile message but the delivery isn't really worth the cost of a full price movie ticket.<br /><br />- Kevin Decker<br />p.s. I give kudos to Sandler for wanting to spread this message, because it does need to be heard.
0553801503|3.0|A Feast for Crows is a decent novel by an author from whom we've learned to expect greatness. The book's problems are two-fold. First, we've seen the introduction of many new characters that we don't care about. Second, the story focuses on minor characters. It seems that Martin has come down with a case of Robert Jordanites. <br /> <br />Still, I enjoyed the chapters on Cersei and Jamie. Hopefully Jamie has learned that his sister is no good for him and that he needs to hook up with his one true love, Brienne.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|There is one reason I gave this movie a 4 and not a 2 or 3.  Stephen Chow.  Is he not the coolest guy on the planet, or what?<br /><br />Now the movie itself I think would have been more enjoyable had I known what the hell was going on when the action hit.  The final fight is a special effects masterpiece, but nothing more.  I thought it was nice bringing old school high kicker Bruce LIang out of retirement to play the beast.  Overall I thought it was one of Stephen Chow's weaker efforts.  I highly recommend Shaolin Soccer over this.<br /><br />The dvd is a really good release and has a commentary with the cast  on it.  You have to read as it is subtitled, but at least you got something.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This is one of Enya's best works.  I love to listen to this sensual, mellow music.
B000089CJI|5.0|This album is worth anyones time and money.  It doesnt matter if you arent into indie or techno or even Death Cab.   <br />\\"Give up\\" has a totally unique sound, uplifting beats, and the most beautiful lyrics.   <br /> <br />\\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" - Very poetic. There is a soft melody and the song paints a sad, beaufitul image in your mind. <br />\\"Such Great Heights\\" -is so amazing, with lyrics like \\"I've been thinking its a sign/ that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images/ and when we kiss theyre perfectly aligned.\\"  <br />\\"Sleeping In\\" - This song is great as well, it has some great ideas.  Light and easy to listen to. One of my favorite lines is \\"Last night I had that strange dream where everything was exactly how it seemed\\"  <br />\\"Nothing Better\\" - If i had to desrcibe this song in one word I would say \\"trippy\\".  Its upbeat and busy.  This song also features a girl's voice which is very pretty :] <br />\\"Recycled Air\\" - It's a sleepy song that really speaks to me.  The singing is soft and sweet. <br />\\"Clark Gable\\" - Brilliant.  The lyrics really stand out in this song they tell a clever, beautiful, sad story. <br />\\"We will become silhouettes\\" - I find this song very distinct.  It has a less techno sound to it, and not as many perky beeps and bops as the other songs. It's really different. <br />\\"This place is a prison\\" - Somehow this song pulls of being dreary and beautiful at the same time.  Sad and surreal. Some of the great lyrics in this song are \\"I know theres a big world out there like the one I saw on the screen.\\" <br />\\"Brand new colony\\" - This song is everything; unusual similies and romantic.   <br />\\"Natural Anthem\\" - Mostly instrumently, it's actually very suspensful.  The few lyrics that are in this song are amazing as usual.  Natural Anthem is a masterpiece, unique and thought provoking. <br /> <br />Give this album a try, PLEASE. <br /> <br />
6305907145|5.0|Okay, it may not follow the book exactly, but it's not all that far off, and it's an excellent, throughly enjoyable Austen experience.  IMHO, the casting is superb.  When Lindsay Duncan awakens to see her husband returned from a long trip, she interprets Austen's words in a way that made me understand her character much better than I ever did reading the book. Excellent movie!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This is my 2nd purchase of this great CD because I have given the first one away to someone who loved it.  Madeleine is a great singer.  It's a CD that I listen to all the time.
B000001FTH|5.0|Grace is fasinating. She's such a legend, rightfully so. There's something about her music that keeps me coming back. \\"Island Life\\" is a retrospective, and a very good one. I love everything about it. Especially her cover of \\"La Vie En Rose\\" by Edith Piaf (which is one of my favorite songs ever.) The album artwork is also perfect. Very creative. Perfection.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|This movie was very good.  Well writen, and a very well put together continuation of the first movie.  I liked both of the Underworld films, but I liked this one more because it had more action scenes and it elaborated more on what was said in the first.  This is a must buy for anyone who likes the supernatural.
B000002GY9|5.0|If you just got done reading Bukowski and you're in the mood for some music, this amazing piece of work will be perfect.  <br /> <br />You can believe all the rest of the reviews about this album. <br /> <br />PS-If you're wondering who Bukowski is and you already like Waits, I suggest you try \\"Ham on Rye\\" by Bukowski.

B00004C8TC|4.0|Radu lupu, now 66, has had a cult status since his debut on disc forty years ago, and the fact that he is reclusive and elusive seems to help. He walks on water as far as The Gramophone is concerned, and since his fans demand total devotion, it's hard to look at Lupu objectively. He belongs to the classicist side of the piano family, headed by Alfred Brendel, where good taste and restraint are the order of the day. brendel I find brittle and dull, but there's no denying his huge reputation. Lupu is capable of being mannered and fussy; to his devotees this is pure poetry.  but if there is wisdom in crowds, it's worthwhile for a non-fan like me to check in every once in a while, just in case my reaction changes.<br /><br />Originally this pairing of the Schumann and Grieg concertos set my teeth on edge; from the first bar Lupu cannot ehlp but tinker with every phrase. However, relistening has made this less irritating - after all, Schumann's piano music asks for expressive liberties if anyone's does. I was also buoyed by the enthusiastic playing of the LSo, captured in delicious sound by Decca - Previn was capable of bringing out the best in these players once upon a time. The album was released in 1974 when Previn and the LSO were having a honeymoon and lupu was under thirty.  Compared to his later self, the fussiness is kept to a minimum, and the pacing in the Schumann is always strong, never lagging or sagging. The slow movement brings out the pianist's refined touch; it's the movement that engaged me the most. Restrained readings of this score tend to lose steam in the finale, depriving the listener of needed contrast with the first two movements, which can seem like much of a muchness in tone and theme.  Lupu and Previn generally heed the composer's marking of Allegro vivace, although without the spirited energy of a Serkin or Richter.  In all, a better performance than I remembered.<br /><br />The Grieg interests me much less as music, and with only two recordings on my shelves after five decades of collecting (they are by Gieseking and Richter - the latter is unsurpassable) I can't be counted as a fan. amazingly, the original Gramophone reviewer actually chided Lupu for not obeying the letter of the score and delivering a conventional reading. I disagree - Previn and the orchestra remain enthusiastic, and Lupu applies his refined phrasing to thrice-familiar melodies, giving them renewed freshness and interest. I was surprised and delighted to discover that my reactions have shifted this much, but there you are.gs on my shelves after five decades of collecting (they are by Gieseking and Richter - the latter is unsurpassable) I can't be counted as a fan. amazingly, the original Gramophone reviewer actually chided Lupu for not obeying the letter of the score and delivering a conventional reading.

B00005JOQS|5.0|I've seen both the 3D IMAX and the regular version.  Two small but very important scenes are missing in the regular version.  I loved the movie, but it is more romantic than action packed.  I'd say it reminded me of the second Star Wars, more of a bridge to the next movie.  When it comes out in DVD buyers will need to make sure they get the complete version.
B000A59PMO|5.0|It's an excellent show,  When it first came on TV my husband told me I would like it and I just did not have time for another series in my life.  So this summer I caught a few reruns then I bought it.  I probably watched the whole season in three days and have already pre-ordered season two

B000063DFQ|5.0|This was the first album I ever bought by Iron Maiden, and it hooked me, as it did many folks of my generation. I own 2 cd versions of this, and a cassette version. I also have parts of this on Vinyl.  This was the second album with Bruce, and the first with Nikko.  The combination together is awsome.  Tracks to catch: \\"Flight of Icarus\\", and \\"The Trooper\\".  Overall the whole album is flawless the whole way through, but these two tracks are the ones that just sink their hooks into people and draw them into the Legion of Eddie.  This is one of the two must have albums by maiden.  Somewhere in Time is another \\"can't live without\\" albums.  Seventh Son is decent (most successful commercially), but Not at the revolutionary level of Piece of Mind.  Maiden at their prime.

With powerful tracks like Stranger in a Strange Land and Wasted Years  that catch you with their melody and have you humming the tune all day long, this album marked the beginning of the worldwide domination of Iron Maiden as the Leaders of the NWOBHM.  Anyone just getting into Maiden has to have this album, but only after buying \\"Piece of Mind\\".

With her father, who is shunned by the Nazi party for his sympathetic actions toward Jews, she learns to read the books she steals, while befriending some unlikely characters.

0385513755|5.0|Robert Langdon, professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard University in Cambridge, is on a business trip in Paris when he receives and urgent late-night phone call from the French police. It seems that Jacques Sauni&egrave;re, the curator of the Louvre, was found dead inside the museum. Because Robert had a dinner appointment with Jacques, he turns out to be the obvious suspect. Even more, when certain riddles at the crime scene and on the body of the diseased directly point to the American professor, there is only one way out for Robert: flee and try to prove his innocence. Luckily he gets help from an unexpected source: the gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu. Together they discover things that not everyone would like to become public domain. No matter what it takes, those force will stop at nothing to prevent Robert and Sophie to unveil the truth behind the Da Vinci code.<br /><br />Not often is a book destined to be the cause of a hype that has had such an impact as the Da Vinci code. But is this necessarily a bad thing? There must be a reason why a book manages to appeal to such a big audience? That reason is actually not so hard to find in the case of Dan Brown's most popular book. Indeed, it is well-written, action-packed and covers a subject that is not spared of any controversy. It is quite impossible to stop reading, once you have read the first chapter and that is certainly a good asset for a thriller. Throughout the story the reader gets certain insights into the origins of Christianity, information that would normally not reach such a big audience. It certainly has increased the interest of the audience in Christian history significantly. Been to the Temple Church in London lately? If you have you definitely know what I mean.<br /><br />Of course the book has its weaknesses. Not always is it easy to distinguish fact from fiction, but that should indeed trigger the reader to go and do some research themselves. The main characters of the book are indeed quite one-dimensional and do not trigger emotional involvement with many readers, but as long as the story manages to keep the momentum alive, who bothers. In conclusion, The Da Vinci code is an excellent read for on the train or on the beach, and that is often exactly what people want!eed quite one-dimensional and do not trigger emotional involvement with many readers, but as long as the story manages to keep the momentum alive, who bothers.

B000001LKY|5.0|I did notice that there is a bit of a proggier feel to Warriors on the Edge of Time (1975), especially in contrast to earlier efforts such as In Search of Space (1971), and musically appears to continue the format of Hall of the Mountain Grill (1974). The lineup on this album is similar to that on Hall of the Mountain Drill, with the exception of the subtraction of keyboardist Del Dettmar, and the addition of drummer/percussionist Allen Powell along with vocalist/sci-fi author Michael Moorcock. Busted for possession of drugs while on tour, Lemmy was arrested and subsequently fired by the band. As such, this was Lemmy's last album with Hawkwind before he went on to form Motorhead.<br /><br />This great album of space rock opens with the approximately 10'30\\" minute Assault and Battery>The Golden Void, which is ushered in with the pounding, chugging, Rickenbacker bass work of Lemmy, while keyboardist/violinist Simon House establishes swirling clouds of spacey mellotron pads. The rest of the band then joins in with the heavy, straight and double drumming of Simon King/Allan Powell \\"cutting through the clouds\\", along with the \\"rough around the edges\\" vocal style of guitarist Dave Brock and great flute work by Nik Turner. This combination of spacey synthesizer textures (at times it reminds me of Tim Blake's work with Gong), tons of mellotron, sometimes distorted electric guitar, and a thunderous rhythm section pretty much characterizes most of the album.<br /><br />The odd pieces Standing at the Edge, Warriors, and The Wizard Blows his Horn each feature a heavily echoed and electronically altered spoken word passage and present a stark contrast to the rest of the material. The Wizard Blows his Horn describes hissing \\"snow snakes\\" and other strange imagery, which segues into my favorite track, Opa-Loka. This piece is hypnotic, trance-like, and features a repeated phrase on the bass, which is doubled by the snare and bass drum.

0375830995|3.0|Alright, so the book started out good. The whole robbery was very funny and exciteing. Then he gets the first card and you think..well ok thats cool. He goes through the tasks on the first card, the first card tasks were by far my favorite. I mean it had me very interested. Then he gets his second card, and it was really exciting when he got it because two unexpected guest show up at his house and give him the card in a sort of rough way, but yet its a great part to read.  Then however, the tasks he is given on the cards dont seem to get any harder, and if you ask me many of them get less and less interesting to read. So i find my self getting more and more bored with the book and ready to just skip to the end.   The book had some good laughs and some exciting parts, but i just sort of got sick of it.  I thought it was predictable too. It just didnt seem like their was ever a big twist in the book that left you amazed and thrilled to read on.  The book wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  It did have, for the most part, very likable charecters. I guess i just was expecting a bit more of a thrill from the book.

0307276902|5.0|Okay let's forget about this whole scandal. If you want to read about it then read another review.<br /><br />This book is more than a novel. It is an experience.<br /><br />James Frey has the ability to let you in his brutal, honest, no-nonsense world and convey his every emotion to you through poetic, gritty, powerful writing. He talks about his life in a way that within the first few pages you feel like you've known him your whole life.<br /><br />This story is natural and raw. Frey is hardly ever optimistic about his life and what is to become of him, but this never makes the book too depressing. It is not for the reader who wants a sugar-coated Cinderella story, but for the reader who wants to look at the hellish, abysmal life of an addict and his at times equally hellish but also hopeful and beautiful road to cleaning up.<br /><br />His style will captivate you, his words will move you, and his story will no doubt make you look at your lifestyle- whatever that may be- and either be thankful for it or be inspired to alter it. At the end of the book you will feel satisfaction and sadness. Satisfaction from the gripping, beautiful journey you just took, and sadness that the journey is over.<br /><br />Bottom line: Beautiful and captivating. Frey doesn't want your praise or sympathy, but this doesn't mean you won't end up calling him a hero.

B000022TSH|5.0|Oscar Winning director Roman Polanski's (Best Director, 'The Pianist') \\"Chinatown,\\" is a complete, undisputed masterpiece from the great director. The movie is number 19 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 and won the 1974 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. I'm usually not a huge fan of AFI's picks (that's kind of a lie. Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Fargo, Unforgiven are some of my favorite films), but I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. Three time Oscar winner Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes, a private eye and former cop working in Los Angeles. Gittes is hired by a woman named Mrs. Mulwray to investigate whether her husband is having an affair. After investigating the man, who works really high up at the Water Company, he discovers that the man appears to be having an affair and the pictures end up in the newspaper.  At which point he meets Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway), the real wife of Mr. Mulwray; Turns out someone posing as her hired Gittes. Shortly after, Mr. Mulwray dies; But Gittes is unsatisfied with the cause of death, being an \\"accident.\\" As Gittes investigates further, he uncovers conspiracies, cover-ups, and several other plot twists that you still see echoes of in film 32 years later. That's right, this film is 32 years old. While watching it, I really did notice things (from dialogue to plot twists to plot line) that have been used in movies after this film. This movie is very influential. But it's also entertaining and genuinely surprising. Nicholson and Dunaway give some of their best performances and the dialogue is spectacular. Polanski is a very talented director when it comes to making audiences feel tension. Roger Ebert put it best \\"The whole movie is a tour-de-force.\\" Which is very very true. This is one of the best films I've ever seen and any film buff should agree with me.   I can not urge you enough to see this movie.    GRADE: A+

B000BMSTMS|5.0|I see that there are people here that think they know something about Korn and give them a 5 star rating and then bring them down.  See you on the other side has obviously the two songs that everyone knows Twisted Transistor and Coming Undone but if the people that bring them down would listen to the rest of the Cd, they would find that there are more than just 2 good songs.  Liar is a great song but since it is near the end of the cd some people dont get that far to listen to it and say the cd sucks right away because they are Hypocrites.  Another song on the cd that is good.  Hey you out there that think you are Korn fans and bring them down Johnathan wrote a song about you, Hypocrites.  The cd is good even without Head.  It just shows how diverse Korn can really be.  I would go and buy it you wont be disappointed.
B000002P5W|5.0|I love this album!! I just started getting into Jimi Hendrix last year and this was the first album I heard from him.  Every track on here is outstanding, but my favorites are \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\", \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\", \\"If 6 was 9\\" \\"Aint No Tellin\\",\\"Up from the Skies\\",and \\"One Rainy Wish\\".  Really the WHOLE album is good, definetly worth the money.  I have Electric Ladyland as well, but I prefer Axis:Bold as Love over it.  A lot of the lyrics I dont understand, but this doesnt take away from the musical experience that Jimi, Noel, and Mitch provide for the listener.

I play air-guitar,kick my feet,pump my fist,cry and smile at the thought of living my life to its fullest. When I listen to it,anything I dream of doing seems possible.

B00001QEE9|5.0|As a child one of my earliest memories of going to the movies was going to see Pinocchio.  I have seen many Disney films since then, but Pinocchio is still one of my favorites.<br /><br />For me at least what makes this movie stand above so many other animated movies is the story, and the characters.  The simple Italian fairytale of Pinocchio is really taken to the next level in this movie as we see the rich animation paint beautiful images across the screen.  From Gepetto's wood shop with all the clocks to Pleasure Island, all parts of the animation really surpass anything anyone could have expected.<br /><br />The characters are all interesting and well developed.  From Pinocchio to Monstro you get a real understanding of their personlities as well as their struggles.<br /><br />The Story though is what makes the film.  For a Disney film this is really a dark story.  I'm sure that Disney had a little pressure to comprimise the story to make it more \\"kid friendly\\"  but the fact that he stayed true to what he envisioned for this film really pays off in the end.<br /><br />In all the Disney animated movies made I would personally put Pinocchio in the top 3 just behind, The Lion King and Peter Pan.<br /><br />I think is would be a great movie for theater classes as it shows the perfect example of character and story development, and flawless animation perfection.<br /><br />Pinocchio for some reason hasn't really received the praise it rightfully deserves from Disney.  It isn't released that often and when it is, it's not to the same fanfare as other more recent Disney films, and that is unfortunate.  If you can pick this one up you should.

B00005JKNC|4.0|Why haven't people given this film more credit? Because it moves at a leisurely pace, and there are no great chase scenes with crashes and explosions? No fight scenes with wire-fu and impossible gymnastics?  <br /> <br />If some of the themes of The Majestic are cliched, it doesn't matter when the actors are so good at conveying their characters, and eliciting genuine emotion in the audience. But I guess it is just too much to expect a modern audience, raised on \\"reality TV\\" (which is about as fake as you can get), to appreciate subtlety and hometown values. Harumph!  <br /> <br />This film deserves at least four stars, maybe a bit more, in view of the truckload of gutless artifice that passes for art in Hollywood these days.
B00006JDVV|3.0|This isn't a classic fantasy film. It definitely owes much to the Mad Max films, set in a world where burned-out machines, rubble, ash-strewn landscape and a barely surviving keep in England represent what's left of England. Communications are down all around the world; dragons - real ones - have been on the rampage destroying everyone in sight; the band of survivors in the keep have no idea who's left alive in the entire world.<br /><br />Are they all that is left of the human race?<br /><br />Well... no. A band of marines with attitude and mean machines turn up with a hotshot plan to track down the main dragon - the one that they've deduced is the only male. All the dragons they've killed so far are female, so they work out that there must be but one male, and that he flies over all the dragon eggs to fertilise them. Kill the male, and the ever-worsening dragon problem is stopped in its tracks... because the main problem is that the darned dragons proliferate at a terrifying rate.<br /><br />Now... all of this sounds like an interesting film. Unfortunately, the script is mostly slow-moving inundated with clich&egrave;s and enlivened occasionally with dragon encounters. The directing is nothing above the ordinary, and the characterisations are very, very stock.<br /><br />There really are only two reasons to watch this film: Christian Bale (who is always worth watching) and the dragons, which truly are wonderfully portrayed. However, the dragons don't get very much screen time, and the overwhelming attention is placed upon character interplay, which is a pity... because character interplay is far too weak a thing in this film, and thus the film as a whole is more tedious than I'd expected.<br /><br />I purchased the DVD hoping for a better film, but in my opinion, this is more a \\"rent it\\" DVD than a \\"buy it\\" DVD.
B00005MP58|5.0|Having read the book, I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie when a friend of mine told me about it.  I was not dissapointed in the least.  In fact, this is one of the rare cases where I liked the movie better than the book, though I loved the book as well.  This movie was simply cast perfectly, and it followed the book better than perhaps any other movie I have ever seen.   <br /> <br />In short, it is the book come to life for you to watch.  The wit of Mr. Bennett, the rediculous smile of Mr. Collins, the utter rediculousness of Jane and Elizabeth's mother and sisters, and the optomism and friendliness of Mr. Bingley all are exactly as you imagine them when reading the book.  The acting is superb, and ever character plays their parts to perfection.  I enjoyed this immensly, and I imagine that you will too if you enjoyed the book at all.  I very highly recommend this over newer adaptations, which cut the book to pieces and ruin it. <br /> <br />Overall grade:  A+

B00005JP0A|4.0|Adapted from the book of the same name, The Devil Wears Prada tells the story of Andy Sachs as she navigates through the ruthless world of high fashion publishing.  <br /> <br />Andy, played by Anne Hathaway, is an idealistic young woman. A new graduate trying to be a serious journalist, she interviews for the assistant position as a last resort and she wins the position a million women would kill for despite her own lack of interest and aptitude for fashion. Hathaway provides an admirable performance full of humor and heart. Her character manages to maintain her idealism and view others through rose-tinted glasses even while she is pushed to conform to the fashion world around her. In her desperate effort to get things 'right' she loses herself in the process.  <br /> <br />Although The Devil Wears Prada is told through the eyes of Andy, the true star and center of the film is Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly. Miranda could have been played over the top but Streep delivers an underplayed, yet layered performance as only she can do. Outwardly calm and controlled at all times, she also manages to convey her character's fierce love for her children and admiration for Andy's intelligence and determination. There is also some wistfulness and sadness as she witnesses someone who is seemingly much like herself before her career became everything.  <br /> <br />Andy is guided through the world of fashion by supporting characters Nigel and Emily. The under-appreciated Nigel helps her develop a stylistic fashion sense despite being a \\"fat\\" size 6 while overworked, desperate Emily helps her learn her responsibilities as \\"the new Emily\\", the job Emily once held. Her boyfriend, Nate and friend, Lilly who serve to keep her grounded in her previous life, balance these characters.  <br /> <br />David Frankel does a wonderful job directing the film, providing both laughter and drama as Andy learns about the world of high fashion publishing and then learns its consequences. His montage showing Andy's progress is particularly well done while his admiration for the City of New York is clear as he guides you around the city, showing the energy around both those already established and those just starting out.  <br /> <br />The film is not without its faults. Primarily, being too perfect flaws the character of Andy. The idealism she comes to \\"Runway Magazine\\" with is barely challenged and never waivers. She never questions the goodness and integrity of those around her. Despite her college journalistic reporting, living in New York seeking her future and then working in this rarified atmosphere, she remains more innocent than should be possible. <br /> <br />However, it is an enjoyable film, providing fun, laughter and even a few tears. It is well worth viewing at least once if not more.

B000E41MS6|5.0|Let me just get this out of the way: no, I haven't seen the classic \\"Doctor Who,\\" okay? But the 2005 series is one of the best TV series I've ever seen. Even if you're not a \\"sci-fi fan,\\" it's such a well-produced show that you'll find plenty to enjoy. I'll give you two main reasons why. <br /> <br />First, the writing is superb. Many science fiction series fall victim to writers (and, no doubt, producers) who are primarily concerned with coming up with nifty plots and who don't want to be bothered with character. I don't know about you, but if the characters are two-dimensional, I'm going to lose interest pretty quickly. The 2005 \\"Doctor Who\\" scripts, however, are rich in emotion and character while also filled with drama, comedy, and adventure in near-perfect proportions. If great writing is more important to you than genre, you definitely have to watch this. However, if you are a sci-fi fan...well, you've probably already seen this; but if you haven't, watch it. You'll be glad you did. <br /> <br />Second, the two lead actors are incredible. Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor and Billie Piper as his companion Rose not only give compelling individual performances, but their chemistry with each other is magical. These two were meant to be onscreen together. My favorite scenes are Doctor/Rose scenes because of the joy of watching them interact.  <br /> <br />The Doctor could so easily have come across as campy or cheesy, but Eccleston makes him completely believable. He (Eccleston) displays a range he's not often given the opportunity to show and makes it clear what a complex character the Doctor really is. The Doctor has a vast amount of emotional baggage, and Eccleston nimbly shifts from heroic to stubborn to joyful to angry to melancholy to silly and everything in between. <br /> <br />Piper, not nearly as experienced an actor as Eccleston, more than holds her own. She's a talented young actress to keep an eye on. Rose is only nineteen but she's not intimidatedin the least by the Doctor, and she doesn't hesitate to tell him when she thinks he's wrong (nor he her). Piper, too, has range and believably fleshes out what might have been just a sidekick into the Doctor's equal in many ways. Rose has confidence, courage, and heart beyond her years, all ably portrayed by Piper. <br /> <br />I must also quickly mention Murray Gold's score, which is wonderful. I dearly hope a soundtrack release is in the works. Anyway, I could go on and on, but it would involve revealing spoilers. Suffice it to say that I've driven my family, friends, and coworkers nutty with my praise for the show, but it's so good I just can't help myself. Watch it for yourself and you'll see why. <br />

1559408855|5.0|Being a borderline fan/admirer of shock/exploitation films from the late 60's to the early 80's I'd known about Pasolini's film for quite a few years before actually getting my hands on a copy. <br /> <br />I hesitate to say that it was well worth the wait, but what I can say is that it's a film filled with disturbing images that I will never forget. <br /> <br />The film can be, and has been, interpreted in many different ways, two of the most popular: <br /> <br />(1) A film against fascism.  To depict tyrannical rulers as unsympathetic, cold, heartless beasts. <br />(2) A shock film.  Nothing more, nothing less. <br /> <br />Now, the people who believe the film to be nothing more than a quick shock film have obviously something wrong with them.  Pasolini was an artist of the highest degree, and this was his vision, his creation, his voice against fascism: that it absolutely destroys people in every form, mentally and physically. <br /> <br />One of the main aspects of the film that disturbs me the most is, as an existentialist, these men, the fascists, choose to do this out of their own free will, and enjoy every single moment, every minute, every second of it, with a greater degree of bliss than a fat kid in a candy store placed right next to a Burger King. <br /> <br />So, in summary, I sincerely belive that Salo is, without a doubt, one of the most powerful films of the last 50 years, and that if you're not moved in any way after viewing it, you've been utterly desensitized and have lost all credibility as a human being. <br /> <br />And on a side note, I can guarantee you that the majority of the people who declare Salo \\"oh, it's not so bad,\\" are the same hypocritical invalids who cry & moan about 'animal cruelty' in films, but are more than happy to watch human suffering, be it on some internet site, or film, you're just as bad as the fascists in this film.

0141439661|5.0|Being a fan of Jane Austen but never having read Sense and Sensibility, I approached this novel both nervously and excitedly.  Reading any work by Austen is a delight, but I was worried this one wouldn't be as good as some of the others I'd read.  However, I slipped into the language and time period effortlessly as I was introduced to the Miss Dashwoods and their plights of love and friendship.  This debut novel by Austen is light, witty, and charming, and a complete joy from beginning to end.<br /><br />Both Elinor and Marianne Dashwood have fallen in love, but as the story progresses, we discover that both are going to face unrequited feelings in their relationships.  Still, though slightly impoverished, the girls are taken under the wing of several friends who introduce them into London society and further the story with many twists and turns.  Elinor becomes entangled in secrets she would rather not know, and Marianne plays into the drama of her love relationship grandly.  As both girls come to realize what is really important, the story turns yet again and leads us into unexpected events.  This is a truly engaging tale, and a terrific introduction to all of Austen's works.  Recommended reading for all lovers of classics.
B000GRUMPU|4.0|When I first heard back in early 2004 that Wolfgang Petersen was planning a remake of \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" I was stoked. The 1972 film holds a special place on my personal favorites list because it was the very first film my parents took me to see (at the local drive-in, no less).    <br />  <br />The Irwin Allen classic has become a guilty pleasure for loyal fans. Over the last several years many of those fans (myself included) have thought that, in the right hands, \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" would benefit from a remake.  <br />  <br />And in Mr. Petersen the producers found the perfect filmmaker. How could the brilliant, visionary director of the claustrophobic classic \\"Das Boot\\" and the brilliant \\"The Perfect Storm\\" go wrong?  Combine the best elements of those two films with the classic tour-de-force survival story originally told by Paul Gallico in his 1969 novel and a new movie could become a critical and box office success.  <br />  <br />So with much anticipation I went to see \\"Poseidon.\\"  The long awaited remake is a tremendous spectacle that will keep you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire length of the movie.  <br />  <br />Petersen begins the film with one of the most stunning opening shots in recent film history: A 3-minute wrap-around of the grand luxury liner as she sails the Atlantic. What makes this scene so amazing is the fact that the ship doesn't really exist. The Poseidon is completely computer generated, yet when you see her up on that screen (accompanied by Klaus Badelt's excellent score) you can only be in awe. She is majestic and stately and puts a certain James Cameron boat to shame.  <br />  <br />We are then introduced to the main characters at a quick clip. Mark Protosevich's screenplay doesn't draw them very well, but I'll speak to that in a moment. Because just as I was starting to let the lack of characterization bother me, the mighty Greek God of the Sea lashes out at our New Years revelers and spins their world upsidedown in a heart-pounding capsize sequence that bests the original's by a mile.  <br />  <br />From there it's non-stop, edge-of-your-seat, hair-raising action as our rag tag group of survivors fight their way up the dying ship to find an escape, battling water and obstacles and more water along the way. Petersen's brilliant direction on the escape sequences will have you climbing the walls.  <br />  <br />As with most well done disaster movies it's the action sequences and special effects that save \\"Poseidon.\\" I recommend the movie highly and think that on my list of \\"popcorn flicks\\" this will join the original near the top. That is thanks in large part to Petersen, his computer and design crews, and a cast that did the best they could with the script they got.  <br />  <br />And it is that script where I find my sole disappointment. Why Warner Bros moved ahead with such a lackluster screenplay puzzles me. This had the chance to be a classic sea tale. Don't get me wrong. I wasn't expecting \\"Moby Dick,\\" but Paul Gallico's \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" is a superb story of survival at sea. It is deep in character study; dark and psychological and leaves the reader breathless.  <br />  <br />Unfortunately none of that transferred over in the 1972 film. When I read that Wolfgang Petersen would be at the helm of this new version I had high hopes that the dramatic human stories told in the Gallico novel would finally be told on the big screen. But it doesn't happen.  <br />  <br />In his review of this film Roger Ebert opined that he felt Petersen's heart wasn't in it. I don't think that was it. To me it almost seems like Warner Bros wanted \\"Poseidon\\" in the can sooner rather than later and were willing to sacrifice a strong story in order to get the film on screens by May 12, 2006. As a result the film is awkwardly edited at times - as if there had been a script there, but that it was jettisoned and then a hasty editing job done to plug the holes. It makes me wonder whether they purposefully threw away a potentially triumphant story for yet another piece of popcorn fluff.  <br />  <br />At this point it doesn't really matter, because the film is popcorn fluff. Mind you, it is well done, exciting, and thrilling popcorn fluff and I highly suggest you head give it a look. But, I just can't help but wonder \\"what if?\\" I'm afraid we'll never know, because it is highly doubtful that this story will be told again.

B000003TA4|5.0|Most of those who gave Nevermind one star have justified their evaluation by saying that Nirvana \\"sucks\\". This is hard to argue with, because it doesn't really say anything at all about the band, though it does say something about the reviewer's taste in music and possibly their age.  <br />The detractors who provided any form of cogent argument as to why this album is bad say that Nirvana is primarily a Grunge/Punk band, and that Grunge/Punk bands are nothing more than expressions of \\"teenage angst\\".  <br />Again, this says more about the negative reviewers' taste in music than anything about Nirvana.  <br />It's rather unfair to lump Nirvana into a broad category which you already dislike, and then by virtue of its place in that category, to proclaim that you dislike Nirvana.  <br />If you actually listen to Nevermind you'll find just as many Metal, Rock and even Pop influences as Grunge or Punk. The most obvious example of a Pop influence is Cobain's outright statement that \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was an imitation of a Pixies song.  <br />Rather than attempting to categorise Nirvana into a genre that you already hate on principle, actually listen to Nevermind. There's Heavy Metal grinding, Rock'n'Roll riffs and brilliant lyrics as much as there is \\"teenage angst\\" wailing.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|I CAN'T HELP BUT BE IN TOTAL HYSTERICS WHEN I WATCH THIS CLASSIS COMEDY!! FEATURING SHELLEY LONG AND TOM HANKS, THIS IS COMEDY AT IT'S BEST!!
0792841344|3.0|The Horror flick that spawned a score of imitators, this is a fun drive-in worthy horror flick, filled with tons of \\"don't go in there\\" and \\"look behind you\\" and \\"why is he going into the basement of a funeral parlor at night?\\" moments.<br /><br />The acting is ok, the girls are tashy and busty, the guys (except for the teen) are old enough to know better.  Some of the sets are simply laughable.  We probably need to remember that when this movie was made, the majority of the target audience was high on pot.<br /><br />The best part of this film is the surprisingly good moments of surreal dream imagery.  Real flashes of art in film that really makes... no sense at all.  I rate it 3 because 3 is average, and that is not bad.  Low production values, and adequate acting and story.  But who cares?!  Campy horror classic fun.

B000FUO0C4|5.0|First of all, I'd like to commend the reviewer G.B. Talovich (in the Spotlight Reviews as I write this) for his analysis of the archetype underpinnings of the novel.  It made me reconsider the novel as a whole and appreciate it all the more.    A Passage to India was written in 1924 and it bears similarities to some of Forster's literary contemporaries, most notably Orwell's Burmese Days and the short stories of Somerset Maugham.  Here we have India, ancient, diverse, plagued with ancient schisms, a \\"muddle\\", under the authoricratic rule of colonial Britain.  The British portrayed here conform to the rule: stuffy and prejudiced, with no love for their foreign station, maintaining a thin veneer of the Victorian role - to keep themselves \\"proper\\", warding away the dust and sweat and sweltering heat of an exoticism they can never truly understand, nor wish to incorporate.  It's all about tennis and tea-time and the Club.  As a contrast to these rigid expatriates, Forster introduces two arrivals, Mrs. Moore and Ms. Quested, initially starry-eyed and curious about the subcontinent, willing to taste the culture - if only taste, and nothing more - to satisfy the instinct for romance and adventure.  This leads them into contact with the Muslim Dr. Aziz, who promises to show them India and ends up doing so more than any of them wish; \\"that incident at the Marabar Caves\\" results in explosively exposing the dichotomy of social conduct and temperament between disparate cultures, the superiority-wound ever-festering beneath the Western mandate to civilize and the East's own long-standing hierarchy establishment.     To wit: \\"It was, in a new form, the old, old trouble that eats the heart out of every civilization: snobbery, the desire for possessions, creditable appendages; and it is to escape this rather than the lusts of the flesh that saints retreat into the Himalayas. (chapter 26 pg 235, old penguin edition)\\"    At first I was a bit puzzled by Forster's approach, but as I read on it dawned on me that the author was displaying not just the discomfort and isolation of the British, but that of Aziz as well.  As a Muslim, he is forced to inhabit three worlds: that of the dominant Hindu population, that of the snooty colonials and, deep within, that of his own faith and culture, marginalized by sheer population.  Victimized as much by his own people as by the judgment-cry of the West, he eventually chooses exile, augmented in the final section `Temple'.  The `Author's Voice' character, the atheist and open-minded Fielding, also capitulates to the home-town creed by the end of the novel, sacrificing his freedom for the reward of security, the buffer against the exile's loneliness, and his final meeting with Aziz - in which the earth itself seems to grumble that reconciliation between East and West cannot yet happen - is more powerful because of where these two characters have gone and what they have, in effect, given up due to outward pressures.    A Passage to India is widely regarded as a masterpiece of the 20th century, highlighting the internal conflicts that would, in time, lead to Indian independence, casting a caustic eye to the irrevocable differences endemic to East/West relationships whenever superstition and racism rear their ugly heads... an all too common occurrence.   Recommended.

Cliches usually freeze me right out of an entertainent like this, but there's so much that's really good, and that goes without expressing my own delight that the movie doesn't take itself seriously at all.  The casting is spot-on ... I usually find myself second-guessing the casting director, but definttely not here.<br /><br />ID4 is lots of fun and in may ways more like a ride at an amusement park than a movie.<br /><br />I didn't read the book, but I might.  With a story like this, I'm just not sure that a close match between book and movie is so vital.

It is not just a story or a biography but it is a book of life with so  much to decipher. It is abstract and real at the same time.  <br />I worked in Mumbai for two years and could relate to the city. I am also in love with this amazing city. The more time you spend with it the more it grows on you. I am in Delhi now and I miss Mumbai but I want to go back to the city which never sleeps.  <br />  <br />Thanks for the reading delight.
0399226907|5.0|We have read this book as the final story before bedtime since she was 6 months old, she is now 15 months old. She loves that the caterpillar turns into a butterfly. Initially she just expressed her surprise, but once she learned to clap, she began to applaud his accomplishment. After hearing the story every night for months and months, she still claps for the butterfly. When you ask her for the Caterpillar book, she will go to her bookshelf and pick it out by the spine among all of the other books there. Once she has it, she will crawl into our laps and help turn the pages as we read. When the book is finished, she knows it is time for bed.
B000067J1H|5.0|Very enjoyable movie, subject matter was inspired.  Man goes insane but, just as the insanity takes over everything in his life becomes crystal clear.  He suddenly has the answers to the chicken and the egg question.  He is so convincing others follow and listen to him,  he becomes the new profit of the oversensative, overblown, overfeed, overconfident, overspending  \\"new\\" man.  Brad, suprised me, he really can act.  He should do more of these low down dirty parts.  Ed Norton is terrific he should have won an academy award for his part.  Enjoy!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This CD just makes me happy!  Mark Knopfler and Emmylou sound wonderful together and the music really compliments their voices.

It's a definite 5 stars in my book.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil is a better superhero film than most people give it credit for. The direction isn't outstanding, but it's certainly more than competent, and the special effects are quite novel. Ben Affleck, once you get past the personal baggage the actor brings to every role he plays, is an effective Matt Murdock. Jennifer Garner is also strong as Elektra, just please remember to skip that horrid spin-off movie she did. The rest of the cast is an A-list of stars: Colin Farrell, Michael Clarke Duncan, Joe Pantoliano. All are great, and help ground the story emotionally.<br /><br />The problem with Daredevil is that Fox, like with X-Men, fudged the film by cutting out a lot of footage. There's a whole subplot that's missing here, as well as small character moments that give the movie a stronger edge. They don't bring the film to X-Men or Spider-Man levels, but they do raise it significantly. And if you haven't tracked down the director's cut dvd, it's worth a look as well.<br /><br />Otherwise, this 2-disc theatrical edition comes loaded with extras. As appropriate for a movie about the visually impaired, there is a descriptive audio track included among the commentary and enhanced viewing mode options. Lots of documentaries and featurettes on disc 2. The best cut of the film isn't here, but the extras are, so it might be worth your money to view both.<br /><br />A good comic book film missing that extra punch, but still one of the better ones in the recent splurge of comic book movies.
B00005JMAH|3.0|There's a new director, new places and older faces in \\"Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban\\", the third film adaption of J.K. Rowling's fantasy series. I didn't think it was good as the first two films in the series, even though the look of it all was pretty much as good.    Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is due for his third year at Hogwarts Wizarding School, and things bleak, and not just in the stormy skies above. The mass murdering wizard, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), is on the loose, and as a result the creepy black - robed dementors have been called in to guard the school. Still, there is fun to be had this year, Harry discovers. This year, they have a friendly new Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and third year students now have access to the wizarding village of Hogsmeade. But dangers and mysteries spoil most of their fun. Why is Sirius Black coming after Harry? Why is Professor Lupin often ill? And why does Harry keep seeing images of a spectral hound?    Before I'd read the third book (or any of the others) I saw this on DVD and had no idea what was going on, and didn't like it terribly much. I've read the first three books now, and things are a little bit clearer now. I definitely think you have to be familiar with the books before you watch the films. Rather than an ordinary film, I like to think of these movies as a motion picture illustration of the novels, a picture that moves, rather like the potraits that move in the world of Hogwarts. Even then, bits that added to the intrigue and adventure, bits that I would have liked to have seen had been left out. Oliver Wood's feverish desire to win the cup was completely absent, for instance. Actually, did Oliver Wood even appear? I know Ginny Weasley appeared, but only for a fraction of a scene. Also, some things that are left in don't have the weight that they did in the book, like the mystery of Hermione's multiple classes, and her dislike of her silly divination lessons.     Even with so many things left out, the film seems to drag on a bit, particularly towards the end. There's just something lacking in the mix that doesn't keep you as interested. I don't think this is the fault of the director, or the screenwriter, or of J.K Rowling. I think that \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" was just a really tricky book adapt into a movie. Actually, I'm starting to think that a lengthy TV serial would have been a better option for Harry Potter's adventures. That way, it could have been really thorough, and all the plots and subplots could have been explored. A cartoon series would have been a good option, even. Ah well.    For what is there, for the most part, is done fairly well. Director Alfonso Cuaron lets the kids be a bit more relaxed on set, letting them wear casual clothes and encourages them to be themselves, which they can be as their acting keeps on improving. The effects are evocative, too. I didn't really like the faded, washed out colour scheme, but I suppose it does keep with the atmosphere of the book.    It was interesting to see what an all star cast had gathered on this film, and many of them are people I admire. Dawn French plays the painting of the Fat Lady former Fast Show member Mark Williams plays Mr Weasley, British comedian Lenny Henry plays the talking shrunken head. Apparently Warwick Davis (from Willow) is in the film too, but I didn't see him (is he the little man who is conducting the choir, perhaps?). Michael Gambon now plays Dumbledore, and he plays it differently to how I've grown used to. He seems a little more self absorbed, a little more stand offish, not the kind, grandfather figure that played him as. Perhaps there is a reason for this, perhaps not. I'll just have to keep reading the books and watching the films.    The special features are once again very well done. The menu narrator's warm voice is like an old friend. I hope they keep him for the rest of the DVDs. The special feature menus this time around have a Marauders Map theme.     Like always, there are many and varied special features. There's, of course, the five deleted and alternate scenes including the two with Sir Cadogan (played by Paul Whitehouse). Paul Whitehouse is one of my favorite comedians and character actors, and I really wish these scenes had been left in the film. The world needs more Paul Whitehouse. There's the \\"Catch Scabbers\\" game, where try to follow Scabbers across a table covered in junk using the remote keys (I found this game a bit frustrating). There's a triva game called \\"Magic You May Have Missed\\" which quizzes you on various minor details within the scenes of the films. There's tours to Lupin's classroom and Honeyduke's Sweet Shop. Lupin's tour is interesting, as it takes place within a scene, and it really makes me wonder how they shot it and put it together. There are candid interviews with all the cast and crew, hosted by an ordinary man and that extraordinary shrunken Jamaican head, who jollies up everyone. There's a montage played to the music of the Hogwarts choir (the \\"Double, Double Toil and Trouble\\" song), a featurette about all the stunt animals, a special effects/making of documentary, an featurette/interview with director Alfonso Cuaron & author J.K. Rowling, and a preview of the video game adaption.    There's also a game called \\"The Quest of Sir Cadogan\\" where you get to be Sir Cadogan (voiced by Paul Whitehouse) and race through Hogwarts completing little mini games. Get to BE Paul Whitehouse? Brilliant! I was very excited about this game! If you win, you are given a tour of the wizard potrait gallery, which is a pretty pleasant reward.     If you have a DVD ROM drive on your PC, there's a few extras to enjoy there too, including a Hogwarts timeline, wizard trading cards, and another preview of the video game adaption. You'll need a recent version of both Macromedia Shockwave and QuickTime to run it though.    Not the best Harry Potter book to film adaption, but I think it was the best theycould do, considering the tricky material they had to adapt. Still, it's worth a look for fans.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|I'm completely and totally besotted with this film. Those who say this is a man's film are completely off their rocker.  At its foundation, this is a very emotional film, essentially a series of love stories. Love of the ship, love of the ocean, fellowship of men, love of danger and adventure.  <br /> <br />At the center is the relationship between the men and the ship and sea.  The film does such an incredible job of bringing the ship to life on the ocean, of putting the men in the ship in such realistic ways that you are there with them, you feel the wood at your feet, the sea water on your face. You smell the blood and feel the bite of canon debris on your face and body.  You are aghast at the youth of some of the crew, the hardships.  The terrible choices that have to be made by the captain.  You are totally enaged by all the relationships that keep the ship afloat, that are the necessary foundation to the success of the Surprise. <br /> <br />The detail is simply amazing.  Besides the technical aspects which are unsurpassed, I was amazed by the little touches, such as the scene where Aubrey is celebrating the turn back up north with a pudding cake.  He gives a portion to Lord Blakeney who is about 12 years of age.  And during the scene, as they are eating and rejoicing, his youth is betrayed by the chocolate markings of pudding on his mouth, such subtle detail. Another is when the captain is teaching the young 'uns about how to navigate.  You see them holding the instrument, both hands are required to hold the instrument, and you fear Weir may have forgotten that Blakeny now only has one hand, but sure enough, of the two hands holding Blakeney's instrument, you see that the other hand belong's to the Captain.  The continuity on this film is amazing. <br /> <br />But the soul of the film is the relationship between the captain as played charismatically by Crowe and the doctor, embodied so compassionately by Bethany. And as if that weren't enough, the score is peerless with its combination of classical and original music. <br /> <br />Really, every element comes together to form an almost flawless film.  In a word, <br /> <br />WOW.
0553801503|1.0|This book almost made me want to cry it was so bad...especially after how terrific the first three books were.  Others have summed it up...\\"nothing happens\\". <br /> <br />Another major dissapointment is the new reader of the audio edition of this book.  The reader of the first three audio books was fantastic - really professional and top notch.  This current reader of Feast is just awful - can't differentiate his rich deep voice to make any characters sound different than the next.   <br /> <br />Please George - back to the drawing board and go back to the formula of the first three books.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This was a subject of much conversation when I was deployed to Saudi Arabia and it's still a favorite with most military and Civilians in Iraq. \\"Ground Hog Day\\" is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same...until finally,the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it's the day you leave. The movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique; Bill Murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well. It's fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man, and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I haven't seen the DVD as yet, but I did buy the VHS when it came out, and it was excellent.  Great sound, good visuals and pure Floyd music.  \\"A Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" was fuzzy in sound and visuals, but this one is not at all.  I did order the DVD, and I just hope that it's that much better.  If you are a Floyd fan, you need this concert.  In addition to the new stuff, this CD also has the entire \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" performed live.
B00008AWOG|5.0|Still Life marks Opeth's most noticeable foray into exploring more progressive sounds, utilising a cleaner and more pristine production work compared to their first two albums produced by Dan Swano. Not as heavy as My Arms, Your Hearse, their first album engineered at Fredman Studios, Still Life contains more clean vocals than before, merging the band's interest in death metal, progressive rock, and Scandinavian folk, while still retaining their heavy approach to songwriting. After this disc, Opeth would move on to work with Porcupine Tree mastermind Steven Wilson, venturing into more 70's prog with thicker soundscapes and layered melodies.<br /><br />For starters, there is a wealth of clean vocal harmonies on this album, which have Akerfeldt sounding a lot more emotive and elaborate. This would be the album where he found his true self as a clean vocalist. Still alternating between demonic death growls and fragile, soothing clean passages, the album became a logical next step for the band's future albums, where they experimented with more complex harmonies. However, the first two songs on Still Life are arguably Akerfeldt's finest moments, as far as clean choruses are concerned. \\"The Moor\\", the album's first track, is comprised of innumerable threads of melodies that range from the slow, haunting intro to the acoustic and electric riffs respectively. Actually the acoustic intro of this song remains among Opeth's most remarkable to this day. Infused with clear folk elements which particularly come to the fore during the amazing chorus that starts with the lyrics \\"If you'll bear with me, you'll fear of me\\", the melody of this section is reproduced on guitar impressively. There are several guitar themes soaring above the piece, while neat acoustic elements are played on top of them, and Akerfeldt's melodies convincingly hummed. Without doubt, when contrasted with his possessed death growls, the dynamics make for an incredible song overall.<br /><br />\\"Godhead's Lament\\" is another Opeth classic. Starting with sudden shifts of metallic riffage and a paralyzing lead solo, the song retreats to its anticipated calm mood, where a fantastic guitar theme is played to generate atmosphere. Unlike the opening song, this time Akerfeldt delivers the lyrics staying true to the theme played, singing \\"What would they care if I did stay, No one would know\\", stressing the final word and producing heart-wrenching melodies. For a brief moment, the bass, acoustic and electric guitars are all played in synch before the song ventures into its initial heavy path, only to highlight another clean chorus that is arguably the most moving part on the album.<br /><br />The all-clean sung \\"Benighted\\" and \\"Face of Melinda\\" are both sublime. The former maintains its careful flow throughout, with subtle blues-inflected leads; while the latter does take on a heavier vibe in its second half with a great electric solo. By many considered Opeth's most engaging ballad, it is also interesting Mikael Akerfeldt would name his new-born daughter Melinda a few years later. On the heavier side, \\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\" and the amazing riff-master \\"Serenity Painted Death\\", besides highlighting Opeth's death metal heaviness, are also punctuated by creepy middle sections underpinned by tranquil elements and quirky sound effects. Needless to say, these parts are very brief and only serve to enrich the dynamics, as they are both followed by punishing death metal riffs and brutal growling. \\"Serenity Painted Death\\" particularly stands out for its endlessly creative riffing and climactic ending that follows a throbbing bass and syncopated drum workout.<br /><br />Still Life is one of Opeth's two concept albums (the other one being My Arms, Your Hearse). The lyrics are poetic and rather hard to understand on first reading; it's a tragic love story based around the Middle Ages about an exiled man who returns to his village after many years in order to find the woman he loves. Also, as wasthe case with My Arms, Your Hearse and Blackwater Park, the title seems to have been inspired by another 70's band Akerfeldt highly respects: namely Van der Graaf Generator's 1976 album. However, given the amazing artwork by Travis Smith, it could also be the art term for a type of painting which consists of predominantly inanimate objects. Speaking of which, the packaging is among Opeth's best as well.<br /><br />If you have never heard any Opeth before, start with Still Life.arse and Blackwater Park, the title seems to have been inspired by another 70's band Akerfeldt highly respects: namely Van der Graaf Generator's 1976 album.

B000C3H4L8|5.0|I first heard TH 77 at art college the year it came out & the sound was so foreign to anything I'd known before that I honestly couldn't be sure whether I loved it or hated it! I know now that I was listening to one of the most creative, intelligent, different bands that ever explored a new vein in the vastness of rock formation. Many great TH albums followed but none carry the raw naivety encompassed by impassioned focus that does this one, the first! Sound quality on the DualDisc is great tho I must confess I've only heard the cd side. As as rule I don't like bonus tracks included with the original track listings, so I burned the original version then made a second disc of bonus tracks off the first six records TH put out. The bonus tracks are worth a listen on their own. A standout Disc is TH77!
B00000DR8R|5.0|It was 1984, and Metal ruled my life. Def Leppard and UFO were my bands of choice. Then, a cook where I worked handed me an unassuming Cassette called \\"Rattlesnakes\\" by Lloyd Cole. <br />From the opening of Perfect skin I was hooked. I played that tape a thousand times that year. There is not a weak cut on this album,period. To call it a perfect album is not far-fetched. It morphed me in a new musical direction. The Del-Lords, Lloyd Cole and the Beat Farmers ruled my 1980's. I love this album, and still play it pretty regularly. Cole is as great live as he is on record,just to mention. An absolute must to own.

Captain Fantastic was no exception! No descriptions of the songs will suffice. This record as all the classic Elton must be experienced & indelibly printed on each new listener. A genious in fine form! Exceptional bonus tracks are also included on this edition, tho as I've stated in other reviews I would rather have them on a separate disc to maintain the original conception unaltered.
B000FMGTTE|2.0|My opinion is completely biased because writing the music for Superman Returns is probably one of the things I would have most loved to do with my life EVER. Sadly, I had neither the knowledge of the film's existence until it was too late or too hard for me to even have a chance. And seeing as John Ottman is a close friend of Brian Singer I suppose there is no hope. However, I must say as a HUGE Superman fan that the movie itself is EXCELLENT. I've seen it 4 times!  <br />But John Ottman's work to me is poor. The best parts of the music are really only those that are direct quotes of the original Williams score.  <br />Two major things annoyed me - firstly the clumsy reharmonisation of Lois Lane's theme (or \\"Can you read my mind\\"). It looses the sense of direction at the end of the motive with resolution to the dominant, rather than William's original use of the dominant of the dominant in 3rd inversion.  <br />I also did not enjoy the music which accompanied the scene where Superman runs through the fields as a child. It was also clumsy, sounding too much like the Superman fanfare. There is some fantastic music which accompanies the first movie as clark chases a train, which could have been drawn from for inspiration. <br />I have to say that I did like some of music in the music which accompanied Lois and Superman's flying scene. It had a nice, restrained feel about it and actually quite suited the mood. Other reviews have criticised Ottman for his lack of sweeping melodic ideas, which clearly exist in the original Williams score. I actually feel that it is more so the orchestration which is poor, often being very bland, particularly in comparison to the very colourful Williams score. Superman movies are supposed to be very colourful and this music did not draw on that. <br />Again, I must qualify that I am completely biased here, considering that William's original score was probably the first skilfully composed music I ever heard as a 3 year old, and contiues toinspire me as a composer today. In the end, Ottman did an OKAY job - I don't cringe when I hear it, I just enjoy the direct Williams quotes more than his own original material. <br />
B000002P5R|4.0|This is a treasure chest full of early unreleased Jimi.  These songs really show the heart and soul of Jimi Hendrix as a thoughtful songwriter.  As always, the guitar is wonderful and amazing; but there's something peaceful in even the most scorching of solos on this disc.  Enjoy this wonderful collection of songs that illustrates Jimi's command of the blues and how he was able to stay true to it's roots or help it blossom into a rock 'n' roll explosion.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|If you're a Muse fan, it's difficult to not hold high expectations for a CD after Absolution, whose music was done so staggeringly fantastically it could send shivers up and down your spine even after the few dozenth listen. Holding on to previous standards, BH&R isn't quite as fantastic as Absolution was, and it's a definite change - progression is vital for bands who strive to mature and perfect their sound. And, if Muse wanted to achieve aggressive space-opera rock to inspire some and entertain the rest, I'd say they succeeded. <br /> <br />The album is very politically driven, but it's woven into the songs very well, not blaringly smashed through your heads to attempt to get you to change sides in politics or look at Bush in a glaringly negative light. For those that say there's no underlying theme, there is. It's all layered beneath the blaring electronica, whether Matt's voice is a soft whisper or a high falsetto over an aggressive drumbeat and crunching guitars. And, although there are no fantastic searing guitar solos reminiscent of Stockholm Syndrome to Absolution, there are quite a few standout tracks - it just takes more than one listen to distinguish them from the rest. <br /> <br />On first glance, you may think BH&R isn't anything too special, and definitely not up to Muse standards - but not rightly so. It took more than a couple listens per song to accustom my ears to the growing sound of what they were trying to accomplish, and the reviewers that say this is terrible music must really not be able to open their ears and evolve, which is a shame, and probably a must for all aspiring music fans. <br /> <br />Stand-out tracks would be: Take A Bow, Starlight, Map of the Problematique, City of Delusion, and Knights of Cydonia. <br /> <br />Muse fans should be patient with this album: Give it more than one chance, and it'll nestle into you and make you develop a soft spot for it, because it is what it is: good, progressive music from a fantastic band, whomay or may not have already reached their peak, but I wouldn't be so doubtful. <br /> <br />New listeners may not find it easily accessible simply because they don't know what to expect, but that happens to be the case with a lot of Muse songs. This album is definitely not the most accessible for newcomers - I'd suggest listening to Absolution and then moving on to this album.
B00005JOFQ|3.0|Ennis and Jack are sent off to guard a flock one summer, and while off in the wilderness discover and explore their mutual desire for men at a time (and in a place) where such was anathematic. Their romance continues over the years, hidden they believe, from those around them.    I read the 65-page version of this originally 11-page short story by Annie Proulx way back, and found it an enjoyable read. When I heard they were bringing it to the big screen, I wasn't particularly enthusiastic, as it seemed to me a hard one to script and bring the emotions and thoughts of the lead characters to light. I suppose my preconceptions may have spoiled the experience for me somewhat.    It's a great story, and the screen adaptation is about as good as it can be. Both Gyllenhaal and Ledger do an outstanding job in their roles as Jack and Ennis (Gyllenhaal hasn't gotten the credit he deserves for this, in my opinion), and their supporting cast, particularly Williams as Alma, Ennis' wife, do an extraordinary job of showing that not only Jack and Ennis are suffering from their predicament. All said, the film comes across as just a bit too long, and at times a bit boring. By the end, I was a bit eager to see the credits roll.     I won't demean what this film has done in bringing gay issues to the fore, particularly in the more Southerly States. While the subject matter of gay \\"cowboys\\" (these were sheep) is supposed to be daring, it's all a few years too late. Proulx's work, at the time it was written, DID, indeed, break new ground. If you gave the film more than 3 stars, I highly recommend the book. It's a more complete experience.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was definitely spirited away to another world while watching this stunning film. Miyazaki did a great job and I give him 2 thumbs up. I watched this movie twice and can't wait to rent it again! Chihiro was simply charming
0151006903|4.0|It is the year 1204, and Constantinople, the splendid capital of the Byzantine Empire, is being sacked and burned by the knights of the Fourth Crusade. Amid the carnage and confusion, one Baudolino saves a historian and high court official from certain death at the hands of the crusading warriors and proceeds to tell his own magical story. <br /> <br />Born a simple peasant in northern Italy, Baudolino has two major gifts-a talent for learning languages and a skill in telling lies, and one great flaw - absolute cowardice in the face of armed conflict. When still a boy he meets a foreign commander in the woods, charming him with his quick wit and lively mind. The commander-who proves to be Emperor Frederick Barbarossa-adopts Baudolino and sends him to the university in Paris, where he makes a number of fearless, adventurous friends, including a talentless Poet, and a love-struck former assassin turned troubadour.  <br /> <br />Baudolino skill at lies has created not only the myth of the Holy Grail, but the Grail itself, caused a city to be raised from swampland, and generated the infamous love letters of Abélard and Héloîse, actually the unsent love letters from Baudolino to the wife of Barbarossa, himself. Spurred by myths and their own reveries, this merry band sets out in search of Prester John, a legendary priest-king said to rule over a vast kingdom in the East-a phantasmagoric land of strange creatures with eyes on their shoulders and mouths on their stomachs, of eunuchs, unicorns, and lovely maidens. To aid him in his quest, he has a motley crew in tow, including the aforementioned Poet and troubadour, as well as an alchemist, Cabalist and assorted others. <br /> <br />Fans of previous Eco works will immediately note that this is the first that does not claim to be, or revolve around, an authentic re-discovered manuscript of some sort. It's also not as scholarly, or esoterically heavy, as Rose, or Pendulum. However, it's clear Eco is having fun in writing this, and after all of the pedantic scholarship of the Rose and Pendulum, one has to feel Eco is entitled to his fun. Eco takes us off the map of the known world, to the mysterious East, where a Christian King awaits the return of the 12 magi to re-unite his Kingdom with the Christian West, where nature has been set upon her head, and where the map says, \\"Here there be dragons\\". While not among Eco's best, it's still a fun read, and shows Eco's humor amidst, and as complement to, his scholarship. <br />
B00005JLR8|5.0|`In America' is a truly touching and beautiful film, elevated by strong performances by everyone involved.  The film centers on a poor Irish family that, after the tragic death of their 5-year-old son, illegally move to New York's Hells Kitchen and try and start a new.  The family consists of parents Johnny and Sarah (Paddy Considine & Samantha Morton) as well as their two daughters Christy and Ariel (Sarah & Emma Bolger).  Johnny is trying to make it in the world of acting, and they struggle as he fails audition after audition.  Their apartment is just about condemned, all their neighbors are crack addicts, and worse yet Sarah has become pregnant again and her condition is far from perfect.  In the midst of all this tragedy there is a glimmer of light. <br /> <br />That light is found in Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who, while appearing to be reclusive and mean actually lets his guard down with this family and becomes a friend.  It all starts with his kind gesture towards the two girls while the experience their first Halloween in the states.  No one is paying them any mind as they trick or treat throughout the building, but Mateo is softened and opens the door for a friendship all parties needed.  As the film progresses and we learn of Mateo's condition, their relationships become more and more pertinent and meaning some.  They need each other. <br /> <br />The final frames of the film are tragic yet beautiful and as the oldest daughter Christy turns off her camera a tear is brought to your eyes...one of happiness mixed with sorrow.  This is a brilliant film that touches on so many levels of human emotion, from grief to acceptance to fear and happiness.  As you watch these people grow and learn you are swallowed up in their trials as if you've known them your whole life.  This is due mostly to the impressive cast.  Samantha Morton hands down delivers the finest performance here.  I only feel that if the academy had placed her in the right category (she was above all things `Supporting') she may have beat out Renee for the golden statuette.  Regardless, her performance was harrowing.  She captured every emotion a grieving mother goes through, and her nervous breakdown in the hospital is so emotionally gripping it had me weeping. <br /> <br />Djimon Hounsou blew me away with very little words, but it was Paddy that shocked me, mostly because he was all but ignored come awards season.  He was brilliant and deserved some recognition.  His grieving father trying to hold his family together in the midst of even more tragedy was heart stopping.  And don't forget these two young girls who played their roles so perfectly you'd swear they weren't acting.  They became these adorable innocent children without slipping into stereotypical `cute kids', remaining three dimensional and `real', not Hollywoodized and hollow!  <br /> <br />This film is, as many have stated, classic and should be watched and enjoyed by everyone.  It's very rare you get to enjoy something that exuberates perfection on every level, and this film, this rarity, does just that. <br />
B000E5N62U|2.0|Okay, after listening to Donald Fagen's new album, I think he was the melody of Steely Dan, but not the soul.  And that's what's missing from this album. <br /> <br />While this is Donald Fagen and not Steely Dan, Donald tries to ride the coattails of his previous works with the group.  When you listen to Steely Dan through the years starting with their first album, Can't But a Thrill, you can hear the soul seeping slowly from the music. <br /> <br />Sure, there were a few dying gasps.  Aja was almost as good, after the group disbanded and left Fagen with Walter Becker.  There were a few highlights with Gaucho, but their last big hit was Rikki Don't Lose That Number, from the Pretzel Logic album. <br /> <br />With Morph the Cat, Fagen is still smooth.  The familiar melodies are still there that remind you of Steely Dan.  However, it is not something to which you want to hear again like Dirty Work, or Reelin' in the Years. <br /> <br />If you want to buy some familiar, polished jazz with no soul, this is your album.  If you long for Steely Dan, break out the oldies.  I guarantee you'll like them better.
0385336691|2.0|I read this series because I consistently enjoy Jack Reacher. I sometimes do not enjoy Lee Child,however, and this was definitely one of those times. Reacher's comment, could he read The Hard Way, would be unprintable, one feels sure. Smarmy? Reacher? And Child just doesn't seem capable of consistently producing the sparce, driving prose of books like Killing Floor, The Enemy, One Shop. Pitty. When he's good, he's so very, very good. Kind of makes the bad one's hard to forgive.
0393317552|3.0|The author is obviously one of those curious individuals who admires every race but his own (very similar to those {I'll let someone else insert the 'L' word here} Americans who admire every country but their own--oh, or Israel.) All of the advances made by Western Civilization are discounted as having been brought about not by the ingenuity and determination of the people who made such advances, but instead by the chance fortune of geography.  Somehow I think that if the face of Africa were dotted with magnificent, thousand year-old cathedrals, Mr. Diamond would not so easily throw them and their creators out of the mix.  It is obvious, especially in the first section of the book that the author would find it impossible to admit that building a craft to travel to and return safely from the moon is any more \\"intelligent\\" than a bushman knowing which leaves make the best toilet paper.  The author is apparently so steeped in the tyrannical and illogical equity of political correctness that he has gone to fantastic lengths to ignore the Western Tradition to which he owes his career.  Perhaps, he should return to Toynbee who was thankfully unable to ignore the greatness of our civilization and who couldn't make the \\"great leap\\" so common now and believe that the real genius is not in medicine, literature, science, law, and art, but in finding those soft, absorbent leaves in the bush.
156224003X|5.0|After only reading the first few pages of this book, I had already discovered my life's purpose. This is a wonderful book for musicians who are self-conscious of their skills or who have low self-esteem. I highly recommend it!
B00005JOQS|5.0|I've seen Superman Returns five times (including once in IMAX).  I may be a little obsessed, but who can blame me?  To me, it's just so good it deserves to be seen over and over.  I've never seen another movie in theaters five times and certainly never before saw the same movie twice in one day like I have with SR.    I truly LOVE this film and enjoy it even more with each new viewing.  It is exactly the movie I've wanted to see since the last great Superman flick (S2).  It's like movie nirvana from beginning to end.  Everything about this film is perfect to me:  the story, the direction and feel of the film, the visuals and effects, the music, the action, the romance, and especially Brandon Routh as Clark/Superman. It's exciting, fun, engrossing, entertaining, and very satisfying.      I've been a long time fan of the original Superman movies (well, I & II anyway) and both the Lois & Clark and Smallville TV series.  I've also loved all of the actors who've played CK/SM, especially Chris Reeve, but Brandon is absolutely perfect.  His look, his voice, his acting, and just the physical presence he brings the character are simply amazing.  As others have said, I think he was born for this role, and we viewers are blessed that he was chosen and that he put so much effort and heart into really being Superman.      Bryan Singer's story, vision and direction resulted in a movie that will forever be close to my heart.  The film is breathtakingly beautiful and deeply engrossing.  I can't take my eyes off the screen and the 2.5 hr run time flies by as fast as Superman himself.    Kate also did a very good job as Lois.  Her whole performance was great, but she sold me with the look on her face as she hid her true feelings after she told Superman on the rooftop that she didn't need him anymore.      Kevin Spacey was perfect as Lex Luthor.  More villainous than the humorous version played by the great Gene Hackman in the earlier films.    I can't wait to buy the DVD(s), and I'mhopeful there will be an extended directors cut version with the omitted scenes of Clark's trip to Krypton and the additional scenes on the Kent farm.   I'm even more hopeful that there will be several blockbuster sequels in the coming years.      A big 'Thank You' to Bryan Singer, Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey and Warner Brothers!  Thank you also to everyone who was involved with making this movie a reality. A really super job!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I had heard of this movie from various sources so I decided to buy it and see what all the fuss was about.  Now I know!  At first I thought it was just odd, then the pieces started coming together and the full story hit me and I was blown away.  It is rare that a movie makes you think even a little bit nowadays, but this one does.  It had me thinking well after the movie was over.  I would definitely recommend it to any sci-fi or fantasy fans.
0446577383|1.0|I felt like I was in a freshman seminar at UC Berkely and couldn't wait for class to end. There was not a single liberal soapbox missed: from the dangers of the Patriot Act to the inhumanity of the meat packing industry to racism in the US to the 'rogue elephant' of the intelligence community (hey, even Frank Church admitted he was wrong on that one David) to the evils of Christianity...I could go on, but why bother. Read the NYT or watch CNN and you pretty much have Baldacci's research. His hero has even oh so wittily dubbed himself \\"Oliver Stone,\\" a truth seeker. This is just pitiful. I only gave the book one star because the story wasn't bad; however, it could have been written in 200 rather than 400 pages without the ridiculous and pedantic ravings of a rather inept author. This was my first and last Baldacci.
0385338694|4.0|I would have to agree with the majority of the reviewers: This book is very funny. Underneath this funny story, however, we can find serious issues that upon varied opinions might release a heated debate. For example, we have the career-woman or prefer-to-be-a-bread-baker controversy. Frankly, I am not sure that Kinsella is telling us that being a career-woman is a bad thing or that cleaning is better or the opposite. People get all riled-up because someone choses what they want to do with their life as if by choosing one way or the other we need to give account of it to the entire world.  <br />The fact that this is an issue come to me as a ridiculous thing. It makes me feel as though women continue to have limited choices and that in reality we have not improved much from the machista society. If a man would leave his high-powered career to live in the country fishing and relaxing, who would notice? <br />So, to me, as a career-woman and one who has a family this is truly insulting! <br />But to other issues.... <br />Ok, so as far as other issues from this book, I found that, as another reviewer stated there were many things that were left in thin air. For example, Where did they finally go? or what did the letter say? what did Guy say to Nathaniel and why was Guy so incredibly obnoxious and intrusive at the end? And why was this high-powered lawyer being pushed,shoved and disrespected physically as well as emotionally?  <br />I think that a sequel is in order for this title at least to find out important information, since I think that these would have made the book much better. <br />Despite all this, I really enjoyed this book...
B000FVBLEI|5.0|Let's start off with something about me that will be vital to understanding my review, I listen to metal, ALL kinds of metal. I am a lot like the dude from Kung Fu who just walks the earth. I do the same with metal, I spend time just finding unique metal and unique bands but also enjoy the good ol' drag your brains through broken glass brutal metal. I listen to Opeth, Korpiklaanni, Pantera, Metallica, Chimaira, Killswitch Engage, In Flames, Diabolical Masquerade, Novembers Doom you name it  <br />I have AT LEAST heard of it. But on to the cd. It has melody and screaming just like the last album and just like Killswitch Engage or Shadows Fall or any other Massachusetts metal band, grinding brutal guitars, soaring solos, and FAST double bass. SO what sets it apart from all of the others? VARIETY. It isn't even neccesarily variety or different songs, I mean there's no slow songs or anything, but variety in the instrumentation of ALL members of the band(including the vocalist) All of the members of the band prove on this album that they are capable of death, thrash, metalcore, black, hardcore, and really just about any kind of metal. They even throw the odd acoustic in there. Which isnt really strange for this kind of band but considering there is definate death and black metal influences on some of the songs.The vocalist Phil Labonte impressed me the most on this album though, the last album was great and he did an impressive job on it, but he did what needed to be done on this album, more clean singing (I can hear groans as people read this already) dont worry they haven't gone soft or anything, but the fact remains that ol' Phil has one of the best singing voices since Jesse David Leach of Killswitch Engage. But if you think they've gone soft listen to the Cannibal Corpse inspired \\"The Weak Willed\\" or the black metal influenced \\"Six\\" (remember INFLUENCED). They pull all of this off while still having a ton of melody. The drummer really picked it up on this album too.This Darkened Heart led me to believe this band was only capable of standard hardcore drumming but man he goes nuts on this one. He does quite a few blast beats even which really took me by surprise. And the guitarists as always in this band are the most top of the line in riffing and in solos, especially in solos. Whatever this case if you enjoy any kind of metal you will enjoy this album or at least find moments that are over the top. If you dont like your music heavy, well this is not for you. As far as my opinion goes: FREAKING MASTERPIECE!!!
1932100660|5.0|I think that The China Study should be required reading for every American citizen.  The only gripe I have about this book is the title.  While I was reading The China Study, if the person responsable for the title had been next to me I would have kicked him/her.  Maybe this book will become the bestseller it deserves to be anyway, and I hope it does.  The author is a scientist who has done the most exciting research on the repercussions of diet on health that I have ever read.  I don't think I've ever read a health book with so much compelling evidence.  So much that is written about diet is conjecture.  No wonder everyone is so confused.  No wonder Americans are dying off in great numbers from heart disease, diabetes, cancer.  If you have a health issue of any type, read this book.  I seriously think it could save your life. <br />Good luck!
B00005JKCH|5.0|I am a huge fan of Spiderman and this movie did not let me down!  In fact I love it!  The cast was great and the action was perfect!  I finally have the DVD and it rocks!  I especially like Tobey's screen test footage in the special features and the comic book art gallery!
B00006B1HH|4.0|I actually had never seen Grease until last month (and I'm 59 yrs. old!).  It is fun, upbeat, and a musical history of the 60s.  John Trivolta and Olivia Newton-John as well as Stockard Channing give amazing performances as they move through the movie, dancing and singing their hearts out.  If you haven't seen it, do, I guarantee it will make you smile and take you back!  If your kids haven't seen it, make it a family night, pop some corn, make some shakes and sit back and enjoy a movie the whole family will love!
B0009MDPYM|3.0|John Constantine is a chain-smoking exorcist with only a few months left to live.  Although he knows that he is already destined to spend eternity in hell for a mortal sin he committed in the past, John is still attempting to find redemption by dedicating himself to battling the demonic forces that exist just beneath the surface of our known reality and which have lately been making a greater effort to cross over from their world to ours.<br /><br />I imagine that the Catholic Church must be rather pleased with this film,  especially considering the black eye it suffered at the hands of Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"  Here the incantations and paraphernalia of the Roman church have a great deal of efficacy in keeping the demonic forces Constantine encounters subdued and at bay.<br /><br />Strictly as a movie and not as a theological document, \\"Constantine\\" is a slightly better-than-average demonic thriller that goes back and forth between the world of humans and the shadowy netherworld inhabited by angels and demons and even a few creatures that fall somewhere in between.  In a role not all that far removed from the one he played in the \\"Matrix\\" movies, Keanu Reeves once again functions as the flawed Everyman hero whose job it is to save humanity from a fate worse than, in this case, eternal death.  We're more willing to accept the silliness of the premise knowing we have Reeves to guide us along the movie's path.  The special effects are impressive for the most part, with special credit going to the art designers for their imaginative view of hell (which looks much like a city after it's been destroyed by a nuclear explosion).  The film is, admittedly, too long and the nonsense quotient begins to run dangerously high long about the last half hour. But \\"Constantine\\" is, overall, sufficiently imaginative to keep us interested for most of its duration.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|but then I don't think Plant will ever do an album that matches the height of his work with Led Zeppelin.  What we get here is a contemplative, sometimes brooding album, in which Plant covers a wide range of sources (including his own) to create a pleasing but not all together satisfying album.  He is still drawing from folk forms, but there is a pop strain to the music.  I even detected a distant echo of \\"Indian Reservation\\" on \\"Let the Four Winds Blow.\\"  The lyrics are strong, however, ranging from his disgruntlement with his peers on \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" to an apocalyptic vision of things to come on \\"Another Time.\\"  Probably my favorite song on the album is \\"All the King's Horses,\\" a beautiful ballad in which he contemplates the long road he has traveled.
B00000612P|5.0|I just heard this classic after not hearing it all for many years.     It is a true classic, with Rod Stewart at his best, just slamming down those songs with his every ounce of his passion and soul.    The unbelievable muscians playing with Rod has to be mentioned. Their power really comes out when hearing the re-mastered versions.     This was such a differnt era. The music was controled by the fans and muscians, not Corporate oligopolies. Musicians and singers learned their craft by being on the road and playing live for years and years. If you were really good, worked your [...]off, creative and learned from others, your going to make it.   Cut an album, then support it by touring live and sound better live than on the record !! No faking in those days.     You pay your dues on the road, on backstage sessions, etc. Plenty of live venues and small , independent record companies.     This is great stuff. I think the work Rod did with the great group \\"The Faces\\" and with Beck was great.     You are right about going for the gold and becoming a pop star. I can't blame him for that, Rod was not exactly an overnight star.     I don't think it was thought of so much about what was going to occur after Bill Graham's death and Corporate ownership of the arts.     Jon
B00000C3G6|5.0|When CSN&Y formed, the premise behind the group was to make the best music they could with whomever wanted to join in. This album is by far the best exponent of that philosophy. <br /> <br />On this album, Crosby & Nash prove that they can make a wonderful album without Stills and Young. Nash's poppier numbers perfectly counterbalance Crosby's more cerebral trips. The harmonies are solid as a rock, and the two often overdub themselves numerous times to produce a vocal blend that just might be tighter than CS&N. Instrumental backing by various members of the Grateful Dead is complementary but never flashy or intrusive. <br /> <br />It's arguable that this album isn't as varied as Deja Vu, but it highlights Crosby and Nash at their respective strengths. While it might be difficult to find on CD, this album is well worth seeking out for fans of CS&N and CSN&Y.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|The first half of this \\"animated musical\\" has exciting music, excellent audio-visual synchronization and a promising story. Accompanying anime with dance music instead of dialog produces a uniquely refreshing feel, and I doubt anybody would miss the words. However the whole thing seems be losing dynamics in the latter half. Good concepts are not adequately developed, leaving the story predictable and somewhat cliché. The more laid-back feel of Daft Punk in the latter part doesn't really go well with the format of musicals. Overall it is still very good, and I hope to find more works in this vein.
1400032717|5.0|A great looking book and the inside matches. What a wonderful book, it had me up all night wanting to finish reading it.
B000009QPG|4.0|For fast, agressive, thrashy metal, you can't top Slayer. This album is outstanding for the genre. Great riffs, with the pauses, tempo changes, and perfect drum fills that give Slayer a distinct advantage over other metal acts.   My strongest criticism of this album is that it isn't as good as South of Heaven. It feels a bit more plodding, and while some of the guitar parts are melodically more interesting that other slayer releases, this comes at the expense of the \\"edgey\\" feeling on SOH. Also the \\"hello mr. Gein\\" voice-over on \\"dead skin mask\\" seems a little forced and unneccessary. On the other hand, the voice over on \\"Skeletons of Society\\" sounds extremely cheesey, but in a \\"so bad it's awesome\\" sort of way.   If you like Slayer you'll like this album. Personally I rank this above \\"Reign in Blood,\\" but below South of Heaven.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Somewhere in between our most fervent passions and deepest fears winds a long road upon which we all must travel.    For some who go the distance, the journey may lead to self actualization but for others, the slightest diversion can mean total destruction.  David Lynch is no stranger to the lonely road metaphor (Lost Highway) and in Mullholland Drive, he created another dream felt portrait of good intentions gone wrong, very wrong.    As in many of his other works, visual imagery peppered with stilted conversation takes precedence over plot.  Plot is secondary to the creation of a mood in any particular scene, with lighting, musical score and camera angles all engineered to cast a mood or evoke a feeling rather than to move the action forward.    Such devices are appropriate in a film where popular belief lends the theory that the majority of events take place in the dreams of the main character, Diane Selwyn a.k.a Betty Elms.    Like faded morning memories of a dream, we recall more of the emotion felt than the actual events; the terror of a nightmare, the sweetness of a love's embrace.    The basic storyline is of a young aspiring actress who arrives in Hollywood to pursue her acting career after winning a jitter bug contest in her home town in Canada (Deep River, Ontario and Blue Velvet reference).  The \\"dream actress\\" takes the name Betty Elms, a name borrowed by the `real' actress, Diane Selwyn, from a waitress's name tag in a diner.  Similar to the classic, \\"Wizard of Oz,\\" the last scenes in the movie suggest real time events and people that become embodied in Diane's dreams.    Diane Selwyn has been torn up by Hollywood and spit out by its rising stars, her lover included, who jilts her for an influential director.  Diane decides to avenge this betrayal by hiring a hit man to kill her girlfriend/actress, Camilla Rhodes.  The guilt of commissioning this crime ultimately consumes Diane and she is lead to suicide.  Conversely,  in her dream state, Diane's wishfulfillment of what her place in Hollywood would have been is actualized by stellar auditions, palatial living quarters and a deep, gratifying love.       The movie begins with an automobile accident presumably taking place on or leading to Mullholland Drive from which a dark haired beauty survives (and who we later discover is likely the \\"dream version\\" of Camilla Rhodes and a paradox to the \\"real actress,\\" as naïve, innocent and submissive.)   This woman, dazed from the impact and drawn by the city lights below, meanders her way back into the city and ultimately into the apartment of Betty's aunt who has left on an extended vacation.  Betty arrives as her aunt's invitee while the aunt, an apparent successful actress, is away as a place to accommodate herself while she settles into L.A.   Upon her arrival, Betty discovers this woman who has suffered amnesia from the accident and names herself \\"Rita\\" after glancing at a Rita Hayworth poster that hang's in the absentee aunt's bathroom.    Meanwhile, seemingly collateral events unfold with a famous director being bullied by ominous but nondescript forces to cast a particular actress in his new film.    The same director discovers his wife in bed with his `pool boy' and ultimately finds himself bankrupt.  Other non-linear events take place as the audience is shifted around through an apparent conspiracy against the director, an inept hit man that carries out a botched hit against a friend and the developing mystery of the identity of the woman Betty finds in her aunt's apartment, as the pair embark on a quest to solve the puzzle.  Also woven in, is an eerie scene in a diner (the same diner where we later learn Diane has hired the hit man) where a man recites to another man, a recurring nightmare that he has of a decrepit being that lives at the rear of the property, possibly a physical emobdiment of the evil that occurred in the diner, the payment for the hit.      Confusing?  No doubt, as Lynch seems to string his audience along into believing that the various sequences are all somehow related.  Ultimately, one scene near the end of the film seems to suggest that we are being misled and perhaps provides the \\"key\\" to all of  the various goings on.  Leading up to this scene that takes place in what appears to be a secret night club by the name of, \\"Club Silencio,\\"   Betty and Rita's chase for Rita's real identity leads to the discovery of a dead body.  This body is an image that is repeated at various times during the movie and is likely the body of Diane in various states; deep slumber, rising and perhaps death after she commits suicide.  The pair sexually consummate their evolving friendship after this trauma and Rita awakens in the early morning hours uttering the name of the club, \\"silencio, silencio\\" beckoning Betty to go the club with her, as if drawn by some unseen force.  The two sit at this club while a Spanish speaking MC of sorts tells the audience, \\"No ay banda!\\" or \\"There is no band!\\"  We hear music but the man repeatedly tells the audience that it is, \\"all an illusion.\\"   The pair clutch each other in sadness as they watch a female vocalist (who we learn is lip synching -- all part of the illusion) sing a Spanish version of  \\"Crying\\" with such emotion that she succumbs to collapse on the stage.      As Lynch has never publicly unraveled the mysteries of the movie, public opinion is abound as to importance of the Silencio scene as perhaps the turning point of the film.  Is Lynch reminding us in this scene that it is all an illusion?  Is this a broad commentary on Hollywood and all of its players that we photograph, quote and idolize at every turn?   The darkness of the club reminds us of an underlying and terrifying truth, that all is not well and that there is malevolence beneath the melodies we hear and the show that invites us.  Of course, as Lynch is the master of unease, this scene is all but redundant of what the viewer has already been pounded with at every turn.  At the end of the scene Betty and Rita pull out a blue box, a prop that recurs throughout the movie as some sort of symbolic grail that will unlock all of the mysteries.  When the pair return to the apartment, Rita unlocks the box, Betty disappears and blackness envelops the screen.  The remainder of the movie is perhaps in 'real time' as we see events that possibly lead up to the arrangement of the hit including scenes in Diane's actual apartment where she is betrayed by her lover and summoned from to Mulholland Drive, the scene of a humiliating dinner party.  The dinner party scene revisits the characters of the dream both central and periphery as Diane suffers through this sequence to learn that Camilla has become engaged to the director.  In this scene, we see the motivations for the dream, turning the powerful into the powerless, the mighty into the weak.  The final scenes in the movie perhaps appropriately intertwine both realistic images and fantasy as a demonic like presence seems to overtake Diane's soul driving her to suicide.    Mulholland Drive is a long strange trip indeed, at over two hours in length of often snail's pace action.    No one really seems to reach their destination on Mullholland Drive and yet we travel through with some expectation that we will be lead to clarity.  Perhaps this is both illusion and ironic truth etched by the writer/director as we allow ourselves to long for some enlightenment that might arrive while losing the journey.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've noticed the major complaint with this album is that it isn't hard enough. This of course is a matter of opinion so cannot be legitimately argued. Instead, I make a suggestion. Don't listen to it with pre-concieved notions or desires. As a whole, this is not a hard cd. But it is still amazing. Listen to the whole thing  in order when you're calm and receptive. Then you will truly be able to appreciate this album. Maybe thats just the mood I needed to be in and perhaps other people need to be feeling differently but whatever the mood you will suddenly feel it click and... I dunno, it made me feel mellow, connected, blissful... no I wasn't high. Usually I'm an angry person. It took a while but after a couple days I was just ready to listen to 10,000 Days and now it just makes me feel amazing everytime I listen to it. This is a spiritual cd and a very immersive experience.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Very bad horror thriller that has the right pieces but does nothing  with them to make a compelling or interesting film. Keanu Reeves has  the charisma and the charm but his character is a wasted bore and he  just comes a cross like an unlikable jerk than anything useful to the  story. He just sticks out like a sour thumb and just does not engaged  the audience with his badly written character. Rachel Weisz does far  more for the audience and the movie with her way too good and complex  performance in this film but you do end up feeling sorry for her after  awhile because the script and the dialog does not do her valiant  performance any justice. Her performance is so good in fact that she is  single handedly holds this film together while its in fact falling  apart by all around her. Tilda Swinton plays a pretty good angel but  her character is way too lightweight to be taken seriously, especially  with the revelation towards the end of the film that just blows apart  the little creditably this film had going for it. Shia LaBeouf is a  decent kid actor but his character ends up more annoying than useful  and Djimon Hounsou does OK with a very limited role.    My Thumb goes way up for Rachel Weisz's game and way too good for this  film performance and a special nod goes to Peter Stormare, who's brief  appearance at the end of the film does more for it than the whole bad  script itself.
B00005JOWR|5.0|This is a movie about the world of Lobbyists and the life of \\"spinning\\".  A note up front, you have to keep an open mind with this movie. This movie was actually very funny and pointed out a number of thing that I think we all realize but never verbalize.  This is based in the late 90's prior to the tobacco settlement, the main character is a Lobbyist for the tobbacco industry.  It explores his job and his life and why he did the job. Many people write him off as a murderer, but this movie adresses this and more.  Throw in his dinner meetings with his Lobbyist friends from Alcohol and Firearms, I would not have thought i could laugh at the movie, but I did. The movie was well written, great voiceovers where needed, and dialog flowed well.  The movie is best summed up by one of the lines \\"you have to pay the mortgage\\".  So if you want a thinking comedy, and don't mind some dark humor on occasion, i think this is worth a viewing.
B00009ATIX|3.0|I always find it interesting to approach a movie that has people so polarized - in this case \\"it was sooooo slow\\" vs. \\"uplifting and incredible.\\"  That seems to go for the critics as well. My reaction was neither. <br /> <br />I am predispossed to like this kind of science fiction - the low key and wonderful \\"Gattaca\\" comes to mind. I found the story very intriguing and atmospheric and it held my interest - at the same time I felt something was missing and it just wasn't as rich, complex and good as it should have been. <br /> <br />I am not sure why, I think the key for me is that I was not able to really get emotionally involved with the love story - and this is first and foremost a love story. I have trouble with most love stories, due to my own particular biases, so there has to be a lot there to really identify with it. I think the problem here was the casting and acting - it could have been a lot better. The woman playing Gordon was rather flat as well. <br /> <br />Also the script was a little too obvious.  <br /> <br />All in all, an intersting film that I am glad I saw, but I can't really get worked up about it.
6305499365|4.0|This movie will appeal to 95 % of the working poplulation, assuming that you have a sense of humour that is. The scene is set in a modern IT office, whereby nothing new ever happens, until one day the IT bodds decide that they should be rewarded for their work and as a result plot to \\"modify\\" a few computer systems in order for them to rob the company blind.<br /><br />Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy....
0553584537|5.0|This is one of those plots where you know the whodunit long before you reach the ending. But, the strenght of this thriller is not on the whodunit but on the clever plot line with its twists & turns on the two main characters: Catherine & Bobby. Are you to believe the two are really telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? The motives for each & every action is chronicled in detail by both Catherine & Bobby. Just when you thought, ah yes, I believe you Catherine, then again maybe not, I trust Bobby more, then it goes again, your belief & trust vascillate between Bobby & Catherine.    The investigative team of DD & Copley do a probing analysis on the various options available that can be exploited by both Catherine & Bobby. To top it all off, the ending for most thrillers usually end in a murmur, for this it ends with a trumpet call as your adrenalin is set on a very high as there is a very dramatic twist at the end. Very original & highly suspensful ending to a superb thriller!
B000002AGN|5.0|Being this an enhanced version, it sounds brighter than the original album.  Some hiss from the original master tape can be heard between songs, but this should be no excuse to avoid buying it.  The net result is an excellent sound from an excellent album.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|While Madge was very popular with her first album (1983), it was in 1984 when she released the #1 smash hit \\"Like A Virgin\\" that the entire world stopped to pay attention the the 25 year old. With her tough-girl lyrics which showed a woman could be sexual and still in control, she became an icon for young liberal girls everywhere. The CD was #1 for weeks and eventually went on to sell over 10 million copies in the States alone. <br /> <br />Matiriel Girl- Remains a very famous song today and has some of the most clever lyrics about not wanting a man who dosen't have the credentials she wants, although the music video told a rather non-matirielistic story. <br />Angel- Another top 5 hit for Madonna, and her singing in the song is just excellent. <br />Like A Virgin- Such a naughty title for a song, and talks about how great it feels to fall in love with someone at the beginning. It's like being a virgin again. <br />Over and Over- Pure 80's fun about not giving up. <br />Love Don't Live Here Anymore- A song that would be released as a single more than a decade later in Madonna's career, this song while not a great song in itself, showed how she could really sing. You can almost hear the loneliness in her voice. <br />Dress You Up- The fourth and final top 5 hit from the CD, this is the album's true gem. This is one of the greatest pop songs of all-time. <br />Shoo-Be-Doo- A song which shows off Madonna's vocal talent, but has some cheesy lyrics and not one of the best. <br />Pretender- A fun song about a man who's a pretender, a fake, a fraud. I love it. <br />Stay- I can't comment much on this one, as it didn't make much of an impression on me. <br /> <br />Like another reviewer said, this is next to Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" CD as for great 80's albums. Madonna owned 1984-85.
0618526412|5.0|I have seldom read a book with so little \\"action\\" yet so stirring.  Admittedly, I am not a great friend of the South much less the language, but the characters of this book had me engulfed so deeply that I was not able to read any other book shortly thereafter for lack of depth, sincerity, emotion and total involvement.  Exceptional!
B000ETQRCM|1.0|It appears that people either love or hate this album.  Unfortunately I hate it.  I have been buying PJ albums since the day after Ten debuted on the video channel (whichever one it was back then, at least it played music unlike now), and they have been going progressively down hill.  I thought this one might be different after hearing World Wide Suicide, so I bought it the second it was released (literally, I opened the box of CD's for them).  I have forced myself to listen to it repeatedly, but it just won't click.  I find that most of my most treasured albums take at least three good listens to start to click.  This one just won't.  Nothing sticks in my head besides the first single.  It's all disappointing. <br /> <br />Luckily I bought 10,000 Days on the same day. <br />
B00005JJX8|4.0|You don't get much better than Cary Grant, Grace Kelly and Alfred and Edith Head.Full of fun, danger, and suspence, this suspenceful thriller shows how Hollywood used to make a romantic movie. Alas, can one imagine how this movie would be made today? All guns, car chases and explicit sex and very little plot! Let us be glad we have means of saving these classics for our future entertainment!!!!
B000GRUMPU|3.0|SYNOPSIS   A rogue wave capsizes a luxury cruise ship in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, a small group of survivors find themselves unlikely allies in a battle for their lives. Preferring to test the odds alone, career gambler John Dylan (Josh Lucas) ignores captain's orders (Andre Braugher) to wait below for possible rescue and sets out to find his own way to safety. What begins as a solo mission soon draws others as Dylan is followed by a desperate father (Kurt Russell) searching for his daughter (Emmy Rossum) and her fiancé (Mike Vogel), a young couple who hours before couldn't summon the courage to tell him they were engaged and now face much graver challenges.     Along the way they are joined by a single mother (Jacinda Barrett) and her wise-beyond-his-years son (Jimmy Bennett), an anxious stowaway (Mia Maestro) and a despondent fellow passenger (Richard Dreyfuss) who boarded the ship not sure he wanted to live but now knows he doesn't want to die. Determined to fight their way to the surface, the group sets off through the disorienting maze of twisted steel in the upside-down wreckage. As the unstable vessel rapidly fills with water each must draw on skills and strengths they didn't even know they possessed, fighting against time for their own survival and for each other.     REVIEW  Poseidon comes from Wolfgang Petersen, who has made quite a few water bound films that are very good. As such, i was expecting Poseidon to be somewhat a blend of a meaty storyline as well as good CGI effects. But as it played out on screen, it was not that at all...It was bad... bad enough to arouse only the popcorn action hungry moviegoer who doesn't mind the knowing what will play out on screen next....the film gets 3 stars just because it has a few unexpected sequences (just a few) and has lots of CGI thrown in... If you truly would like to enjoy this movie, my suggestion is to place all expectations out the door and watch it. It may be a decent watch, but for me, it'll be nothin more than a CGI exihibition on film..

B000BTC5LW|5.0|<br />This is the long awaited release of Pink Floyd at Earls Court in 1994. The best songs in the set include 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond', 'One Of These Days' (brilliant), the whole of 'Dark Side Of The Moon' (stunning), a show-stopping 'Wish You Were Here' and 'Comfortably Numb' where the combination of Gilmour's extended solo and the light show are just awesome - one of the great moments in recorded rock history. <br /> <br />This high quality double-disc set has loads of extras too.  <br /> <br />But there is one significant omission from the original show: 'Astronomy Domine' is not included in this release, which is a pity. However the many extras on the disc more than make up for this - and there is a storming rendition of 'One of These Days' to savour.  <br /> <br />We've waited a long time for this - it is Floyd at their best and this gig is much better than their recent Live 8 appearance. One might even say it's undiluted by Waters! <br /> <br />This is a 'must have' DVD for any rock fan. If Pink Floyd ever do reform, they are unlikely to top this. The light show has never been surpassed and it compliments the set perfectly. This is prog rock on a grand scale and the whole show really is an awesome experience.
0060507772|5.0|This graphic novel is intended as fan service. The story that is told is enjoyable in it's own right, but it seems mostly to be an attempt to bring every single standard character from the books into the plot, in order to justify their depiction in an interesting way.<br /><br />The quality of the artwork is very good, and details of the book are entertaining thorughout, with many small details such as background action to both text pages and graphics pages.<br /><br />Overrall, if you are a fan of Discworld, this is a book you want to own. It will make you smile.
B000FGGE68|2.0|This film is about set action pieces and tight pants. Milla handles both very well. But the movie, average at best. The story is one that's been told before, but has potential if it was allowed to unfold, not thrust upon us to get to the next scene of Milla killing everyone. Special effects, not real special: Think Tron upgraded, but just a little. Overall, it's okay if you like Milla, Milla's stomach, Milla killing several hundred armed bad guys or Milla in tight pants.

0767834739|2.0|Please read this review before you decide if it's helpful or not. Seriously, I played the games they are fun, I saw the first film, it was pretty good, this one does not have much going for it. If you want a good shoot-em-up Zombie film see the remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" or even the great comedy \\"Shaun of the Dead\\". Both of those movies will give you so much more than this one. The \\"Lickers\\" in the Church is a good scene, and a brief scene with Zombie Hookers is cool, and that is the two stars I give it. Nemesis (The huge monster villian in this movie) looks no better than a Power Rangers creature I kid you not, and the acting is non-existent. If you are the kind of person that will enjoy anything with the \\"Resident Evil\\" tag you may like it just fine, but people with a higher-standard on their action/horror films REALLY should look elsewhere..........the Zombie Hookers are cool though.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is one of the best family shows that American TV has produced in recent years. It is sadly very underappreciated in the US, despite its popularity overseas. This may be the reason why only season 1 has been released on DVD. However, the release itself is quite brilliant, with the pilot in widescreen and episodes in fullscreen format. 4 audio commentaries are available and a featurette. All episodes have multi-language subtitles, including English, which you can use as closed captioning. The discs have Region 1 regional protection and are in NTSC format, but they work without any problems in multi-region DVD players. If you are a European fan of the show, you should grab this box set at Amazon's bargain price while it lasts.
B0000025H4|5.0|Along with Black Sabbath's \\"Live Evil\\", Deep Purple's \\"Made In Japan\\" and \\"Made In Europe\\", Motorhead's \\"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\\", the Scorpions' \\"Tokyo Tapes\\" and \\"World Wide Live\\", Rainbow's \\"On Stage\\", and UFO's \\"Strangers In The Night\\", stands Judas Priest's \\"Unleashed In The East\\". <br /> <br />As the title suggests, this is a Japanese recording, and I have heard that Japanese pressings contain additional tracks.  But what we have here on the U.S. version is more than enough. <br /> <br />This album has unfairly been maligned as \\"Unleashed In The Studio\\" because of its excellent sound quality.  I wasn't there to know whether anything has been \\"tweaked\\" but it certainly sounds live - and heavy! <br /> <br />Rob Halford turns in what is probably his best vocal performance. <br /> <br />Nowhere in the studio does the twin-guitar team of Glenn Tipton and KK Downing shine like they do here, especially on the intro to \\"Victim Of Changes.\\" <br /> <br />You can actually HEAR Ian Hill in parts here, especially on the last track, \\"Tyrant\\"! <br /> <br />This would be the last album for drummer Les Binks.  This is unfortunate, as he is quite good and worlds better than his replacement, Dave Holland. <br /> <br />In many ways this album signalled the end of an era for Priest that had been hinted at on \\"Killing Machine/Hell Bent For Leather\\": shorter, snappier songs, with less extended soloing, and a very live sound. <br /> <br />This album towers head and shoulders over many other live albums (including Black Sabbath's Ozzy cash-in \\"Reunion\\") and there is a place for it in every collection of true, British heavy metal.  Rarely does a week go by without listening to this masterpiece.
B000002LFL|5.0|I bought this album way back in the early 90s. At first I didn't like it, Morrissey changed some of the lyrics to some of his hit songs. After giving the tape another try, this album put its hooks into me and has not let-go since then. I believe Morrissey is 10X better live than recorded. I have seen him in concert three times and he is never a disappointment as a live act. Songs like \\"The Drazie Train\\" are not found on other albums and are a must-have for the true fan. Of all the albums, this is really not an album but a piece of Smiths history. It is a true treasure. These versions are refreshing departures from the studio-recorded songs. My advice: Buy all of the original Smiths albums and this one too. Don't waste your money on any of the \\"Best Of\\" albums.
0722532938|2.0|Whew.  Putting aside the subjective interpretations inherent among readers of this type of work, I was seriously disappointed in this book, and am at a real loss to understand all the hoopla about the author and the story.  Perhaps I am not \\"in tune\\" enough to see what Anthony Robbins can see in this, but I found this to be lacking in many ways.  The story, while nice enough, is beyond simplistic, and the \\"philosophy\\" is just a heavily watered down play-doh version of Robert DeRopp or Gurdjieff.  What a huge disappointment, I could barely bring myself to finish this short book. The characters are so basic, the writing (or at least the translated version of the book) seems geared for a young teenager, there is no depth to the plot - I must really have missed the wonderful hidden meanings everyone keeps talking about here.  Then again, I don't think Julia Roberts can act either and I seem to be alone in that position as well.  You would do 100x better with a Winnie the Pooh story if you wanted some enjoyable and serious philosophy built into a children's book.  I can't help but compare this to the Emperor's New Clothes, is everyone serious about this being a  \\"golden work of life meaning\\"?  What the heck are we using as a basis for comparison?
0393327655|2.0|The author's argument comes down to a plea for all of us to require evidence for the things that we believe but he fails to satisfy his own requirement by failing to provide evidence for many of the claims that his arguments are based on. <br /> <br />It's as if he's asking us to take his rejection of faith on faith. I was very disappointed because I was eager to side with him in this yet I still found it very hard to do.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|After eons, here's a riproaring, swashbuckling sf adventure that you'll want to watch again even as the end credits roll across the screen. This is not a philosophical sf movie a la the exquisite Contact or Gattaca or The Matrix (the first one only). It's more Indiana Jones meets Star Wars, and Star Wars itself was a space-frontier Western meets Bollywood sans dancing, so what does that make this? Who cares! Climb aboard for a fun ride. <br /> <br />If I were to recite the story it would probably read as a litany of every sf cliche in the book (or rather movie world) except for time travel - ragtag band of desperados roaming the galaxy in a rustbucket of a spaceship, fleeing the all powerful Alliance, robbing banks and heading to Haven to rest up, drawing philosophical sustenance from the Shepherd, encountering evil quasi-aliens called Reavers who specialize in eating humans - alive, a mysterious girl with weird powers whom the Alliance will do anything to kill, a reclusive geek, the wonderfully nicknamed Mr. Universe who monitors (and can control) the broadcasts across the galaxy, secret subliminal messages in TV advertisements. Anything sound familiar in that? Sure it does.  <br /> <br />You've seen this a hundred times before from Star Wars, the Matrix, Minority Report, the Fifth Element and... you get the point. <br /> <br />But the magic of this movie is that it takes all these hoary standards, stirs them up and comes up with something that is fresh, original and bucketloads of fun. I suspect part of the exuberance has to do with the casting - not a marquee name in the bunch, but all eminently suited to their roles. And the script - laconic, dry humor in all the right places: the James Bond screenwriters should take lessons from these guys. And the action and effects - topnotch, edge-of-your-seat, stomach-in-your-mouth stuff. And the characters: the cynical yet idealistic Mal, captain of the Serenity; the hard-as-nails, curiously named Jayne, ever ready to loba grenade at the enemy; the smart second mate whose name eludes me (Gina Torres, now where have I seen her before?) and the exquisite little River Tam (River - Reaver, any connection?) who makes The Bride of Kill Bill look like a pacifist wuss. <br /> <br />I have promptly put Firefly, the TV series that spawned this movie, onto my wishlist for future purchases. This appears to be the second great sf TV-movie combo I've encountered: the first was Stargate which begat Stargate SG-1. But that's another review.
B000683VI4|4.0|I found this film to be an excellent portrail of the book, unlike the rather disappointing A Walk to Remember. The actors were believeable and the scenery ws exquisite:)
6304884419|5.0|Robert De Niro's directorial debut is a great movie and very under rated. The man has proved himself a genius in the acting field and in this film shows his talent in film making.  Great cast and awesome soundtrack.  A touching story showing life in the bronx from both the point of view of the working man and from that of the criminals who live the good life.  The story deals with the issues of the honest life vs the criminal world and gives an insight into the rough world of the Bronx in an era when it was cut off from most of New York.  Chazz Palminteri gives a wonderful portrayal of Mob boss Sonny, both likeable and at times chilling. You find yourself caught between liking him and fearing him and this aspect comes into the story which involves the son of a working class man befriending a mob boss and being torn between the worlds of his two role models.  The sub plot involves love between races and the tension between the African and the Italian Bronxites.  A fine movie which makes my top films of all time.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've been a Tool fan for awhile now, but this album has me more hooked than ever before...as a Surgeon, this has become my favorite music to listen to whether I am in the Operating Room, my office, or my car......10,000 Days (Wings for Marie: Part 2) has probably the most powerful and emotional lyrics that I have ever encountered.........this album is nothing short of a Masterpiece......
B000FBGBPC|2.0|Animal I Have Become is the only worth while song on the whole CD (in my opinion, of course). TDG have become commercialized, the CD chocked full of weak radio friendly songs, as pressure from the label to sell music and make buck$ ultimately wins out. Glad I downloaded the torrent and didn't waste my money!
B000BNNLN4|4.0|Thought provoking and entertaining novel- a great mix of depth and light hearted story telling..
B00005JMJG|5.0|I adore this film.  The setting is so different than that of other films that I have seen.  It is sort of a melancholie feel that brings you to the monotonous world of Joel and CLememntine.  Their characters are so contrary to the others that they are magnetically repelling yet inevitably attracted to one another.  I honestly believe that this is one or if not Jim Carrey's best role.  Kate Winslets portrail of the compulsive CLementine is wonderful.  I felt that the movie did not receive proper attention.  It had an amazingly written screenplay with a cast full of talent, but lacked popularity.  I see now, that everyone has fallen in love with Eternal Sunshine, I'm just sad that it wasn't loved at the oscars. <br /> <br />\\"Meet me in Montauk.\\"
067101756X|5.0|Mr. Corso dosent waste your time with beating around the bushes to get to the 'good stuff'. This book is loaded with dates, names, and the times, everything happened. I have found this book very hard to put down. Its loaded with facts, and has documents to prove it as well. Great read.
B0000013G9|5.0|I was never a real big TLC fan during the time they were big and I got this one after reading that it was their best album.  So, I wanted to check it out.  I gotta say that this album is very sexy and way cool, and while it's silly in parts, there is no craziness here, which is a good thing.  This album is so sexy and so fun to listen to, very easy to vibe to.  Man, I wish I had given this a listen to when it was first out.  But, oh well.  Ain't no time like the present...
0440236738|3.0|I didn't think this was near as good as some of Harlan's books, but it was a fun listen.  It's terribly convoluted with who done it and it's quite entertaining, but it's not the most delicious novel I've ever read.  As well, the reader was not the best for this book.  At least there wasn't music in the background.  It's worth the purchase and the listen...or read.  It's still good...
B00005JM0B|5.0|To many people, \\"Terminator 3\\", or \\"T3\\" seemed cheesy when they first saw the trailer for it in theaters. But that was only the cover of the book. When I first saw the movie, I LOVED IT! It realy was good! I bought it and watched it and really liked it! It's really not bad. The 4th one looks like it could be good too.
B000002513|5.0|If there was any justice in this world, this and not Born to Run would've been Bruce's breakthrough. Granted, Born to Run is the better of the two records, but only by a hair.<br /><br />The E Street Shuffle opens the album up, and it's not at all what one who knew Bruce from the radio hits would expect: more of a jazz -sounding track with lots of horns and Latin percussion. A far cry from songs like Born to Run or Dancing in the Dark. Next up we have Sandy, a lovely ballad and one of Bruce's more moving pieces. I hate accordians, but here I have to admit the instrument gives the song life, as do Bruce's lyrics of working-class love. The blues jam Kitty's Back s a true forgotten gem, showcasing The Big Man's skills with tenor sax. Wild Billy's Circus Story is probably the weakest track of the bunch, but it's still a good song, just not at the level this one can reach. It is different, I'll give it that. Incident on 57th Street portrays Spanish Johnny's ill-fated romance with Puerto Rican Jane, and is one of the best-written songs here though it does go on a bit too long. Track six is the one everybody knows: Rosalita, a mind-blowing explosion of joy and one of mankind's greatest recordings. I know it. You know it. Every Springsteen fan on Earth knows it/ The Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame knows it. Rolling Stone Magazine knows it. Classic rock radio knows it. In short, everyone knows it. Bruce's lyrics are at once funny and insightful, and the music backing it is even better. We close out with New York City Serenade. After a genre-blending piano solo that must be heard to be believed, Bruce enters with his lyrics. Few songs are as moving, as poetic as this one, a portrait of life in New York City.<br /><br />It's kinda funny how this one is usually an afterthought, especially compared to smash hits Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town and Born in the USA. But don't let that stop you from buying it. It's a very amazing record.
B000002J1F|5.0|In the world of what people call \\"progressive rock\\" of the early 1970s, this is probably one of the least pretenious and all around glorious albums of that period.  With the band in a hurry to make an album to cover Mr. Wakeman's instrument expenses, the album would almost seem like a sure fire flop, one that, in the hands of almost any other band, would be dismissed almost immediately.  Yet, with the help of the radio-friendly \\"Roundabout\\", and I use that term loosely, since it would definitely be radio-unfriendly in this day, the album is one of the finest masterworks of the 1970s.  Far from being the ancient, old coots of rock Punk would surely label them as, this album \\"rocks out\\" as well as any, yet explores the limits of standard rock better than most.   <br /> <br />While I never would consider it as progressive as anything bands the like of the Mahavishu put out, it's still just as pleasing for the musically minded, or those who just enjoy pure song-craft.  With only three full-length tunes (in the Yes sense of full-length) under the album's belt, they had to fill the album with solo attempts, and it worked out beautifully. <br /> <br />After Roundabout, you get Wakeman's wonderful Can and Brahms, and while I've heard people point out it's basically just Rick showing off the fact that he knows classical, the way he styles it fits in very well with the rest of the album and almost seems playful to me... much more than just a mere workout.  We Have Heaven is a great follow-up, featuring Mr. Anderson using the best instrument he has, his voice.  With simple background instrumentation, he really makes his voice sound like Heaven, making him a close runner up in the best voice in art-rock, right behind Peter Gabriel.   <br /> <br />The second full-length song, South Side of the Sky, explodes with a tremendous sound, thanks in no small part to Chris Squire's booming bass and the wonderful fret work of Steve Howe.  And let's not forget the memorable vocals by Jon Anderson.  Five Per Cent For Nothing is Steve Howe's solo workout, but once again, is much more than that.  A nice interplay with the bass makes it more than filler.  Long Distance Runaround is the only other song I've ever heard on the radio from this album, and is great in that no one instrument sticks out, and grooves deliciously. <br /> <br />To round out the album, you have the Fish, which is Chris Squire's bass workout, which, to me, is probably the only weak album on the track, and not really all that memorable in my eyes. <br />But that's okay, because you get the beautiful Steve Howe solo acoustic guitar solo in Mood for a Day, to lead up in to what I consider the best song ever performed:  Heart of the Sunrise.  There is no way for me to adequately describe this song without doing it some kind of injustice.  All I have to say is listen to it.  The beautiful atmosphere of Wakeman's synth, the pulsating bass work of Squire, and amazing guitar work of Steve Howe, and of course, the most intoxicating vocals of Jon Anderson really put this song above all the rest.  I never tire of any second of its 11 minute duration.   <br /> <br />While I'll always think Close to the Edge edge's out this album in terms of consistency and granduer, this ranks up there with the greatest ever.

0780628551|2.0|Johnny Depp is my wife's favorite actor, so she bought The Astronaut's Wife from a bargain DVD bin when she saw his face on the cover.<br /><br />The plot's a little garbled, but it goes something like this: Capt. Alex Streck (Nick Cassavettes) and Commander Spence Armacost (Johnny Depp) go off on a space mission.  When they come back, they're different.  Some kind of weird sound--it sounds like shrieking static--was beamed into their bodies.  What it is, exactly, we're not sure.  Let's call it \\"a possessing entity.\\"<br /><br />This malevolent entity wants to have children.  Twins, to be precise.  So Spence becomes fixated on 1) molesting his wife Jillian (Charlize Theron), and 2) building a spacecraft for two pilots.  And then Jillian finds out she's pregnant!  And soon, Streck dies of a seizure and his wife Natalie (Donna Murphy) commits suicide with a toaster!  And it turns out she was pregnant...WITH TWINS!<br /><br />Scary stuff, right?<br /><br />Well, no.  It's not scary.  In fact, the film lingers and drags.  Struggling to inject some urgency is the frenetic Sherman Reese (Joe Morton).  Sherman is convinced something is wrong.  He goes about it all the wrong way, of course, babbling on about aliens from outer space, harassing poor Jillian, and basically ensuring that he's a one note character, not an actually developed person.<br /><br />This movie is a blatant rip-off (or homage, if you think it's good) of Rosemary's Baby.  This explains Theron's pageboy haircut, but doesn't excuse anything else.  The battle of wills between husband and wife is really a battle of viewer's patience.  Will she escape her husband? Will Jillian abort the children? Does anyone care?<br /><br />It's hard to care.  For much of the film, we're not entirely convinced that there's anything actually wrong with Spence. He seems genuinely concerned with his wife; if the movie had bothered to keep us guessing, this would have made for an interesting twist (maybe she WAS crazy all along!).  But it devolves pretty quickly.<br /><br />There's lots of sexual symbolism, and not the good kind.  Yes folks, this is the first film I've ever seen that seriously showed a subway train entering a tunnel overlapped with Depp's \\"Oh\\" face (fans of Office Space will know what I mean).  Is that symbolism or what?<br /><br />Finally, Depp has affected a southern accent for no discernable reason.  It turns into something of a vague mumble and he shifts in and out of it (especially when angry), such that we're not sure if Spence really ever had an accent.  Wouldn't it have been cool if the accent disappeared when the alien possessed him?  Yeah, that would have been neat movie.<br /><br />Rosemary's Baby was very much a product of its time.  The Astronaut's Wife has all the pretty people and slick special effects, but never really bothers to reinforce the sinister nature of the people from beyond.  EVERYONE gets that the Devil is evil incarnate and that you don't want to have his baby.  The Astronaut's Wife never actually proves that the aliens are bad...Jillian's twins could go on to create world peace for all we know.<br /><br />Fortunately, Depp and Theron would go on to do much better works. Alas, the Astronaut's Wife serves as a reminder that you can't just swap out religion with aliens and assume it will be a great movie.zy all along!).

0060194995|5.0|I first read this novel as an assigned reading project in school and was shocked that an \\"old\\" book could be so interesting and could actually deal with such up to date topics as racism! I've since re-read this book, and was amazed at how much I'd either forgotten or had allowed the movie to overwrite. This work should be a must read - it is one of the most important novels writen in the 20th century. <br /> <br />Harper Lee has so easily captured the thoughts of a young girl in rural Alabama - so much so, that it is easy to think that the events contained within the book actually happened. The reading is easy and story immediately catches the reader up into the tale. Jem becomes the older brother we all would have wanted. Scout is the spunky younger sister who irritates at times, but always wins you over. And Dill, though troublesome at first, soon works his way into your heart until you want to protect.  <br /> <br />Even the adults are presented with dignity, although some have the mystique of youth. But who wouldn't have wanted a father like Atticus?  <br /> <br />This book will bring laughter, chills, anger, and tears. This book not only makes a reader think, it makes one feel. And that can be rare. This book will be one I intend to re-read throughout my life.
B00005JP0A|4.0|THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA may put off many moviegoers because it sounds like a silly bit of fluff best seen when released on DVD. But this is a fine little movie that, despite its rather predictable and silly storyline, gives a number of fine actors the opportunity to sharpen their skills in playing roles not usually associated with their repertoire. Especially in the case of the brilliant Meryl Streep, who here proves she can be a convincing evil witch and yet hold our attention for her rare vulnerable moments.  This is a piece of powerful characterization.<br /><br />The story is both well known because of Lauren Weisberger's Top 10 on the charts novel and because the story of a plain Jane making it big in the corporate world at the risk of jeopardizing her ideals and private life.  But the story works again, this time draped in the fashion magazine industry.<br /><br />Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a reporter without a job, a girl simple and physically unsophisticated with a chef boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) and extended family, who is placed for interview with Runway Magazine as the personal assistant to the editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). And is dowdy but smart, and Miranda decides to take her one despite her other assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) and jeering crowd's amazement.  Miranda is a Diva who is a control freak, spits out demands as she tosses her wrap and purse on the assistant's desk, communicates only is stingingly acidic one liners,  and is in general a fearsome Titanic of a woman.  The story revolves around Andy's transformation by magazine worker Nigel (Stanley Tucci) et al and within weeks Andy is Miranda's right hand person, responsible to her whims 24/7.  This obligation and change wrecks havoc with Andy's personal life, leads to a Paris fashion trip, an encounter with Christian Thompson (Simon Baker),a hunky writer with high credentials when sets out to woo Andy, and eventually Andy must make some choices about the speedy treadmill on which she finds herself.<br /><br />Yes, it is a bit of Working Girl, Cinderella, etc but it works on screen due largely to the fine performances by the entire cast - but especially for the stunning tour de force by Streep. Clothed in an endless array of fashionable outfits, Streep is the epitome of the fashion guru: she hasn't looked this beautiful in a long time and this film reminds us that she is a very attractive as well as inordinately gifted actress.  This role is so well played that it may even be listed in the Oscar category.  Now who would have ever expected that from the rather silly idea of The Devil Wears Prada?  Strong work!

0898705525|5.0|In this book, one of the great writers of the last century, writes his defense of the philosophy of Historical Christianity. He goes to great lengths to debate the views of his contemporaries (H.G. Wells, Robert Bernard Shaw) and the influences on his contemporaries (specifically Nietzsche). Chesterton can seem to go off topic at times (it is said he never wrote rough drafts - what we read is his thought process un-edited), but his insights and are purely astounding and worth going down those rabbit trails. I won't dare go into his arguments, as I'm sure other reviews have done that sufficiently, plus I'm not smart enough or have have enough time to do them justice. Read the book for yourself. Chesterton is an absolute delight to read. It's a shame that a man like G.K. Chesterton has been forgotten, while the men whom he often debated have so heavily influenced our culture. We would do well to bring the clarity of thought and ideas of Chesterton back into the public forum. For a Christian who wishes to intellectually defend his faith (as opposed to the blind faith we are often accused of), this book is indispensible.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|This Darkened Heart was one of the best of 2004, and now The Fall Of Ideals is standing tall as one of the best releases of 2006.<br /><br />They got a new drummer and he is about ten times better than the old drummer. There are blast beats, and very fast double bass. Oli is still amazing at guitar and his solos are still as great as ever. The biggest change would have to be Phil's voice. He does sing more now, but don't let that fool you. On this cd he brings in  the lows. His lows give a new feeling to All That Remains.<br /><br />In my opinion, I think this is much better than This Darkened Heart. Not to degrade that cd, or anything because This Darkened Heart is an amazing cd. The Fall of Ideals is faster and I think the guitar work and skills have increased a lot since their 2004 release. The first time I heard This Calling, I knew this cd would be great. Definitely get this if you liked their last cd. A lot of people have been hating on this cd because there is \\"too much singing\\". Phil has a great singing voice, and he lets you know on this cd.<br /><br />The more and more I listen to this cd, the more and more I like it. Every song on the cd is amazing, but stand out tracks are Whispers (I Hear Your), Six, Become The Catalyst, and Empty Inside.<br /><br />Besides Adam D. from Killswitch produced this cd. He has yet to let me down and every cd he produces turns out amazing.
B00000272N|5.0|I won't bore you with comparing this disc to the music genres evolving at the time of its release, but I will say that if you like Guns 'N Roses, you will like this CD. Every song on it is good, there is no \\"filler\\" as many reviewers on here claim. There doesn't exist one song on the disc that I've not had in my head for at least 24 hours constantly. <br /> <br />This is the last Alice in Chains disc I bought, and is admittedly not my favorite, but I disagree strongly with the people who say it doesn't sound like Alice in Chains. It does, because their sound was never locked into one style, yet all their music shared a common thread: Layne's amazing voice, and Jerry's skillful guitar. Not to leave out the other band members, as they all were completely essential. <br /> <br />AIC is a band that either you're the typical radio listener and know a couple of songs by, or you know them all. And by God, if you're between, head to the store and pickup the remaining albums missing from your collection. I probably couldn't pick a favorite album, but if I had to it would be Unplugged..or Jar of Flies...or Dirt...or Alice in Chains...or Facelift. The only CD I never  bought was SAP, but the songs on it are duplicated on other CD's so I never did. Point being, AIC rules, buy all their CD's or die! Or just have bad taste in music...
B000F3UAFC|5.0|Excelent combination(landscapes, locations, music, etc). Good and memorable words. High quality on human being thoughts. <br />Scarlet is admirable and for me one of the most beautiful women in the world. I think that Scarlet really is a good woman. <br />Williarrd
B0006399FS|4.0|Overall, this album is very good.  Crumbs\\" \\"OOTS\\" and \\"COBL\\" are songs that stand out.  Although I like this album, it is obvious that U2 has rehashed material from their earlier albums. The melodies and hooks are beautiful and appealing, but U2 has taken a very safe approach to writing the music for this album.  The lyrics are heartfelt, open, and honest. Aside from the song vertigo, I feel that this is a very personal album from Bono.  Musically, the edge, larry, and adam have not pushed themselves.  Part of the journey in making music is to constantly explore, grow, and re-invent not only lyrically, but musically too.  I hope for their next album, U2 take inspiration from \\"achtung baby\\" to re-invent their sound and push the envelope. Can they do it again? I hope so. They are damn well capable.  I also feel Rick Rubin is the man to guide them to that next level.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|If you listen to the negative, you are mentally challenged and probably not a true floyd fan.  I'd get this for the \\"Poles Apart\\" bootleg song alone.  That's a tough one to find live anywhere.  The concert has been recut, so it's not exactly the same as the original (collectors, you really need both versions).  Lots of special stuff added.  Very cool.  As for the one complaint on the sound, get your dvd player checked.  The video quality rules...even on a big 77 inch projection tv.  Awesome.
B00005JMYI|5.0|I came into Anchorman with low expectations. I heard alot of people say that it was bad. I tried to get into it at the beginning, I like Will Ferrell maybe it could work. Then I heard him threaten to hit Christina Applegate in the ovary, right in the baby maker. I saw 3 more times after that hilarious!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|If you like Knopfler, you'll enjoy the trademark sounds that he creates therefore, you must buy this album.  Whether or not you are familiar with Emmylou, you will want to hear the way they compliment each other.  Emmylou has played with countless people  along all sorts of musical genres through the years and she is very sought after as an accompanist.  Personally, I am a big fan of the stuff she did with Leo Kottke in the 70's, this compares to some of the best that came out of those sessions in terms of sound and overall feeling.  Knopfler is fantastic on his own, but she is a bonus feature that makes this album one that you shouldn't pass up...
0671015206|5.0|Thomas J. Stanley has written an admirable book on the wealthy in the United States.  This book focuses on the \\"truly\\" rich - those with a net worth of at least 1 million dollars.  The author shows that \\"wealthy\\" in  America does not consist of a high consumption lifestyle, but rather a more low key accumulation of appreciating assets that ultimately build net worth. <br />The book is about ten years old but all the important information and the message is communicates is timeless. It's both fascinating and easy to read. It should be REQUIRED reading for everyone graduating high school and/or college.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|If you want to like Shadows Fall, but are exasperated with weak vocals; if you bought Killswitch's album but never listen to it because it's not complex enough; if you love Trivium but need more out of the throat vocals; if you love the twin guitar work of Maiden and the technical thrash of (early) Metallica, -THIS ALBUM IS FOR YOU.    Especially if you heard and loved 'This Darkened Heart' - you should have this CD already.  It really is fantastic, engaging, and very impressive.  These guys not only have melody, they have talent.  The dualling riffs and trading solos are worth the money alone.  And yes, Phil does an excellent job on vocals.  In fact, the entire band makes this album a better one than the last, and, consequently, a better album than all of the other metal-core out there.  Trust me, this genre's success will not last, but these guys are more than metal-core, they are METAL; so when the hype that surrounds Killswitch and Co. fades away, this band will truly be All That Remains.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This extended version of Kingdom of Heaven is a much deeper experience. There's alot mroe character depth, especially with many of the characters who we loved in the original film but who were there too briefly. Also this is alot more historically accurate, portraying the people and the times the way it should have been. This is definitely the definitive edition of this film, and to me the original is just a trailer. This changes everything about the story, even if it's no more than half an hour or so of extra footage, each extra scene is crucial and does change the perspective of the narrative. Plus, as a muslim, it is an excellent feeling to see one of our greatest and fairest leaders in history portrayed in the right manner, as a just loving person who taught his people how to respect all religions, especially that of christianity and judaism for they were all the same religion in the end under the same god. Entertaining, emotional, and highly political, I recomend this film to all.

B0002234LS|3.0|First things first.  I guessed the ending to this movie in the PREVIEWS!!!  That's never a good sign.  But this film does have some quality moments in it that allow me to rate it as just \\"average.\\"  First, Johnny Depp is VERY good in this movie.  Few actors can spend as much time on screen by themselves and pull it off and Depp is one of those actors.  I think the book might have made things less predictable, but in a movie format, it just seems so obvious that part of you wonders that you will be surprised...but you won't.  There were some cool flashback scenes here and there, but in the end, this movie won't stick with you.

0783221487|3.0|When I was a kid, I tore through all of the first books in the Dune series, and loved them. But several decades later, the original story captured on film--even if made by David Lynch and Dino De Laurentiis--left me lukewarm.<br /><br />In 1984, I don't recall being aware that it had come out, much less that it was a flop. I watched the whole VHS tape. Now I know  why it flopped.<br /><br />The story quickly came back to me: the evil Baron, Paul Atreides (Kyle McLachlan), his father the Duke, the religious mystical quality--and especially the worms on the desert planet, Arrakis, where Paul's family meets its fate.<br /><br />But really, the politics is internecine, and dare I say, stupid, along with some acting, early portions of the script and many weird sci-fi machines, space ships, security shields, and so on.<br /><br />There's some magic in remembering the story, no matter how contrived-looking some scenes. I enjoyed seeing Paul struggle up the side of a giant worm and ride to battle. But this film by no means meets the usual standards of its makers.<br /><br />The bottom line: this film is best for unapologetic Dune junkies. Everyone else can miss it with a clear conscience.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a beautifully made movie based on a classic novel.  Great acting, the story. characters, and scenery are depicted wonderfully.  I loved watching this with my sister and again with my daughter.  I even got my husband to watch it with me and he actually admitted to enjoying it, too! A great movie to have in your library, so beautiful to watch.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Not normally a fan of physical comedy, with the exception of Benny Hill, Fawlty Towers has got to be one of the funniest British comedies ever broadcast on television.<br /><br />With over 237 reviews of this 4 disc DVD set here on Amazon.com, I don't think I need to expand on the merits of each episode; nonetheless, Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) is such a pathetic but amusing character you cannot help laughing at. Supporting cast including Prunella Scales and Connie Booth (who co-wrote the series) are, of course, are the perfect comedic foil to our beleaguered and boorish host. Other supporting characters are also superb.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nicely done set with additional footage and interviews from some of the cast as well as a short documentary on the actual hotel (unfortunately destroyed in a fire) in Torquay, England, where the series was filmed outside of the studio.<br /><br />While \\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\\" may be a little off-the-wall or hard to take for some audiences, \\"Fawlty Towers\\" is the perfect antidote to the typical American situation comedy.<br /><br />Although not of a sophisticated or urbane wit or satire as say, \\"Yes, Minister,\\" with Nigel Hawthorne and Paul Eddington, \\"Fawlty Towers\\" does offer the viewer a lens into the comedic slapstick genius of John Cleese and some truly exceptional writing for a 30 minute program.
0670032506|4.0|A sophisticated and brief set of fifty-two disciplinary observations and requirements for better control and less confusion.  A good book - but not as thorough and enlightening as I had hoped for -but then, I hoped for a lot.

0141439734|5.0|I will not give away the plot, and I encourage all to read this literary masterpiece. The author's technique in this novel is to use an independent observer, a Mr. Utterson, who re-tells what has happened to his friend Dr. Jekyll. The story is short: just 70 pages.<br /><br />I would have never picked this book to read without some guidance. It was on Nabokov's  books to read list from his Cornell teaching notes on European Literature (circa 1950) now available in book form: Lectures on Literature (Paperback) by Vladimir Nabokov.<br /><br />His seven books or novels are:<br /><br />Jane Austen - Mansfield Park<br />Charles Dickens - Bleak House<br />Gustave Flaubert - Madame Bovary<br />Robert Louis Stevenson - Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde<br />Marcel Proust - The Walk by Swann's Place<br />Franz Kafka - The Metamorphosis<br />James Joyce - Ulysses<br /><br />Why is the present book on that list? The reason - without giving away the plot - is that it is not a simple science fiction or similar story. It is about human failings and about obsession, compulsion, and human weakness. The story is the battle between a doctor and the counter character that he has created. Who will win this battle: good or evil?<br /><br />This is a terrific but short novella just 70 pages long. The present Penguin classic contains a good analysis of the story by Robert Mighall, plus two other short stories: \\"The Body Snatcher\\" and \\"Olalla.\\" These have similar macabre themes but on different subjects and they are not as deep as \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\" The latter is a literary work of art similar in spirit to \\"Lolita,\\" another book about human failings and compulsions. The plot details are obviously very different as is the London setting here.
B00080ZG10|3.0|This film does represent a serious investment of your time. And, after nearly three hours of viewing, you do not get a full picture of Howard Hughes' life. Scorcese's pacing is just painfully slow, right up until the oddly abrupt ending. At the very least he could've given us a block of type at the end that filled us in on the rest of Hughes' achievements, when he died, etc. That said, the acting is great and at least some of the storyline is quite inspiring. The cast is large and everyone contributes high-quality work. DiCaprio and Blanchett in particular really get into their roles.
0671891634|5.0|I guess what I find funny is that some of the other reviewers say this book does not help. Having read the book I am really quite taken aback.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book! This is a book written by real investment guru with a strong track record. His advice is solid.<br /><br />In many ways I found this to be a very surprising book to read. What I found surprising was the degree to which Peter Lynch tries to think independently and look at the big picture. His advice is very practical and very down to earth. He follows his own instincts and does not follow other people's advice. He tries to follow social trends and go to malls and other places - where anyone can go - to get an idea about what product or store is hot and what is not. Then he investigates the financials of that \\"hot\\" prospect.<br /><br />For example if he learns from his wife that a new store like the Gap or similar is suddenly full of shoppers and things are flying off the shelves, he will investigate the financials, cash flow, etc. If the stock is a \\"buy\\" he will not sell when it goes up 25%. He will set a price in his mind where he thinks the stock can go, say 200% or 400% higher. Then he will buy and hold until that occurs, holding the stock through volatile fluctuations. And he does that on his own. Once he can accumulate a number of multi-integer growth stocks, then the portfolio tends to take care of itself and small losers are easily written off.<br /><br />A very good read. He talks about mutual funds and S&P type investments also.<br /><br />Five stars.
B00005JOQS|5.0|brandon routh plays a great superman... but he plays somewhat of a different character than what i have known clark kent to be. he was NOT AS DORKY. the visual effects were awesome. the plot was great. the acting was good for the most part. the guy who plays richard (cyclops in X-men) does NOT impress me. but bryan singer is an excellent director and i think that this movie has great potential for a sequel. :)
6305128952|1.0|I just read The Divide by the author of the Horse Whisperer, and I wanted to share my opinion of the Horse Whisperer. <br />I did not read the book; I saw the movie, a couple of years ago.  I just remember it being very hoakie, one of the worst movies I had ever seen.  I know that it drew some critical acclaim and that it was popular with the public, but I did not share this enthusiasm.  Don't waste your time on this ridiculous movie.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|This is probably one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.  It stays with you long after it ends.  It makes you look at the choices you make in your life. <br /> <br />I really loved this movie!!
B000002U82|5.0|I first heard this album when I was about fourteen years old and really could not get the concept of this masterpiece.  I am a thirty year old black male and this was during the time of the golden age of hip-hop, so to speak. Fortunately my uncle owned a record shop in D.C. and I would come in all the time and peruse through all the old vinyl. So about three weeks ago after many years of exposure to a lot of vitage r&b, rock, and jazz. I decided to give the ol' record with the mysterios triangle (as I use to call it long ago before getting hip to Pink Floyd's other albums ie.,Wish you were here)a listen. And boy was I in for a real treat. This album is truly ahead of it's time with the way they use the different percussion instruments. And Roger Waters and David Gilmour playing on the guitar and bass respectively are exceptional and no less than remarkable. I felt like I really had to do some catching up because I heard their Animals and The Wall albums first (I know it sounds weird doesn't it). The rest of the band are also remarkable as they all play so well together. The way the background vocals flow in and out of the songs is mesmerizing. I am also getting tired of some people labeling this album as some \\"getting high\\" to type music because that label somewhat takes away the genius of this piece of work. If you want to get technical damn near eighty percent of the music that comes out you can reach an \\"higher elevation\\" so to speak. I can see how this album stayed on the charts for fifteen years. There are many artist that need to take note of this album because the blueprint is all here and that goes for all genres of music, PERIOD!! The way the songs so smoothly flow into one another is similiar to Marvin Gayes music minus the great vocal of yours truly, no pun intened. All n' all this is a must have for all collectors of great music. Pink Floyd Forever!!!
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Witty and very well-written. Kilmer's sarcastic, gay private investigator character is a scream. Downey's line delivery is perfect in every scene. Hands down, this is the most entertaining film I've seen in the past two or three years. I laughed out loud several times - and it's hard for a movie to make me laugh with all the same old cheap scatalogical and sexual inuendo, mean-ness and sophmoric behavior passed off as comedy in film these days.  The gags in this film are mostly situational, well thought out and come from the hand of a writer who obviously worked very hard to come up with something that is truly funny. Funny funny funny.<br /><br />If you liked Guy (Mr Madonna) Ritchie's \\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\" and \\"Snatch\\" You are going to love this. It isn't quite as violent but the humour is very similar.
0767817729|5.0|A very close, very dear freind recomended this movie to me. I now know why.For me, and also for him this movie reaches a place deep within.I reccomend it for all to see because I think at some point in our lives we all know or should know, someone with whom we have a chemistry, another person that feelings cannot be denied for. And how sad for those who can't relate to such a beautiful love story. I suppose that for a person who has never found forbidden love and suffered the torments of knowing they can never truly be together they can't fully appreciate a movie of this magnitude.
0307276902|5.0|I'm actually not going to bash this book solely for the fact that a bunch of the stories were faked because it actually helped to make the book better/more interesting and it doesn't deflect from the meaning behind the message. In this case I don't care if it was a memoir or fiction because sometimes books are meant to take you out of the world you're in and take you into someone elses mind and this book did that for me. I loved the characters. They were lovable even though they were overwhelmingly flawed. It was,at times, laugh out loud funny, sad or so romantic that you wish were were the crack addict who alcoholic/criminal/druggist james was in love with. It was an excellent book and I would deffinately recommend it. Just keep in mind that it's only a book and you shouldn't take the listing it's under seriously. Overall, I would deffinately say you should read it.
B00003CXS4|4.0|The plot of Snatch is hard to explain, but while you're watching the movie it's not hard to follow. There are two story lines that eventually cross each other. Two low-level boxing promoters, Turkish and Tommy, get in trouble with a nasty mobster called Brick Top who likes to feed people to his pigs. Brad Pitt plays an incomprehensible Irish gypsy bare knuckle fighter who boxes for Turkish after putting Turkish's boxer in the hospital. His one problem is that instead of taking a dive as instructed, he knocks his opponent out with one punch. <br /> <br />In the other story, Benicio del Toro steals an 86 carat diamond in Belgium, then comes to London to give it to a man named Doug whose American cousin, played by Dennis Farina, is waiting for it.  However, there is a Russian named Boris the Blade who hires two pawn shop owners to steal it for him. Dennis Farina has to leave the states and come to London to find his diamond with the help of a man named Bullet Toothed Tony. The diamond changes hands several times and then there's the cute little dog who eats a squeak toy so he squeaks every time he barks. <br /> <br />Eventually the two story lines cross several times and it all makes sense in the end. Snatch is a fast paced movie with a fair amount of violence and humor. The overall story is clever and the characters are wild and varied. If you enjoy movies like Pulp Fiction, you'd probably like Snatch.
037571457X|5.0|There is no word to describe the oddity that is \\"Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood.\\" This is as much a novel as it is a comic, as much a biography as it is a satire... This book/comic is funny yet tragic, witty yet shocking in its bluntness. The images of Satrapi as a child who goes through adolesence at the peak of the Iranian Revolution is sometimes difficult to handle, there are violent images, yet pages where the reader must laugh out loud at the magic that Satrapi weaves through her animation and writing. I have not enjoyed a book this much in a long time. Its formula is bizarre - take an Asterix Comic Book, add a historic yet tragic tale of human tragedy, war and religion, and narrate it in a dead-pan style that is witty while hilarious - and somehow it all works. The approximately 150 pages of this book educate the reader tremendously on what transpired pre- and during the Revolution that changed Iran, and the world in some ways, and its raw and real feel make it a truly fantastic read.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|We had watched the Celtic Woman presentations on television so when I saw the CD available I bought it and gave it to my husband for his birthday. Now we're both enjoying the beautiful melodies.
1416503730|5.0|In \\"Mr. Perfect\\", I was treated to a wonderful thriller chock full of laughs, intrigue, and sex. <br /> <br />While eating a meal, 4 friends come up with a semi-farcical list of what would constitute the perfect man.  The problem is, the list gets out of their hands, and into the media, the internet, and beyond.  The 4 friends are mortified by their instant celebrity, but that becomes the least of their worries.  Soon, one of them is dead, and the thrill ride is on. <br /> <br />Linda Howard's ability to create memorable and fun characters is amazing.  The plot is nothing short of fascinating, and while I figured out WHO the killer was, I completely was wrong as to WHY they were the killer.  I won't spoil it for you, but that made the story that much better! <br /> <br />If you don't enjoy this one, you may not have a pulse.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I'm not going to go in-depth with this review, but I will say that this is one of the more unique rock records to grace my presence in quite some time.  Each song has it's own unique qualities about it, whether it be amazing guitar solos, incredible drumming, a mixture of both, or just a great song period.  This band isn't your typical rock band with riff after riff after riff; this is a band that knows how to rock out with a variety that will leave you wondering what's going to happen next.<br /><br />This album, I guarantee, isn't for everybody.  However, if you want an album with a wide array of different melodies, and you just want a good rock album, then this is your CD!
B000000WF9|5.0|I first saw this movie five years ago, and to this day it is still just as captivating, with a beautiful haunting score.
B0002EQ7EC|4.0|This album is reminiscent of Graceland in its rich native tones. I enjoyed Graceland more as I felt that it was more upbeat overall. The Rhythm of the Saints is a fun listen on its own, but also makes great background music for entertaining,tasks or driving.
0767805712|5.0|The first time I saw GATTACA, over 5 years ago, I was instantly enthralled by Andrew Niccol's score. My sister and I could hum along the score years later, even though we'd only seen the film once. Finally we decided to purchase both the film and the soundtrack and we are not disappointed.
B000FMGTTE|4.0|Ottman wrote a good score, incorporating much of the music of <br />John Williams.  Having listened to both, I give Williams 5 <br />stars and Ottman 4. Ottman has written a good movie score, <br />but John Williams soars above his colleague.  I wish John <br />Williams had scored RETURNS--it would have made the movie <br />phenomenal! <br /> <br />
B0009A1AS2|4.0|While not my favorite DT album (Their older stuff, such as Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence and Change Of Seasons were far superior), Octavarium is still a good progressive rock album. It is probably their most mainstream album with hits such as \\"These Walls\\" and \\"The Root Of All Evil\\". The best song off this is \\"Octavarium\\" (the title track, the last song. James' vocals sound awesome on that song. So if you want the newest from DT, buy this.
B0009A21R6|5.0|This quite possibly is the best quality 5.1 surround sound mix I've ever heard. This is the import only SACD 5.1 CD, not to be confused with the DVD-Audio 5.1 edition available in the U.S.  Actually one of the reviews posted here appears to be for the DVD-Audio version.  Both versions are playable on standard CD players though the DVD-A is a 2 sided disk where you must flip it over to the other side for the standard CD mix.  So, with both Hybrid SACD and DVD-A we now have CD's that can be played on any player though you really need to play them on surround sound systems to get the full appreciation of their sound.  Otherwise, why buy it?  I will say that most hybrid SACD's I've played on standard CD players (automobile) do sound better than their non-SACD versions.   <br /> <br />Well, I do have both the SACD and DVD-A versions (just to show my obsession/love for this CD). The first thing to make clear, the SACD version may or may not have used the same audio source mixes used for the DVD-A version, but they are by no means inferior.  The 2 versions truly do sound different.  Its hard to describe in words how much additional sonic details come out in the SACD version verses the DVD-A.  I have an above average system (not top high end) and I'm able to hear sonic details including guitar passages I've never heard before.  One listen to the final song, Brothers in Arms is all it takes though there is not a weak moment song-wise or sound-wise on this SACD.  As for the DVD-A, it's still good, but on my system I can't draw out the same details that I'm able to on the SACD version.  Maybe has something to do with my DVD player being a SONY SACD/DVD combo player?  Or, maybe the SACD version is just that much better.  I'll leave that for further debate. <br /> <br />The fact that most people have a surround sound DVD system and not many people have a SACD player does mean the DVD-A will be the more popular version purchased.  That is a shame as I just don't hear the same level of detail in the DVD-A 5.1 mix (at least on my system).  From a playability perspective, I also prefer the SACD over the DVD-A.  When you put the DVD-A in your player you will find it defaults to the standard 2 channel mix and requires you to go into the menu and select the 5.1 mix.  With the SACD it will automatically detect the 5.1 mix if played in a SACD player.  Also, if you have a multi-disc DVD player, once the DVD-A has finished playing it will not automatically move to the next disc in the changer as this SACD will.   <br /> <br />So, if you love this CD and have a SACD player, don't hesitate to purchase this one.  As for the DVD-A, I've heard better than this one, but I still believe the DVD-A is a worthwhile purchase if you don't have a SACD player as long as you have surround sound stereo DVD system.  It will still provide a new level of enjoyment for listening to this classic Dire Straits CD. <br />
B000002N3J|5.0|When this was released back in 1995, I was a huge Madonna fan. These are songs that were mostly forgotten because Madonna is known for her dance songs more than her powerful ballads. My favorite track off of this album is \\"I'll Remember\\". A great song and a huge hit for Madonna. Another great song is \\"Crazy For You\\". Alot of these songs were huge hits for her. Other highlights are \\"This Used To Be My Playground, Yull See, Rain, Oh Father\\" and many more. They also forgot one of Madonna's great ballads, \\"Bad Girl\\" is missing, that was a #36 hit from her 1992 \\"Erotica\\" album.
B000FA57RG|3.0|This well shot and edited documentary, shows us yet another candid insight into the giddying and exhausting on and off stage life of the mega-pop star and phenomema that is Madonna Louise Ciccone(Ritchie), during yet another world tour and 're-invention' of herself. Yet, while the world, myself included, continues to pay hommage to the amazing power and energy she exudes as a pop music artist and performer,the disappointing truth is that Madonna is much more attractive and captivating on stage than off. She's just so shamelessly self-centred and takes herself so dam seriously that it has become boring. I found her somewhat fascinating in the past, but now I find her predictable quite frankly, and patronizing in many respects.\\" I've always thought my job was to wake people up\\" she declares. Wow! Queen Madonna has discovered the light, the wisdom of the Kabbalah and the metaphysical world, we would never have known any of this without her guidance now would we?..pplleease! I'm the first to admit her creativity, originality and talent for artistic interpretation of her music and image are indeed mesmerizing, and there's no doubt that this fiesty pint-sized Italian-American woman was born to entertain and command the centre of attention. But when she starts lecturing us on 'spirituality' (preaching the Kabbalah and reading the Tora or whatever... yawn yawn) and politics (stomping into the Holy Land in her berret like a female Che-Guevera, chewing gum and mouthing off, Paparazzi in tow, thinking she can solve the crisis in the Middle East); quite frankly I just want to switch off. I mean how deluded is this woman? How big is her ego?. The fact remains Madonna, you are a pop icon and a very talented and clever one at that, who ultimatley sells records and concert tickets and reaches many people through music,dance and image, blended into a kind of mainstream 'performance art', that is certainly very powerful at times and often cutting edge. But I'm afraid those of us wholive in the real world know you don't and never will have, the far-reaching political and social influence or 'clout' that your self absorbtion leads you to believe. You are a performer a 'pop star', not Mahatma Gandhi, not Nelson Mandela, or Mother Theresa (or Even Princess Diana for that matter)! The more cynical amongst us, can't help but also think this is just another phase in the Madonna publicity machine. Today, lamenting about the shallowness and consequences of 'American (capitalist) life' in her commando gear, then tomorrow, playing Lady of the Manor in the English country side with hubbie, in her designer horse-riding attire. Wonder how long that will last? You can't help but feel it's all just a game of expensive 'dress ups' with Madonna. I'm certainly not knocking her for having a political opinion or spiritual awareness and do infact agree with much of what she's saying, but I think she'd best save the serious politics and 'save the world' campaign for the real heavy weights, and not the part-time 'Primadonnas', if you'll pardon the pun.  There are other moments here which made me cringe also, like trying to give her entourage of dancers a 'classical' education by taking them to a concert pianist recital in Paris. In between all your rough language, infantile humour, bossiness and street-wise posturing (with those very mannish biceps and shoulders of yours) the 'f...ings' and 'Motherf...ers', (yeah.. real cultured, very high brow) you want to then portray yourself as this ultra- sophisticated, refined-cultured woman of the world, who mixes with all the crown heads of Europe and knows all about high art. You just can't be all things to all people, and no-matter how deep and meaningful you try to be, you just come off as a phoney somehow.  I'd give this DVD (and CD) package 4 stars for the music and concert footage and remain a true fan of Madonna the artist, but Madonna the person, just leaves me unmoved, I'm sorry to say. And even with all the best that money can buy, including an education, I can't help feeling sorry for those children. I'm sure Mads is a devoted Mum, but imagine growing up in the shadow of this stardom and megalomania and with that kind of pressure. Little 'Lourdes',a darker toned image of her famous Mother, showing off her fluency in French, la de da, even talks like her. Discussing her Mum's children's book 'The English Roses' in that annoying over annunciated way that sounds like an American trying to put on a posh accent. Another Diva in the making there no doubt. Which ever way you slice it, it's an artificial life and those kids don't have a real childhood.  Look don't get me wrong, fans will just love this (and hate this review)I'm sure. And I don't deny, Madonna can be riveting with a presence that can't be ignored. It's just that I, like many others who have suffered from Madonna overkill, handle her best in small doses. That tinny, mechanical voice and manner of hers and her obsession with her own importance, just get on your nerves after a while. Great, that she's found a spiritual path and has a political conscience (as well as being a supporter of Michael Moore, a big tick in her favour) and all that. But stick to what you do best Madonna, entertainment. Your voice and role as 'agent provocateur' works and is best contained through your musical expression and artistry.

This book is wonderful; it makes the essence of good design so clear that it seems obvious, seems like you've known it all along.<br /><br />This book should be read by anyone who has any intention of coming near a software development process.

0061020710|5.0|It took a long time for me to give myself permission to enjoy a book that is this much fun. It has absolutely no redeeming social value. I didn't laugh out loud very much (though I did do so now and then). But it was very funny. More than that, it was simply fun. Too much fun. I found myself not reading the things I wanted to read, because I really wanted to read this more.<br /><br />What is worse, there are 30+ more books in the series. I may not get anything done until 2009. And $7 may not be much but 30*7 is, well, more than nothing I can tell you that.<br /><br />Where was this when I was in high school?

B0002W18MU|5.0|HE WENT HOME ON THE EVENING TRAIN  <br />AMERICAN V: A HUNDRED HIGHWAYS - Johnny Cash <br />A review: Ken Schmierer <br /> <br />RICK RUBIN: He told me, 'I have to get to work. If you don't have something for me to do every day, I'm going to die.' He really believed music was the only thing he had left to live for.  It's a hard record to listen to and it's really sad, and it's beautiful. I absolutely love it. It's the music he wanted people to hear. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />I was introduced to the greatness that was Johnny Cash by my friend Donn Voorhees in 1968.  I remember he loved a new album called FOLSON PRISON BLUE'S and I went out and bought it and played it tell I wore the grooves off of it.  Younger people probably don't know what grooves are but suffice to say I wore out the record.  It was an album that made country music cool at least in my circles.   Okay, that was primarily the bars and Honky Tonks of the Dakotas but none the less.... ever since, I have been a giant fan of Johnny Cash.  I only had the privilege of seeing him live once back in the nineties in the Topeka's Performing Arts Center with the great June Carter. I feel fortunate that I got to see John and June sing their songs and perform their art, live and in person, at least once.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />I purchased the new Johnny Cash CD - A HUNDRED HIGHWAYS last week and was not disappointed.   This is the first posthumous album in the Rick Rubin-produced American series and may be followed more.  This death bed confession is not something just anyone could have gotten away with... but Cash in bad voice, breathing hard and obviously in pain makes it memorable. It is like being present at the end of an era....  In a place where the oxygen is slowly being sucked out of the room. It is like being near the dying gasp of one of the old Blues singers or when Jimmy Rodgers recorded his last live recording while succumbing to tuberculosis.  If it wasn't for his congeniality, his contentment, his comfortableness with the process and letting us listen in... You might feel a little guilty and voyeuristic at being part of something that seems so private, something so personal.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The music is Sparse, raw and powerful.  Proof that great music is more than just voice and instrumentation.  It is something that comes from way down deep in the soul and only a few people are blessed with the ability to pull it out and put it on display for the rest of us and to fully convey the power of song.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Do not go gentle into that good night, <br /> <br />Old age should burn and rave at close of day; <br /> <br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Listening to this album brings to mind the famous Dylan Thomas poem.  John was not going gently into that good night... he was definitely rage, rage, raging against the dying of the light.  I expect some people might think this to be an unfortunate use of what was once a great instrument - Cash's singing voice.  Some will think the producer Rick Rubin was exploiting Cash in his final days getting one more pay day from a man obviously on his death bed. But no one exploits Johnny Cash... all you have to do is listen and hear the inner strength of a man doing something that he truly loves.  What greater way to leave God's green earth than to be doing something you love so dearly?    <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Music is a cerebral process that touches the soul in a way that you can not explain to those who don't feel it.  People who don't feel it are incapable of getting it.  Not their fault just a fact of life.  Here you have a man singing with great heart about life and death, two things we all care about deeply... but it is at a whole different level.  It is like peeking in the window at something forbidden....  A most moving and memorable experience in its own way!  Contrast the final days of Johnny to Elviswho was just going through the motions unable to remember the words and not even bothering to care....  living for the adulation and the paycheck.   Unlike Elvis here a man who is obviously doing something he loves because he loves to do it.  It is inspirational to be able to listen in on his burn and his rage against the dying of the light.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Everyone who hears this CD will have a different favorite song.  When I listen to it next week again I am sure another song will come to the top of my list. But my current favorite is Ian Tyson's FOUR STRONG WINDS.  Heartfelt, this rendition gives the song a whole new perspective and charm.  Admittedly I have loved this song no matter who performed it  since I first heard it back in the sixties.  It is always interesting to see a really good song interpreted in a different way by a significant and great artist.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Oh Lord help me to walk another mile, just one more mile <br /> <br />I'm tired of walking all alone. <br /> <br />Oh lord help me to smile another smile, just one more smile <br /> <br />Don't think I can do things on my own. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The opening song HELP ME is a plaintive prayer that seems so Johnny Cash and so descriptive of his last days.... that it is hard to believe that Larry Gatlin wrote the song or didn't write it with Cash in mind.  A great opening song that really defines what the CD is all about.  John is not going to pull any punches in this the final stage of his life. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />A song that resonated for me when I first heard Rod McKuen do it back in the late sixties is LOVE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME.   If my memory serves me the story was that he wrote if for Frank Sinatra.  True or not, it is really interesting to listen to Cash's voice very reminiscent of McKuen himself as he adds a whole new layer to this song. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />I have been a rover <br /> <br />I have walked alone <br /> <br />Hiked a hundred highways <br /> <br />Never found a home <br /> <br />Still in all I'm happy <br /> <br />The reason is, you see <br /> <br />Once in a while along the way <br /> <br />Love's been good to me <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />John once again brings a new feeling to the song.... not of a young man waxing eloquently about a lost love but of a man at the end of the day thanking life itself for the wanderlust that made it so enjoyable in retrospect.  Reminiscing about the life he lived and how it all worked out in spite of the sadness of broken relationships and hurtful events along the way. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Cash also tackles other well known songs like Gordon Lightfoot's IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND, Hank William's ON THE EVENING TRAIN, Don Gibson's A LEGEND IN MY TIME and Bruce Springsteen's FURTHER UP THE ROAD.  Good song choices and interesting treatments.   But none as good as Cash's own song: LIKE THE 309.  What would a Cash album be without a few train songs and this one is special.  It is the last song he wrote and obviously he wrote it about his then current situation  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />It should be awhile before I see Dr. Death  <br /> <br />So it would sure be nice if I could get my breadth  <br /> <br />Well I'm not the crying nor the whining kind  <br /> <br />Till I hear the whistle of the 309, of the 309, of the 309  <br /> <br />Put me and my box on the 309  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Take me to the depot  <br /> <br />Put me to bed  <br /> <br />Blow an electric fan on my knarly old head  <br /> <br />Everybody take a look see I'm doing fine  <br /> <br />Then load my box on the 309  <br /> <br />On the 309, on the 309  <br /> <br />Put me and my box on the 309  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Write me a letter, sing me a song  <br /> <br />Tell me all about it  <br /> <br />What I did wrong  <br /> <br />Meanwhile I will be doing fine  <br /> <br />Then load my box on the 309  <br /> <br />On the 309  <br /> <br />On the 309<br /> <br />Gonna get outta here on the 309 <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The gravitas and dignity of Cash's peformance is more than just interesting or entertaining it is haunting.  The Man in Black uses his last breadth to convey a sense of the world passing before his eyes. His voice searches for the notes in every lost nook and cranny of his soul as it fluctuates, pulsates and twitches producing what can only be described as real music the way music was meant to be sung... from the heart not the pocketbook; real not commercial; rough and raw not pretty. <br /> <br />

0767817729|5.0|This DVD is confusingly listed on every website I have checked as \\"Widescreen/Pan & Scan,\\" and \\"2.35:1\\" and so on.  This is not correct.  The movie is presented ONLY in full frame format, and the picture quality is SO BAD that it appears to have been transferred from an old VHS tape by some shady characters on the Black Market.   <br /> <br />What really shocks me, though, is that none of the 38 reviews here on Amazon.com mention the incorrect aspect ratio listing or the terrible image quality.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately this movie does not appear to have been released in any other Region - all other countries I've checked just sell the US import - so this terrible version is the only one around.  It's too bad, really, because I remember seeing this film years ago on TV in all its WS glory and it was absolutely magnificent.  If anyone knows where to get a better copy please post it here.   <br /> <br />5 stars for the film, none at all for the DVD.   <br /> <br />It's hard to believe that any studio would take a film with such great cinematography that was filmed on high quality film stock and put out a DVD release which almost looks as though it was camcordered in a theatre.  Please, please, please put out a proper studio release from the original master print so that we can see this film the way it originally looked in the cinema.   <br />
B0002YCVXI|5.0|If this CD contains only the music from (The Mission), (Good, Bad & Ugly) & (La Califfa), it worth more than its price. Some of Morricone's greatest works, a very sensitive play from Ma & a dreamy mode from 1st till last moment (and that's exactly why I mentioned the cuts in this CD). <br /> <br />The cuts here are really bad and unjustified too. You may note this especially when shocked by the cuts between the themes from (The Mission: Gabriel's Oboe & The falls) & (Once Upon A Time In America: Cockeye's Song & Main theme). They break the mode for nothing. Themes from each film should be presented as one musical piece as they were heard in the great CD : Arena Concerto. In fact, one of the greatest things in Morricone's music is that you can listen to the many themes from any film as a one piece if they are properly mixed together (and what a GREAT TALENT he has to do so), remember how he treated the many themes & different modes from Canone Inverso (Making Love) included in Arena Concerto CD? that was like a beautiful 15 minutes symphony. And even if there is a reason for those cuts, there were more suitable moments to cut in, especially between Gabriel's Oboe & The falls. There is a very silent moment after Gabriel's Oboe and before start playing The Falls, instead they presented the introduction to The Falls theme under the title of Gabriel's Oboe and suddenly, in the middle of the theme, : CUT and next track (which is the remains of The Falls theme). <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a perfect dreamy CD & a must have not only for Morricone's fans, but for all classic music ones. <br /> <br />Don't forget to listen carefully to the background played by Ma in The Ecstasy Of Gold (from GBU) & the wonderful background played by the Orchestra in the second half of Dinner (from La Califfa). I think a new soul of the original melodies has been discovered by Morricone by writing these new backgrounds.    <br />

B000F6IOC0|3.0|After seeing and enjoying the original \\"Underworld\\" I was very eager to see the sequel \\"Underworld: Evolution\\". I wish I could say that I enjoyed it as much as I had the first. Perhaps it was the fact the material was no longer fresh, or perhaps the vampire concept has been done to death, but this movie really left me feeling flat.  <br />Kate Beckinsale returns as Selene the vampire Death Dealer who has sworn to rid the world of all Lycans (werewolves). She is now on the run with her lover Michael (Scott Speedman) who has been transformed into a Vampire/Lycan half breed. They are being pursued by Marcus, (Tony Curran, \\"The 13th Warrior\\") the worlds first vampire pureblood, for their perceived betrayal of the vampire race.  <br />The sequel picks up almost immediately where the original left off, and even though the original cast and director return there is very little allure in this sequel that made \\"Underworld\\" so intriguing and interesting.  The conflict and hatred between the vampires and Lycans that fueled the first film now seems forced, and I was never quite sure of anyone's motives.  <br />As usual Beckinsale is stunning, and the sight of her in tight leather alone is enough to get most men to watch, but it's simply not enough to carry the entire film. In fact, the love scene between her and Speedman is gratuitous at best and really makes no sense in the framework of the plot.  <br />If you are a fan of the first film, then you really should see \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" but I wouldn't waste the money to own it, because unlike the original, it's just not a movie I would want to see twice. If they decide to make it a trilogy I'd go see the third, but I wouldn't get my hopes up too high.
B00026WUAU|5.0|\\"Street Legal\\" is a pivotal album in Dylan's career. If you want to get autobiographical about it, it marks the final coming to terms with his broken marriage after the turmoil of the two previous albums (\\"Blood on the Tracks\\", \\"Desire\\") and the beginning of his turning to God which was the subject of the next three (\\"Slow Train Coming\\", \\"Saved\\", \\"Shot of Love\\"). <br />But it is MUCH more than a personal chronicle. Musically and lyrically, it is his most complex and in some ways his best work. The three long songs, \\"Changing of the Guards\\", \\"No Time to Think\\", and \\"Where Are You Tonight (Journey Through Dark Heat)\\" have the richness of imagery of Dylan's best albums from the 60's (\\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", \\"Blonde on Blonde\\"), the emotional power of \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", the spiritual awareness (though implicit rather than explicit) of \\"Slow Train Coming\\", and a degree of formal poetic unity and discipline greater than any of them. Dylan is the only songwriter in the world even capable of such control of rhyme, meter, and diction. <br /> <br />Also first-rate are the nasty blues \\"New Pony\\" and the beautiful \\"Is Your Love In Vain?\\"; but every song is strong.  <br /> <br />Dylan's singing also reaches something of a peak on this album -- with the agility of \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Desire\\" and the exuberant emotion of \\"Saved\\". On the whole, I'd have to put this one in the top 5 (along with \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", \\"Highway 61\\", \\"Bootleg Series Vol 3\\" and \\"Time Out of Mind\\"). <br /> <br />The band larger than Dylan usually works with, and he makes the most of it; also of note is the cover photo, which has a coded key to the whole album that also explains the album's title (hint: tan line).
B000FBGBPC|5.0|So maybe it's not quite as heavy as their debut disc, but there's still some good rock songs.  I love the Beatle-esque sound of \\"Pain\\".  I bought this at the same time as the new Hoobastank and Lostprophets cd's and this is the only one of those 3 that I would really reccommend.  Best songs are Pain, Animal I Have Become, Let It Die, Time Of Dying, Gone Forever.  I wish it had some HARD rockers like Burn or Born Like This but overall I'm completely satisfied with this purchase.
B0000062GK|5.0|After Satriani's self-titled, very different-sounding 1995 album, he released this dazzling effort.  Crystal Planet is his second-greatest album, right behind Surfing With The Alien, which is THE perfect guitar album.  CP has so much magic to it, so many hits, I don't know where to begin.  House Full Of Bullets is fun and funky, Crystal Planet breaks the sound barrier, and Love Thing is such a beautiful love song.  Anyone who thinks a song has to have vocals to it to get a message across obviously has never heard any of Joe's music.  I love everything on here, but my favorite song has to be Raspberry Jam Delta-V.  I've come to associate this song with my little girl.  This song is playful, spirited and very energetic, just like her.  No skips on this one; every song is a gem.  Anyone just getting into Joe's music, get Surfing, Super Colossal (his latest) and this masterpiece.  Then sit back and enjoy the magic.
B00005JNEI|5.0|this movie is a stroke of genius. now, i didn't know anything, really, about bush or michael moore when i first saw it. but i was struck by how intelligent & clever michael moore was--the way he emphasizes certain points with juicy footage & facts to back it up, it's all arranged in the perfect order. brings to light all the wrongs that have happened so everyone can understand. <br /> <br />(and by \\"juicy footage & facts\\" I mean juicy footage and facts!)  <br /> <br /> <br /> points out the faults & mistakes that they've made (and by they i mean our GOVERNMENT) and makes bush look like a total idiot. it was fascinating, exciting, funny. you want to know why everyone hates bush, just see this. it'll make you want to laugh and scream.

B000HBK3MM|4.0|I like the new Corinne Bailey Rae CD a lot, but there's something about it that makes it difficult to review. Everything about it, from the way it sounds to the way it is packaged, is extraordinarily retro. Even the flourishes suggest another era; the rhythm section is smooth, not punchy. Orchestration is the real deal, not some synthesized concoction. Given the state of contemporary singer/songwriter product, calling something `retro' is meant as a compliment, and is reason enough for me to recommend this disk, but who exactly am I recommending it to? Judging from the marketplace as it now exists, there just doesn't seem to be much room for singer/songwriters beyond Alicia Keys, so it is imperative that Rae's label finds a niche that radio will nibble, and CD buyers will bite. With melodies like these, that ought to be fairly easy, but today's music scene is baffling and extraordinarily frustrating, so I can't help but wonder how a pretty and feathery light CD like this will fare.<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing about \\"Corinne Bailey Rae\\" is its consistency. Each song flows with a light and easy charm that would have guaranteed hit status a few decades ago. If the year were 1972, this CD would have as many hits as Carole King's \\"Tapestry\\" album. \\"Put Your Records On\\" could have been the summer theme of that year - even the subject of the title (records??) alludes to an earlier era. \\"Trouble Sleeping\\" is just the kind of song you'd have expected to hear on the radio between Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. \\"'Till It Happens to You\\" adds a hint of Alicia Keys into the mix, and other tracks suggest the mellower side of Nelly Furtado, but the real influences here are Joan Armatrading and perhaps Roberta Flack. The production is flawless (remarkably, I can't find a credit in the booklet), and the rhythm section is tastefully unobtrusive and yet supportive. In my opinion, this is the type of musicianship that deserves awards.<br /><br />What could be wrong with a CD that has so much going for it? \\"Corinne Bailey Rae\\" is a comforting album, and I'm comforted to know that talented singer/songwriters can still get recording contracts. The songs are both charming and seductive, but they walk a fine line between the predefined demographics of today's narrow-minded programming requirements. So will this excellent CD be able to find its audience? I guess it isn't my job to figure out who will like it. My only responsibility is to let you know that it's a damn good `record', provided you are open minded and inclined toward the mellower sounds of the early `70s. Most amazingly, this CD is selling like hotcakes, so maybe there is some hope for the music industry after all.

After listening to this album for 20+ years, the best song is \\"Kid,\\" which I think is one of the most overlooked pop songs ever. <br /> <br />
1400043662|4.0|This story appears to be about two people, Mr. Nakata and Kafka Tamura, but it's really about everyones search for the other half of their identity.  There is a myth that in the beginning there were three types of people, male/male, female/female and male/female.  They were cut apart, and we all spend our lives looking for our other half.  Nakata and Kafka are followed on their search.  There are also three minor characters who make the whole story possible, Hoshino (for Nakata) and Oshima and Miss Saeki (for Kafka). <br /> <br />It's interesting to note that Kafka is Czech for CROW, Shima can mean island or stripe and saeki means a marginal profit.  A crow is usually a metaphor for change (neither good or evil), most of the action occurs on Shikoku which is the smallest of the \\"Home Islands\\" but the most mystical in japanese myths, Oshima is of a different stripe (read the book you'll get it), and Miss Saeki is actually a 'marginal' person.  I wish I knew more or that the translator had notes to explain some others that I missed or don't know, they would make the book more enjoyable. <br /> <br />Interestingly enough this is simply the story of a boy going through a 'right of passage' and another being released from his mental prison.  Kafka, is a fifteen year old boy, searching for a lost mother and sister, but in truth he is searching for himself. <br /> <br />Murakami is an amazingly well read man; this you will find out from the quotes of his characters and the knowledge of different cultures that they possess.  He quotes such diverse people as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Beethoven, Hegal, Dickens and many others. They are always quoted in context and are never just thrown in the way people bandy about names to show how cool they are. <br /> <br />This story is a journey, and like all journeys start with the first step.  The first step of your journey is to pick-up a copy and begin to read.  It is definitely worth the trip.
B000078DOH|5.0|Freaky Styley is the Chili Peppers funkiest album. It does'nt mean its their best but some do think its their best. I enjoy it very much and I think its the most underrated Chili Pepper album out there. George Clinton really helped the Chili Peppers make a fantastic, Funked up album. Highlights are Jungleman, Blackeyed Blonde, Catholic School Girls Rule, and Yertle the Turtle. This album is highly reccomended. Also pick up Uplift Mofo Party Plan, and Mother's Milk.
B000EHSVQ4|2.0|This was a great film, but if your looking for true history, you will be disappointed. Also, he (Ridley Scott) makes Saladin a hero of sorts and does not mention his massacres at Hattin or the massacres that were about to ensue in Jerusalem. I only wish it would have been more \\"politically incorrect\\" so it could have been closer to the truth. The majority of the reviewers here are primarily apologetic left-wingers that like things sugar coated. For them, i recommend reading the New York Times Bestseller \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and The Crusades) for starters, so they can see what Islam is really about. Thus, this film remains together with Aliens, pure fiction. <br /> <br />p.s. I don't subscribe to either religion.
B00003CXIP|5.0|This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices. he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era.
0679721037|4.0|As it stands today, John Hersey's \\"Hiroshima\\" is a two-layered book. Written in 1946, the first four chapters, comprising 90 pages, describe the experiences of six inhabitants of Hiroshima, from the morning of August 6, 1945 when the bomb was dropped, through the following year. Added in 1985, chapter 5 adds a further 60 pages that enable the reader to trace the long-term consequences of the bomb on the lives of these six people, as well as Japan and the world in general. <br /> <br />The witnesses chosen by Hersey, \\"who were among the luckiest in Hiroshima\\" (p87), insofar as they were not instantly vaporized, burned to a cinder or flayed alive, are wonderfully diverse. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto was a Methodist minister; Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a war widow and mother of three; Miss Toshiko Sazaki, a clerk about 20 years old; and Fr. Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a 38-year-old German Jesuit. <br /> <br />The last two, Mazakazu Fujii and Terufumi Sasaki, were both doctors, a profession much in demand in the aftermath of the bombing, as only 65 of the 150 doctors in the city had survived, and most of them were so severely wounded that they could not be of any assistance to anyone. As for the 1,780 nurses, 1,654 were either dead or incapacitated, resulting in massive overwork for the small and virtually helpless remaining staff. <br /> <br />\\"Hiroshima\\" is of value mostly as a testimony, adding six more life stories to the existing literature, and enabling the reader to form a more complete picture of the aftereffects of the blast. Unlike \\"Children of the A-Bomb\\" though, a volume which I recently reviewed, it gains strength from its interweaving of the individual stories, as people meet and lose sight of each other, giving the book a unity and a dramatic construction that is reminiscent of the familiar disaster-movie pattern. <br /> <br />Quite unobtrusively, the author also manages to give us the big picture, through the sparse, judicious use of statistics and other general information. The book thus answered some of the questions I had left after my previous readings on the subject, such as the role of charitable institutions after the bombing, Dr. Sasaki illustrating the work of the Red Cross for instance. <br /> <br />I also wondered whether the Japanese had suffered the same fate as some German civilians in the firestorms of WWII (as described by Jorg Friedrich in \\"The Fire : The Bombing of Germany 1940-1945\\"): getting stuck and burned alive in boiling asphalt. Hersey partially answered this question by mentioning that in the afternoon of August 6, \\"the asphalt of the streets was still so soft and hot from the fires that walking was uncomfortable.\\" So some of the horrors endured by the Germans must have been repeated there too.  <br /> <br />This book may well be the best introduction on the market to Hiroshima as seen by the victims. It can be helpfully complemented by the aforementioned \\"Children of the A-Bomb: Testament of the Boys and Girls of Hiroshima\\" edited by Dr. Arata Osada; Keiji Nakazawa's 10-volume manga \\"Barefoot Gen\\" (a rather ugly but powerful series, which is much superior to the two movie adaptations); Paul Wilmshurst's 2005 BBC documentary on the subject; and Koreyoshi Kurahara and Roger Spottiswoode's brilliant \\"Hiroshima\\" (1995), which seamlessly blends stock films and reconstructions in a dispassionate narrative of the events leading up to the dropping of the bomb. <br />

B00005LMBK|5.0|This is a milestone, seriously. The predecessor of \\"Demon Days\\", it is often underrated compared to it. It is, what may be less important, the first full serious album by a cartoon band. But then it is the work of a musical genius named Damon Albarn, the best musician living on this earth (only John Lennon was a bit better, but he is dead as you might know). Him and and his roommate Jamie Hewlett, famous for \\"Tank Girl\\", having lived together for a few years, got bored by all the common MTV music and crap that went on there, so they decided to form a cartoon band. The rest is history. <br /> <br />This album has been entirely written by Damon and roughly produced by him and two mates, who then invited Dan The Automator to add a few hiphop beats. Dan also connected him to Del The Funky Homosapien, now heard on \\"Clint Eastwood\\" and \\"Rock The House\\". <br /> <br />The first track, \\"Re-Hash\\", is a chilled, funny (and a bit funky, too) starter with some weird, seemingly Irish, vocal harmonies toward the end. <br /> <br />5/4 is a damn rocking stomper that never fails to be genius. Guitar and Bass are written in 5/4 beat (thus the name), the drums however in 4/4. Rocks. <br /> <br />Tomorrow Comes Today is a real nice song with a now famous melodica part as well, a real funky bass. <br /> <br />New Genious (Brother). The ultra cool super monster chill. A very funky guitar sample with bass, drums, backing and main vocals that you just gotta love. <br /> <br />Clint Eastwood. The most famous song off the album. Niiice hip hop song with an incredibly genius piano/bass part at the start of the second rap verse, and a neverending outro that is just woooh. <br /> <br />Man Research (Clapper) is an a bit pointless dance track, but you gotta love the yeah yeah part as it is so funny^^ <br /> <br />Punk - well, it would love to be :P Cool. <br /> <br />Sound Check (Gravity) - incredibly sad, and when the first verse stops, it is starting to blow off your mind totally. <br /> <br />Double Bass - ingenius!!!!! Very weird (which key could this be written in?), and totally freakin' gooooooooood! (All of which makes me anxious - at times unbearabyl so does say a cigarette - must master backwards. :)) <br /> <br />Rock The House: A bit boring. <br /> <br />19/2000: As well, but it's still real groovy :) <br /> <br />Latin Simone (Que Pasa Contigo) is a just amazing Latin track with Ibrahim Ferrer on it :) The original version with Damon's vocals (which appeared on their first CD, the Tomorrow Comes Today EP) is even more amazing, oooh how lovable Damon sings! <br /> <br />Starshine: Uber sad. Just wonderful. <br /> <br />Slow Country: OK as well. <br /> <br />M1 A1: The intro belongs to the start of the album. Nevertheless, just a rocking, stomping, amazing bumping track!!! Yay. <br /> <br />Clint Eastwood (Ed Case Refix): Worthless. It's the hidden track. It's boring. At least you gain the full version, as the version on the single is just an edit. <br /> <br />All in all, this must be the 5 points, and one of the 5 best albums that I've ever heard.
B000002UYZ|5.0|This red album is a great collection of their early 1962-66 hits, and obviously goes perfect with the blue collection of later 1967-70 hits. These are the sets to get if the \\"1\\" disc isn't enough for you, the casual fan. My single complaint is that each disc here is only 31 minutes short, but on the bright side we still get 26 hits in all, with lyrics. Unlike the blue collection, this could easily have been put on one disc, with many songs added. Still, the highlights are here from \\"Love Me Do\\" to \\"Yellow Submarine\\". Maybe one day we'll get a 27 track companion to the \\"1\\" disc.
1594830835|2.0|Camel Club isn't one of Baldacci's best BY FAR.  The story is more of a comic book creation of hi-level government spooks and how they can do anything, merely by saying it's available via the computer databases. <br />Also, Baldacci devotes an inordinate amount of space to muslim criticism of the many faults of the USA, thus justifying their crimes.  Maybe Baldacci is grooming himself for employment by the New york Times?   <br />But if you like fiction with heroes who are never seriously harmed, though taking on insurmountable odds, this is for you.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|En su versión sin Cortes, Extendía.  <br /> <br />Esta que es a mi gusto la mejor adaptación del comic viene en una gran presentación un empaque bastante bueno esta película basada en el comic de culto de Frank Miller dirigida por Robert Rodríguez, Frank Miller y como invitado especial a Quentin Tarantino. <br /> <br />Entre lo que contiene viene con un comic The Hard Goodbye <br /> <br />Material Adicional: la versión en pantalla verde sin los efectos (pero en cámara rápida con una duración como de 20 min.) y realmente puedes apreciar el gran trabajo que llevo esta película haciendo todo computadora, uno de mis favoritos en los Dvd's de Robert Rodríguez la escuela de cocina en 10 min. En la que nos enseña a hacer burritos desde como hacer tortillas, un detrás de cámaras de la toma que dirigió Tarantino, la escuela de filmación donde en 15 min. Nos muestra su estudio con todos los departamentos que tiene bastante interesante, comentarios de Frank Miller y Robert Rodríguez otro de Tarantino y nos muestran igual como hicieron las armas de la película cuales usaron y por que igual con los coches, ropa, villanos. <br /> <br />Un Dvd muy recomendable lleno de material adicional para los que disfrutaron ver esta película van a quedar muy satisfechos con esta edicion.
B000BPK2PM|5.0|System of a down's newest album is great ! The clean version isnt that good the music is amazing. Some songs on the album are slower than most. The best song on the album is definintly tenitive. This is a great album if ure just gettin into S.O.A.D!!!!! Rock on \m/ <br />
B000F3AAUW|5.0|`St. Elsewhere', the dazzlingly inventive debut CD from the duo of DJ/Producer Danger Mouse and rapper Cee-Lo a.k.a Gnarls Barkley, is a musical hodge-podge; traces of hip hop, funk, electronica, and 60s prog rock weave in and out of the brief to-the-point 12 tracks. Oh, and loads of dark, humorous lyrics.<br /><br />Lead off single and worldwide smash `Crazy' is a hypnotic sounding dance/soul ditty about losing one's mind with haunting effects for good measure, and very soulful (Marvin Gaye/Al Green-ish) vocals from Cee-Lo. This was the first single to top the UK charts on digital download sales alone, and is currently placed at #2 on Billboard's hot 100.<br /><br />And there is a lot more where that came from; `The Last Time' is a breezy midtempo soulful song with awesome vocal layering. The half spoken/sung title track is hugely catchy, as is similar sounding `Necromancer' (with dark, cryptic lyrics). The start/stop `Just a thought' is simply brilliant!<br /><br />The bouncy, horn sprinkled `Gone Daddy Gone' (with great electric guitar) is a great pop/rock tune. In a similar vein is second single `Smiley Faces' with haunting disembodied harmonies, and lots of electronic tweets and effects.<br /><br />The all-too-brief `Feng Shui' is a dreamy rap, while the aggressive `Transformer' sounds like Outkast meets Bootsy Collins. `Who Cares', and `Online' are laid back soulful gems.<br /><br />Actually, each track is worthy of mention and praise. The last CD this catchy and inventive I heard was `Demon Days' by Gorillaz. Small wonder, as that disc was produced by Danger Mouse.<br /><br />Already #1 in the UK album charts, it's all set to repeat the massive success stateside...
B000002UJQ|5.0|wow, a heated debate and some strong opinions coming out about this album. personally, i think this is one of the best albums of all time. for people that hate it, well... i dont know what to say really, except i feel sorry for you (no doubt that will infuriate people who hate this album for the reason that other people love it... and frankly, i dont give a damn). having had the priviledge of seeing them twice live, including glastonbury, i can also say they are one of the best live acts ever, and not something i will forget in a hurry. superb.
B00006FDCD|1.0|I just want to start this off by saying....CHECK MY REVIEW FOR THE BOOK <br /> <br /> <br />I loved the book, so i had my wife buy me the DVD off of EBAY <br /> <br />I couldnt wait to watch it. After watching this movie, i am truly scarred. This has to be one of the most HORRID things that has ever been put on film. How can SK let this be created? <br />Are they kidding me, with this movie? was it supposed to be a joke? <br /> <br />My wife said for that we will just sell it on EBAY, i said NO. I could not let another human being go thru this torture!!! <br />So i took the DVD and casing, went out in my backyard, and burned it with lighting fluid!!!!! <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE IS BRAIN POLLUTION <br />GO READ THE BOOK....THE BOOK WAS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER READ!
0393035158|3.0|Like most of us, Sam Harris holds a lot of conflicting thoughts and emotions. Informed Westerners know well the crimes committed by religion that he outlines. He seems to think he has laid out a consistent argument for disposing with the Abrahamic faiths. The first half of the book was on its way, to my mind.  <br /> <br />But what really is eating at Harris, it seems, is that there are Muslims who will destroy themselves in order to kill infidels, preferably Israelis and Americans. This thought frightens him so badly that he can't imagine a Muslim who isn't a potential suicide bomber. He quotes passage after passage from the Koran that demonstrates the religion's attitude toward the ungodly. He insists that all Muslims are fundamentalists who take these admonitions literally. The possibility that they will obtain weapons of mass destruction outweighs any possible call for restraint. If you don't agree with him, you're not a realist. If you do, then no amount of torture at Guantanamo or anywhere else is unjustified.  <br /> <br />Then he claims to be a Buddhist! <br /> <br />The large number of people who have bought and reviewed this book demonstrate that the topics of religion, terror and the future of reason are compelling in our time. Perhaps Harris's book will spur others to reflect on the issues he raises. In the meantime, if Harris came to me, I would suggest he contemplate the consequences of the actions he recommends. I'd also have him re-read the Constitution and the works of the Enlightenment thinkers. Their case for reason had nothing to do with locking up and abusing people with whom they disagreed.
B0000WN0ZK|2.0|Gotta love the flashback to the sixties that is reflected in every scene of this movie (of course, it was just a product of its time--the mid-60s--it's not a film trying to recapture the era..it IS the era). Still the storyline is slim and the going slow. Interesting scenes appear here and there. The parts are definitely better than the whole. There's an intriguing idea in here it just never gets developed as it should. Actually, thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching it was. It's subtle, I'll grant you that. And a nice character study....and yet....?  <br /> <br />We were counting the minutes left in the film by the end (\\"Only 25 minutes left in the film and then we can get back to our lives!\\") so that's not a good sign.
B000B5XOYI|3.0|This, The Batman Boxed set spans all four films(1989-1997) including the three different Batmans and Two different directors.  In 'Batman' Micheal Keaton plays the dark knight in a very stylish, dark and brooding art deco Gotham, against the Joker(Jack Nickleson). Kim Bassinger as the lovely photojounalist Vicki Vale. The Plot of this movie was pretty simple Batman vs. The Joker and his plans to poison the city with his smiley chemical by mixing health and beauty products.   Plus the introduction of both characters into Gotham. Sidebar dealing with corrupt police all the while trying to maintain his secret identity. Several of the Things I didn't like about this film. Batman didn't do enough fighting.  Batman is supposed to be a master of martial arts, I didn't see too much of that.  Next, Commisioner Gordon, Batman's trusted confidante within the Gotham Police, Played by Pat Hingle....Pat Hingle? Gordon is thin and kind of distinguised looking. Not overweight and incompitant. One more thing...Alfred. One of the cardinal rules was the sanctity of the batcave and the secret identity of Batman.  What does alfred do? Brings Vicki Vale down there for a look around, moron. Everything else...for the time it came out, Gotham, The Batmobile, the gadgets, the Batjet? Pretty cool. <br /> <br /> In 'Batman Returns' Keaton isn't the only one who makes a return appearance.  Tim Burton helms this films directors seat a second time. This Film wasn't as strong as Burtons first outing. It was visually stunning, but it felt enclosed like you knew you were watching something that was filmed on a set. Rather than the illusion that you were watching something actually film in the city.  I think Burton drops the ball with this film trying to do to many things in the same film. First you have the plot with the Penguin(played by Danny DeVito) with him trying to find out who his parents are and trying to overthrow the city by getting into public office.  Next you have the subplot with the Catwoman(played by Michelle Pfieffer---no theres something no special effect can top-Pfieffer in a skintight vinyl body suit with high heals and a whip!), is she a good guy, a bad guy who knows! Then theres the corporate bad guy Max Schreck(played by Christopher Walken) whos involved directly with all the characters.  Theres just too much going on with all these secondary characters and not enough Batman. Which is why I think Keaton backed out after this film. He thought his character was taking a back seat to the supporters. <br />I thought the climax of the film with the penguin sending his penguin army into Gotham with missles strapped to their backs was a little ridiculous, it reminded me of the old Adam West Batman TV show. <br /> <br />The Franchise starts to buckle with the release of the Third Batman in 'Batman Forever' Even though I thought Val Kilmer played a good batman and an even better bruce wayne, I think that placing Joel Schumaker in the directors chair was a huge mistake.  In the First two films Gotham is dark gothic city with style.  In this third outing under Schumakers supervision, gotham is slowly being transformed from Burtons Gothic city scape into a neon drenched tokyo shangri-la! Absolute Garbage!  The plot?  The Riddler(Jim Carrey) creates a mind control device thats used through a Television Cable Unit that kind of looks like a blender.  All financed by stolen funds when he joins forces with Two Face(Tommy Lee Jones).  This Film sees the introduction of Robin the boy wonder(Chris O'donnell)Big mistake which leads to the dumbest line emmitted in the film,\\"Holy Rusted metal batman!\\"  Jim Carrey as the Riddler? Great I get to watch Jim Carrey play the Riddler as Jim Carrey, not good. I would have paid real money to watch Frank Gorshen reprise his role from the old tv show. <br /> <br />Which brings me to the Final film in this boxed set 'Batman and Robin' why? because people did throw away good money to watch this rubbish. George Clooney takes up the role as the dark knight....no let me rephrase that, the caped crusader! Comic book fans bow their collective heads in a moment of silence as the franchise takes a crippling blow in the form of a lame batman film. Filled with comic book origin catastrophes abound. Like the film before it, this movie sees the introduction of Batgirl(Alicia Silverstone), but as alfred niece? Supposed to be Commisioner Gordons daughter, but since Burton botched that one in the first film with Pat Hingle....things are burying themselves quickly. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Victor Freeze, o.k. but the outfit, too much again Mr. Schumaker. and when the Mr. Freeze henchmen come out on Ice skates. It was the TV show all over again.  Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, not bad. But when batman and robin fight over her in the Gotham Auction(Batman pulls rank on Robin with his \\"Bat-Credit card\\")just ruined the whole thing for me. And the Character Bane, was such a turning point in the batman comic book when he breaks batman's back.  Cheeses out in this film as Poison Ivy's muscle. <br /> <br />This boxed set is  a nice addition to a dvd library if you can get over the last two films(almost like superman 3 & 4) Bottom Line....not bad. A little too much for a marathon you might want to break it up, 1 and 2 then 3 and 4-on a diffent night. <br /> <br />
B00004WGAI|1.0|I've watched this version a few times and tried to like it but unfortunately I can't.  Some of the scenes are quite disapponting, there is so much to work with in this novel but they just don't capture anything. The 2 main actors Tim and Zelah don't in any way suit the roles they are playing, so immediately I can't warm to it.  Tim acts well but isn't Rochester and Zelah is just well, strange! Even Pilot the dog seems disastrously miscast!  If you want to see a true, classic adaptation of a fine novel with outstanding acting, then go no further than the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, simply outstanding in every way.  I think the fact that it has been released after 30 years due to popular demand says it all!  It's a complete joy to watch and proves that you don't have to cast a young, tall dark and handsome actor as Rochester to ensure that you produce a fine adaptation.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|David Gilmore was the sound of Pink Floyd, and it comes thru loud and clear with On An Island. It is awesome <br />Patti McAuliffe
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|this is a real nice special edition dvd, with nice extras and a great quality. its a real  cool dvd. two thumbs ups! <br />also came with the original japanese audio track. even cooler!
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Wicked is a marvelous show that, at first, I thought was overrated.  So many people talk about how great it is, and I was certain that it had to be mostly hype.  Then, I got the soundtrack and I'm now the one cheering it on.  It's a creative show, based on a wonderful book, with fantastic vocals and refreshingly new music.  I thoroughly enjoyed this show, though there were a few songs that I felt were dull and dragged a bit.  For the most part, though, I loved it and think that it's a great way to interest another generation in the joys of Broadway.
0783231032|4.0|Quick and simple, not the best movie ever, but damn funny and entertaining. Personally I think it gets a bad rap. <br />DVD?? Directers cut, extended. Not really nessessary but I like to see things that didn't make the final cut, for whatever reason. <br />Long movie none the less, but great 2.35 widescreen transfer (contrary to other reviews) and the 5.1 mix is GREAT !! This mix is so intense at times , I can't even play it at normal volume without pissing off my neighbors. Tons of bonus features too. At the price , it's a steal.
0525948023|1.0|How strange. Last week on this site the last ten out of twelve reviews were very negative of Tolles latest copy. Today they have all been deleted. No wonder Tolles books sell well if only positive reviews are kept. I expect this will go after a week or so. Watch and see. <br />Lesson here is do not wrote a negative review. It will be deleted. How? Simple. One or two of Tolles fanatical disciples will complain. Yet Tolles says everything is perfect so how come they do not seem to follow this part of his story?
0441013074|4.0|\\"Century Rain\\" is an interesting attempt at smashing SF and film-noir style detective fiction together, with some alternate history as well, and seeing what results.  For such a mix of disparate styles, this book works very well.  It's something different - which is a quality increasingly hard to find in SF novels overall.  Generally well-written and well-plotted, this novel held my interest throughout.<br /><br />So why just four stars?  I agree with one of the other reviewers about the over-cuteness of some of the throwaways in the book - the same ones made me wince as well.  And, in this novel Reynolds has a tendency to put the characters in situations characterized as ones from which they cannot possibly survive, and they do, perhaps once or twice too often for believeability.<br /><br />Still, this is an interesting novel that is at least worth checking out from the library.  Fans of Reynolds' other works will want to just purchase this outright.
B000E33VWW|2.0|I have to admit that I don't own the DVD but I had see the movie. I had great expectations but the movie was horrible, it was slow, it has no action. Maybe the history of Truman Capote is great but this movie was a big waste of time.
B000002KAT|5.0|Well first, I think this album is absolutely brilliant..  Why?!?  Well, for many of the reasons that some listeners reviewing it didn't like it..  What appears to be loose structure, thick mixes of swirling instruments and all around experimental composition in all senses of instrumentation and Lyricism.  Being a musician and writer, I use it as an example of being able to produce a piece of work that is absolutely honest and true to its time. <br /> <br />Once when I was dating a girl, her brother knew that I was a \\"Van Fan\\" and asked me which CD he should get and obviously I stated \\"Astral Weeks\\".  He bought and two weeks later told me he would NEVER trust my opinion again..  He stated \\"Why would you recommend an Van album that didn't have Brown Eyed Girl on it\\"..   <br /> <br />The Music.. As far as I can tell, their is not an Electric instrument on the album..  All acoustic guitars, Upright bass, trap drum kit, Flutes, horns, Vibraphone as well as other acoustic instruments but truthfully, I have never been able to pinpoint an electric instrument on any of the songs..  PURE musical tone..  It is fused with Elements of Jazz, blues, folk and always with Van's twist of Traditional Irish influence.   <br /> <br />I have seen many state that they find \\"Beside You\\" To be more of the \\"Annoying\\" Songs but truthfully, It is really my favorite.. <br /> <br />I would also say if you are a fan of Counting Crows, you should purchase this album..  I saw them a few years back and midst one of their songs, Adam Duritz sang \\"And I will walk and talk in gardens all misty wet with rain\\".  I looked around to see a few jump up and down with ecstatic approval of what appears to be Adam's approval and admiration of this recording..  <br />
B000F7CMRM|1.0|The movie embraces ((typical Hollywood stereotypes)) it merely uses them for beneficial reasons! With arrogance and ignorance, it points fingers at certain groups in support of the media propaganda. <br /> It does not even deserve the one star I gave it. In fact I would give it an (F-) for its sick content, and false arbitrary accusations and generalizations. That it deserves! <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|If you are looking for the \\"Don't Fall In Love with Me\\" song from John's piano room in his web site it is on the Sergio Mendez album Timeless. I am just passing this on because I first heard the song on John's site and was despretly looking for a copy. Those of you who have heard the song know what I am talking about, anyway hope the info helped and enjoy both of these albums they are great. If you havent heard this song go to johnlegend.com it will be in the piano room ...go now I can wait......trust me you wont regreat it and this review will make more sence.
0446605409|4.0|Nelson DeMille is one of those trusted authors where when you see his name as author, you can't go wrong. His books keep you entertained for hours, or until you're tired of sitting, but not of reading.  <br /> <br />\\"Plum Island\\" is another one of his greats. I won't get into plot, but his characters are real, a bit loveable, and people you want to be friends with. The story is believable and keeps you turning the pages as you eavesdrop as him and his associates \\"solve the crime\\" and bounce along to an exciding ending. <br /> <br />Get this book, schedule at least three hours of quality reading time, and ready-set-go! You'll enjoy it - a perfect plum summer read! <br />
B000DN5W4I|5.0|To recently release a world class bassist in Eric Czar, and Kenny Kramme a great drummer, both whom have Defined Bonamassa for the last Five and a half years is Way beyond me..Mind boggling to say the least..But, more his loss than theirs...Without a doubt, one of the Most powerful live concerts ive seen in Many years...Recommmend this dvd one Big Time, but what a shame, that he has choosen a lesser band to continue on with. For that id have to give him One Star.
B00013F38K|5.0|I used to watch King Fu during my college days every Thursday night when it was on (ABC foolishly moved it to Saturday nights its last season). The character of Kwai-Chang Caine was one of my favorite on TV. The first season had four particularly outstanding episodes (in my opinion): <br />1. The Praying Mantis Kills <br />2. Chains (another emmy nomination) <br />3. An Eye For An Eye (won an emmy) <br />4. Alethea (starring a young Jodie Foster)
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Finally a Batman movie made with a realistic approach and the main focus is on the iconic cape crusader and not the villains.  I would have to say this might be the best comic adaptation ever made, surpassing \\"Spiderman\\" and the original \\"Superman\\".  Don't even hesitate to buy this film because it is truly a classic.
B00005JNX0|5.0|This was a movie that kept a smile on my face and often made me laugh out loud. What I really liked is that most kid movies are so predictable. this movie on the other hand wasn't. Sure we all know nothing really bad is going to happen but how the details played out was imaginative and frankly quite fun.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|This is on my ipod, my laptop and that junky MP3 player. I play it over and over again not listening to what she is saying but the emotion she is conveying while saying it. Her voice leaves me feeling like she is the saddest woman in the entire world, well beyond the agony of defeat in a relationship, the loss, the negotiation, bargaining with god...something beyond that. If you were to write a song about your true love leaving, this is the ransom note you would write...it is a passionate command of saying goodbye while twisting the hear into saying be with me. Her voice says it all, beyond the lyrics, the orchestration and the arrangement.
074325144X|5.0|I am 43 and had quit running because of knee and ankle pain.  Then I read this book, and discovered that I had literally been pounding the pavement when I ran before.  My joints couldn't handle it.  Now I have no joint or back pain when I run.  I feel like a kid again.  This book is the best money I have spent in years.  And for the reviewer that thinks this book gives you too much to think about when you run, I recommend forgetting the book and running barefoot.  I suspect that you will end up incorporating the really important Chi Running techniques this way.  Myself, I'd rather read the book and run with shoes.

B000ESSTKG|3.0|I have bought both versions (UK and USA). Here is my review.    1) The Sound: Both versions sound equal. The remastering at least on the CD layer is not better than the singles 86>98. Period.   The new remasterings are in the middle between the \\"old\\" CD's and The Singles 86>98 CD, so don't expecte a \\"big\\" improvement unless of course you have a SACD player or a 5.1 system.    2) The SACD layer: The USA doesn't contain this layer. I think they should be presenting a CD/SACD + DVD (as originally designed) on this 'remaster' series, not just a plain CD with an additional DVD. However if you don't own a SACD player this layer is useless.    3) The video format: The USA remasters are NTSC and Region 1. The UK are PAL and Multiregion. However if you live in America and have a good CD Player Sony the USA remasters are more useful because sony doesn't reproduce PAL DVD's.    4) Both versions can be ripped to a mp3 format. No problem.    Which version you should buy?, the're almost equal, one has an advantage over the other and viceversa. At the end the decision is only yours.

B0007M22TI|5.0|I think too many of the reviewers are trying to pick apart and find flaws for whatever reason.  My opinion is simply this - if you want to hear amazing music with a contemporary spin on cultural song, done by extremely talented performers, in a way that will entertain you and that you can truly enjoy - you will like Celtic Woman.  There are a few simple facts about Celtic Woman:<br /><br />1.  They have been at the top of the Billboard World Music charts for 68 consecutive weeks.  No other performer ever has.  There is a reason.<br /><br />2.  The violinist is one of the top performers IN THE WORLD.  She is a national and international music champion.  She has worked with many top musicians from around the world.  She has more energy and skill than most performers in any medium.<br /><br />3.  The vocalists are extremely talented and their performances (especially live) are spellbinding.<br /><br />4.  Many people put it up against Riverdance.  The music was produced and arranged by the same man who did Riverdance - and he doesn't dissapoint.<br /><br />I don't know about the DVD, but I have seen them live and there is no lip-syncing.  Just amazing performance after amazing performance.  In the span of a 2 1/2 hour concert I went from being an observer to an avid fan.  I think you will too.
B000ENV2Q4|3.0|I have bought both versions (UK and USA). Here is my review. <br /> <br />1) The Sound: Both versions sound equal. The remastering at least on the CD layer is not better than the singles 81>85-Period.  <br />The new remasterings are in the middle between the \\"old\\" CD's and The Singles 81>85 CD, so don't expecte a \\"big\\" improvement unless of course you have a SACD player or a 5.1 system. <br /> <br />2) The SACD layer: The USA doesn't contain this layer. I think they should be presenting a CD/SACD + DVD (as originally designed) on this 'remaster' series, not just a plain CD with an additional DVD. However if you don't own a SACD player this layer is useless. <br /> <br />3) The video format: The USA remasters are NTSC and Region 1. The UK are PAL and Multiregion. However if you live in America and have a good CD Player Sony the USA remasters are more useful because sony doesn't reproduce PAL DVD's. <br /> <br />4) Both versions can be ripped to a mp3 format. No problem. <br /> <br />Which version you should buy?, the're almost equal, one has an advantage over the other and viceversa. At the end the decision is only yours.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood without a doubt is the best family show on tv.Its such a shame they decided to discontinue this show. You will love every episodes of Everwood! you will cry and laugh for all caracter and what they have been through. This is absolutely a must have collection,because you won't get tired to see it over and over!<br /><br />I really wish that WB will release season 2-4 of Everwood. I can't wait to see the rest of it!

0786245972|3.0|I tried to read this book when it first came out, but as a new father to a daughter, I couldn't get past the first chapter. It was just too powerful, too frightening ... But I returned to it this summer and finished it last night. Sebold is a terrific writer and you could have a whole seminar on the literary merits of the novel. Particularly impressive was her ability to step into the shoes of her characters and describe their pain and thoughts. It made me ache, and sometimes I dreaded the idea of continuing to read. The father's pain was excruciating, and it's a testament to Sebold's writing abilities that I could feel that pain. I also understood the mother's blinding urge to run in an heart-breaking attempt to outdistance the pain and memories. But, that said, I was disappointed with the Hollywood ending. I had no idea where the book was going as I neared its end. Sebold had done a good job of keeping me guessing. But given the tone of the first two-thirds, I had hoped that Sebold was going to remain courageous, and consistent. In that regard, I felt cheated ...
B000GTLQXU|5.0|\\"Poseidon\\" is an awesome movie.  I loved the special effects and the actors too.  Wolfgang Petersen is a great director and with this remake he excels once again.  I saw it three times in the theater and plan on buying the DVD on August 22.  Can't wait!  Thanks Warner Brothers!
B000001DZQ|5.0|I only saw Roy Buchanan once, during the mid 80s,I stood five feet from him and I was absolutely Gobsmacked!! Now, here's a man who produced a gumbo of country, blues, rock & roll, jazz, whatever, into a wholly original creation of the most sublime, intense, technically challenging electric guitar music in history. He was a true original, growing up in hillbilly America, backing the likes of Dale Hawkins (that's him on \\"My Babe\\"), he was the classic journeyman. Apparently, later, Ronnie Hawkins (Dale's cousin)asked Roy to briefly join the Hawks to teach newbe \\"Robbie Robertson\\" some guitar tricks. On their first session, apparently Roy gave Robbie a look which said \\"You wanna dance?! Then, let's dance!\\". As he tuned up, Roy went through a whole symphony of sounds, squeals, harmonics, glissando runs, pulverizing the younger guitarist! Roy Buchanan was a legend. His renditions of Don Gibson's \\"Sweet Dreams\\" or Neil Young's \\"Down By The River\\" place him at the very pinacle of electric guitar greats! it is criminal that this genius of the guitar never got his due! However, ask any tele player worth his salt and, dollars to donuts, Roy Buchanan (along with Danny Gatton) will be at the very top of their list of heroes. As proof, check out the Hellecaster's wonderful tribute to him (their version of Sweet Dreams from their first album).  This box includes a firm introduction to Roy Buchanan and his formidable talent. Reader be warned. After hearing this set, you WILL be compelled to go out and buy the remainder of his catalogue. We will NEVER see the likes of him again. So...all you guitar players out there, tune up your teles and BOW DOWN BEFORE A MASTER!!
0316096199|5.0|The truth can be painful, but sometimes it must be spoken.  <br />Such is the case with Lucky. This is probably one of the best books I have read all year, maybe even ever. This story is far from sugar-coated, but is raw, beautiful, thought provoking, oddly humorous in places, and in a sense, the essence of life.  <br />The pages sparkle with personality, and \\"voice\\". I am amazed that Alice Sebold could write such a story, and I commend her for it.  <br />I had read The Lovely Bones before this, and Lucky reads in the same fashion. At times, you are horrified and want to cry, and others, burst out laughing. It takes a very gifted author in order to instill such emotion in the reader, and Alice Sebold is definitely one of them.  <br />I can say nothing bad about this book. I read it in two days, and seriously could hardly put it down.  <br />The one thing the reader should take into account is that as said before, this book is far from sugar-coated. If you like happy, neatly packaged stories, this is not for you.  <br />If you do decide to pick up a copy, you will not be disapointed. Above all, this is a tale of survival after tragedy, and a story that any person who has faced hardships should pick up. The message and the themes are so universal, that in my opinion, every reader will have some feeling which they are able to connect with.  <br />After this, read The Lovely Bones, or the two of them together! Either way, you will be very satisfied!
B000FVQYZY|5.0|What a fantastic return from Muse! I saw them last year in Portland for just 10 bucks, but that will never happen again as they will become huge in America with this amazing album! Start to finish is awesome and every song has different styles and influences. Take a Bow takes a shot at world leaders and gradually builds to an amazing crescendo. Starlight could grace any singles chart and has an excellent and likeable piano riff that could be the 'love song' of the album. Supermassive Black Hole is a raunchy rockin' mover that could pass on the dancefloor and Map of the Problematique has hints of Enjoy the Silence from Depeche Mode. Soldiers Poem is forgettable and the only real disaapointment on the album.    Four stomping tracks then follow, my fave four of the album. Invincible is sure to be a concert opener and includes a guitar solo remeniscent of Hysteria. The chorus almost has you singing Keane's 'Everybody's Changing' but Muse take it back out into their own formidable style and change direction once more.    Assasin is the heaviest song on the album and Dom's amazing drumming (he drumming is amazing throughout this album) really hones into view here. Exo-Politics is krunky-groovy with a brilliant variance of chords that flow seemlessly throughout the song and the chorus is truly amazing, the best on the album for me!    City of Delusion is wonderfully comical! It has a mexican vibe and every now and again the drums will beat in an almost 'cha cha cha' moment. Wonderfully crafted song that has you tapping your foot and humming along to the trumpet. Chris's best Bass song.    I'm not a huge fan of Hoodoo but it eases very nicely into the first US single \\"Knights of Cydonia\\". The video to this song is very funny and is a take on US Western movies with a modern twist. This song has hints of Queen and is very dramatic. Interestingly lyrics are not sung until over two minutes into the song, but the boys' music has you barely noticing.    A masterful album yet again from Muse. Not so much Piano as other efforts, and a little less intricate to allow for easier listening, but the songs are truly legendary and crafted to makes your ears ring with appreciation. Enjoy!
0066211697|4.0|This was my first reads by Francoise Sagan, and I must say that I enjoyed it very much. Considering her age when this story was published, Bonjour Tristesse is very well written and thought out indeed.  <br />The prose floats along so easily, that it reads more like a novella. I finished it in an afternoon, and this is also an excellent beach or coffeeshop read. I also loved Sagan's depiction of the French way of life, and how with some of her descriptions, you feel as if you are transported to Paris or the Riviera.  <br />The only problem with this story that I could find is that some of the details did not have enough depth, and that the narrator could be almost vapid. However, Francoise Sagan was very young at the time, so it hardly matters.  <br />I'm reading The Painted Lady at the moment, which is considered to be Sagan's major novel. I am looking forward to reading more by this very whimsical and creative author, and recommend Bonjour Tristesse to any person who is interested in French culture, the 1950s time period, or a just a pleasant read to make the afternoon go by. Bonjour Tristesse definitely qualifies, and the beach reads today hardly hold a candle to this gem of a story.
0790729601|5.0|This movie was, and will be played on channels like TNT, Spike, TBS at least couple times a year.  I end up watching it whenever I happen to flip channels and see it. So far, I would say I watched about 5 times. <br /> <br />It is by no means 5 stars, nothing profound. It does have the typical Arnold Humour/violence/special effects, which are entertaining and I liked the acting of James Caan. He is a solid actor as you all know from Godfather. That being said, I would never pay to watch this movie as you can see it many times on cable etc, but I would not have complained if I had paid money at the theater....
B000068IEU|5.0|i found this to be a great film actually, this was craven back in his better days. The 70s music inbetween sorta gave it a weird vibe though,but still all in all a great movie. The basic film plot is two kids going to a concert and yeah they just had to look for drugs and they get kidnapped by a bunch of murderous people and basically get tortured...but the parents get their revenge once they find out. I mean if you are expecting one of those \\"oh no,whos the killer\\" type of films,then u probably wouldnt like this

B000GG4Y32|5.0|\\"REDS\\" seems to be taking longer and longer to get released on DVD. My VHS is so worn out that the audio is almost silent in some of the rally scenes. This is a movie that needs to be seen by the new generation of film goers. Yes, it's a little long, but every scene is perfectly timed and every performance is acted so expertly. This film holds a special place in my heart because after Gene Hackman did his three weeks of work on \\"Superman II\\", he decided to retire from show business. His brief, but electric scenes with his close friend Beatty made hime realize what he was missing. And the rest is history. Oh and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill is one of his most understated performances since \\"King of Marvin Gardens\\" <br /> <br />I doubt that Mr. Beatty will do a commentary track, but if he does, maybe Paramount can talk him into remastering \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" and add bous features to that classic.

In areas where I have previous experience and know myself well, then my initial reaction may prove to be the most valid one. BLINK's concept of \\"thin slicing\\" stays with you. If at the end of a good read you can walk away remembering something, just one thing that will influence your future decisions, then I'd say the book and the author did its/his job.

1401302378|4.0|As we learned in our marketing classes from days of yore, businesses have historically ignored everything below a certain cut-off part because it was considered economically non-viable to meet such specialized needs in the marketplace. That's why it's reassuring that our more idiosyncratic buying behaviors as consumers are finally translating in aggregate into economics of abundance, whether it be obscure books, rarefied recordings or DVDs of movies long forgotten by anyone else. In his incisive, surprisingly entertaining book, Chris Anderson, editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine, argues that products that are in low demand or have low sales volume can collectively make up a market share that rivals or exceeds the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters, if the store or distribution channel is large enough.<br /><br />Obviously this is not revolutionary thinking at this point. Online commerce sites like eBay, Amazon, Netflix and iTunes have flourished by developing to such a point where they can tap rather easily into the market of the Long Tail, where according to Anderson, 80% of total consumers are. His musings cover the business and sociological phenomenon that started with the revelation that a handful of weblogs have many links going into them versus the rest, millions of weblogs, which have only a handful of links going into them. This apparent imbalance points to a marketing opportunity for potential e-commerce companies should they decide to tackle the issues around scale needed to conquer it. Otherwise, as we know firsthand, the Long Tail becomes indecipherable noise. Enter search engines like Google AdWords which has become a vital filtering mechanism to get through the noise. Other filtering options followed - social media recommendations, tagging, social bookmarking, blogs and online communities - all to help move us toward what we want to know and choose to purchase.<br /><br />The author gives most of the credit to entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos who figured this out in 1994 with the introduction of Amazon as an online bookseller. It has since expanded into a number of areas from CDs to now groceries. Clearly, Bezos has led the rest of us to see how the Internet has given us unprecedented ability to find products never before available so quickly and easily.  For Amazon, in particular, it's important to note that the pursuit of Long Tail opportunities starts with an item of popularity. The helpful Amazon recommendations drive people down that tail, but they enter from the top where an item of recognition begins them on their trek toward items that are more obscure.<br /><br />The book is most fascinating when Anderson shares the recent genesis of the Long Tail phenomenon in ways that are quite relatable, in particular, the decline of network radio and TV channels as potential revenue sources. The resulting blandness found on these outlets has to do with the deliberate avoidance of niche market programming that does not meet their profitability thresholds. Consequently, the availability of MP3 and XM radio makes standard radio a less attractive option based more on convenience. The same can be said of the original three broadcast networks and their loss of audience to cable and premium-pay channels. The days of one-size-fits-all are apparently numbered, and unless the larger broadcasting corporations are aware of that, they are in for staggering losses.his out in 1994 with the introduction of Amazon as an online bookseller.

1400062071|5.0|Lovely seems almost too precious a word to attach to something that has quite a bit of heft to it, however the word does seem apropos for the feeling I had upon finishing it. Tyler Caskey comes to the small town of West Arnett Maine in the 1950s to be the local parish minister. Yet soon a personal tragedy befalls his family and he finds himself struggling with his faith, and his place in the world as he copes with a terrible loss. What makes the book so winning, is that Strout avoids any maudlin or melodramatic pitfalls in her portrayal of Caskey, a man who must  provide spiritual guidance for a rich and colorful tapestry of small town characters in all their gossipy glory, while also struggling as a father and a widow.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Wow! I thought I would go to my grave never having the opportunnity to see Pink Floyd in concert. This DVD package exceeds my wildest dreams. Great audio 5.1, fantastic video, and what a show. I have personnaly attended many concerts, but watching this DVD on the big screen beat them all. A dream come true!!!
B00005KHJM|4.0|The longer version is significantly better. Rent this first if you can. Ultimately the limited edition has both versions, some commentaries and a nice balsawoodlike case.Is this a horror film, yes. The 'end achieves the reason' of it. And the psychological nuances interplay. There is no 'jack-in-the-box' surprises here. No 'scary movie' themework either. But the townfolk barscene with the Prim Sergeant staying overnite and Britt interesting nextdoor room scene leaves an interesting psyche thrill for Mr. Prim. (Britt does not actually do the scene). The subtle pagan going-ons makes this a lead-in horror.The thriller/suspense concepts comes into play with the Prim Sergeant thinking that he is outthinking the folks here. They are playing him for the fool and even the girl is into the act. This entire movie deals crop harvesting sacrifice and the level of it in paganism. Both Mr Lee and Mr Woodward are serious actors in their own right. There is maypole rituals, there nymph dancing, there is complex hide and seek in pagan costumes. Even Prim Sergeant is in costume (the pagan-folks know that he is trying to outhink them). There is even a little bit of dangerous swordplay 'guillotine' play.Mr. Hitchcock would have enjoyed this. Worth the ten bucks provided it isnt the 88 minute version.It would interesting how Nicholas Cage is going to put this across. But remakes as a general lot just sucks.True 'paganized' horror. Actually true paganism employed relevant doesnt relate to this.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I wasn't too impressed with the theatrical release of Kingdom of Heaven. Actually, I wasn't impressed at all. I thought it was slow-moving, plot-confusing film that may have been Ridley's poorest effort as a \\"storyteller\\". I was proven wrong when I finally saw the Kindom of Heaven Director's Cut. Throw your theatrical release out the window or sell it to blockbuster because this the definitive cut. Not only does the story make more sense, its almost always engrossing and even though I had already seen the film, I felt like I was watching it for the first time. Orlando's character, Balian, was much more convincing as the flashpoint of the story and Sybilla's character made much, much more sense. Their romance was also improved as it didn't feel as rushed and \\"hollywoodized\\". I have to give it to Ridley, he knows what he's doing and has made this film into a classic; at least for me. This is now one of my favorite films!
B00005JOQS|5.0|I really liked this movie. I am a big fan of super-hero movies (X-Men, Superman, and Batman mostly). I also like the CW's hit show Smallville which focuses on the early years of Clark Kent before he became Superman. <br /> <br />This movie was really awesome. The special effects were amazing and breath-taking. Newcomer Brandon Routh made the legendary role of Clark Kent/Superman, (living two lives of a reporter and a superhero) his. No other actor could have done a better job. The story plot follows when Superman takes a bad fall and decides to take an absence of fighting crime. He doesnt even say good-bye. Meanwhile Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) manages to come up with a plan to destroy the world ( as usual). Superman must stop him or the whole world will be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Kate Bosworth ( Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!) did an excellent job as reporter Lois Lane, both Clark Kent and Superman's love interest. Lois mainly is infatuated with Superman and they share so much of chemical romance together. When he leaves, she is upset which causes her to write an article for The Daily Planet titled \\"Why the World Doesn't need Superman\\" which causes her to win The Pulitzer prize for best journalism. When Superman does return she falls in love with him all over again-but since he had taken an absense for many years Lois has had a son and a fiance named Richard (James Marsden). There is a bit of a love triangle in the movie. <br /> <br />Each role has their own depth to it and the movie gets into their roles a lot. Obviously Superman does defeat Lex Luthor and his side-kicks. As well as his girlfriend Kitty ( Parker Posey).  <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie. Director Bryan Singer did a good job with the choice of actors for each role. There is some mystery about the child Lois has-could be Clarks. And also the sad thing is Superman doesnt end up with Lois. It may be possible to make a sequel but it wont be out for awhile is what I've heard. It also iskind of hard with the plot to make a sequel-if they want it to be better than the first. The sequel probably wont be out for 2 and a half-3 years. Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, and Kevin Spacey should be back for the sequel. This movie gave breakthrough roles for Both Routh and Bosworth they probably have been offered many roles. <br /> <br />We hope to see Superman soon!
0446677450|5.0|Great Book. It once again reminded me of one simple thing I've discovered a few years ago:  <br /> <br />\\"We do not have to go far away to find gold. It's right under our feet. All we have to do is: 1)open our eyes to see it, 2) make some effort to pick it from the ground, and finally 3) have enough discipline to make it to another level.\\" <br /> <br />Recommend it to everybody!!!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I like this show. It comes on UPN in New York (Soon to be the CW) and I think this show is really interesting. Kristin Bell delivers a great performance as the-girl-next-door mystery girl Veronica Mars. After her best friend Lilly Caine is murdered by a psychopath, Veronica starts to solve mysteries. <br /> <br />In the beginning of Season Two a bush crash happens claiming the lives of over 10 innocent teenagers. From the beginning of the season Veronica gathers small clues that lead her to the cause of the bus crash. Each episode is unforgettable and after one episode its really easy to get hooked on.  <br /> <br />This is a great show I hope it lasts long!
0517123207|5.0|Perhaps the most influential work ever written, and a shining beacon of modern scientific thought. This book is the much needed breath of air the scientific world needed after millennia of religious (unscientific and assumable) oppression. The work, shines on many points, and dulls on others, but, keeping in mind the time it was written, it does not deserve a lesser rating. I will here give my impression on what was \\"hot and not\\" about this volume;<br /><br />Positive<br /><br />-Despite many who would disagree, the book is eloquently written. It is a very enjoyable read. It does, I admit, get a tad dry and repetitive at times, but keep in mind that this is a scientific volume -- it is not entertainment. Also, it was written 150 years ago, and the rules of grammar and language would of-course differ from today's.<br /><br />-The book is truly scientific; it does not make blind assumptions, but backs up it's theories with facts. It is the burden of the proposer to back up his claim, therefore, claims that Evolution is false and volumes of energy are wasted just to defend it is erroneous.<br /><br />-And, of-course, the book lacks a-lot of the modern principles discovered regarding evolution since its publication. However, there is no need to rate it down just because of age. I don't see Dickens being rated down because 19th century London exists, now, only in books. As far as a scientific work, however, it lacks in this department.<br /><br />Negative<br /><br />- It is outdated, so it should not be completely trusted as a source of valid information. Don't misinterpret me: most concepts are correct, however, details are often erroneous and not up to date. This book should NOT be used as a source of serious arguments for or against evolution, with few exceptions and examples.<br /><br />- The language may tire and bore some modern readers.<br /><br />The last comment I have is for readers who are very vexed by this book and choose to bash it publicly and claim its error in, well, almost everything. Those are usually Religious readers who are opposed to any mention of evolution for obvious reasons. I am an open atheist, I won't deny it, and, everyone on this earth has a right to their own opinion. However, bashing a work purely based on instilled hate for science is NOT helpful to the community which reads these reviews. First, if the book was so erroneous and \\"laughable\\" in its propositions, Religious folk wouldn't have felt so threatened by it as to post 3 page reviews full of angry remarks. An evolutionist/secularist/atheist is not someone who knows too little about religion or is ignorant -- it is someone who knows too much. Religion assumes, and, the bible was written for political purposes -- if you are a truly educated Creationist you would have at least an idea of what I claim here. Therefore, people who ONLY read the bible and use it as an example do not hold any water to their claims. The bible has no authority with many cultures on this earth. Science, however, can have authority with everybody, because it proves its points with facts. The angry theist reviewers, here, are as gullible as a child. I did not read Darwin's work and become an \\"instant believer\\" in evolution; I had to read several books and weigh the evidence. Another excellent work is \\"What Evolution Is\\" by Earnst Mayr.<br /><br />Comments I was really vexed by:<br /><br />- Darwin was an atheist -- most theist posts claim this in one version or another. He was not an atheist, and, even though his underlying intentions will never be clear, he was openly a theist. Throughout the book he mentions the \\"creator\\" as the \\"breather of life\\" on earth. The last sentence in the book is truly beautiful, and disproves the atheist claim.<br /><br />- The fossil record refutes evolution; maybe so today, but I am convinced this is erroneous; the evolutionary link to the lineage of birds from dinosaurs (Mayr 2001) was only a proposition supported by Darwin and many evolutionists, quite blindly. Why? No \\"Intermediate\\" between dinosaur and bird was found, and therefore, theists had a field day bashing evolutionists. However, the Archaeopteryx was discovered in due time. I believe that it is due to the vastness of the fossil record and its unimaginable distribution and randomness that these \\"gaps\\" exist. I believe the future will surprise evolutionists quite pleasantly.<br /><br />-Posts which include remarks such as \\"Yes, there is a God, and he is not you, Dr. Ego Monkeyshines.\\" are clearly the futile attempts of an uneducated theist at disproving evolution. Having no facts, of-course, he must resort to name-calling when all else has been expired. I urge you to read that post, and, if possible point to one fact that supports his claim. He claims we should be \\"REAL\\" scientists and investigate for ourselves -- well, most of us are, and we have simply concluded that Darwin puts forth amazing proof of evolution. This is only a very accusatory rant by yet another disappointed theist who just saw a huge chunk of Bible validity being crushed by a genius of scientific advancement. Religion and science do NOT mix; one is based on assumptions, the other on facts. I very much find it interesting that many people here compare \\"Origin\\" to the Bible -- in a way it is; it is the modern bible. It simply replaces or updates, if you will, the ideas of the bible. The bible can be viewed as a very outdated theory on the world -- one that predates science and explains everything without the need of thought -- it's all simply magic (god). The \\"Origin\\" updates it, and goes on to explain the magic of God as scientific laws. Which sadly for many, does contradict the bible.<br /><br />- A reviewer commented that the full title of the book was concealed by Amazon with shady purposes to cover up the book's \\"racism.\\" I particularly love the claim that Darwin was a racist. The reviewer claims that Darwin displayed racist remarks towards black people in his book, favoring races and saying Africans were inferior; where in the book, dear reviewer, did you see any mention of Africans, and, overall humanity? Darwin makes VERY little reference to humans in the \\"Origin,\\" perhaps you'd be interested in \\"Origin of Man\\" (Descent of Man). \\"Preservation of favored Races\\" refers to the animal \\"races\\" or, more modernly, types/varieties/breeds. This erroneous claim is baseless, because the word \\"races\\" was used with a different meaning in \\"Origin\\", and again, take into account that the book is 150 years old -- grammar rules and interpretations change.

Darwin makes VERY little reference to humans in the \\"Origin,\\" perhaps you'd be interested in \\"Origin of Man\\" (Descent of Man). \\"Preservation of favored Races\\" refers to the animal \\"races\\" or, more modernly, types/varieties/breeds. This erroneous claim is baseless, because the word \\"races\\" was used with a different meaning in \\"Origin\\", and again, take into account that the book is 150 years old -- grammar rules and interpretations change.

0451450523|5.0|This book was recommended to my English class by my English teacher as a 'brilliant' book. I thought that I'd go ahead and read it, even though it was a children's book. Upon reading it, I was shocked by not only the simplistic brilliance, but by the language in which this book is written. Even though I'm only 16, I've read many books, and few have entranced me like this one. From the first page the author uses his art of writing to create one of the most timeless books in history.
B000002L9J|5.0|OK...so I've followed the Smiths since the 80's, and I would list them as my favourite band; but, I'm going to impose a 2 year ban on myself from playing any of their songs.  Why?  I guess I'm just burnt-out on them and feel like if I don't listen to them for awhile, it may bring back that magic when I \\"re-discover\\" them again.  Does this makes sense to anybody or am I being strange? <br /> <br />So back to this album...all the songs are classics, second to only \\"Meat is Murder\\", IMHO. <br /> <br />Oh, one exception to my self-imposed ban.  I will go to the end of the Earth and shave my head if a reunion somehow miraculously occurs. <br /> <br />
B00005JMCN|2.0|I could not force myself to watch this film in its entirety. I think I made it about 45 minutes in. Despite many fine actors, esp. the always interesting Jeff Bridges, who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles, I simply could not connect and did not care about these people.<br /><br />It was this huge budget American movie shorthand: we're supposed to care because we've been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else, but it just doesn't work for me. If I don't care this far into the movie, it just won't happen.<br /><br />Visually beautiful, and sky high production values on costumes and sets, it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling. Whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces, which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of, but why don't we get faces like that in the major characters. Of course Chris Cooper has that kind of face, but many others (esp. all the \\"size 2 women\\" in the supporting roles)seem to have stepped out of a commercial.<br /><br />The Chicago tribune called this film \\"sleek and beautiful.\\" I will completely agree with that, but so are music videos. I kept asking myself, what is wrong, what is misfiring? I really wanted to like it. Some of it is the short-hand story telling, but the look was almost too pretty. When the cinematography is this gorgeous, you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper, or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger -a mini-series.<br /><br />Ultimately, I began wondering if the original length was much longer, and it was cut down so much that it became fractured, and if that is the case, my apologies to the director. This is the kind of film that makes me ponder, what is it that European film-makers \\"get\\" that we lose in our big budget studio films? Is the system itself hurting some films, by sanitizing and conforming them, when they need to stick out like an unruly horse's nose at the starting gate?<br /><br />Very beautiful, but no connection, and not satisfying... well, that's a lot of things in Hollywood in a nutshell, isn't it?<br /><br />There are lots of special features on this DVD, but if I can't sit through the film, I don't care about the extras.  So glad I borrowed this instead of buying it!  I hear the book is something wonderful....but no connection, and not satisfying... well, that's a lot of things in Hollywood in a nutshell, isn't it?  <br /> <br />There are lots of special features on this DVD, but if I can't sit through the film, I don't care about the extras.

B00005JNTX|5.0|Very different approach to familiar material.  Good performances from all the actors, and Britany Murphy (she suprised me). Comic book come to life, very over the top. Loved the black, white, grey and red atmosphere color.  Very dramatic and lots of violence but it goes well with the storyline.  It's nice to know someone has some imagination left. Enjoy!
B000AP04OM|5.0|This CD is everything a fan of the sound of music can ever dream of. All the unanswered questions I had for years since I was a kid, was answered in this 2 Disc DVD. To see the beautiful sites and the brillant actors that played in it as they are in the present was a plus for me. For years I always wondered what they look like now, and if that beautiful country really exists.  Learning the story behind the story helped me to understand it more and appreciate it. So if you are a huge Sound of music fan, this CD will answer all of your questions and more to the best musical ever written. <br />
B0007PAMR4|1.0|I can't believe some of the reviews for this piece of trash that I've read here. Did any of those people actually READ the book? Apparently not, or phrases like \\"true to the book\\" and \\"author's vision\\" would never have been written. About the only things this movie has in common with the book are the character and place names, everything else is completely different. It's pretty clear that David Lynch didn't read the book, either. <br /> <br />A far, far better treatment is the mini-series John Harrison directed that played on the Sci-Fi Channel in 2000, starring William Hurt and Alex Newman. An extended Director's Cut (in widescreen) is available and is even better. Don't waste your time with Lynch's disaster, get Harrison's version and enjoy a movie that really does remain true to Frank Herbert's epic novel. Harrison also directed \\"Children Of Dune\\" for Sci-Fi and it is very good, too.
B000005IU2|5.0|Forget the album as a masterpiece, forget it as a landmark, forget the Stooges, forget Iggy Pop, forget what everybody tells you about this recording, forget yourself in desperate search of the truth and just listen to the most raw human nature ever recorded...
B000FIMG68|5.0|Season 2 of \\"Lost\\" stayed riveting, for the most part. Many people, while watching on TV, felt annoyed by the constant long breaks between episodes. While I agree that it did hurt the enjoyment of the season, the fact that more people are complaining about the break that they did last season, where in fact the episode count is almost the same, shows that people are more eager to watch the next episode. So in my opinion, TPTB are doing their job well.    The beginning of the second season showed to many people that The Powers That Be still got it. The first 3 episodes followed the events of the night where viewers were left at the end of Season 1. It was frantic, exciting and riveting. Surprising answers and easter-eggs sent thousands to the message boards, trying to analyze what it all means. The episodes following, with the introduction of the new cast members, cut into the screentime of the core group of survivors, but it was still compelling television.    The middle part of the season disappointed some fans. The flashbacks were getting repetitive and some character were being \\"reset\\" to their former past. The introduction of Henry Gale's character brought new life to the show, and Michael Emerson stole every scene he was in.    Season 2 lacked a defying plot (unlike Season 1, that was all about survival on the island). Was it the merge between the two groups of survivors? Was it the clash with the others? Or was it the discovery of what's in the hatch, and the DHARMA Initiative?    As we got to know most of our main characters well enough, their flashbacks were becoming less intriguing, but it still didn't hurt the quality of the episodes. The writers began to write more out-of-the-box flashbacks, like an on-island flashbacks, an all-island episode depicting the lives of new characters, and a flashback episode for a couple who aren't even regulars.    Lost is a show about faith, and so, it is fitting that not only the characters will have tests of faith, but also the viewers. There are those who trust the writers, who say they know where they're going with the story. And there are those who are frustrated with the luck of answers, and accuse the writers with making it up as they go along.    I fall on the camp of the believers. And season 2 didn't show me I'm wrong.
0679731725|5.0|\\"The Remains of the Day\\" is a very rare, very special sort of novel. It's a gem. I'd put off reading it for some time, and never got around to the movie (not a big Merchant Ivory fan - their stuff makes me sleepy). Anyways, while reading Ishiguro's \\"Never Let Me Go,\\" several friends spotted the name on the cover and suggested I read \\"Remains.\\" <br /> <br />I regret sounding gushy, but in a real sense, \\"Remains\\" is sort of a near-perfect novel. One doesn't often encounter writing which so delicately balances a meticulous, character-accurate voice (in this case, the prim, ornately structured proper English of a high-class butler) with deep, nuanced human emotion. The book unfolds like a little Swiss watch, all intricate, interlocking parts, so carefully that you'd expect an end result focused on form and execution - impressive, maybe, but austere and distant. <br /> <br />But Ishiguro is a wizard. <br /> <br />This is as sensitive and devastatingly human as fiction gets. Without stratospheric revelations, tearful tragedies or high suspense, Ishiguro puts his man through a few days of quiet reflection and extracts an awesome payoff - a finely crafted, tiny little jewel of regret and doubt. <br /> <br />At 256 (suprisingly breezy) pages, \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is worth your time. It's really special.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Every CD tool puts out is different than the previous.  It amazes me how they continue to change their sound yet are still able to put out music which I like.  For their 4th full length album, Tool pushes the creative envelope and they lyrics are lot more direct than the previous albums.  In some of the other albums, like lateralus and aneima, maynards lyrics could be translated into a plethora of different meanings.  The songs here are more focused and a lot longer, which is great because thats more tool material!  The CD is broken down into about 7-8 Songs, but these songs total over 40 minutes of material so stop hating on the amount of material on here! <br /> <br />Vicarious is the radio hit and once again finds tool in their familiar \\"heavy\\" form.  Jambi is almost like a coninuation of Vicarious, I really love the guitars on this one.  They have this echo which makes them sound really different yet still good. The next 2 songs \\"wings for marie\\" and \\"10000\\" days are about Maynard's mother, the first one is the slower and shorter of the two and its probably best to listen to them together.  The lyrics are very serious and you cannot dislike these songs.  I think the suprise of this album is probably \\"the Pot\\", maynard almost sounds like a woman on this one when he starts out \\"who are you to wave your finger....\\" but its really him.  Another hard song.  Lipan Conjuring is just a short clip of some voodoo noises, its a nice change and sets the mood for the next interlude, \\"lost keys.\\"  This is basically just a doctor talking to a patient who just arrived and is groggy, wakes up and starts to tell the story of how he arrived there (this story is the next song \\"Roseta Stoned\\").  Roseta stoned is another really hard song and maynard speaks really quickly his voice distorted, its very difficult to understand what he is saying.  It makes for something you cannot sing along with but that still is great and they lyrics are pretty crazy if you read them. The only other real song on here is \\"right in two\\" a much slower song but the lyrics are serious and thought provoking, comparing humans to monkeys. The other songs are mainly interludes and do drag on but you can always skip them, however I find them to be nice mood setters and you can do other things while still listening to these songs and not feeling like your sitting in silence. <br /> <br />Overall I think this CD is very good and, although maybe not as thought provking and clever as some of the previous tool CDs, they have managed to change their sound and you gotta give them credit for being one of the few bands who push the creative envelope.  If you liked the other tool CD's you will surely like this one, if you are new to tool start with some of the other CDs like Enima and then move to this.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I learned long ago not to pass quick judgement on a new Dream Theater album, especially from their post-Awake period. Because whenever I did, as in the case with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, I had to eat my words upon discovering the album is actually ultimately rewarding given patient listens. The case with Octavarium isn't any different. After the band's obsessively heavy (yet also amazing) Train of Thought, Dream Theater have put out an album that in no way treads on the same route as its predecessor. Rather, it forges its own path, still unafraid to borrow any and all influences the band members may have had during the writing and recording of this album.<br /><br />This disc may be Dream Theater's most mellow outing since Falling into Infinity. It does contain some commercial moments as well as a good many ballady material, but careful repeat listens will attest to their wealth of melodies and meticulous arrangements. The oft-criticised \\"The Answer Lies Within\\", considered too monotonous and sappy by some, is actually a very neat song. It may bear a resemblance to \\"Anna Lee\\" off of Falling into Infinity in some ways, but there is more to this carefully written and arranged piece. While its beginning may seem cliche because of its slow intro, plucked acoustic guitars and Labrie's ballad-style voice, the inclusion of a great string quartet with awesome violin and cello motifs in the second half help elevate the song to impressive heights. And thus, \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" becomes quite engaging, particularly given it's the second song of the album. It provides a nice contrast to the ambitious album opener \\"The Root of All Evil\\", the third piece of Portnoy's AA program, following \\"The Glass Prison\\" from Six Degrees and \\"This Dying Soul\\" from Train of Thought.<br /><br />\\"The Root of All Evil\\" is among the best songs on the album for a variety of reasons: it encompasses the whole Dream Theater sound their fans have come to appreciate over the years, as it moves from a brave synthesized patch to wonderfully restrained drumming and forceful bass guitar. There is even a cool vocal melody that is strangely evocative of Labrie's work on Scenes From A Memory. The piece is finalised with a frenzied guitar and keyboard interplay and a sweet piano coda respectively.<br /><br />It is understandable the rather modernist beginning of \\"These Walls\\" and the much U2-inspired main chorus of the somewhat poppy \\"I Walk Beside You\\" will not be among Dream Theater fans' favourites, but it is also important to note how these songs are actually structured with creative ideas and top-notch production. Myung's bass becomes a driving force on \\"The Walls\\", which is saying a lot, considering the same fans have expressed a wish to have his instrument louder in the mix. Octavarium presents his fat, growling bass through and through, on almost all the songs. And although there are no extended guitar solos on these tracks, Petrucci plays well-written guitar themes that fit the flow of the cuts. Dream Theater has never been a band to hide their influences, as they've paid tributes to bands like Metallica, Tool and Radiohead, let alone their 70's influences. The Bono-like vocal interpretation on \\"I Walk Beside You\\" is nothing but sheer emotion. It shows Dream Theater are also capable of churning out melodic lead choruses and make it work.<br /><br />Delving into heavier territory, the album presents the rockers \\"Panic Attack\\" and \\"Never Enough\\", a song that became controversial more so for its lyrical message than its instrumentation. The song starts with the words, \\"Cut myself wide open, reach inside, help yourself, to all I have to give\\" and continues with, \\"Sacrifice my life, neglect my kids and wife, all for you to be happy\\", not to mention the rather extreme main chorus, implying Portnoy wrote this piece to vent his frustration about his fans never being content with what they're getting, no matter how hard he tries. Whether it was really written for the fans or not, however, remains a mystery, but who could blame him if it was? Going back to \\"Panic Attack\\", the heaviest song on this disc, it stands out for its dynamic bass and heavy riffage atop symphonic passages where Portnoy also adds incredible fills. The song is also infused with some of the most interesting vocals Labrie has put on tape.<br /><br />The last two songs, also the longest ones, see Dream Theater employing a real orchestra and turning to their 70's prog rock influences, like they've never done before. They did play lots of 70's stuff live, but on an album, this is the first. \\"Sacrificed Sons\\", whose lyrics were penned by Labrie, deals with the 9/11 tragedy, featuring all kinds of spoken vocals (by politicians, victims' families, even terrorists) and proceeds with a long yet fitting instrumental midsection only to return to its calm beginning.<br /><br />Special mention goes to keyboardist Jordan Rudess for his superlative performance on the 24-minute prog rock epic \\"Octavarium\\", nicely broken down into five sections. It begins with a great symphonic arrangement, acoustic instruments, folky flute sounds and violins before seguing into \\"Medicate (Awakening)\\", complete with thick bass and drums, and a perfect balance of Genesis-like synths and Wakeman-like soloing by Rudess. The third part of the song, \\"Full Circle\\", is also their bravest moment, also featuring mighty back-up singing by Petrucci and some quite aggressive vocals by Labrie. The riffing is intense and brutal, but Rudess once again softens things up with a playful, almost humourous piano melody. The theatrical final section of the song brings to mind Gabriel-era Genesis, bleeding into \\"Intervals\\", a short yet surprisingly heavy passage, laced with Metropolis 2-like spoken vocals, a chopped guitar riff and awesome drum syncopation, not to mention Labrie's most aggressive singing in his Dream Theater career. The piece quitens down and closes on a fully orchestrated note, leading Petrucci to a climactic finale.<br /><br />Octavarium may not be Dream Theater's best, but it easily blows most other prog albums out of the water.remains a mystery, but who could blame him if it was?

B00000DFRS|4.0|I remember buying this cd back in 1998 and as soon as I finished listening to the whole album, I had to admit that I wasn't entirely pleased with this production. I was trying to figure out whether it was the new type of music or the way it was recorded or even worst, her voice. I realized that it was everything that I just mentioned. Although I loved Whitney since the very beginning and always will, this cd seemed to be the beginning of the worst for her.  Whitney's voice on this cd sounds very strained and tired as if she had been singing non stop for days.  There used to be such a milky, smooth sound to her voice and the way she could tell a story in a song just by the emotion in her sound but this album lacks much of that. The cd seemed very rushed too, from the sound to even the inside jacket, which is disappointing coming from such a high roller such as Whitney.  She does try to put that same feeling into her songs like before but it only comes off as being very scratchy and even hoarsed at times. She certainly doesn't hit the high octaves like she used to and instead seems to be holding back from doing so, probably since her vocal cords couldn't handle it. I remember seeing her concert in Atlantic City just before this cd came out and she was terribly hoarsed and blamed it on doing many non-stop weeks of recording for the cd, but we all know that its more than just the recording thats causing the problem which I dont need to mention. The album has it highlights in a few songs like When You Believe, If I Told You That and You'll Never Stand Alone.  Other songs like I Learned From The Best and especially I Bow Out, you can really tell she's pushing herself to get the notes out. I know she still has the potential for example when she sings Could I Have This Kiss Forever, it kinda took me back a little to the old Whitney. I really hope with her next album coming out soon in 2006 or 07, she really has it together and give us back that magic she once had in her voice.
B00006CXSS|5.0|In 2001 at it's preview on HBO I was not able and to be honest did not have the time to invest in a 10+ hour series.  I was wrong.  This is one of the most honest and realistic programs on WWII that I have watched.   <br /> <br />My uncle was in the Battle of the Bulge and would not speak of his time during WWII.  He only spoke of his experiences as to liberating one of the death camps and it was so far removed from my own experiences that it was difficult to grasp.  \\"Band of Brothers\\" has opened my eyes to the experiences and sacrifaces that these men and women made.   <br /> <br />I now have a better understanding and compassion for what these brave men and women accomplished during a most difficult time in our history. <br /> <br />
0140187537|3.0|I marked off many passages to read to my 16 year old son. I was dazzled by many parragraphs. That said I would not recommend he read this book.  I found the story confusing and drawn out and skimmed through much of it.  Read Grapes of Wrath or Cannery Row instead.
B000F3TBIO|3.0|Snippets of excited gossip about this \\"Peeping Tom\\" record have been floating around message boards and heavy on the tongues of Patton fans everywhere so when the album finally got released.. Well, there was silence.  I'll preface first that I'm a huge Patton Fan but this project lacks the direction and power of Patton's previous releases.  The real shining stars here are the producers who fill this album with slick grooves and abrasive guitars and drums.  Odd Nosdam blows out Dale Crover on '5 Seconds' in a throwback to Fant&oacute;mas which works brilliantly, despite the awkward pairing of the two on Nosdam's album \\"Burner\\" (the song is called \\"11th Ave Freak-out Pt 2\\" for you fans who need it all.) Amon Tobin digs back into his Permutations bag of tricks and turns an old Fugee's sample into a bittersweet grinding industrial track.  Jel and Nosdam make beautiful music for Patton to croon over on 'Your neighborhood spaceman.' But still there is something missing.  Lyrically, this is one of Patton's weakest albums.  Forgotten are the clever biting lyrics of Mr. Bungle or Tomahawk which are now replaced by trite like \\"Driving Lamborghini's and we're sipping our martinis. Slurping our linguini's etc...\\"  Thankfully the Norah Jones collaboration is bitter and nasty on \\"Sucker.\\"  Take this album at face value; It's Patton's take on pop music and it sounds exactly like that.  Instead of trying to dumb down his music for a major release (it was put out on his own label in the long run) Patton should have fully embraced all of his talent's weird skills and made a fearless and freaky collaboration (like General Patton vs. Executioners or the Patton/John Zorn album.)  It's a Patton album for beginner to intermediate listeners at best, but at least it casts some light on the Anticon collective that they rightfully deserve.  Should you buy this album?  The artwork is worth the price alone and there are some great songs on here but if your expecting the second coming of Christ (musically speaking) you've found the wrong album.ally speaking) you've found the wrong album.

Of course the package is really exclusive, remembering Hips video isn't released officially. <br />If you want to search it, the cover is exactly the same with Hips Don't Lie CD-Single (only the outcover, the booklet still same with audio CD edition). Don't be confused. If you a realrealreal big fan of Shakira, YES,  I recomend this extremely-exclusive package for you. <br />
B00005JOX6|1.0|First of all, it shouldn't have even been given a mere \\"PG-13\\" rating. Was someone on crack when they rated this? How about the director/producer/writer of this film? Just My Luck, Poseidon, and even King Kong are given the same rating, yet have nowhere near the filth in it this movie does. I couldn't even bear to finish it. After sitting through 45 minutes of pure torture, I finally got up and left. It felt like I had been sitting in that movie theater for 2 hours of my life. I am very thankful that I got my money back. I don't believe I will see any more \\"Adam Sandler\\" movies. This was so over the top. It should have been R rated, even though it doesn't have violence. The foul language made up for the lack of violence, and it should have been enough to make it an R rated film. You would not believe how much junk is crammed into in just 45 minutes. You will have heard a lot of sexual related stuff, as well as plenty of cuss words. How could anyone enjoy this? It even has kids cussing! No wonder the kids in the hallways at our schools are cussing at an unbelievable degree! I found myself squirming and fidgeting because this movie was so utterly unentertaining and also filled with junk that no one should have to endure watching. I feel very sorry for the innocent kids who acted on this set and were subjected to stuff they should not know at such an early age. Where is America? Why do we keep producing such films? Why are we wasting our time on films such as this? Another thing I would like to point out about this film was the disgusting amount of cleavage. I am so tired of seeing it. Why do guys find it appealing when girls dress whoreishly? Bottom line---Do NOT waste your time. I repeat, do NOT waste your time. Don't even rent this film. RV, Cars, and even Just My Luck were more entertaining.  I wish I had gone to see Superman or the Lake House instead.
B00005JOQS|3.0|I am a big Superman fan. From the comic book collection, to the movies, to my T-Shirts. I love Superman.  <br /> <br />I went to this movie 4 times before it left my local theater and once at an IMAX 150 miles away, (big mistake). And everytime I saw it I kept wondering how old is Superman supposed to be when he left earth in search of Krypton?   <br />Brandon Routh looked to be in his early to mid 20's. (he is actually 26). So if he left 5 years prior to the start of the story line, he would have been 19 or 20 years old.  <br />Lois Lane,(Bosworth) looks to be about the same age as Clark Kent/Superman. (When she is actually 23). <br /> <br />So when does this relationship between the two begin? <br />How old is Lois Lane supposed to be when she gets pregnant with Superman's son? 18?!?!?!? <br /> <br />Doesn't Lois Lane go to college after high school? <br />Doesn't Clark/Superman travel to the Northern Pole, after his earth father, Jonathon Kent dies, and spend 10 years learning about his origins before going to Metropolis? <br />These may be picky things and my wife tells me that they are actors playing an older role. Well, isn't this Hollywood. Can't they find someone in or at least around their 30's to play the part, or at least make them look a little older. They billed this thing as continuing where Superman II left off. <br />Casting wrong for Superman and Lois. <br />  <br />One last gripe.  Why do the wrtiers use the word SAVIOR at least 4 to 5 times when referring to Superman? <br />Superman has always been described as a HERO.  <br />A savior (to me) denotes religion and/or some kind of spirituallity.  <br />It would have sounded better for the line to have read, \\"The world doesn't need a HERO\\" or \\"I hear the world crying out for a HERO everyday, Lois.\\" <br />Just a few bumps in an otherwise good movie. It could have been great.  Maybe they will contact me before the next one.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|One should never judge the accomplishments made by an artist based solely on what one reads and sees in the news.  How many singers can honestly say they have been in the spotlight for 3 decades?  Very few can and are around to tell about it.  It is unfortunate that many celebrities are tarnished by their lifestyles but at the same time these people have left a mark on world-wide culture.  Michael Jackson is one such artist.  Beginning in his youth in the 70s, MJ has gone from child performer to adult superstar.  Few people over the age of 30 can deny that they have never heard of the greatest selling album of all time in the world : Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\".  No fewer than 9 of the 11 tracks on the album were hits in the early 80s.  Although his future albums never reached the awesome success seen by Thriller, no one can deny the genius in many of Jackson's recordings.  The Essential Michael Jackson presents just enough of MJ's hits (everything from the J5 to little known songs from the recent past) to satisfy any fan.  However, Say Say Say (a duet MJ had with Paul McCartney) is sorely missing. I have never even run across the album the song was originally released on.  Although we may never again see a resurgence of Michael Jackson mania, listeners can relive what are fabulous songs by a gifted entertainer.
0062502182|3.0|A readable fable of a shepherd boy, Santiago's journey of self-discovery. The book begins with some promise - it is quite easy to relate to the main character and some of his experiences. The character of Santiago is developed well and I felt most readers would be able to empathise with him easily. <br /> <br />Toward the end of the journey however, the author lost me somewhat with some confusing events/ metaphors. In the context of the book it appeared to me as though the author had reached some point on the journey which he had not experienced himself or could not adequately express his experience with the consistent simplicity of the rest of the book. To me it seemed like he decided to throw in a bit of chaos to cover this up which was disappointing. <br /> <br />The story as a whole and the driving concept of the book .. i.e. to follow your dreams certainly comes through regardless and overall it is enjoyable... I cannot help but feel though that something is lacking.
B0000DC13U|5.0|An amazing depiction of the creative process in contrast to the \\"revolutionary\\" process. The Stones, working together, create a new piece of music, which is itself a commentary on political upheaval. At the same time, Goddard, pointing his finger at the true \\"devil\\" - i.e. the deadening impact of the media - playfully contrasts the Stone's creative process with the decidedly \\"uncreative\\" language and actions of the \\"revolutionary\\" forces of the time as well as the keepers of the status quo. As with all of Goddard's films, here too the media is indeed the message, but one that is in no way a massage; \\"revolutionaries\\" mouthing words that they hear played on a tape recorder, a book-store where you have to punch a hippy and give a Nazi salute before you can leave with copies of pornography - these are the images that Goddard assaults us with right outside of the studio where the Stones are doing their creative work.  <br /> <br />All in all, a wonderful cinematic interpretation of  the Stones' song, Sympathy for the Devil. Nor does Goddard exempt himself, or at least his own medium, from his critique of the deadening power of the media. Check out the last image of the film.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|I first began listening to Avenged 3 years ago.  There first two albums were solid metal releases.  However this \\"City of Evil\\" is corporate crap.  Sure there are some cool dual guitar attacks, but since being signed to a major label anyone who heard the old CD's can instantly recognize the change in style.  The vocals have gone to hell...I hate the way he sings now.  If you like corporate bubble gum metal this album is for you.  If you like raw old Avenged Sevenfold save your money.
0800196341|5.0|I can only echo the responses of so many other viewers.  This version of the play, with nothing left out, makes the entire story more accessable.  I finally understand what's going on! <br />I am amazed that this wonderful production is not available on DVD.
B000AL730O|4.0|<br />.... but I didn't at first. <br /> <br />A friend of mine downloaded it for me, and I gave a listen to it all the way through once in my car.  I really wanted to like it, but the best I could say, on first listen, that there were a few tracks that I kind of liked, and that was it.  I even told my friend that I was glad I hadn't spent money on it. <br /> <br />And then my friend told me that you can't tell if you really like an album or not after just one listen.  He told me to listen to it a couple more times, and then decide. <br /> <br />So I did.  And every single time I listened to it, I really started to like it an awful lot more, until, before I knew it, I was playing it over and over again, and very soon thereafterwards, buying a copy of my own, so I could give my friend his copy back.  That was back in December '05, and I still play this album all the time. <br /> <br />To me, this album is not like anything he's ever done before.  It's not a Beatles album, it's not a Wings album, and it's not a McCartney solo album (thank goodness).  But I think it's an amazingly honest album, and it's just Paul being Paul, who he is today in his 60's. <br /> <br />To me, most of these songs have a very timeless feel to them.  I think they're going to still be excellent songs in 20 years or much more. <br /> <br />I love so many of these songs, and I sing them to myself all the time, whether I'm listening to the album or not.  \\"A Certain Softness\\" is such a classy song; it reminds me a bit of \\"Something\\" by George Harrison, in the way that it describes the different qualities of a woman who so inspires the writer.  The guitar intro, and all of the instrumental work in \\"Jenny Wren\\" is so catchy.  \\"English Tea\\" is such a fun, bouncy song, as is \\"Friends To Go.\\"  Yes, he uses a lot of cute lyrics in \\"Tea,\\" like \\"Very twee... very me...\\" and \\"Very gay... hip hooray...\\" but there's such a sense of genuine fun and whimsy to the song, without the lyrics seeming lightweightor throwaway in any way, at least not to me. <br /> <br />However, my very favorite song on this album is \\"Too Much Rain.\\"  I love the pounding piano at the beginning, and I love the sad yet optimistic theme of the whole song.  He really captures the emotions and feelings of deep sadness, and even depression, so perfectly:  \\"You know the wheels keep turning.... why do the tears run down your face?\\"  and \\"Smile... when you're spinning 'round and 'round...\\"  And because he describes the emotions of sadness so accurately, it doesn't sound trite or saccharine at all when he begins the song by saying, \\"Laugh, when your eyes are burning... smile, when your heart is filled with pain.\\"  The song is sad, and the theme is simple, but he acknowledges we all experience deep pain sometimes, and yet gives us a way to recover from it, without being dismissive about it in any way. <br /> <br />\\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\" took a while to grow on me, because it's slower and longer, but I like it because he deals with rejection and just kind of revels in his feelings for a while. <br /> <br />I think \\"How Kind Of You\\" is just a sweet song, acknowledging someone who has been there for him, and how much it truly touched him. <br /> <br />\\"Fine Line\\" is a fun rocking tune, and I like at least parts of all of the rest of the songs. <br /> <br />My only somewhat negative comments are as follows: <br /> <br />He only delves briefly, thankfully, back into some \\"McCartneyisms\\" in his lyrics - once in \\"At The Mercy\\" (\\"...we can watch the universe explode...\\") and several times in \\"Promise To You Girl.\\"  I love the beginning of that song (\\"Looking through the backyard of my life....\\") and the harmonic middle (\\"Like the sun that rises everyday...\\" and \\"Every single second of our lives...\\") but I really don't like the lyrics in-between (\\"All the time that it takes to repair this brave old world...\\") and so on.... yuck.  I think they're the only throwaway lyrics on the album.  I don't think there's anything behind them, or any meaning to them, and I can't sing 'em.  I just skip over 'em. <br /> <br />And honestly, that's it for the negative stuff, for me.  For those reasons, and because I don't think it reaches the level of quality to be compared to his work with the Beatles, I can't give it five stars.  But I absolutely love this album, and I hope he lets Nigel Godrich produce every single album he ever makes of new music from this point out.  I think they're only going to get better from here.  I think it's such a very, very good album, in so many ways, and I absolutely love it. <br /> <br />One question: At the end of \\"How Kind Of You,\\" when he sings the final \\"How kind of youuuuuuuuuu....,\\" a few beats later, he makes a weird vocal noise that sounds like he's convulsing!  Lol... does anybody know what that sound is, or why it's there?  I'd be really curious to know.  If you haven't heard it, take a listen. :-)
0385336691|5.0|This tenth novel in the series plays on two of Jack Reacher's known quirks as well as on an underlying theme that has existed throughout the series.  In this novel all three items are used to create a fast moving 371 page thriller and another very good read.<br /><br />Along with his uncanny ability to know exactly what time it is without a watch, Reacher has always had exceptional powers of observation.  Something that worked very well for him in his past life as a military policeman as well as his current life which is sometimes indefinable.  As the novel opens, Jack Reacher is sitting outside a New York caf&eacute; late in the evening and sees a rather unremarkable man drive off in an expensive car with a somewhat distinctive license plate.  Unknown to him, what he witnessed was a ransom payment for a kidnapping.<br /><br />Shortly after returning the next night to the same caf&eacute;, Reacher is contacted by an individual who would like to know what Reacher saw on behalf of his employer.  Intrigued, Reacher agrees to accompany his inquisitor to the legendary Dakota hotel.  There he discovers that a band of mercenaries led by Edward Lane have taken up residence there and they want to recover Edward Lane's wife and daughter as well as eliminate the kidnappers as brutally and painfully as possible.<br /><br />Vengeance and retribution aren't unfamiliar concepts to Reacher and he certainly understands the need to eliminate threats. Reacher isn't impressed with the idea of mercenaries or of the government's use of them for contract work.  He is even less impressed with the group that Lane has around him as it is clear that while they may have been very good in their day while serving in their respective military units they aren't very good now.  As the kidnappers escalate their demands and he learns more about the mercenaries shared history, he wants to walk away.  But, the wife and child are non combats and there is no way he isn't going to help them.<br /><br />What follows is another good Reacher read.  As he works the case, he discovers more angles and machinations than he expected along with another short term love interest.  Little is done to add to the complex character of Reacher and for those that have read the series, none is really expected.  What is expected in a Reacher series novel is a fast paced intensive roller coaster of a read where one knows Reacher will win out in the end.  That's exactly what happens and this novel, while an installment of the series, also provides an excellent stand alone read.<br /><br />Kevin R.

B000005RFQ|4.0|This is one of the more enjoyable albums from the legendary Black Sabbath, Ozzy says so!!! Just like another legendary U.K. band Deep Purple, they made a great album without Ian Gillan and Ritchie Blackmore called \\"Come Taste The Band,\\" well Black Sabbath does the same here, without Dio or Ozzy. But of all people, Deep Purple's Ian Gillan!!! The voice of Jesus Christ Superstar. A strange pairing, but it does work. Born Again is much closer in spirit to the early 70's albums with Ozzy, and Gillan comes off like this crazed mad man, a drugged out party animal (which was the case) leading Black Sabbath's original trio down a path of true hard rock high jinx. I find that I reach for this Sabbath album more than any other, because of it's inspired vibe, which gives the very best Sabbath albums a run for the money.<br /><br />The only thing holding back the album from 5 stars is the sound quality is pretty muddy. Gillan blames bassist Gezzer Butler for this. Story has it, Gillan heard the rough mixes (and still has them) and they sounded great, then Gezzer was in charge of mixing the album, and the results had way too much bass. The remastering is pretty good, cleaning up some of the problem. Maybe one day it will either be re-mixed, or Gillan will release the earlier mixes.<br /><br />Highlights: Trashed, Disturbing The Priest, Digital Bitch, Born Again & Keep It Warm<br /><br />Born Again<br />~ Black Sabbath: 4 1/2 stars
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I truly think this is one of the best series ever to appear on television - but horribly, horribly marketed, with the pilot being rejected, three of the best episodes never being aired, and the episodes being shown all out of order.  Fox TV executives have a lot to answer for! <br /> <br />Thankfully, we have the DVD box set, with all the episodes, including three that never aired and the original pilot, all in their proper order.  I haven't yet found anyone who can watch the box set and not be utterly stunned that this show was cancelled while a plethora of mindless, brainless, talentless crap remains on the air. <br /> <br />The acting is first-rate, the scripts are phenomenally good - touching, funny, smart, and ORIGINAL - and the characters are so real that you find yourself frustrated beyond belief at the end of the box set because you NEED to know their backstories, and you need to know what happens next! <br /> <br />This is also one of the only TV series I've seen, sci-fi or otherwise, to have strong, believable, competent female characters who are not even remotely 'mannish' - they are all most decidedly women.  Not girls - women.  For that alone, this box set makes a great gift for teenage girls!
B000CNEO1G|5.0|I can,t stop listening to this player.  <br />Her tone is exquisit and the performances are very musical!! <br />
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the spirit of this movie. It has some slow moments, but most of the plot moves right along. Felicity Huffman was great, but I had a problem with her voice. She says in the interview that follows the movie that she had a lot of trouble getting her speaking voice low enough for the part, and the result is almost a monotone. As great as she was playing a man becoming a woman, I think it would have been more convincing if the lead had been played by a man. I couldn't forget that it was a woman playing a man becoming a woman. Nevertheless, this film is very different, and I enjoyed it a lot. It is not preachy or judgemental, and has a lot of heart.
B00003CXA2|5.0|When my stepfather first urged me to watch Forrest Gump, I was critical. Over three hours of a stupid guy's ramblings on the world? Please.<br /><br />But then I actually did watch it, and I couldn't have been more wrong. Forrest Gump tells the story of an Alabama man born with a low IQ. The story begins with him sitting on a bench, trying to strike up a conversation with the woman next to him. At first she isn't interested, but as Forrest's story goes on, you can't help but be drawn in and before long there are more people on the bench, missing their buses so that they can keep listening.<br /><br />Forrest has been everywhere, from war to to Ping Pong tournaments, and met a cast of people along the way, the most important being his long-time love, Jenny. Forrest is dense and clumsy, with braces on his legs and a mother that would do anything for him and won't hear a word against him. Jenny is beautiful and smart, with a father that abuses her. They're best friends.<br /><br />When they grow up they go seperate ways, but Forrest never forgets her, and they run into each other at differnet points of their lives. Forrest's story is told in a great way- Forrest himself is dull, but you have to be sharp to catch all the references in it, from Nike campaigns to the impeachment of Nixxon.<br /><br />When the flashbacks end and Forrest is back on the bench, he finishes the rest of his story from there. It's sweet and sad and truly moving. Even though Forrest is not especially bright, there is plenty of wisdom in all that he does. As he says, he's not a smart man, but he knows what love is.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I tell you what. FINAL FANTASY VII- ADVENT CHILDREN is animation at its finest. The images are beautiful and swift. The animation is so good, you sometimes get lost in its quality, forgetting you're watching a simulated camera sweep through DRAWINGS. I could talk all day about the animation. It's tremendous! Even flawless.<br /><br />My problem with the movie comes from the most basic of movie criticisms. The emotions and characters are hollow and empty. Yeah, we're watching motorcycle riders attack the hero CLOUD, but WHO CARES? Why? Why do we care? There is absolutely ZERO EMOTIONAL BUILD UP.<br /><br />We watch these TREMENDOUSLY COOL scenes. Battles. Magic. But there is no emotional involvement achieved. The main character CLOUD speaks in his same, downbeat depressed tone throughout. Never once giving us any emotion other than... like a young KEANU REEVES on downers.<br /><br />I couldn't help watching the film and thinking that this was an animation tutorial. This is what can be done with the future of animation. Yet, the creators weren't too concerned with story arc, emotional involvement or achieving any other emotion than... \\"that was cool.\\"<br /><br />Despite all the tremendously cool scenes, clanging metal, roaring motorcycles and magic waves of blue, FINAL FANTASY 7 falls flat with boring characters. They spent no time focusing on achieving an emotional contact with their audience and it shows.<br /><br />FINAL FANTASY VII isn't without merit. The animation is worth seeing. I just hope that somebody someday will take this animation and its possibilities and ACTUALLY PUT A STORY THAT GRABS AN AUDIENCE with it.

B000FIMG68|5.0|I had previously put a negative review on this show up and I still agree with the review. It was basically that I was upset that I was only able to watch the first 9 episodes of the season when it aired on ABC due to the fact that ABC foolishly had the episodes so spread out, it was frustrating... then there was the clip shows, and the aired episodes from season 1... and whoever's call it was to air the show that way... should be canned... harshly.<br /><br />Yet, reviewing on AMAZON isn't about how it aired on television... it's about these DVD sets and whether or not they're worth buying. The answer... YOU BET YOUR SWEET BUTTOX they are!<br /><br />Now that I think about it, season 2 was a richer season then season 1. There was so much going on in season 2 and I look back now and the writers need to be HAILED and worshipped for keeping this show hopping and twisting and moving and constantly interesting like they did.<br /><br />The opening of the hatch, Desmond, the disappearance of Walt, the Ocean raft, the other crash survivors, the numbers and the buttons, the relationships and the coinciding jealousies, the Mary statues, the missing film splices, the struggles over medication & guns, the prisoner, the weather balloon, the hatch and its secrets, the Pearl, murder, Hurley & the mental institution episode, Echoes dreams, comfronting the Others and betrayals.<br /><br />A slew of stories and interesting twists and turns and shocks that will have you riveted. In fact, many times during the season, I thought and couldn't help thinking that there was a little bit of a hint or an influence by David Lynch. I think, had Twin Peaks, been made slightly more commercial and a little more relatable by a mass audience, it would have a feel to it that is a lot like LOST.<br /><br />Television at its finest. Right now, I'm just wondering how the writers can keep things interesting... the more you reveal about the secrets of LOST... the more challenging it will be to keep people wondering and keep people riveted.  Funny thing, I have a feeling, they'll have no problem.<br /><br />You should not only buy LOST season 2, but you should buy LOST season 1 and watch them both... get caught up, because this is GREAT TV.Funny thing, I have a feeling, they'll have no problem.

B000FMGTTE|5.0|There have been mary cheerers and jeerers for Ottman. I myself  think this is a great soundtrack. Ottman has tightened up the main theme a bit, and while it's shorter than the original, it is punchier, and it sounds just wonderful. And as others have said, Ottman has woven the theme into the rest of the score quite well. <br /> <br />I don't envy Ottman. Deciding to use Williams' theme was a tough choice, but absolutely the right choice. The music is brilliant, and when people think Superman, they think of Williams' music. The soundtrack draws us ol' timers into the movie because it brings back memories of going to see Reeve's original, and our young'uns just love it becaus it sounds great. (My three year old asks to listen to it every day.) NOT using William's music would have been like not using the original Star Wars theme for Lucas' three prequels! <br /> <br />Ottman's original music is also quite good. I was a bit miffed the first few times I listened to it, but I've listened to it more than a dozen times now, and I adore at least 2/3 rds of the tracks, and like the rest. <br /> <br />The worst thing about this soundtrack is the it was put together by those idiots at Rhino. I'm a soundtrack fan. I like soundtracks. Yes, I mean music. I don't give a damn about stupid marketing crap, or CD videos. I can download those all day long from the Superman web site. So pushing music OFF of the CD to make room for that rediculous garbage is so infuriating I could spit nails--especially when leave off the Planet Krypton music!  <br /> <br />Soundtrack fans want soundtrack music--every note we can get our grubby little hands on. But look at Warner/Rhino's priority. It took them 20 YEARS (!) to release the 2-CD soundtrack of Superman: The Movie, and it will probably take them another 20 years to let us have all the music from this movie. If they do at all (and I'm not holding my breath). I hate Rhino.  <br /> <br />But the bottom line is it's great music. If you like this genre of music, buy this CD. (And write Rhino a complaint!)
B000F7CMRM|4.0|First, It is a good movie. I can understand why some people <br /> detested it. It is not an easy movie to watch if you are used <br /> to typical hollywood fare. Linear plot devices. Clear cut roles <br /> of good guy, bad guy etc..  <br /> <br /> There is only so much you can show in 2 hours. so, some characters are little disjointed. But, you get to see so many <br /> small stories. Oil Business, CIA, Gulf monarchies. Immigrant turned terrorist : I must say this is done very realistically. <br />Very realistic, I think it happens more or less like this.  <br />  <br />Even if you get only small part of the movie, it is worth watching. You will definitely learn something about our government, oil business, Gulf. AND that makes you a better  <br />citizen.  <br /> <br />Regarding the accusation that this is anti-american. It is not <br />true. I believe that american people/government does more good <br />than most countries. But, we have to be honest in accepting that <br />we care for our self interest. Having control of oil supplies <br />is in our self interest. Is it right or wrong is upto ones conscience ?  <br /> <br />Watch it folks. Even if you learn a thing or two, it is worth  <br />your time and money. Even if you donot agree with some aspects <br />of story - Watch it. This movie has more truth to it than I am <br />comfortable with. But, that is not a good enough reason to detest it.  <br /> <br />There are some good dialogues that should make people think. For <br />example: When Prince Nasir says about US military spending, stability etc.. George Clooney, Damon, stephen gagan, Jeff Skoll - they all deserve praise for making this movie.

0440131480|1.0|This is honestly one of the worst books I have ever read. I was saddened to see how far Vonnegut's mind had apparently deteriorated by the time I read this novel. It's a bunch of disjointed babbling about the most boring things imaginable; if I hadn't read the back of the book I wouldn't even be sure if it was intended to be humor. Practically nothing in it is the least bit funny or entertaining. It looks like it was written by a heavily drugged 10-year-old as a school assignment to explain Earth to an even younger and more ignorant child. Throughout there are infantile explanations of the most basic terms as if Vonnegut intended his book to survive for centuries until it was a historical relic, used by future societies to understand ours. One of the most stunningly idiotic things in the book (or any book I have read) is his technique of babbling about himself in the first person in the middle of telling the story, as if the story wasn't boring enough in itself; it has perhaps two plot events total. He even makes claims about his penis size. It is beyond me how any intelligent person above the age of 12 could find this interesting. <br /> <br />I loved Player Piano, Slaughterhouse Five and Cat's Cradle, which were nothing like this book, and can only assume from the stark contrast that Vonnegut suffered from senility at a much younger age than usual.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Snatch is a fast moving movie with little chance to catch your breath. It moves along at lightening pace showing the dark side of Londons criminal underworld at it's worst. It is a humourous film and one which will please anyone who saw Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. <br />The dialogue is distinctly English and so it will be hard for some to follow easily. Brad Pitts broad Gypsy (Irish?)accent was so authentic I even found it hard to catch all his words. North American residents may struggle at times with this and may actually have to resort to subtitles. <br />To sum up.The movie is in the  classic Guy Ritchie mould . He seems to have picked up on Tarrantinos thirst for blood in most every scene. However, even the violent scenes are all done very well and with the humourous dialogue it still manages to make you laugh.  The cast all work well together in their respective roles. <br />I would not hesitate to recommend this movie but anyone who does not like the F word or to see too much blood should maybe try something else.
B00005JP0A|4.0|I will be the first to admit to you, here and now, that I have never owned anything from Calvin Klein, Vera Wang, Jimmy Choo, or Tommy Hilfiger (much less Abercrombie & Fitch).  Yes, Amazon.com readers, I am not a fashion maven.  To be honest with you, most of the fashion references in this film (made by the delightfully wicked Meryl Streep, as Miranda Priestly) went right over my head.  Yet, it worked.  Can you blame poor Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) for feeling more than a little beside herself?  I mean, the girl comes straight out of a good college with a journalism degree, with the aspiration of one day working for the New York Times, and must take an administrative position in a fashion firm (fashion being a subject she knows NOTHING about).<br /><br />Others before me have called this film a--sort of--modern day Cinderella story with a twist.  For me, it was more like a comment on modern day materialism, ambition, and how we all have the option in life to throw our morality to the wayside in persuit of the \\"American Dream.\\"  This was more social commentary, to me, than anything else.<br /><br />Is this worth seeing?  Yes, I think it is.  Anne Hathaway is absolutely charming as the heroine, Meryl Streep steals the show with her one liners and posturing, and you can tell the whole cast was having great fun with her.
B00000JZC4|5.0|From the brief, ambient opening track \\"Sand\\", to the tenor goodbyes at the end of the closing track \\"Miss Blue\\", it's easy to see at all points in between that Title of Record was an open-minded step forward from the band's mostly angry debut four years earlier. This sophomore release presented an infectious blend of alt rock and raw energy, and yet it sounds the least industrial of Filter's two albums up to that point, save for a staticky burn-out which closes \\"The Best Things\\" on an awesome note.  While this humorously titled release offers a hypnotically shiny platter of promising numbers, the real winner of radioplay on this disc turned out to be the lyrically sublime \\"Take a Picture\\", which hooked a plethora of new fans by way of a lazy tempo and a sudden confrontation toward the vocalist's father near the end.  After an extended listen or two, Title of Record ends up being a must-have release for all who find themselves at home with intelligently written songs featuring just a hint of industrial aggression.
6305897786|4.0|It's a shame that Roman Polanski's \\"Ninth Gate\\" never found its audience when it was initially released. Misleadingly hyped as the type of action/horror hybrid we are all too familiar with, \\"Ninth Gate\\" actually revisits the Noir trappings Polanski played with in \\"Chinatown,\\" and combines it with the tongue-in-cheek Gothic overtones of \\"Rosemary's Baby.\\" <br /> <br />Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a used book dealer who is pressed into service as an amateur P.I. by multimillionare Balkan (Frank Langella), who hires him to track down and examine alternate versions of a rare Satanic text. What appears to be simple turns out to be a convoluted web of intrigue and dark secrets in best noir fashion. Depp's Corso encounters femme fatales, eccentric cloistered old money and - most charmingly - a series of rather bookish Old World types. While never devolving into slapstick, Depp keeps tongue planted firmly in cheek, adding a much-needed light touch to the proceedings. <br /> <br />In sum, I enjoyed this film a lot, and believe it holds up to multiple viewings. <br /> <br />The Artisan single disc version of the film contains very few extras. There's a very brief featurette, as well as the ridiculous trailers which explain why \\"Ninth Gate\\" failed at the box office. More thoughtfully, Artisan included two bonus audio tracks. The first is a director's commentary, the second is a music-only version. There's also a nice gallery containing the Tarot card-like illustrations that figure so heavily in the film. Unfortunately, there are no subtitles nor are there any foreign language subtitles or language tracks. <br /> <br />I have no idea how closely \\"The Ninth Gate\\" resembles the book it is based on. But if you are primarily a noir fan who also enjoys nongory horror films, you may just find this movie to your tastes. It's a lot of fun.
0060557818|5.0|Every now and then a book comes along that leaves you thankful for the experience. What a captivating piece of magic this is: it works on so many levels, and doesn't unravel upon reflection afterwards; just continues to glow. Homer's Odyssey meets Dr. Who, it never descends into the hardness and cynicism that I expected when I first started reading. Can't wait to give this to my college-age niece who just visited (and fell in love with) London (altho she probably has already read it by now)
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Without the orchestrations, the emphasis is on the guitars here, making this probably the Beatles most guitar-oriented album. You won't miss any of the orchestrations. The Spector version of 'The Long and Winding Road' almost seems like a joke now. In general, the mixes are cleaner and clearer. You won't miss the banter in between songs, and you won't miss 'Dig It' or 'Maggie May', which weren't even really songs. The addition of 'Don't Let Me Down' is nice, but why not include some of the other full-length songs from the sessions?!? And the new sequence of the songs is more logical. So, in general everything is better than the Spector version, with the exceptions of the two songs that were added later by Spector: 'I Me Mine' and 'Across the Universe'. In the '...Naked' version of 'I Me Mine', the main guitar riff is weaker. And in 'Across the Universe', the wah wah guitar, the phased effect on the acoustic guitar, and the bass riff at the end are all missing, which would be more important to us old folk who got used to hearing it that way. If you're young, '...Naked' is clearly the better 'Let It Be' album.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|This stylish film is both beautiful and has a well-told story. The set design and costumes match perfectly to immediately place you into the future of 23rd Century Earth. Charlize Theron and Marton Csokas find real on-screen heat that sizzles. Theron also does some beautiful stunts that are fun to watch. This movie doesn't have the gratuitous ultra-violence which other movies in this genre have. It is well written and well made. Enjoy!
0385338686|5.0|I love all of Sophia Kinsella's book and this one was no exception.  I really loved the characters. A hard to put down read.
0316172324|3.0|I've read both the Tipping Point and Blink, and I've felt the same way after each: Gladwell has a knack for describing fascinating research studies and observations, but the conclusions he draws from them are not always logical.  I don't doubt the accuracy of his reporting of studies and events, especially since I studied a lot of the research he describes as a psychology major.  What turned me off were the giant leaps he takes in drawing conclusions from his stories. <br /> <br />For example, in Blink he describes a study that found that the amount a doctor is sued for malpractice is not correlated with the number of mistakes they actually make.  Instead, it is correlated with the manner in which they speak to their patients.  Domineering doctors are more likely to be sued, regardless of their skill.  So far, so good.  However, Gladwell goes a step too far in concluding that if you get a bad feeling when you're with a condescending physician, listen to that feeling because it's your intuition giving you a sign.  A sign of what? All Gladwell has shown is that this doctor is more likely to be sued -- not that she or he deserves it. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this is an entertaining read that tells many interesting stories.  I just recommend reading it with a healthy amount of skepticism for Gladwell's conclusions.

B000EMGAGW|2.0|I have been a fan of Mobb Deep ever since I heard Survival Of The Fittest and Shook Ones Part 2.  I was very happy that Mobb Deep was releasing a new album.  I told myself I should get this album as soon as possible.   I cannot believe I wasted my money on this rubbish!  I was highly expecting to only hear Havoc and Prodigy on the entire album, I was wrong.  The first two tracks Smoke It and Put Em In There Place are really good tracks.  My problem with this album is that 50 Cent is on too many or should I say the whole album.  If wanted to hear this much of 50 then I would brought his last album The Massacre.   The track Give It To Me feat. Young Buck is by far the most annoying song on the whole album.  When you hear this song by the second time, you will be pressing the skip button over and repeatedly.  Enough about   50 and Young Buck whoever is reading this review is wandering why I called this review the Blasphemous.  On the ninth track Pearly Gates feat. 50 Cent this so called religious track has Prodigy challenging God and Jesus, there is an edit on the track but I will give the reader the freestyle- PRODIGY: Now Homie If I go to hell and you make it to the Pearly Gates tell the Boss Man we got beef and tell his only son I'm a see him when see him and when I see him I'm a beat him like the movie.  When I first heard this, I was thinking Prodigy has lost his mind.  After I brought Blood Money and I heard Pearly Gates, I was wandering why there was an edit on Prodigies rhyme, now I know.  I have no intention to ever buy another G Unit or Mobb Deep Album ever again.
B00000721J|5.0|A lot of people really dislike this first solo effort by the former Beatle .This McCartney lp is a very home grown, stripped down record. From the simplicity of the title, to the organic feel of the songs. I believe this album was released before the Beatles \\"officially\\" broke up. In fact, the song  \\"Junk\\" has appeared on some Beatles reissues.  \\"Maybe Im Amazed\\" has aged well and is still heard on the radio today. Certainly not as radio friendly as his later solo work would become, this lp will fit in fine with your post Beatles collection
B000055Y0X|5.0|\\"Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" is an old movie that tackles a difficult subject, the end of the world as we know it due to a nuclear war. Despite that, it is simply brilliant, and not boring at all.<br /><br />Why? Well, there are different reasons to say that, but I think I'll point out only those that I deem more important:<br /><br />1- To start with, even though this film was made in 1964, director Stanley Kubrick managed to create a timeless masterpiece that depicts, in a sardonic way, the dangers of nuclear war. The message of this movie still comes across as valid, albeit nowadays for different reasons.<br /><br />2- Secondly, even though the subject is undeniably serious, this movie is a black comedy that makes you laugh. If that is difficult to believe, take into account that the plot involves a crazy general (Sterling Hayden) that sidesteps the chain of command in order to launch a nuclear airstrike on the URSS, something his aide (Captain Mandrake, played by Peter Sellers), the President (played by Peter Sellers!!) and many of his advisors (including Dr. Strangelove, a scientist also played by Peter Sellers) try to stop. But will that be possible? And what about the Soviet \\"Doomsday Machine\\", that will be triggered automatically by any nuclear attack on Soviet soil?<br /><br />All in all, I think this is the kind of movie you simply must watch. Highly recommended  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B0000C8AVR|5.0|If this album is on Carly Simon's Top Ten list, it belongs well up on your list too. Definitely a classic and, except maybe for Blonde on Blonde, Dylan's best ever. Between these two, you'll have the best of Dylan except for \\"Lay, Lady Lay\\", which he wrote some 10 years later -- after his near-fatal motorcycle accident. <br /> <br />Like another reviewer, I mostly dislike country. Unlike that reviewer, I think this album is terrific. It's the first true blend of country, folk and rock in musical evolution that's done really well in every respect.
B00005JOQS|5.0|It's hard to believe that less than a decade ago, comic book-to-live-action-movie adaptations were so, uh....well. falling so short of their potential.  There were a few enjoyable movies among them, but their best were generally far from the best of the larger crossgenres epic vein they were a part of (think the Star Wars movies, Terminator 2, Braveheart, and other big, powerful greats like those for comparisons from the same timeframe) and they were also falling far short of hitting the mark as adaptations of their source material and of presenting the world of modern comics to the much larger movie audience.  The best jobs, by far, in that department were being done by certain animated works: \\"Batman - The Animated Series\\", \\"Superman: Last Son Of Krypton\\", \\"Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm\\".       Flash forward just a few years from when the bigscreen comic adaptations temporarily disappeared and all of a sudden: the X-Men series.  Batman Begins.  Spider-Man.  Elektra.  And now \\"Superman Returns\\", in one of the biggest, most incredible, better-than-ever comebacks of all time.  This is the level of movie that the Superman comics have deserved to have up there representing them for a long, long time.        I'll admit it - the movie doesn't nail the realism mark nearly as well as the modern comics (or even the younger-geared, animated, Superman material of the 90s for that matter).  And it does rely heavily on a couple of pretty large coincidences.  In this case,that doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter in the same way that, when \\"Star Wars\\" is playing, it doesn't matter that in space you wouldn't Really be able to hear those great explosions as X-Wings and Trade Federation Droidships are being blasted to kingdom come.  It doesn't matter in the way that, when you're watching \\"E.T.\\", with any real Earth government involved, events most likely wouldn't really have been allowed to end as beningnly as they did.  Sometimes a movie just goes past the 'larger than life' markand becomes larger than reality.  \\"Superman Returns\\" is one of those movies.       Watching this, you believe it all.  You care about the characters, and you Know the characters.  It's exhilirating,  humorous, emotionally moving, inspirational, dramatic and forever memorable.       Apparantly set more or less in the continuity of the previous live-action Superman movies, the Man Of Steel returns to Earth after a five-year abscence off in space seeking out the remnants of his homeworld Krypton in hopes of some trace of survivors.  The world he comes back to seems darker, more violent, and more desperate than the one he left; just like the world of today seems darker, more violent, and more desperate than the world of years ago (or, more likely, we're just in general more aware of the more distressing aspects of our planet nowadays).  Superman's actual return to the public eye is one of the most stunning moments in movie history.       By one of the above-mentioned coincidences, his return comes at the same time Lex Luthor is putting into play his biggest and most ambitious plan to date.  The Luthor of \\"Superman Returns\\" occupies a midway point between the entertaining but too-buffoonish Luthor of the earlier live-action movies, and the deadly believable, genius behind-the-scenes manipulator of the books; I would have voted to go far closer to the comic book version but the incarnation presented here turns out to be extremely effective after all (over-the-top masterplans and all) thanks in part to a fantastic performance by Kevin Spacey.  Perry White (the chief editor at the Daily Planet) is quite different here in both appearance and mannerisms but comes off very well also, with Frank Langella doing a great job in the role.  Lois Lane, as played by Kate Bosworth, is pretty close to the comics version but actually, in my opinion, a bit Better of a character than she often is in the comics, and she seems more indispensable to the Superman mythos than in previous adaptations.  The new, created-for-the-movie, characters, come off great and add tremendously to the film.  And Brandon Routh proves to be worthy into stepping into the lead role and living up to 68 years of glorious Superman history; he does a great job of synthesizing the feel of the 'classic' Superman from years past and the 'modern', post-Crisis On Infinte Earths (a DC comics crossover from the mid 80s) incarnation of a more believable and detailed Superman and DC Universe in general.      I hope they do ten more of these (bring on Darkseid!).  Awesome in every regard, \\"Superman Returns\\" defines the term 'movie magic'.

0312305060|5.0|If you ever asked me to read a book about lesbians -- young and old -- homosexual men dying of AIDS, former lovers of the dying AIDS person, hypnotically insane housewives, and depressed suicidal writers, I would say \\"pass.\\"<br /><br />This book is about those topics, and amazingly weaves three worlds -- each separated in time and location -- which touch upon Virginia Woolf and her less than happy disposition. Woolf is encased in her home and seeks to return to another place or she will kill herself. Modern poet Richard seeks to do the same -- but for very different reasons.<br /><br />As each character is introduced to the reader, introspective review of their person is constantly delivered by Cunningham.  Amazingly trite and vivid details are delicately positioned throughout this novel to the point where we are ensconced by the incredibly moving prose.<br /><br />This book is well deserving of the Pulitzer.<br /><br />This writer does the most amazing thing - he takes on a topic I would have to consider the least attractive for my readings tastes and delivers a book I wish, and probably will, read again.
B000002UJQ|5.0|No other band today so perfectly captures the human condition as Radiohead, and ok computer is the album for which this statement is most true. This album has been compared to Dark Side of the Moon, and for good reason. Both albums delicately and poetically undertake universal themes that any mature individual should be able to relate to on some level. I like to view both as psychedelic portraits of the respective cultural environments in which they were written. However, both are presented with such genious and poignant language and music that they transcend their respective cultural settings, which certainly helps to explain each albums' immense worldwide success. <br /> <br />I am saddened by any music fan who doesn't \\"get\\" ok computer, or Radiohead for that matter. If you listen to this album all the way through while reading the lyrics and aren't even the slightest bit moved, perhaps you should turn off your MTV for a little while and study some art or literature. I guarantee you'll learn things you never would from the commercial box in your living room. Maybe, with enough effort, one day you too can see why so many people worldwide adore this band. And if you don't care, well that's OK with us.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|Munich is the story about a secret Israeli squad sent out to track down and asassinate 11 targets who were believed responsible for the 1972 killing spree of 11 Israeli athletes during the Olympics by Palestinian terrorists, a group known as Black September. <br /> <br /> The Israeli government hires a man named Avner [Eric Bana] to lead a team of 4 away from their families for months, maybe even years till their mission is complete. They will have to sacrifice their own well being as they venture into hostile territory as they track down their targets. At first Avner and his men are relaxed as they think it will be done in a couple of months, however the stress of tracking down their targets start to take a toll on themselves. <br /> <br />Geoffrey Rush co-stars as Ephraim, the team handler. He sort of just hung around to check on the team's progress and also supplied them the money they needed to bribe people into helping them with their mission. Also in the movie is a paid French informant who supplies the names of the targets but also does not earn the trust of the full team as some question whether he is really helping them or not. <br /> <br />The plot takes the team all over the Middle East, even areas such as France and London. There is also a lot of violent images such as brutal execution by the team members on their targets. They also show in flashbacks during the movie how the Israeli athletes were killed by the terrorists which aren't easy to see. <br /> <br />However Avner shows a lot of compasion as he sees his new daughter and wife for the first time after being separated for such a long time. I did find some scenes in the movie to drag a bit, but a lot of suspense as the team members prepare to eliminate their next target brought the level up a lot.  <br /> <br />There aren't many extras on the DVD at all, although you do have the option of choosing to start the movie with a small introduction by Steven Spielberg himself as he talks about the story and how hard a subject it was to touch and make into a movie. <br /> <br />Even though the extras section is lacking this is a great movie to see. A lot of suspense and even some sentimental scenes in between make this well worth checking out. <br /> <br />Recommended
B000008JUM|4.0|The beautiful elements of all Porter's work are that the songs he penned are elegant, witty, refreshingly verbose, timeless and can, in effect, be sung by anyone to anyone. They are loving, sexy and sexless at once; which reveals much about the great man's character and genius.<br /><br />The songs and artists here are a sound spread of genre. Sung in either classic form or as refreshing reworkings. On the whole it works well with a few unfortunate exceptions.<br /><br />It is well worth adding to a discerning collection. My personal favourites are those which by and large retain their classic quality, Annie Lennox, K D Lang and Lisa Stansfield do beautiful interpretations of their chosen songs. Andy Bell and David Byrne add twists which work to great effect. It is a certainty that the album is developing it's own classic status as time moves on, it was origianlly released in 1990. The perfect tribute at the time and a mark of how far we have come in an effort to fight HIV. The songs howevr in my opinion need little tinkering or adjustment since they were and are beautiful, it is a shame some of the artists chose to rework certain songs so heavily.
6305128952|5.0|When you first see this movie it already leaves you feeling emotionally connected. But when you see it the second time and know for sure how the events pull out it leaves you in tears. This movie is so emotional in how they played out Pilgrim, and Grace's fall. Then the trama that followed. This is not a soap opera but it teaches you something. It teaches you the value of love, and life.  <br /> <br />I don't see why so many people are rating this so badly. Trust me if you haven't seen it yet and you love horses. You'll love this movie. But if you don't that is true too. You know I've seen this movie many times and it always has some emotional parts left. I have tears when seeing it. But this movie teaches so much and was so beautifully done it's a must see for anyone. <br /> <br />The story was awesome and there was never a dull moment. Sure it's not an action or an adventure. But it's not a soap opera either as some people might believe. <br /> <br />All and all this is a must see for anyone.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|If you are interested in the lreal ife of Casanova, and want to know something about him, this film is not the place for you. `Casanova' directed by Lasse Hallström (`The Cider House Rules' `Chocolat') disregards any historical accuracy in turning the life of libertine into an almost farce-like romantic comedy, which is full of -- at least four, as I remember -- mistaken identities. Take it for what it is, and you will find it quite entertaining with beautiful costumes and locations. <br /> <br />The film begins and ends with a series of routine tricks - voiceover by an aged man writing something, recollecting his younger days; the image starts to wobble; cue to the glorious days of Venice, the richest city in Europe. And Casanova making love in a nunnery. Lasse Hallström tackles these familiar setups in a bold manner, doing them as straightforward as possible, as if to shake off the dismal air of his previous films like `The Shipping News.' The scenes are not original, but still fun thanks to the good acting from the cast. <br /> <br />Heath Ledger is perfectly cast as Casanova, who finds his `true love' in a feisty woman with a progressive idea named Francesca (Siena Miller), right after he has got engaged to another girl Victoria (Natalie Dormer). And Francesca, who has engaged a Genoese merchant Paprizzo (Oliver Platt), also seems to keep clandestine meeting with someone else. Add to them Lena Olin as Francesca's mother and Jeremy Irons as Pucci from the Catholic Church, who is so eager to catch and hang Casanova, and the already complicated story gets more complicated to create some funny set-pieces about the mistaken identities.  <br /> <br />In spite of the film's title, it is Oliver Platt and Jeremy Irons who are most attractive in the entire cast. Both play the characters who are constantly duped by Casanova, but that makes them all the more engaging. Heath Ledger's Casanova is OK. As a womanizer his portrayal looks rather tamed, but still good enough. Siena Miller's Francesca is the most disappointing for I finally couldn't find why Casanova has to be attracted to her. One courtroom scene that (intentionally, I guess) reminds us of one Shakespearian drama is weak and ineffective, and I also do not see why the film should have ended like this with two Casanovas. <br /> <br />`Casanova' is a light-hearted romance with gorgeous costumes and production designs. Actually, the film's comfortable feelings come mostly from the city of Venice and the delightful photography that captures it. You cannot say the film does justice to the real Casanova who, some say, is a much more complex person. I don't know about that; maybe I should read books. But as far as the film's content is concerned, it is amusing enough.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|M J Heilbron, are you out of your mind about this being a ho hum album? You said that the song \\"Don't Look Back\\" was the only good song and about the only song that you ever played. What a D.A.!!!!! And I think you know what that acronym means because you ain't to smart. I had heard the three big hits off the first self-titled album by Boston but the album DON'T LOOK BACK was the first that I ever purchased and heard in it's entirety. I know everyone says that the debut was quite a bit better but not so in my book at least. Even the last two that finish off the album (a lot of people would call them filler) are superb. I wore this cassette out mostly playing it on my very first car stereo back in 1980. How can you go wrong with the songs \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\", \\"It's Easy\\" and \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\". That stuff kicks, so M J Heilbron go out and buy some taste. Will you please? Go back to your Michael Bolton cds and try not to just dismiss this album out of hand, and maybe you could go to music school and learn how to rock. If you're new to Boston just take my advice and buy this gem of a cd and just get it over with. Enjoy!!!
B00006SFBD|5.0|I can't get enough of this CD. Like Kommisar said, it's heavy yet melodic. Not only is this Opeth's most technical album, it is also tied with My Arms, Your Hearse as their heaviest. Mikael's vocals range from harsh death growls to beautiful, clean singing, fitting his intelligent lyrics. He is also a superb rhythm guitarist, laying out some nice riffs and even some acoustics. Peter's riffs and solos are mesmerizing and complex. Martin's basslines add to the heavyness  and are hearable. The other Martin's drumming is nicely done, and he doesn't abuse the double bass. Wreath is one of the greatest songs Opeth's ever written. I command you to buy this CD.
B000002UAR|5.0|This in many ways is the ultimate beatles album. Already leaving there \\"mop top\\" image behind just a year ago the beatles stretched even further for this album. With the beatles given a three month vacation they decided to hit the studio and record this masterpiece. Lennon's acid soaked commentary is all over \\"doctor Robert\\", \\"She Said, She Said\\", and the highly innovative \\"Tommorrow never knows\\". George Harrison finally challenges the dominate Lennon/McCartney compositions with three of his own brilliant numbers, \\"Taxman\\", \\"Love you to\\", and \\"I want to tell you\\". Ringo's drumming is damn near extrodinary and delivers the children's classic \\"yellow submarine\\". But it's Paul McCartney who steals the show, showcasing a new and striking maturity in his compositions. From the bleak and powerful \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" to the beach boyesque \\"Here there and Everywhere\\".While\\"For No One\\" is certainly one of the darkest and most brilliant compositions the beatles ever recored. But truthfully every track here is a gem! With Revolver, The Beatles officially turned there backs on being \\"teen idols\\" and became the greatest rock n roll band in music history.
0521618789|4.0|This review is dedicated to my father. Along with \\"Macbeth\\" and \\"Midsummer Night's Dream,\\" this was one of his favorites. The play begins with an unfortunate ship being caught in a storm. In the next scene, we move from the ocean to a nearby island. There, we learn that the tempest was not from natural causes, but from the magic of our hero Prospero. Prospero has a grudge against certain passengers on that ship. (Miranda is in her teens, but she sounds much younger. Possibly because she has lead such a sheltered life.) Prospero's brother Antonio usurped Prospero's dukedom andhanded control over to King Alonso. Prospero and his daughter were banished, and the benevolent Gonzalo furnished them with books Prospero loved. (Prospero has been called the greatest representation of Shakespeare himself.) We may note though that while Prospero is the hero of this play, he has a major fault. (He loves playing God.) One example is when Ariel, (his fairy servant) asks for her 'promised freedom of air,' rather than just politely asking for some more time, Prospero threatens her.<br /><br />Moving on, we meet the deceased Sycorax's son Caliban. (Prospero defeated Sycorax) Prospero tried to be nice to Caliban, but Caliban repaid him by trying to rape Miranda. But since he enoys playing God, Prospero subjects Caliban to a torturous slavery. We later meet Ferdinand (the son of the king on the ship). He sees Miranda and loves her. But Prospero decides that he can not let his daughter be won too easily, and like Caliban, ferdinand is made to do hard labor.<br /><br />Moving on, we understand that the king (Ferdinand's father) is Prospero's enemy. But we are allowed generous sympathy for him when he is sorrow struck over his missing son. And even Ariel (Prospero's servant) stops an attempt by Antonio and Sebastian to kill the king.<br /><br />Later, caliban meets Stephano and Trinculo. the 3 become friends (throughsome comical use of wine) and join together to defeat Prospero and take over the island.<br /><br />Onto Act 3. ferdinand and Miranda express their love for each other, and Prospero (watching from an unseen location) is pleased. Antonio and Sebastian make another plan to kill Alonso. At this point, we can infer that Ariel has warned Prospero of the Caliban/Stephano/Trinculo plot.  But Prospero sees another chance to play God. Antonio, Sebastian, Alonso, and Gonzalo are starving. Ariel and Prospero make an image of a banquet appear before them only to vanish. (This is kind of below the belt.)<br /><br />In Act 4, Prospero shows a gentler side when he consents to the marriage of Ferdinand and Miranda.

But Prospero sees another chance to play God. Antonio, Sebastian, Alonso, and Gonzalo are starving. Ariel and Prospero make an image of a banquet appear before them only to vanish.

B00000E3HM|5.0|In this recording, the Berlin Philharmonic produces the most beautiful orchestral music that I have ever heard.  Notice the evocative sleigh bells at the beginning, the hypnotic third movement, and the rapt singing in the fourth.   <br /> <br />    I could go on and on.
B000ENWKN8|3.0|Rob Zombie has always been an idol of mine, ever since I purchased \\"La Sexorcisto Devil music vol. 1\\" in \\"93\\".  Right away I was hooked.  Here's a man who mixes horror with heavy metal.  Granted this wasn't a new idea, but it seemed there was finally someone who would help carry on the torch for Alice Cooper and the Misfits.  I am always eagerly waiting for the next release from Mr. Zombie.  Unfortunately, Rob has a tendency to let quite a bit of time fall between releases, but they always seem worth the wait.  This time I was bit disappointed.  Granted he took some time off in between the release of \\"Sinister Urge\\" and \\"Educated Horses\\" to work on \\"Devil's Rejects\\".  This was fine because Zombie has found quite a gift for horror filmmaking.  However, I just felt a little let down with \\"Educated Horses\\".<br /><br />Please don't misunderstand me.  I do like this album.  It still sounds like Zombie and I can bang my head to it, but it seems like he dropped a little of his horror image.  When one looks at all his albums up to his latest release, each one seems to get darker and more disturbing.  It's almost as if Zombie is turning undead himself.  Then \\"Educated Horses\\" is released and it is a little less dark and ghoulish.  Now I know image has nothing to do with music, but it seemed that when Zombie toned down his image he also toned down his music.  Simply put, this album just does not rock as hard as his other efforts.  I knew I was in for a bit of a let down when I first heard \\"Foxy Foxy\\" on the radio.  Granted not a bad tune, but just not nearly as edgy as his other singles.  \\"American Witch\\" or \\"Let it all Bleed Out\\" should have been the first single.  These tracks are much closer to what I would call Zombie's quintessential sound.<br /><br />I also realize he has a new band and that will definitely make a difference in the sound of the album.  I also know that artist needs to grow and a try new things or else their work can get stagnate.  I do think it's interesting how this album does really seem to be homage to the great Black Sabbath.  There is some signature Sabbath like riffs and right down to the black and white photographs of Zombie and the band in the woods I feel like I'm viewing the inside of a Sabbath album.  As I stated before I do enjoy this album.  It's still sounds like Rob Zombie and the track \\"Let it all Bleed Out\\" just shreds.  It has to be one of the best songs Rob has ever recorded.  But as \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\" felt like a trip to hell and back, \\"Educated Horses\\" feels like a walk through the graveyard.s album does really seem to be homage to the great Black Sabbath.

B000002UAU|5.0|First concieved from Paul McCartney as a concept album about a fictional rock band Sgt Peppers soon took on a life of it's own along the way kind of shedding the \\"concept\\" along the way but in a way it's what makes the album such a classic. Each song seems to flow perfectly into the next even though many of the songs themes couldn't be closer in any sense of togetherness. The title track actually inspired from guitar great Jimi Hendrix is actually the ony song off the album that ties together with the original theme. McCartney delivers a throat shredding delivery and is a great way to start off the album. Next is the class \\"With a little help form my friends\\" another Lennon/McCartney composition intended for Ringo Starr. But unlike any of the past Ringo' vocal delivery is sincere and quite frankly the greatest vocal performence of his entire career. A true classic in every sense of the word. Next up is the amazing yet controversial \\"Lucy in the sky with diamonds\\". Believed to be an LSD reference the song title is really inspired from a drawing Lennon's son Julian titled of the same name. However you look at this song it is another classic. The next track \\"Getting Better\\" may have been worn out by tv ads but no version is as good as the beatles original with a great vocal from Paul McCartney and a great double tracked guitar part from George Harrison. The next track \\"Fixing a hole\\" is another strong track with yet another great vocal delivery from Paul McCartney. What follows next is yet another classic, \\"She's leaving home\\". Inspired from a true story McCartney writes another gem while Lennon accomponies him on the classic chorus lines. \\"Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite\\" is one of the weaker tracks from sgt peppers though the production from George Martin is as always top notch. The next track, Harrison's only composition on the album \\"Within Without You\\" is the only track on the album to only include one beatle but that doesn't mean this isn't a great track! Whatcomes next is McCartney's \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\", which he wrote when was only fifteen. The sped up vocal serves as a reminder of this fact. \\"Lovely Rita\\" is the next track, though a little better then \\"when I'm sixty four\\" it's none the less a silly and pointless song. But it is actaully a very good song. \\"Good Morining, Good Morning\\" is not a great track but McCartney's blistering guitar solo nearly makes up for Lennon's disjointed lyrics and silly pretensions. The reprise which follows is a great song though no where near one of the best on the album. But what follows is the ultimate track off sgt peppers, \\" A day in the life\\". Lennon delivers a classic performence while McCartney joins him on the middle eighth. This is no doubt the best track on the album and quite possibly the greatest achievment the beatles ever recorded. If you already own this album you already know this is one the greatest albums ever recored and if you don't already own this album, you should almost do anything in your power to get a copy!
B000646MNE|5.0|I am dismayed that so many reviewers found this series vapid, offensive and far too focused on sex.  I have to admit the first episode I saw left me a little shocked.  But what gets you hooked on this show is how much these four women care about and support one another.  And, yes, they may live in an ultra-glamorous New York (by the way, is there a rule that says every series about New York has to feature homeless people?  If so, somebody ought to tell the Donald because he's missing the boat too), but they all have excellent, well-paying jobs.  The only two things I ever thought were unrealistic were: 1) being a lawyer myself, how often Miranda seems to be free to have a social life; and 2) how does Carrie walk down New York City streets in those shoes?  And before anybody cares to tell me I don't know what I'm talking about, I lived and worked in New York City myself for 25 years.  I confess that I truly miss these women and their lives.  But I absolutely value my own girlfriends just as much.

Before I saw this, Pink Floyd to me was an entity, not a group of individuals. It was mesmerizing to see this concert.  It was interesting to watch the crowd--not moving a muscle.  Every note is perfection, and I will continue to get chills each and every time I watch it. Buy it, watch it, love it.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|I love it anytime a band can take styles and production values from the past and totally nail it; I've been listening to this over and over again and it is just great, a terrific throwback to 30 years ago. I don't care who they \\"sound like\\" if the songs themselves are strong and well-written and here, they are. Make sure you pump this through a heavy-duty home or car system 'cos it's going to blow you away.
B00000IP3S|5.0|I'm not sure why. it's not like they are particularly esoteric or anything. I think it has something to do with the overall mindset I had in approaching Blind Guardian previously. my theory is that their rather unique style was not something I was able to appreciate without a paradigm shift. Realistically, one would have to call them power metal--their emphasis on vocals, melody, and speed is not uncommon to the genre. Yet, in being a metal band, it doesn't follow that they are a big riff, big guitar band - their music is unusually focused on vocal arrangement and melodic devices. The music, sure, is really chunky, pretty heavy, and very fast, but the guitars dominantly play a lead role. Guitar lines themselves are often charged with renaissance-flavored modalities that lends atmosphere and credibility to their fantasy-influenced sound more than they make wannabe metal-geeks (like me) want to suddenly learn how to play guitar. Recently, things changed - I can't get enough Blind Guardian, and I think this is their best album overall. Rather than trudge through obligatory review prose, I will catalogue the things that make Blind Guardian and this album awesome.<br /><br />> First and foremost, Hansi Kursch is the best voice in metal, bar none. He is completely different from any other singer out there - rather than a high-pitched power metal tenor or brutish growling, Hansi's voice is raspy and sounds strained almost all the time. Few singers have either his range or power - his hair-raising screams are unmatched and his softer minstrel-like singing is honestly beautiful. _Imaginations from the Other Side_ is probably the last album where Hansi's raspiness is full on - his vocals started to sound a little more polished and `mature' after this album. Overall, this is Hansi's best performance. His scratchy, desperate tone delivers the most poignant metal lines ever: \\"What can I do on this road to nowhere at the edge of time (heart of dragon lies)\\" he implores with perfect viciousness on \\"And the Story Ends...\\"; \\"he's the one who took the sword out of the stone,\\" he sings on \\"A Past and Future Secret\\" with a stirring, lilting bardic quality; \\"Agony's the script for my requiem\\" he snarls as the chorus of \\"The Script for My Requiem\\" kicks into high gear. Hansi is the Patrick Stewart of metal - he has a unique power to make any line sound amazing.<br /><br />> Also vocal-related, the CHORUSES!!! Blind Guardian is the best in the business when it comes to the huge, multi-tracked vocal choruses. Every album Blind Guardian releases cranks the choruses up a few levels, but _Imaginations_ is the first album where those vocals were really, like, HUGE n' stuff. HAHAHA<br /><br />> Blind Guardian would be nothing more than what they are without a few special qualities. One of the reasons they command so much drama in their music is that their sense of arrangement and structure is meticulous so as to really drive home the intensity and emotion in different tracks as the passage unfold. Sometimes it is as simple as throwing in a new bridge before the chorus. For example, the way every chorus gets more and more intense each time it appears in the song or the subtle addition of tubular bells to the blazing metalness - like on \\"Script for My Requiem\\" where bells chime alongside racing metal speed just before the final chorus kicks in (hang on to your chair). The complexity of the vocal arrangements, particularly on \\"Past and Future Secret\\", creates a lush effect alongside reeds and flutes and orchestral percussion with a modally-based acoustic guitar figure. In the solo section of \\"And the Story Ends\\", a brief shakti-like acoustic widdle appears with great effect (even if only for a matter of seconds - it's the little touches that often makes songs great).<br /><br />> for any good album experience the first and last tracks are essential - the best albums often have both a killer opening and a killer finale. Here, the title track and \\"And the Story Ends...\\" are two of the best metal songs...EVER!!!<br /><br />> _Imaginations from the Other Side_ straddles the line between Blind Guardian's earlier, thrashy fantasy-power metal and their later albums of bombastic fantasy melodrama with hundreds of vocal tracks on each song. The mix is awesome and makes for their tightest album all together. There is good variety on the album - breathless power metal at top speed, like \\"I'm Alive\\", \\"Script\\", \\"Born in a Mourning Hall\\", and \\"Another Holy War\\"; a gorgeous, GORGEOUS ballad \\"Past and Future Secret\\", two epic progressive metal tracks opening and closing the album, and atmospheric mid-tempo rockers \\"Mordred's Song\\" and \\"Bright Eyes\\".<br /><br />I have gone from actually disliking this band to owning almost all their albums, and I think I could write a book about how good they are. Highest recommendation for anyone who likes metal!metal songs...EVER!!!    > _Imaginations from the Other Side_ straddles the line between Blind Guardian's earlier, thrashy fantasy-power metal and their later albums of bombastic fantasy melodrama with hundreds of vocal tracks on each song.

The writing is of the highest quality. The writer is clearly a woman who knows what she likes and likes putting pen to paper. I went to bed planning to read one chapter and couldn't put it down. I've searched the net for more books by the same authoress and sadly I can't find any. I just hope Chloe's on another erotic adventure and will write about it when she comes back down to earth.

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|This is hard rock with so many different guitar grooves it's pure craziness.  Almost every song changes beats and grooves several times.  Awesome Baby!!!!!! <br /> <br />Wolfmother sounds like Wolfmother.  Hard core rock and roll! <br />But I will give you some comparisons just for the fun of it. <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin <br />White Stripes <br />Black Sabbath <br />Rush (the harder stuff) <br />Deep Purple <br /> <br />I would say Wolfmother doesn't sound like any of these bands by themselves.  But if all 5 of these bands were melded together, it would be somewhat close.  You could even add a little Jethro Tull (the good harder stuff), a portion of AC/DC, Kansas, & maybe a little Triumph. EVEN With some of these 70's comparisons, it still sounds fresh!  <br /> <br />But I think Wolfmother is definitely their own band. <br /> <br />My Fav's. <br /> <br />DIMENSION: Starts off with a scream for the ages.  Hard RNR <br /> <br />WOMAN: Very catchy WOMAN! <br /> <br />APPLE TREE: Yea, sounds like hard White Stripes, & that is good! <br /> <br />COLOSSAL: Big anthem sound. <br /> <br />WHITE UNICORN: Nice mix of mid guitar sound to hard anthem style <br />  <br />WITCHCRAFT: Page style riff & also adds a Tull sounding part. <br />   <br />TALES: Slow to very cool faster part(my fav. sound on the cd) <br />  <br />LOVE TRAIN: What a guitar groove! Very infectious!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Andrew Stockdale could easily become one of my favorite singers ever. He will need more material before I can give him that honor. He could join ROBERT PLANT, EDDIE VEDDER, JACK WHITE, KEVN KINNEY, TORI AMOS, & ANTHONY KIEDIS (AK'S LAST 3 CD'S ANYWAY).
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Phantom of the Opera, is one of my favorite movies EVER!!  The songs are great, the characters are amazing, and the actors and actresses themselves made this movie awesome.  I've watched this movie more times than I have fingers, so that goes to show how much I love it.  This is the only movie that I've bought with my own money, + the soundtrack.<br /><br />  Patrick Wilson is amazing.  I love his smooth voice when he sings, and these confused looks he gets on his face when he talks to Christine about the Phantom. Should've been nominated for Best Supporting Actor somewhere, even if not the Oscars.<br /><br />  Emmy Rossum is absolutely fantastic in this movie.  At the age of sixteen she absolutely showed that she has one of the brightest futures in Hollywood right now.  She totally stole the show.  Her voice is so powerful, and you can feel how frightened she is as she sings and speaks of the Phantom. I love that girl!!<br /><br />  Gerard Butler is the most amazingly talented, (plus amazingly hot), actor that I have seen from this century so far.  You can feel his emotions when he sings the songs even when you are only listening to the soundtrack.  When you see it on screen, it totally rips my heart out to see his eyes, his tears and his love for Christine.  If it were up to me, I would've given him some recognition for his splendid take on the misunderstood Phantom.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who enjoys a good musical, and possibly a good cry, too.  100 out of 10 stars for me!!
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|How did I miss out on watching Return to Oz when I was a kid?!?  Oh my freaking poop nuggets!  I am so speechless, well sort of.  When we started watching this flick last night I was instantly in love.  This is the best Oz movie (in terms of translation from the original material), if not one of the most interesting kids movies of the 80's, and it was freaking made by Disney.  How the hell did that happen?<br /><br />First off Return to Oz was one of the darkest children's movies I've ever seen.  Between the opening of the film where Dorthy is set to have electroshock therapy to cure her of her Oz fantasies, to the amazingly dark and well done practical effects of the post Emerald City Oz, this movie never fails to disturb or be interesting.  The puppetry for a lot of the main characters was done by the Henson Company, or at least Brian Henson and friends, so the Tick Tok Man, Jack the Pumpkin Man, and the chicken (no Toto on this adventure folks) are astounding.  This movie feels like the secret love baby of Time Bandits and Edward Scissorhands with a dash of Hellraiser to boot.<br /><br />This is the kind of kid's movie Neil Gaiman would write, and honestly I just can't believe it exists.  If nothing else, it goes a long way to showing how the main actress Fairuza Balk turned out to be the gothed out crazy person she appears to be.<br /><br />There are so many cool things in the film, from a headless witch who has an entire room of spare heads to choose from, to a reanimated moose head that just want to be dead, to underground rock Gnome kingdoms full of amazing claymation.<br /><br />Do youself a favor, if you have never seen this film and are a fan of either Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, or Neil Gaiman, buy this movie.  You will not be disapointed.
B0000019PA|5.0|this is quite simply an incredible album. if you are wondering whether you should get this or not you should ask yourself if you like music full of passion and emotion? If the answer is yes, then this is most definitely for you. <br /> <br />while you may be hooked after the first line, the rest of the album can be difficult to digest upon the first few listens. however, if you keep listening with a close ear this album is so rewarding. Like mentioned many times, the voice at first can sound somewhat off, but after a while you are able to appreciate the wonderful sounds that it produces. few artists are able to share their hope and despair through their voice so flawlessly. when jeff mangum sings, you are not only able to hear what he is saying--but also feel it. <br /> <br />another great thing about the album that is seldom seen these days is the continuity of the songs as parts of a whole album. there is not a bad track in this album. all of them flow extremely well together and while a couple are notably weaker than others, they are far from \\"filler\\". <br /> <br />if you are looking for some quirky pop music you should look elsewhere! this is a deep venture into tales of loss and tragedy that will leave you floored each and every time. <br /> <br />top 5 tracks <br />Aeroplane Over the Sea <br />Oh Comely <br />Two Headed Boy <br />Two Headed Boy Pt 2 <br />King of Carrot Flowers Pt 1
B00005NRO3|5.0|The first Scream was fine, very cool, with scenes that could scare you to death...great.. The third and last Scream was maybe the worst, a little too predictable and boring sometimes, plus funny in other scenes. But this one, Scream 2, is the most terrifying of all them. The ways Ghostface appears are very horrifying, and you literally are on the edge of your seat the whole time....<br /><br />One thing I have to mention is that the music they used in this movie was perfect. In a horror film, the music helps a lot, to remark the suspense, and that works amazingly good in this movie. Maybe the scene that scares the most is the one in which Sydney is at the theatre....with Ghostface chasing her. That scene is great!<br /><br />The whole movie is great!, I hadrly recommend this movie, and this is not one of those trilogies in which you must see the first part otherwise you won't understand anything, that doesn't happen with Scream. If you want to see a good quality horror film, see Scream 2.<br /><br />Greetings from Chile :)

B000BNX3B4|2.0|ok, I've watched movies for decades, and this is the first time I've ever been irked enough to write a review here.  I wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching this dreck, because I thought there was no way a romantic comedy with Diane Lane and John Cusack could suck.  Man was I wrong.    I've liked Cusack in just about everything he's done, but he was horrible in this one.  He seemd wooden and uninspired, like he was just walking through his lines in some movie he really didn't think was ever going to make it to distribution (now there's an idea).  God, I hope he hasn't hit the same wall Chevy Chase hit- you know, brilliant genius until suddenly everything looks forced, fake, and not funny.    Dermitt Mulroney's performance was eerily similar.  It was like they both hadn't acted in a long time and were just shaking off the cob webs for a few scenes.    I did give it 2 stars, but only because of Diane Lane who is just gorgeous and does her best with a crappy everything, Elizabeth Perkins who is always great, and Stockard Channing.  I must admit there are some pretty funny lines and even a moment or two I laughed out loud.    Oh yeah, and whoever called it \\"Chick Flick by the numbers,\\" is exactly right.  The ridiculous coincidence followed by her sudden realization that Cusack's the one, then (sorry for the spoiler here) she jumps into the river to catch him so she can profess her undying love and affection?  I so wish I'd read the reviews here before watching this, even if it was for \\"free\\" on HBO.  I really want that 2 hours back.

B000002BVN|2.0|As Michael Jackson ventured on the second leg of the HIStory World Tour in 1997, the EP Blood On The Dancefloor was released perhaps in order to capitalize on Jackson's success in Europe. His HIStory album had experienced enormous success in Europe, yet America did not embrace the album as warmly as Europe had. Jackson's popularity in Europe was cemented as the first single Blood On The Dancefloor reached no. 1 on the English single chart, while the album enjoyed success in both England and the rest of Europe. <br /> <br />Blood On The Dancefloor is mainly to be regarded as an EP or a remix album, consisting of 5 ordinary songs and 8 remixes. The title track and the first single Blood On The Dancefloor is a funky up-tempo song with a fusion of keyboard and teasing synthesizers. Despite being released as the opening single, the song was hardly among Jackson's finest material. In fact, Blood On The Dancefloor even sounded dated in 1997 and it has certainly not aged very well. I always found that the song bore a resemblance to the Dangerous album in terms of sound. Perhaps the material on the Blood on the Dancefloor album was written for that particular album or during the same time period. However, the gruelling theme continues as the song Morphine reveals a character completely obsessed with the drug. The soft and hunting verses are a contrast to the sturdier choruses, yet surprisingly it works quite well. Superfly Sister is Michael Jackson's attempt to simulate Prince; however the repetitive, dull baseline is an unwelcome addition. Similar to the lead single, Superfly Sister suffers from the syndrome of ¨dated-ness¨. Ghosts and Is It Scary are enjoyable songs; however they are not among Jackson's greatest works. Notably, Is It Scary is a lovely track especially due to the shift between the soft verses and the tougher choruses. I considered it the best song among the 5 ordinary songs on the album. The remaining 8 songs/remixes are a Tour De Force of dance remixes.Generally, I do not like remixes, however the remix of 2 Bad, Scream-Louder and HIStory are not half-bad. Yet the remixes of the remaining songs leave a lot to be desired. <br /> <br />Blood On The Dancefloor is primarily an indulgence for hardcore Michael Jackson fans. The few ordinary songs are pleasant, however they are not on par with Michael Jackson's back-catalogue. If you like remixes in generally, I am positive the remixes on the album would surely appeal to you. If you have recently discovered Michael Jackson's music, I would advise you to purchase Number Ones or The Essential Michael Jackson in order to fully grasp the back-catalogue of Jackson. <br /> <br />Overall Grade: 4.0/10 <br /> <br />

0805066349|5.0|Carry this book around and people will like you. When people see it they'll blurt out \\"Indians!\\" with glee. And if you actually read the damn thing that's even better. If you did you'd learn about Chief Joseph who didn't want the white man's churches. Unfortunately, white men like churches and there were more white men around. You'll learn about Siting Bull who liked to stare into the sun, cut himself and bleed until he saw cool stuff. You'll learn about Indians and white men cutting out female genitals and wearing them on their heads to piss each other off. You'll learn about Indians cutting open animals and sticking babies inside so that the  babies wouldn't freeze to death. You'll get a bunch of cool pictures of Indian men who like to wear their hair long like girls. Don't those silly Indians know that men are supposed to have short hair like it says in the Bible? Don't they know that the Great Spirit Chief is a silly fairy tale and that the ancient Hebrew god Yahweh (commonly translated as \\"God\\") is real and is gonna send all those unrepetant Indians to Hell to burn forever and ever? Don't those silly Indians want to go to Heaven and be with the blond haired blue eyed Jesus and all his pasty white followers who forced all the silly Indians off of their land and killed them for their own damn good? No? Really. Then should we Americans humble ourselves and learn from the Indians? Yes.
B00005JOQS|4.0|So I take Morty to see Superman. He always loved Richard Pryor before he set fire to that warehouse in Waco, Texas. SO Morty wants popcorn. I say, \\"Morty, it'll get stuck in your teeth, and I'll have to take your teeth to the ladies room to rinse them out\\". <br />Well sure enough, popcorn gets stuck between his gums and his teeth. He starts making a sucking noise. In an attempt to not bother anyone, he put his head down low in my lap as he tried to misplace the popcorn from his tooth. <br />No telling what those kids behind us thought when he lowered hsi head and started making sucky noises. BTW Morty is in a wheelchair so we have to park him in the aisle. <br />After the movie, Morty took his lap blanket and tied it around his neck to make a cape as he sped down the aisle. <br />Ay ay ay.
0380788624|5.0|This is a wonderful, excellent, witty, engaging, intriguing (etc.) book.  I wasn't sure what to expect of it when I picked it up.  But, I immediately loved it.  Since there are tons of positive reviews here, I'll just focus on one aspect of the book that I found really fascinating:  the characterizations.  Normally, in these multi-threaded books, the separate characters are fairly similar in how they behave.  Usually, they differ only in their goals and attitudes.  In this book, the three main characters are entirely different in how they even SEE the world.  They each have filters on their perceptions that are sharply in contrast with the others' and really cause you to think about what they're doing.  As an added bonus, this way of thinking leads to some pretty hilarious scenes.  I don't think I've ever run across a better set of characterizations in a book. <br /> <br />As for negatives, they're minor.  First, in a couple of places, Stephenson gets a bit pedantic expaining some of the technology involved.  Those who already understand it are just bored and those who don't understand it probably don't care.  Second, I have a nagging feeling that the final disposition of things at the end will just lead to lawsuits instead of a happily-ever-after moment.  But, these are mere quibbles.  I just thought I should try to balance the rest of my glowing review. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this book and give it an Excellent 5 stars out of 5 rating.
B000EULJLU|5.0|this album flows. it can't really be looked at in pieces, i think. ebb and flow. give and take from one 'song' to the next and even within each song. <br /> <br />tool will always be tagged as 'hard', but they are more than that. this is performance of \\"jamming\\" proportions... they seem to catch a mood and go with it, building each song in an almost ad lib, free-will sort of way.  <br /> <br />laterlus was good - it broke them out of the realm of radio obscurity - but it should not be the standard by which to measure tool. undertow and aenima were even more solid and definitive than laterlus. i think 10,000 days does well by any standard. <br /> <br />10,000 days (wings pt. II) is perhaps, one of the best tool songs i've heard. i wish it went on for 112 minutes. this album has got me wanting to see them live agian - something I haven;t been motivated to do in quite somer time. <br /> <br />whatever. great album.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|-- the whole thing is fantastic... the best performance and show I have ever seen in my entire life [...the stones and rush follow in my list]...<br /><br />... i've been watching a bootlegged dvd for so long now --probably transferred from the VHS tape, with excellent sound though... but this is the REAL thing... the extras, design, packaging and else, all is great!<br /><br />... i saw this concert twice, live, at Mexico City and at Syracuse, NY, awsome... always!<br /><br />... what is left to be said [while we wait now for the \\"delicate sound of thunder\\" disc]?<br /><br />... well, YES mr. gilmour, you should have recorded this one on film [to get my full 5 star rating]... cheers anyway!
B000093BDX|5.0|This is a great driving disc in fairly constant rotation in our car's CD player. It may not please the Beach Boys purists out there, but it's perfect for casual fans and people (like me) too young to recall the entire albums from which these hits are drawn. Pop it in your CD player and sing along!
B000002ADT|5.0|At least to me, Miles's record is heavy headache music.    Because it is not only hard but also so bored.    I don't know theoretically about the Jazz.    Miles's music is not delightful and joyous just like Horace Silver, Lee Morgan and many hard-bop sound.     But obviously, Miles's music is really deep and profound.  I must have many times until understanding this simple fact.      I don't understand completely the meaning and value of the Kind Of Blue yet.    So I have been careful when I have talked about the this sopiscated piece to the others to be interested concerning the Jazz.    But just one thing, that I can tell you certainly about this headache piece, it is that 'Kind Of Blue' have so beautiful and melodical tunes.     That is the reason why I should recommend this record.    You must have need to show patience.     ...If you want to get a taste of 'Kind Of Blue' ultimately.    I had heard Rock & Roll and contemporary instrumental before I have fallen into the Jazz World.    For sure, there is no superiority or inferiority to music.    But if you don't fall into the jazz yet like me before, I want that to happen to you through the 'Kind Of Blue'.     ...may have need some (or much) patience...
0060512806|4.0|This sprawling, joky book is surprisingly successful.  Stephenson is all over the map (literally) with a set of complex plots set during both WWII and the present.  Codes and the nature of useful algorithms are recurrent themes of the book, as is the clever use of enjoyable conspiracy theories.  Stephenson writes with real verve, gleefully bringing in real historical personages like the great Alan Turing and manufacturing a wide variety of fictional historical characters and locations.
B00003CX9S|5.0|The Elephant Man is the true story of John Merrick who suffered from degenerative genetic diseases that deformed most of his body.  Merrick was a side show freak call the Elephant Man.  One night he is discovered by Dr. Frederick Treves.  Treves decided to make his pet project.  What Treves did not expect is Merrick's ability to assimilate information. <br /> <br />Soon Merrick becomes the toast of British Society but the hospital did not like the publicity.  In a great scene the Queen's sister comes to the hospital and forces the board to accept Merrick as a resident. <br /> <br />But Merrick's \\"owner\\" is not happy about losing his cash cow and kidnaps Merrick and takes him to the continent.  With some help, Merrick escapes back to London.  Though he is a society darling, the common man is not so welcoming.  This leads to the famous \\"I am not an animal, I am a man\\" scene. <br /> <br />In the end, Merrick cannot cope with his dual role in society and just wants to be normal. <br /> <br />John Hurt gives a stunning performance as Merrick.  He captures his torment and gives him dimensions under layers of make-up.  Hopkins was not a major star yet but this film shows his future abilities.  Rounding out the cast is Anne Bancroft as the actress who takes an interest in Merrick, John Gielguld as head of the hospital and Wendy Hiller as the head nurse. <br /> <br />This film propelled David Lynch into the forefront of the new wave of directors of the 80's.   <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS:  <br />Making of Featurette - retrospective cast and crew interviews.  This is a fascinating look at the making of this masterpiece. <br /> <br />Behind the look at the make up design - this is also a great featurette on how the make up effects were created for the film. <br /> <br />Narrated Picture Gallery - this is not a standard photo gallery but a photo gallery showing the make up design that is narrated by designer Christopher Tucker. <br />
B00004Y6OA|5.0|When I had vinyl record albums this was my very first Van Halen Album. I played it so much I just about wore it out. This is One of Van Halen's finest. This is their third album and their best ever. The guitar lick at the beginning of And The Cradle Will Rock is awsome. Then it goes right into Everybody Wants Some with some great guitar work. My favotite song on the CD is Take Your Whiskey Home. Wow how we used to party to this song. All in All there is not a bad song on this CD. There are only nine songs but what a huge sound of great music. I like David Lee Roth better with Van Halen than when he sung solo. Van Halen is probably the best Rock & Roll Band Of All time in my opinion.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|My husband and I do not own many movies, but this is one we bought right away.  It is the type of movie that you need to see more than once to absorb all the intricate details.  If you enjoyed movies like \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Memento\\" because of the non-linear progression of time, you will love this film. <br /> <br />I was skeptical of an Aston Kutcher movie because of his previous silly comedies like \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\", but he is a first rate dramatic actor in this film. <br /> <br />The infinifilm features are also fun if you enjoy things like deleted scenes and \\"what was the director thinking?\\" type explanations. <br /> <br />Love it!
B000002KB8|4.0|Black Sabbath's eponymous debut album should be considered a cornerstone for most collectors and students of hard rock. At a time when most bands laced their albums with songs of varying tempos, moods, and style, Black Sabbath laid down a bedrock sound that spews atmosphere and eschews melody.<br /><br />Pummeling drums, driving, grunge bass, howling guitar outbursts, and vocals from hell render listeners into a heavy metal stupor. Themes of black magic, supernatural encounters, and doom and gloom leave one with profoundly sweet sense of dread and uneasiness. This recording remains a fine example of how a fresh, genre-spawning direction came into its own.
0061122092|3.0|I picked up this novel shortly after reading Coelho's best work, 'The Alchemist'. Again, I was shocked by the author's ability to present difficult concepts with such simplicity. 'By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept' is a novel about insecurity, love, trust, and faith. The main character, Pilar, struggles with her love for a friend who she believes does not love her. Intertwined in this conflict is Coelho's point of view towards the female attributes of a mostly male dominant Christian God- a concept that is discussed heavily as a subplot.<br /><br />The novel opens with Pilar at the banks of the River Piedra. She is writing this novel which, as the reader finds out, narrates the details of her ruined love life. Pilar bemoans her fate and begins telling the reader of the journey that led her to find the solace of the river bank. Referring to her lover as \\"He\\", Pilar tells how her childhood friend became a powerful figure in the Catholic Church and a miraculous healer of both bodies and souls. When He invites Pilar to attend one of his conferences in Madrid, she learns that He not only speaks of the feminine side of God but also confesses his unending love for her.<br /><br />Hesitant to accept his love and believing herself unworthy of it, Pilar continuously changes the subject when it becomes too emotional for her to bear. However, her love for Him prompts her to accept his invitation and tour Spain with him, and thus begins a feverish journey of self-discovery, spiritual reawakening, and rekindled love. The ever-changing spiral of her travels is both heart-wrenching and uplifting as Pilar retells the story of a love that could surpass all religious doctrines if she would only give it the chance.<br /><br />Although a great read for romantics everywhere and an interesting prerspective change for religious, I am saddened to admit that 'By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept' is not as strong a novel in characterization, plot, and conclusion as 'The Alchemist'- hence the three stars. Pilar at times appears whiney and childish, and her claims of not being loved do get old. Although I enjoy Coelho's style and do admit that there is some highlighting to be done in this book, I suggest you take this as a light read- something to munch on while you wait for 'The Zahir' to come out in paperback.ist'- hence the three stars.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|Long awaited arrival on DVD did not disappoint.  This is by far the greatest racing movie ever made.  The extras are a great addition and tell the story behind the movie as well as Formula 1 racing in the 60's, which many consider the heyday of the sport.  If you enjoy racing or are interested in the history of motor sports, or like great cinematography, get this movie.

B000F3TBIO|4.0|I have had this album for approximately a month now, and my opinion of it has changed markedly.  When I first picked it up, I was intensely disappointed with it.  It was hyped as a \\"pop\\" album, which to most people means that it ought to be immediately accessible.  Peeping Tom isn't.  \\"Mojo\\" is the most immediately accessible song on the album (and is the perfect choice for a lead single), the rest by and large take time.  A few of the tracks still haven't caught on, and I don't really expect them to.  \\"Celebrity Death Match\\" is totally inane, as is \\"The Getaway\\" - both boring tracks that ought to be forgotten.  \\"We're not alone\\", \\"How You Feelin'\\", \\"Don't Even Trip\\", \\"Neighborhood Spaceman\\", \\"Play Me\\", \\"Caipirinha\\" and (to a lesser extent) \\"Sucker\\" have all improved quite a bit with subsequent listens.   <br /> <br />This is not a \\"pop\\" album.  People need to remember that everything is relative.  Relative to Patton's other work, it seems pop - but relative to what's on the radio, it still seems bizarre and obscure.  This is Mike Patton after all, not Britney Spears (though Patton does say \\"oops I did it again\\" at the end of \\"mojo\\" - coincidence?).  That said, this is a fun CD.  It's not the masterpiece that Mr. Bungle's \\"California\\" is, but its also not nearly as unlistenable as much of the Fantomas stuff has been.  I would describe the music as alternative electronica (if such a thing exists) or maybe electro-alternative.  Most of the instrumentation is synth, and when guitars do show up, they're usually distorted.  The synth-work on many of these tracks is interesting, and carries with it the darkness/\\"creep factor\\" that seems to go along with most of Patton's work.  Patton's vocal work is, as always, impressive, but again, not his greatest work ever.  Anyone hoping for him to sing like he did with Faith No More will probably be a little disappointed (the exception being \\"We're Not Alone\\"), as will those hoping for a Mr. Bungle-esque clinic in falsetto.  This issomewhere in between. <br /> <br />This is a fun CD that is great music to blast in one's car while driving around town.  Don't expect it to hit you immediately, however.  As with all things Patton that I've yet seen (and most other finer things in life), Peeping Tom takes time to grow on you.
0451196716|3.0|The whole concept of this book I found to be fascinating. Walk or you die.  I wanted more.  I wanted more of a conclusion.  I am sure I missed some deeper meaning King was trying to get across but having the \\"winner\\" end it the way they did just left me with a want.  I stayed up late to finish this book and this is what I got??!!!  I was not happy ! <br />
B000093BDX|4.0|This is a very good compilation of the great Beach Boys songs.  However, like  with most compilations, usually some songs have been omitted.  I was disappointed that the beautiful song, \\"Warmth of the Sun\\" was omitted and the song, \\"Be True to Your school\\" was included!  Can't understand how the \\"School\\" song fits in with Summer music.  Also, \\"All Summer Long\\" was omitted.  It is still worth the money and a worthwhile addition to your Beach Boys collection.
630460288X|4.0|Later in the 21st Century, the meek truly have inherited the earth. There's no crime, and sex is done by virtual reality. There's no exchange of 'bodily fluids' -ick!<br /><br />Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), a criminal frozen in the 20th Century, escapes in the 21st Century and goes on a crime spree. John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), a top cop also frozen in the 20th Century, is thawed out to catch him. Police Lt Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) is assigned as cop John Spartan's Chaparone.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock does a good job playing a polite eager lady of the 21st Century. She has an interest in the 20th Century so she's quicker to recognize violence or intimidation than her cop peers, even doing a karate move, which she laters explains come from, &#34;watching a Jackie Chan movie&#34;. She's playing a nice girl who carries a big stick I guess. Later in another movie, 'Miss Congeniality', Bullock would play a tough cop, undercover as a nice beauty contestant. Sandra Bullock has a nice performance in Demolition Man. Bullock is this movie. This is a SF movie tho, where everything that is up is down, and where sometimes movie makers seem to comment on apparently taboo issues of the present. Bullock received only a 'Razzie' award for her role here.<br /><br />It turns out, the head honcho in the 21st Century, Dr Raymond Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne), actually released criminal Simon Pheonix on purpose - so he'd cause mayhem and give the goverment an excuse to further control peoples lives (which could seem strange considering there's no crime, littering or violence already). One thing about the future is the same - behind the scenes there's a rich powerful bad guy who is really the cause of all evil. When do the forces of evil just come out and tell you their plan right to your face? In one scene Wesley Snipes character says something like, offhandedly, &#34;Eh, people have always been afraid of me&#34;. Dr. Cocteau replies with, 'Yes, but now they are really terrified! Now we can build a society of such order that has never been seen before . . . '<br /><br />I was entertained by Demolition Man and probably in love with Sandra Bullock, but, near the very end, I couldn't help but wonder, 'is this what is going on right now'? Are crime and violence being fostered by the powers that be in order that they be allowed further control over our lives?
1401206905|3.0|Batman: Year One narrates the origins of Bruce Wayne's conscious decision to becoming the Dark Knight.  In this comic, the reader is introduced to familiar characters such as Selina Kyle, the future Commissioner Gorden, and Falconi (the same gangster from the Batman Begins movie). <br /> <br />Batman: Year One is the first \\"true\\" American comic I've read.  My own history of comics is related to mindlessly flipping through the pages of my brother's Ghost Rider and Terminator series, and my own collection of shojo manga.  My first exposure to the Western comic mainstream was not American by whole, as I was first introduced to Alan Moore prior to any of the American comic geniuses such as Stan Lee and Bob Kane.  As a first-time reader of American comics, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised, but found myself wanting more out of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One.  For starters, I am comparing the comic to Batman Begins, as the movie was inspired by some of the parts in the comic.  I feel the movie does a better job showing and explaining the origin's of Brue Wayne's endeavor to becoming the Dark Knight.  Such as how he got the car, made his Batarangs, etc. If the reader had no previous knowledge of where Bruce gets all his toys and how he makes them, they would not have known how he got them in the first place.  Which must drive the Joker crazy to know that Batman's toys are better than his! <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE:  Batman: Year One is my first exposure to American comics, as I have always considered myself a Manga reader.  I am pleasantly surprised by the depth of the story and the development of the characters.  There are a few plotholes in the story, specifically with how Bruce gets his car and how he makes his weapons, as they were shown in the movie Batman Begins.  What Frank Miller's Batman: Year One does successfully, however, is prick my interest in wanting to read more American comics.  My next read is Batman Hush by Jeph Loeb, with artwork by Jim Lee. <br/>

B000BNX3B4|3.0|I'm a big John Cusack fan, and only slightly less so of Diane Lane (and only slightly less so, Christopher Plummer).<br /><br />\\"Must Love Dogs\\" is a good enough flick. Not real deep, and it's a comedic drama (or dramatic comedy), so it's not quite the grins and giggles depicted in the trailers and previews (which is fine with me).<br /><br />It's more Lane's movie than Cusack's, but it's got a lot of heart, does a good job showing the pain and awkwardness of post-divorce dating in a compressed space, and has some good relational dialog (a particularly good scene between Lane's Sarah Holan and Plummer's father (Bill) characters was unfortunately cut from the film, but is available in the DVD extended features).<br /><br />I'm also incredibly encouraged by Dermot Mulroney, who works hard, often, and solidly in every film in which I've seen him (at least since Young Guns).<br /><br />The movie has a couple of hokey sentimental moments that detract from the story, but they're brief, and at least are entertaining in their own right.<br /><br />Overall, a worthwhile film, if only for the top-notch caliber of talent.
B000AWYOGE|3.0|Not a memorable story - however the old hi-rise rent controlled apartment building where the characters struggled to exist is worthy of Franz Kafka.  A smile button manager (John C. Reilly) ushers the occasional new tenant into this dark, gloomy deteriorating monolith where a bedraggled maintenance man tries to exact a bribe from tenants when something must be fixed.  If anything costs money - the great invisible corporate presence from above just says no. Best of all - doing a load of laundry in the dungeon/basement costs $1.50!
B000F0UUT6|5.0|Of all the Jane Austen movies, the 1996 miniseries \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is arguably the best and most detailed. While remaining faithful to the original comedy of manners, the story remains steadily-paced and exceptionally acted. It's sort of a thinking-girl's romance movie.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter) moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to eldest Jane (Susannah Harker). But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie (Jennifer Ehle) immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), who scorns the rural village.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships arrive, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham (Adrian Lukis), who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia (Julia Sawalha) elopes with Wickham! The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie.<br /><br />It's obvious from the very first scenes -- when Lizzie jokingly comments that \\"a man of good fortune MUST be in want of a wife\\" -- that this is an adaptation that was done with love. The subplots, characters and atmosphere of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" are all here.<br /><br />The plot unfolds slowly, one piece at a time, but with several subplots that tie together as the story progresses. For a miniseries, it's actually rather spare and lacking in filler. And the dialogue -- based on Austen's -- is wonderfully well-written (\\"Beauty is not the only virtue. She has just inherited a fortune of ten thousand pounds, I understand.\\" \\"Now THAT is a definite virtue!\\")<br /><br />The time period is recreated with loving detail, from the muddy roads to the sweeping mansions with elaborate grounds. Even the hairstyles are recreated. And the entire plot is steeped in the mores of 19th-century England, with the attitudes toward marriage, love, and propriety that bound everyone (especially women).<br /><br />The casting of the leads is absolutely perfect for this movie: Ehle and Firth are nothing short of amazing. Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways. Firth's Darcy is a selfish man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Ehle's Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />They're also backed by an excellent supporting cast, with slimy clergy, screeching moms, sly seducers, sardonic fathers, innocent sisters and aristocratic old harpies adding colour to it all. Sawalha is especially good as the 19th-century Valley Girl, and Alison Steadman gives a grating but suitable performance as the whiny, marriage-obsessed Mrs. Bennett.<br /><br />This edition has a bunch of extras for the rabid Austenite -- a \\"making of\\" book, documentaries about Austen and the miniseries itself, and interviews with the people responsible. It's a nicely-rounded addition that will take a look at how both the book and movies came to be.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the cream of the Austen crop, and an understatedly romantic movie as well. Definitely to be watched, again and again.tand.\\" \\"Now THAT is a definite virtue!\\")  <br /> <br />The time period is recreated with loving detail, from the muddy roads to the sweeping mansions with elaborate grounds.

B00005B4GU|5.0|I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical and apprehensive about this album. Just like many Radiohead albums lately, expect the unexpected. They always come out with a sound so eccentritic and out of this world that it's scary, but in a good way. Regardless of how less accessible Radiohead's music has become, you have to give credit for their immensive creativity, eclectic and innovative sound and style, and most importantly, their mission at never compromising with anybody. Their music is their statement, their art, the way they want it without restraint. I found that to truly appreciate Radiohead today you have to listen to their albums more than once, embracing the new sounds that we've never heard from anybody else, realizing how lucky the music business is to have at least one truly great band out there amongst the superficial crap we get from the talentless popstars and over the top punk rockers. Also, the more you listen, the more you admire Thom Yorke's voice, which is always changing, surprising, and experimenting with his vocals, along with the always changing, surprising, and experimental band mates. This is what real music is all about. Listen it to more than once to appreciate this album. Once you do, it's really worth it.
B000F39MAQ|4.0|This production gets mixed reviews, partly because of its modern and stark stage design. But unlike the recent 2004 production from La Fenice which also has a contemporary setting, this one works for me because the chemistry is great between the two stars and the director allows their relationship to bloom.  Anna Netrebko has the most remarkable voice - rich, creamy, and dusky. If you like seeing two lovers light up the TV screen, you'll love this production. Assuming she takes care of it, Netrebko's voice should only get better, but I didn't feel that her interpretation of Violetta was as nuanced and deep as others I've seen (perhaps she's just too young); but oh, can she sing.<br /><br />Rolando Villazon is wonderfully expressive as Alfredo and has a rich tenor voice. He pays careful attention to phrasing which makes his Alfredo sound fresh in interpretation. He flails a bit too much around the stage  though (strangely enough, a criticism leveled at Netrebko in her recent performance in \\"Don Pasquale\\" at The Met). Thomas Hampson sings well as Germont, but was a bit stiff in the role; odd for a performer who is often criticized for being too much of a ham onstage.<br /><br />Bottom line, don't miss the chance to see two superstars in the making.
B000FVQYYK|2.0|this album sounds like half 'absolution' b-side leftovers and half new dancemuse songs.  that is my honest opinion.  my guess is they are striking the iron while it is hot and wanted to get something (anything) out as fast as they could.   so they took the leftovers and the new ones and put em together.  that said, there are some fine tracks here.  but a half great album is not a great album.  despite my 2* rating, i do recommend this album for the dancemuse songs.  not my favorite direction, but they are great tracks.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|There are some things in life that I know when I see them, I just have to have for all time. I want them around for the rest of my life... and now that my beloved Everwood has come to a close, I would like WB to release the rest of the episodes on DVD. Everwood has made me laugh, ponder, cry, and taken me right through so many parallel situations to my own life in the storyline, sometimes it was freaky. My heart would soar or shatter with each character's trials or triumphs. I need this show for all time. Release the last seasons please. Impatiently awaiting - Heather Franz
0060977493|3.0|I caught a glimpse of the first line of this book at a bookshop and I was hooked. But it won't be months later until I finally get to devour the entire novel. I wasn't wrong. I knew the book would be unforgettable. Because days after reading it, here I am , still disturbed--both frustrated yet madly infatuated with the book.<br /><br />I am in love with: the twins, Rahel and Estha, their youth and innocence slowly being surrounded by the madness of adult world. The story, though it seemed to be focused on them, actually skips to every character in the book (no person is missed), and just when you are about to be engrossed on this or that character's story, like a spotlight gone amock, the story again re-focuses to either the twins, or to a different person.<br /><br />I love the unusual simple narration, the use of 'titling' some words Like This and at times joiningthem atthehip is pretty amusing. The characters make a good combination actually. Twins that are inseperable, their single mother who loves them in a realistic way, the grandmother who spoils their uncle who was schooled in Oxford and loves to quote novels here and there, their grand aunt who seems to be a half baked antagonist.<br /><br />I love how the characters do not fall into stereotypes. There is an abundance of tastefully placed political and social puns in the narration.<br /><br />Too much detail, no matter how beautifully written sometimes overpowers a good plot. At times, I felt lost in the beautiful poetic jungle of details. Just when the story is about to be 'cooked' right in front of your eyes (and you are looking forward to it), a sudden chopping board-full of lush cool greens are doused into the pot, delaying the climax yet again. She seemes to be plucking at a beautiful fruit when its just 3/4 ripe.<br /><br />Storytelling is an art, and many writers use various techniques. Such is the time travelling style. However, there is also proper(reader-friendly) use of it. Usually, this style will leave you confused, but in this book, it will leave you wanting to re-arrange chapters in the book because you know the story will flow more beautifully when told in a straight sequential line.<br /><br />Many important issues are dealt with (racism, religion, caste system, communism and child molestation) but it seemed they are just brushed in passing because of the \\"swinging spotlight\\".<br /><br />Scenes and lines still come to my mind. They are all hauntingly beautiful on their own, but somehow when you piece them together, the chemistry is not exact.t in this book, it will leave you wanting to re-arrange chapters in the book because you know the story will flow more beautifully when told in a straight sequential line. <br />Many important issues are dealt with (racism, religion, caste system, communism and child molestation) but it seemed they are just brushed in passing because of the \\"swinging spotlight\\". <br />Scenes and lines still come to my mind.

B000056N8X|4.0|`Highlander - Endgame' released in '00 brings a fitting and well-constructed conclusion to the Immortals Mythos and the adventures of the cousins MacLeod. The legacy of both Connor MacLeod as played by Christopher Lambert in the three previous Highlander films and the six season television series starring Adrian Paul as Duncan MacLeod come together in grand Highlander style. You know with those two fighting side by side its got to be good! The only question that remains to be answered is \\"Who's the One?\\"<br /><br />Also strong performances by Bruce Payne, legendary martial arts expert Donnie Yen and Peter Wingfield as Methos.<br /><br />This DVD is a must own for all Highlander fans!
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Starting in November of '05, there have been several debut releases by artists with a penchant for the traditional.  It began (to the best of my recollection) with Ray Scott's MY KIND OF MUSIC, and proceeded through albums by Jamey Johnson and Trent Tomlinson (there are probably others I'm unaware of, or have simply forgotten; my appologies).  Eric Church's SINNERS LIKE ME carries on this tradition of traditionalism, with an album that is real, pure, and unadulterated country music.<br /><br />Don't believe me?  Check out the opening number, with the classic line: \\"Jesus is gonna come back before she does.\\"  Or \\"Two Pink Lines,\\" about the anxiety two teens face waiting for pregnancy test results (\\"One means none and we're home free/Two means three and a diamond ring\\").  There's \\"Lightning,\\" about a man on his way to the electric chair; there's the heartache and regret of \\"The Hard Way,\\" \\"These Boots,\\" and \\"What I Almost Was.\\"  Even \\"Pledge Allegiance To the Hag\\" manages to remain mostly un-cheesy (the appearance made by Merle himself isn't much of a surprise, though, and a tad bit unecessary).<br /><br />SINNERS LIKE ME is a stellar country album.  Eric Church is a promising new singer/songwriter...he wrote or co-wrote all the tracks on this album, and his voice is rugged and home-grown...much like the Hag's, actually.  There is a traditional outlaw bent in the arrangement; there's a brutal honesty in the lyrics; there's a yearning in the vocals; and there's some great country music on this album.  Church may go far (his debut single, \\"How 'Bout You,\\" somehow managed to catch radio listeners' ears, an astounding feet for a traditional tune of independence), or he may not...whatever the results, he's country through and through.  God willing and any luck, he'll be a star, and help bring country music back to its roots.  Until that day, we have SINNERS LIKE ME, one of the best albums to come out yet this year.
B00005JLZN|4.0|'The Life of David Gale' released in '03 is an intriguing tale dealing with the pursuit of intellectual honesty, personal ambition and radical political activism. David Gale (Kevin Spacey) is a highly respected intellectual, author, college professor and anti-death penalty activist who's life falls apart after a unplanned sexual encounter with one of his students.<br /><br />That one brief moment of passion ends up costing him everything he holds dear. That is everything but his friendship with fellow colleage and activist Constance Harraway (Laura Linney) and their desire to give it all for their mutual cause. Eventually death and a possible murder turns out to be the end result of all their altruistic efforts.<br /><br />'The Life of David Gale' is a fascinating study in political zealotry, exploring just how far individuals will go to prove a point and promote a cause. After all, \\"almost matyrs don't count\\".<br /><br />Great performances by Spacey, Linney and Kate Winslet as Bitsey Bloom, the reporter who finally puts it all together.
B000EGCITQ|5.0|After listening to this CD, I plan on purchasing all of Pink's previous works.  This is a woman with raw talent and an amazing ability to compile a whole CD where every song is a hit.<br /><br />Now as you read this review, consider that I am a super-conservative Republican who supports George W. Bush and his administration, and that I am not judging this CD by the political slam against the president on track #5.  The greatest thing about this country is that we can state our political opinions through any medium we choose.  I don't care if Pink is a communist, which I'm sure she's not, she is a star, a musical genius, and has that scratchy, strong, and yet somehow soft voice that really causes an addiction.<br /><br />Let's look at the tracks one-by-one:<br /><br />1. Stupid Girls - Here is a song that says a lot about society.  I know she is just having fun on this song, but I think she is on to something.  The lyrics are funny and of course, as I have mentioned earlier about Pink's work, very addictive.  I don't think this is the best song on the CD, but it is a good start.<br /><br />2. Who Knew - By far the coolest song on the CD.  Pink really delivers a song that describes the heartache and pain that comes from young and faulting love.  The beat is catchy, the lyrics so life-like that almost every human being on the planet should be able to relate to this heartbreak story in a song.  The CD is worth the cost just for this song.  Pink is indeed a musical force that requires attention and recognition!<br /><br />3. Long Way To Happy - Deep lyrics with Pink showing her musical range by stretching her voice up and down the chart on this one.  It is weird how much emotion and strength she puts into this song about struggling to get back on her feet.  This fast to slow to right back to fast Track #3 is a must hear - many times.<br /><br />4. Nobody Knows - Okay, I'm not really a fan of slow songs, so when this song first came on, I almost skipped the song.  But I gave it a chance, and the longer it played, the more I enjoyed hearing Pink say \\"baby.\\"  She says it really well!  LOL<br /><br />5. Dear Mr. President - Ummm...seeing how I am a supporter of the president, I was not happy about Pink and the Indigo Girls blaming Bush for homelessness, hunger, and bad education.  Pink and IG, I am sure the President sleeps just fine.  In the same way that you believe in what you do, George W. Bush believes in what he is doing.  But I can't complain too much, after all, it is our freedom to say what we want about our leaders that makes this country great.<br /><br />6. I'm Not Dead Yet - An awesome entry that grabs the listener right into the song.  I'm not really sure what in the heck Pink is talking about on this one, but she sure keeps it fast and interesting.  All I really know is that Pink is DEFINITELY not dead yet!  Of this I'm sure.<br /><br />7. Cuz I Can - Fun, fun, and when that's done, more fun.  Wow, I can't get enough of this song.  \\"You talk real loud, but you ain't sayin' nothing cool. I can fit your whole house in my swimming pool.\\"  I love that.  I haven't seen the music video (if there is one) yet, but I bet it would be hilarious.  Pink will make ya smile on this one!<br /><br />8. Leave Me Alone - Hey, it's a Lita Ford song, but with talent.  I don't remember the song Lita Ford sang that started off like this one, but that's only the first few seconds.  This song shows another side of Pink that really delivers.  I have the cleaned up version of this song.  I really don't know why Pink throws profanity in her work.  She is so talented she sure doesn't need it for SHOCK value.  Her talent is SHOCKING enough.<br /><br />9. U & Ur Hand - Funky little tune about how Pink doesn't need any hassles.  Well, you'll see what I mean.  I think ole' boy better back off.<br /><br />10.  Runaway - a song about, you guessed it, running away.  This starts off like Pink telling a story with a little bit of background music, then it takes off a little.  The lyrics and music in this song are unpredictable and prove that PINK truly thinks about her work and doesn't just throw things together to complete a CD.<br /><br />11. The One That Got Away - Bluesy, scratchy, and a song that I would love to hear Pink sing in a small venue.  I cannot say enough good things about this song.  I like it better than Sheryl Crow's stuff.  I know Pink will think that's a stretch, but this is my review!<br /><br />12. I Got Money Now - Wow, read the lyrics, listen to the sincerity in this song.  I kinda' wish she could change this song to \\"I Got Jesus Now\\".  Yeah, it's my dream that PINK becomes a Christian music star.<br /><br />13. Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self - A moving song about the child we used to be, and what it would be like to have a chance to go back and talk to that child; to be a comfort to the pain and the worry that controlled our lives.  This is a tribute to Pink's amazing talent and hard work.<br /><br />14. I Have Seen The Rain - Pink sings a song about the Vietnam War with her dad.  It is a great way to end the CD.  I can only imagine that Jim Moore (Pink's dad) is so very proud of his daughter.  She is an amazing artist.<br /><br />See ya next review.ly thinks about her work and doesn't just throw things together to complete a CD.    11.

B00005RYL2|5.0|'Highlander' released to the theaters in '86  was an instant cult classic. And why wouldn't it be, clashing swords, severed heads, a secret society of Immortals living secretly amongst us battling to the death through the centuries in hopes of being the last Immortal standing. It doesn't get any better than that. As the sacred prophecy predicted, \\"In the end there can be only one\\". Add to the mix a killer soundtrack written and performed by Queen and you've got yourself a franchise.<br /><br />Christopher Lambert plays Connor MacLeod, the Highlander in the role that made him famous and unfortunately typecast him for all time. Be that as it may, this is his signature role and he is perfect in the part. Sean Connery is also wonderful as his best friend, mentor and fellow Immortal Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez.<br /><br />A lot of previous reviewers have already voiced their concerns about the quality of the DVD transfer. To be honest, whatever technical problems may exist with the sound quality and picture resolution, they haven't been noticable enough to me to lessen my enjoyment of this classic action/adventure.

0312305060|5.0|This novel was heartbreaking, uplifting, enraging, and empowering. I read Mrs. Dalloway in college and couldn't quite yet grasp what was being said. I read this novel as a desparate housewife of a sort, and wept. I wept for myself, for women through otu the ages. I wept for my dying spirit, and in that realization I was able to find myself again. I suspect many women have had the same reaction. In subsequent readings I've found there are some problems with the plot development, but this novel is so beautiful and so poignant that it doesn't matter.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Well, Muse, like most every other good band does, has changed. While some may not appreciate this change it is important to be open to good music. Some might also not appreciate this album because its greatness does not just jump out at you, like Absolution and Origin Of Symmetry did. Yet, this album almost rivals those two masterpieces. It does not quite have that same emotional edge; remember they are often singing about politics (which is different from singing about the end of the world or about another person). The other complaint might be the lack of the piano playing which Matt is so good at. The band has started bringing in some Spanish guitars, electronic, and some other sounds (spacey-ness? ... more spacyness) to vary their overall sound     *note I feel I am a fairly harsh scorer of songs     1. Take A Bow - This is a slow haunting song, it sort of reminds me of \\"Bliss\\". It has a crescendo and Like most Muse songs it begins to rock out a little more. Not the best song, but its message is probably about Tony Blair and friend (G.W. Bush) being evil and burning in hell; how could you not love that?   6.9/10     2. Starlight - A fairly peaceful song where the electronic and piano sounds really comes through. It has a spacey feel and spacey lyrics. This song only rocks out a little but I love its feel, it includes the line \\"black holes and revelations.\\"   8.0/10     3. Supermassive Black Hole - Muse gone dance + space rock? This song is very different from anything on the album. How could I love this pop trash? Well ... its actually kind of catchy. This overblown dramatic song sounds very little like anything Muse have done before ... although it is dramatic and overblown.   7.7/10     4. Map Of The Promblematique - Starts out with a very cool guitar sound, and has a very cool, haunting chorus. It sounds like a broken down person who is suffering in a relationship. Probably has something to do with politics, maybe from the point of view of an innocent Iraqi. This song keeps up the space theme to some extent. Great song.   8.8/10     5. Soldier's Poem - A very soft song with some acoustical sound. The sound reminds me of \\"Falling Away With You.\\" Its about a soldier who doesn't really want to go to war and resents the government; definitely starts up the political theme. Beautiful song but really doesn't quite do it for me, the \\"filler\\" of the album.   6.5/10     6. Invincible - A fairly soft song, the intro sounds kind of like drums beating to a soldier's march. It might be taken as an uplifting song to persevere but is probably a call to arms and share the struggle with your companions. Towards the end, it starts taking up a funky, cool sound that makes better than before. Not too great.   6.9/10     7. Assassin - This song has some powerful drumming and another haunting chorus. Is this a call to arms against democracy? Has Muse gone Green Day on us? The powerful drum and guitar playing really make the song good.   8.1/10     8. Exo-Politics - Has a basic drum beat and some cool guitar sound in the beginning. It soon explodes and becomes a great song. Has a cool chorus once again and is also a bit funky. Once again it is trying to expose the government use of propaganda.   8.5/10     9. City Of Delusion - Starts out with a Spanish guitar sound. Then drums are brought in. And then more guitars and the song really begins to rock out. It is about people not wanting to see the problems of their American-style government. Very cool song.   9.1/10     10. Hoodoo - Continues the sound of Spanish guitars. Spanish theme is present throughout the whole song, and although some of the guitar playing is very cool, the song never takes off even after the piano starts playing. The singing is generally soft, and dare I say, not too good (*gasp*) (the breathing while singing problem that some have complained about on different albums is definitely present). I don't really care about the meaning cause I don't listen to this song, the onlybad song on the album.   5.0/10     11. Knights Of Cydonia - The intro is very cool, sounds like knights on horses in a space battle. Whatever the sound, this song is pure adventure. It has a great mix of sounds and is very fun. It does have very long instrumental parts though. The most complex song on the album; this song might have to do with the Anti-Christ ... it is very complicated. After a few listens and trying to understand this song, it has really grown on me. A fitting end to the album ... especially because it has something to do with Revelation in the Bible. The idea of this song is also displayed on the cover. If only it wasn't stretched so long and had more vocals it could be really great ... this is the only thing besides Hoodoo that I am disappointed with on the album. This is still the best song on the album.   9.3/10     This is definitely a pessimistic (not uplifting?), yet great album that attempts to discredit modern governments.   - This album has some great work on the drums and still sounds like Muse in most every song     NOTICE: I love Muse and therefore may be blind. Why are they talking about all these political problem? Is democracy a problem? It seems as this album was a little lame and that Muse wasnt really trying and even a bit cheesy in parts. This was not an innovative album at all and is best enjoyed with huge stadium speakers (supposively).     Final Rating: 7.4/10 ... I love them but recommended mostly for those who are familiar with the band (others should get there other two great albums).  Those two albums flirted with the line of dramatic-ness (overblowness) and lame-ness creating powerful music, this album crossed the line but is still not the worst thing Muse has done (Showbiz).
0375703861|5.0|I found this book to be absolutely amazing. I don't understand why this novel didn't strike others as the contemporary masterpiece that is, but to each his own. I especially admired Ms. Smith's ability to take her character's seriously without being mello-dramatic, to jest at them without being satirical.  <br />The dialogue in this novel is cunning, intricate, and enlightening without being monotonous. <br />I agree she gets a little long winded at times, but I enjoyed every second of reading. <br /> <br />

The music reflects the the excitement of the Quidditch World Cup, the conflict within the three Triwizard tasks, and most to my liking, the beauty and magic of the Yule Ball.   <br /> <br />I don't believe it is such a crime that John Williams' previous themes weren't used more.  Patrick Doyle has created new melodies that fit this film so well.  The music is beautiful.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Is anybody out there who's following the ratings of this series? For weeks now, people have been writing glowing reviews on Everwood, giving it a 5-star-rating ... I agree with them all. Does this mean anything to the people who decide whether to release a) more DVDs and b) DVDs for Europe (with code 2!) for fans in Europe (and me ...)?!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This Film is truly beautiful and unique. The Dvd is also great! It has plenty of things to do. For those people who get sad, mad or discouraged because the film is out of print: dont worry about it. The movie can be found used in some store. I found a copy at a local cd exchange for $13.99 then i saw one for $20 at the flea mart. Otherwise just wait for disney to re-realease it in 10 yrs. Also u can buy it online. Its possible u might get a bootleg but the asian bootlegs are better than nothing. Plus the contain DTS surround sound (something not all originals have).

B00004WGAI|1.0|I'm sorry but I can't understand how Tim Dalton can match the Rochester described in Charlotte Bronte's novel.  He is described as the exact opposite of young and handsome.  Tim does a lot of staring and theatrical acting in the part of Rochester and that's about it.  Zelah Clark just doesn't capture the fire and character of Jane in the novel and where is the chemistry?  She also looks far too old for the part.  The 1973 adaptation is outstanding, every scene is wonderful and Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack ARE Rochester and Jane.  Having seen the 1973 version nothing else compares favourably and this 1983 version is completely dull, certainly doesn't capture the essence of the novel.  I wouldn't recommend it but if you haven't seen any other version then this is probably just ok.  Not a classic by any means!  A plodding romance it is but Jane Eyre it isn't.
B000000LZV|5.0|DOUBLE NICKELS ON THE DIME ('84) stuffs 43 short songs on two LP's or one CD.  The album meshes quite a variety of musical styles:  punk, funk, spoken bits, jazzy instrumentation, folk, and even polka! <br /> <br />The MINUTEMEN accomplish this masterpiece album because of its three outstanding musicians - D. BOON (vox, guitar), MIKE WATT (bass, vox), and GEORGE HURLEY (drums, percussion), as well as other guest musicians.   <br /> <br />Key tracks include:  VIETNAM, POLITICAL SONG FOR MICHAEL JACKSON TO SING, CORONA (*note:  The theme music for \\"JACKASS\\"), HISTORY LESSON PT. 2, JESUS & TEQUILA, DO YOU WANT NEW WAVE OR DO YOU WANT THE TRUTH?, MAYBE PARTYING WILL HELP. <br /> <br />If you stack this album up against any/all of today's weak & soggy music (i.e. video/pop hits), then you'll discover an album that stands head-and-shoulders above this unfortunate lull in current musical trends...This album more than makes up for today's lack of creativity in most forms of music.  Buy it - try it!!!!!
0790742780|4.0|For some reason I missed seeing this movie when it came out, and just now (July 2006) got around to watching it on DVD. I've been catching up on movies I missed in the theatre, and \\"Falling Down\\" is among the best of them.<br /><br />Yes, it's contrived and a bit preachy, but the acting is marvelous, and Bill \\"D-FENS\\" Foster's adventures as he walks through 1993 Los Angeles are laden with moments where we can't help but cheer him on. The scene in the burger store is classic. Who among us hasn't wanted to strangle some officious little prick who tells us we missed the breakfast menu by three minutes?<br /><br />If it were possible I'd give \\"Falling Down\\" 4.5 stars, but that's not possible on Amazon.  It's really a very good movie, but not quite up there in the realm of greatness. While we sympathize with Foster's SITUATION, we can't really empathize with Foster himself, because he's clearly demented and becomes increasingly so as the movie progresses. Another minor flaw: many of the people Bill encounters are stereotypes (the Hispanic gangsters, the Nazi surplus store guy, the burger joint staff, etc.) and his reactions to various frustrations are often absurd.<br /><br />Still, it's a sharp, insightful and enjoyable flick. If you haven't seen it, it's worth seeking out!
630542828X|5.0|This is a very underrated movie.A Hollywood courtroom drama that manages almost totally to avoid cliché...? One for the scrapbook maybe. What I liked most about it was almost the complete lack of explanation about motivation ( shades of David Lynch here perhaps) most notably in the Schlichtmann character, brilliantly underplayed by John Travolta.Who could ever have imagined that being said? Indeed all the top stars (+Duvall, Macy, Shaloub) rein in on the histrionics, which is one reason why you have to watch this. What really made him change from a typical materialistic lawyer into people's hero willing to risk everything for, well, you make your mind up? The word hero is out of place here, however, and perhaps more disturbingly also so is villain, as the film does deal with a terrible crime. But then perhaps the banality of crime is what it is all about. Or should be. <br />Whatever your view, you will not go away without thinking about some very searching questions concerning the relationship between the law, justice and human suffering. The film ends with perhaps one of the finest pauses in cinema, as Travolta, faced with bankruptcy, attempts in vain to answer the judge's question: Where did it all go?    See it.
B000002KO1|5.0|I remember hearing Precious on the old M105 outside of Cleveland back when it was first released. Christ, what a song! I was sold at that moment and the album didn't disappoint. It is an unbelievable debut, especially considering that it came out during the pre-MTV days when labels still took a chance on groups instead of the \\"safety first\\" attitude that now prevents so many groups from record deals and sends them to the internet to market their wares. This band couldn't have been a safe bet by any means! This is a frantic, punky, sexy, sonic dose of autobiographical material from the jaded mind of Chrissie Hynde. Better yet, the material does not sound dated like so much from the late 70s/early 80s (except for the hip-at-the-time Space Invaders sample!), thanks to the lack of synth and the timeless incindiery guitar work of the late great Jimmy Honeyman-Scott. I feel fortunate to have seen this band in Pittsburgh just after they released the fantastic follow-up to this album, and they were just as intense and powerful live as on those two fantastic albums. An essential rock and roll record.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Excellent! After watching the special on VH1, I knew that I had to have this DVD. In the 70's listening to The Dark Side of The Moon on 8 track tapes and LP, I always hoped someday to see Pink Floyd play this live.  Now my dreams have come true.  Side 2 was the first one I watched. Stunning... with 5.1 Surround and big screen TV, I WAS IN THE CROWD..a must have to your music collection.
B000FS9FCG|1.0|If Natalie Portman is moving toward any new career direction(s), hopefully this movie is not at all representative thereof. She was criticized by some for \\"showing skin\\" in CLOSER, but that was a relatively rewarding performance compared to V FOR VENDETTA in which the only new skin we see of hers is on her bald head (yes, I know, it may not really be her bald head, and her hair may be back none the worse for wear in her next role). But as for things of substance, that is sorely lacking in this film, in which all she does is participate for baffling reasons in a violent revolution that looks amoral most of the time. And the regime being rebelled against just looks like a silly and unbelievable caricature rather than a villain of any reasonable insight. And there is a distinct undercurrent of America-bashing in it. While any nation should be able to take thoughtful constructive criticism, that isn't what we have here. The America-bashing is just as simplistic, unsubtle, and crass as it was in LOVE ACTUALLY. In short, Natalie Portman has this time gotten herself into a cinematic mess with VERY little going for it.
B00000E3YJ|4.0|Despite the grabled listing at Amazon, this must be Karajan's DG recording from 1965 of the Schubert 'Unfinished' and his 1969 recording of the Ninth. Now out of print, the CD will be of interest to those, like me, who are disappointed by Karajan's later Schubert cycle on EMI. Those readings sound inflated and leaden.  Clearly the Ninth meant something to Karajan, since he recorded it three times, first in mono with the Vienna Phil. after the war (1949). That's his best reading despite the antique 78-rpm sound. He never quite duplicated its mixture of heroic and lyrical qualities.<br /><br />But this Ninth is his most energetic. It's one of the fastest at 45+ min. (the usual Ninth runs around 50-53 min.) The first movement opens with a quickish Andante than speeds up considerably for the main Allegro, where Karajan favors rather fierce attacks--he sees this work in the light of Beethoven. The overall effect is somewhat brittle--this bargain reissue doesn't have the best sound. The second movement, marked Andanta con moto, is taken almost as fast as an allegro, which some listeners may find too rushed.  The Scherzo is big-boned and fast again. Clearly Karajan wants to avoid boredom. The finale adheres to the same spirit of fast tempos and blunt attacks, making the symphony end on a turbulent note rather than an uplifting or joyous one.<br /><br />We can't overlook the coupling. Karajan's Unfinished will satisfy more people than his Ninth. It's not in any way aggressive or paced too fast. We get a classic Berlin Phil. reading of balance, proportion, and excellent playing. Karajan gives us prominent horns in the opening movement and a heroic stance in the big climaxes. But the famous melody is beautifully shaped, and the same lyrical care runs throughout the second movement. For some reason, however, he plods a bit through the climaxes.<br /><br />In all, this CD makes up for a good deal of disappointment over the EMI sst without being one of Karajan's outstanding efforts. Four stars seems fair.g efforts. Four stars seems fair.
0977326403|1.0|The material quickly goes astray claiming that \\"the primary path to greatness in the social sectors is not to be become more like a business.\\"  Collins manages that conclusion through a non-sequitor - stating that basics such as personnel selection, demanding results, etc. don't count \\"because poor companies don't do those either.\\"<br /><br />Regardless, while Collins does identify the NYPD as an example of a well-run social-sector organization, his coverage is less than superficial.  Similarly, while Collins admits that social sectors often have a problem getting rid of unsatisfactory performers, he doesn't seem to appreciate how important that is.<br /><br />American public education and healthcare are the two biggest social sectors, and both perform poorly while costing more/client than that of any other nation.  Public education costs have escalated far faster than the CPI in general (while pupil achievement and dropout rates have stagnated), and healthcare costs rise faster than most anything else - despite repeated evidence that basic treatment steps are frequently omitted or performed poorly, millions lack healthcare access, and Americans' outcomes lag those of a number of nations.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that both sectors are heavily funded by third-parties (thus appearing \\"free\\" to users); another is the lack of good outcome measures; a third is that neither sector strongly links provider success with pupil/patient outcomes - in fact, both sectors generally achieve more income the worse their clients' outcomes.<br /><br />My \\"Bottom-Line:\\"  The two largest American social sector components need enormous improvement; this is best accomplished through providing incentives for them to act more like businesses - Collins' point of view notwithstanding.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|and a lot less than you should get for the price (about $20 when I wrote this).  People who liked the series have probably already seen the movie and been disappointed, but it still has the potential to disappoint a general audience, too.<br /><br />The movie suffers from problems that would doom any movie.  There is a lack of character development, in particular, a lack of explanation for characters' motives.  For example, and trying not to be a spoiler, one character explains that he wants to die simply by saying \\"I'm tired.\\"  Why he's tired, when he hasn't suffered any more than anyone else, really, and less than most, is unclear.  Other characters are killed before we even get to know them, which makes the survivors' over-the-top dedication to them seem a little ridiculous.<br /><br />The second problem are the plot holes.  I know a certain suspension of disbelief is required for this sort of movie.  But, as the many unanswered questions from my date made clear to me, often the characters seem to just be making random choices.  Why blow this or that up?  Why disobey orders NOW?  Why isn't any of the bad guys' technology worth a damn?<br /><br />That brings us to the third problem: it isn't a very interesting vision of the future.  The series had the advantage of actual conflict creating actual drama.  The movie gives Aeon such a massive advantage that you never question the outcome of any particular situation.  She solves all of them in exactly the same way.  even Schwartzenegger flicks have him do something creative once in awhile.  Aeon just shoots or kicks people to death.  Often using the same few moves.  Worse, the bad guys' tech choices are just odd.  Why use razor sharp grass when it is plainly ineffective (there are paths nearby and nobody gets seriously injured even after getting cut)?  Why aren't there any alarms?  Why does the bad guy's stuff just automatically work for Aeon, even when its supposed to be a security device?  When the future's tech is less effective than our own, you know there is a lack of vision somewhere.<br /><br />I grant that the special effects are pretty cool.  They still can't save this movie.  It doesn't even work as a good piece of eye candy because the cool special effects sequences are frequently separated by boring, rather conventional scenes.  I think what happened is the writers grabbed some cool scenes from the series and then just strung them together, using random chunks of story to make them fit together.<br /><br />What you get here is just some Hollywood hacks trying to capitalize on an old series that they didn't really get.  The result for non-fans of the original is just a crummy movie, and for fans, a travesty.  This flick is a straight up rip.  I gave 2 stars because there were still some cool scenes.h is less effective than our own, you know there is a lack of vision somewhere. <br /> <br />I grant that the special effects are pretty cool.

0066620996|4.0|How can companies move up to great results and sustain them (6.9X general stock market) for at least 15 years?  How are these companies different from those that failed to make the leap?  (Most analyses attempt to determine the commonalities within the top performers - eg. \\"In Search of Excellence\\"; Collins' approach is potentially more valuable.)  Some of the findings are as follows:<br /><br />1)Ten of the eleven good to great CEOs came from inside the company; comparison companies tried outside CEOs 6X more often.  (Jack Welch, of G.E. was one such transformational insider.)<br /><br />2)Structuring executive compensation to encourage \\"right\\" behavior was NOT important to success; it is more important to simply get and keep the right people.<br /><br />3)Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) played virtually no role in igniting a transformation.  In fact, successful and sustained transformations never happened out of any grand program, killer innovation or step - instead, it was a long process.<br /><br />4)The good-to-great companies paid scant explicit attention to managing change and/or motivating people.  Instead, they first focused on getting the right people on, and the wrong people off.  (Suggested Hiring Rule:  When in doubt, don't hire.)<br /><br />Collins also asserts that strategy was not a key component of success - that unsuccessful firms spent about the same amount of time on this topic as the successful.  Collins' observation about time spent may be true, but my review of the evidence presented is that 9 of the 11 began their upward progress after a significant CHANGE in strategy (the other two subsequently have fallen from grace).  Collins does, however, suggest \\"keeping it simple,\\" using technology to serve the firm's focus (not as a cure-all or fad), confronting reality, and setting big goals - all consistent with \\"In Search of Excellence\\" and Jack Welch's approach.<br /><br />Successful strategy-setting also requires determining, in my opinion, whether one is going to be primarily in the business of offering innovative products (eg. Gillette's new razors), or commodities (eg. Nucor's reinforcing steel).  The former requires a primary emphasis on speed of innovation and keeping very close to the customer), the latter on cost reduction.  Too often firms do not make this distinction and simply muddle forward.nion, whether one is going to be primarily in the business of offering innovative products (eg.

I am amazed to find that someone, with the intellect, the education and who has clearly spent an extensive amount of time on his research, has so exquisitly summed up what should be, in the ultimate analysis, common sense.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|You may hate this movie when you first watch this.  I know I did.  But then I watched it again, and again.  The more I watched it, the more I appreciated the comedy.<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite, from Idaho, is possibly the goofiest character of all time, and not just because he's from Idaho.  The ginger kid afro, the incredibly stupid mouth-open grin, and the ridiculous clothing all make for a character at which I can't stop laughing.  \\"Gosh!\\"<br /><br />Pedro is the perfect sidekick, barely there, barely audible, and barely normal.  Shaving his head, running for class president, baking cakes, and blasting pi&ntilde;atas, he's a hilarious mockery of many English as a second language immigrants.  \\"It's a sledge hammer.\\"<br /><br />The other major characters (Deb, Uncle Rico, Skip, and even Summer) are perfect casting choices.  Deb is borderline retarded, and probably a little agoraphobic.  Uncle Rico is living the old days of high school, and he's beyond pathetic.  Skip is the biggest loser alive, with lame poetry, 4-hour chat sessions, and an internet \\"girlfriend\\".  Summer is perfect as the most popular girl in school who runs for class president because it's almost a guarantee that she'll win.<br /><br />Overall it's a great movie that will have you quoting lines in numerous situations on a daily basis.  Whether it's the steak throwing scene (that puts me in tears every time I see it) or the on-going obsession with self defense/cage fighting, you'll soon find yourself talking with friends about your favorite scenes.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie highly enough.
0783225849|5.0|There's little I can add to what others have already written. I saw \\"Psycho\\" in the theatre when it first came out -- and, like everyone else, nearly jumped out of my seat at the famous shower scene.  But there's more to the movie than that. A lot more. It's one of the greatest suspense thrillers of all time, and Anthony Perkins' portrayal of the creepy, schizophrenic Norman Bates is still unsettling.<br /><br />The extras on the Collector's edition are worthwhile, although Janet Leigh drones on way too long, repeating herself endlessly and saying \\"you know\\" about 50 times. Someone should have edited her interview down by about 70%.<br /><br />Still, it's a great movie. A true landmark in the history of film that holds up well nearly a half-century later. Five stars for sure!

0679422714|3.0|Having read _Mao: the Unknown Story_ and the previous reviews of this book on Amazon, a few points leap out.<br /><br />*This is a sensational and hostile tome, unyielding in its basic idea that Mao was a heartless sociopathic opportunitist. Although it has some of the trappings of a biography, it's little more than a laundry list of China's unfortunate sufferings (both individual and collectively) under this maniac's grip. For this reason, it's not a cogent biography or history book as other reviews have amply pointed out. In sum, context is lacking. For this reason, it's not a very good read.<br /><br />*What emmerges is the life narrative of a reptilian-brained, lustful, wicked hypocrite who looked after only his own benefit and steadily developed a method of duping and double-cossing everyone around him. Mao is portrayed as first latching on to ideological revolution to hoist himself from his farming background, engaging in cynically-designed military blundering in the war against the Nationalists to kill off his rivals (or erstwhile comrades) in the red army, and then graduating to wholescale massacre of millions under his domain through purges and starvation (while he constructed bomb-shelter palaces to his liking, ate well, enjoyed books and operas and romped with a bevvy of girlfriends).<br /><br />*Although the book isn't simply a useless collection of trash and lies as some reviewers have stated, a careful look at the copious source notes indicates the authors have allowed lies and agendas to creep into their work. I think what this \\"Mao\\" gives us is the grain of salt to add to any deep study of Mao's life. As other reviewers have suggested, this book shouldn't be read as the first and last word on Mao but rather a caustic suppliment to existing biographic work.<br /><br />As the interview with the authors on this website points out, this book is intended to provoke discussion among historians (almost a challenge to historians to disprove the heinous litany).<br /><br />*This book is valuable in spite of it's flaws. It opens with the following sentence: \\"Mao ... was responsible for well over 70 million deaths in peacetime.\\" It then concludes, in the terse epilogue, with these sentences: \\"Today, Mao's portrait and his corpse still dominate Tiananmen Square ... The current communist regime declares itself to be Mao's heir and fiercely perpetuates the myth of Mao.\\" What exists between these two statements is a generation of murder, darkness and insanity that the authors undoubtedly feel China (and the rest of the word) still needs to come to terms with as it steadily emmerges as the powerhouse of the 21st century. The fact that the authors were able to unearth so much previously unknown information indicates that this process is already well underway and this book represents a kind of long-overdue denunciation of the man who rose to the top by denunciating or killing anyone who stood in his way.nous litany).  <br /> <br />*This book is valuable in spite of it's flaws.

I've tried to show this CD to a few friends, and its about 50-50 love/hate. You can be certain that when you pick up this album and give it a full listen, you will have an extreme and passionate reaction. I sincerely believe this is the best CD ever recorded, just as one of my best friends threatens to stab me with a fork every time I put even one track on. <br /> <br />Regardless of what your particular reaction is, I guarantee that the potential gain (finding a new ultimate favorite album) far outweighs the potential loss (an hour of your time). <br /> <br />Listening to Neutral Milk Hotel is a full body high for me. My favorite songs on this album are Holland 1945, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, The King of Carrot Flowers Part 1-3, Ghost, and Untitled. Really, there isn't a bad track on the whole CD, and their debut album \\"On Avery Island\\" is excellent as well, though I wouldn't pick that up until after you've aurally mastered \\"Aeroplane.\\" <br /> <br />If you're looking for an \\"I'd like this CD if I like these other bands\\" list, their sound is so unique I can't provide an accurate comparison. But, my other favorite artists are Nick Drake, The Flaming Lips, Bob Dylan, Iron & Wine, Regina Spektor, Queen, Jimi Hendrix, Fiona Apple, Devendra Banhart, Belle & Sebastian, The White Stripes, The Postal Service, Wolf Parade, The Pixies, The Shins, The Arcade Fire, Warren Zevon,  Victor Wooten...and Neutral Milk is better than them all.

B00006AW2P|4.0|This is The Rolling Stones' debut album and it's a good one at that.  Consisting of mostly covers, this album takes you on a journey through blues and R&B that no other debut album ever could.<br /><br />It all starts with the Buddy Holly cover, \\"Not Fade Away\\", a song that will get you snappin' your fingers until they're numb(well, maybe not since the song is pretty short.)  Next comes Nat King Cole's \\"Route 66\\".  This song kicks it to with Mick's soulful voice and some superior guitars by Keith and Brian.  They do an especially good job with Willie Dixon's \\"I Just Wanna Make Love To You\\".  The song is very fast and is a good mixture of blues and rock 'n roll, a trademark the Stones would develop in the late 60's.  \\"Honest I Do\\" is a good bluesy number but is easily forgotten.  \\"Now I've Got A Witness\\" is a instrumental written by the Stones themselves, in tribute to asong later on the album.  The song is okay but the organ is just silly.  It makes me feel like I'm at a baseball game.  \\"Little By Little\\" is a good catchy blues number co-written by the now infamous Phil Spector.  \\"I'm A King Bee\\" sounds a lot like \\"Little Red Rooster\\" and the Stones do a outstanding job on Chuck Berry's \\"Carol\\".  \\"Tell Me\\" is the only Jagger/Richards composition on here.  This song is somewhat underrated; it is a warm and fragile ballad with some great vocals by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.  Next comes my personal favorite, Marvin Gaye's \\"Can I Get A Witness\\"  This song is so happy and silly that you can help but smile when you listen to it.  \\"You Can Make If You Try\\" is just average, the silly organ from \\"Now I've Got A Witness\\" is featured on this one too.  Mick Jagger's voice is so goofy on this song that it's a bit surprising at first.  Last but not least is \\"Walking The Dog\\", a funky R&B song.<br /><br />This album is essential to any fan of The Rolling Stones.

Loved the other two sections. The author has an endearing sense of humor and a resilient attitude to life. She also manages to bring out the complexity of the characters, the woman in Indonesia she tries to help is a particularly memorable episode in the book.

B000002MTR|5.0|Before John Frusciante returned in 1998 and the Red Hot Chili Peppers since then have devoted themselves to mid-tempo rock, rock minimalism, and pop ballads, the 1995 album One Hot Minute, their only with Dave Navarro at guitar, will remain as the band's most aggressive, poignant, and creative record and the last in-your-face, take-no-prisoners album they will most likely ever release. <br /> <br />While the previous five albums (self titled, Freaky Styley, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, Mother's Milk, and Blood Sugar Sex Magik) were all daring in their own right, One Hot Minute pushed the Red Hot Chili Peppers into brand new territory as lyrics of nostalgia, loss, drug addiction, and society come through in a powerful mix of influences including funk, hard rock, heavy metal, progressive rock, jazz fusion, and psychedelic rock. While the previous albums had dry and straightforward instrumental work it becomes heavily esoteric and spacey with this release.  <br /> <br />Tempo changes are abundant and create a real sense of unpredictability as there are surprises all over the album. Dave Navarro is a fan of vicious tempo changes along with numerous overdubs; it's stunning how Navarro managed to pick out the right parts to play live. Flea plays his most diverse bass yet from the distortion on \\"Coffee Shop\\" or a heavy metal rhythm on the title track and \\"Transcending\\". Chad Smith's drumming is powerful and commanding as this is easily his best drum work Smith has ever done with the band. Kiedis (and Flea who wrote \\"Transcending\\" in memory of actor River Phoenix, \\"Pea\\", and parts of \\"Deep Kick\\") write very deep lyrics, from the heavily random and non-sequitor (such as the spoken word on the jazz fusion track of \\"Walkabout\\", \\"One Big Mob\\", and the funk-heavy metal jam of \\"Coffee Shop\\"), to the nostalgic (\\"Deep Kick\\" and \\"One Hot Minute\\"), drug induced (\\"Warped\\" and \\"Aeroplane\\"), love and friendship (\\"Falling Into Grace\\" and \\"My Friends\\"), loss (\\"Tearjerker\\"), and personal convictions (\\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\"). <br /> <br />The music is intense for 11 of the albums 13 cuts (\\"My Friends\\" and \\"Tearjerker\\" are the only laid back tracks on the album), but nonetheless deep, well crafted, and very creative. Although Navarro would only be in the band 2 1/2 years longer after this release and Frusicante would return to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers to a second wave of global success, One Hot Minute remain the most underrated album of the Chili Peppers catalogue and by far the most explosive and creative album they will ever release.
B00008NRI8|5.0|I'm a big fan of romantic comedies and this is one of my favorite. I received this movie as a graduation gift and I really like it. Hugh Grants George character was such a pain in the butt to Sandra Bullock's Lucy character but he grew on her.  <br /> <br />Lucy was always an overachieving, take charge, and want to make a difference person while George was guy who never really needed to work hard just represent his company.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Celine Dion's Christmas album \\"These Are Special Times\\" has a little bit of everything from traditional holiday favorites like \\"Oh Holy Night\\", \\"Ave Maria\\", and \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\", to Christmas \\"pop\\" classics including Elvis Presley's \\"Blue Christmas\\", John Lennon and Yoko Ono's \\"Happy Xmas\\", Nat King Cole's \\"The Christmas Song\\", and Jose Feliciano's \\"Feliz Navidad\\".  Also included in this collection is her huge hit with R. Kelly \\"I'm Your Angel.\\" <br /> <br />The songs on this album are very good and well performed, and this CD contains well over an hour's worth of Christmas music.  You are indeed getting your money's worth here! Celine and her family (who also sing on the album's last two tracks) really throw their heart and soul into this album. <br /> <br />Any fan of Celine's music will absolutely love this Christmas CD to be enjoyed year round!
B000BCE918|5.0|This trilogy is an excellent set that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.
B00005JOYA|4.0|Being a huge fan of the games, I watched Silent Hill on opening night. And honestly, I've never been so torn about a movie. Part of me loved it-- The part that understood the ashen and rusted beauty and intricacy of the film. The other part of me knew that the casual viewer wouldn't like this film. This is made for the fans of the game. Or at least for fans of the survival horror genre. <br /> <br />Gah, how to describe it all. First off, this movie just revolves on video game logic. The dialogue is cheesy, the actions are incomprehensible, and in the middle of a scene, a person just says a piece of unnecessary explanatory dialogue. As another reviewer said, the dialogue falls into either unnatural exposition or instructional. This was obviously done on purpose to recreate the feel of the game, since Roger Avary (a co-writer of Pulp Fiction) is highly capable of writing normal dialogue. The main character automatically knows that if she gets a key to a certain area, she must get to that area to move the story along. There is even a moment when a level is beat, the screen goes white, and a voice says, \\"Congratulations\\" followed by a cut-scene. This is as loyal to a video game as humanly possible. This will either make you hate the movie with a passion or adore it. I myself enjoyed it. <br /> <br />Another very interesting touch is that when Rose is running down a hall, the camera quickly switches angles just like in a survival horror video game. (You know, those frustrating moments when the camera angle switches and you find yourself walking into the exact same room you walked out of? Especially annoying when some terrifying creature is in that room.) Oh, and when she's memorizing the map, she keeps saying Left, Right, Left, Left, etc., and someone told me that that's actually a code in the game. I thought that was an interesting touch. Long story short, this movie is as accurate to the game as possible. <br /> <br />And the beauty of the film-- Wow. Just... gorgeousin that screwed up way. The creatures are stuff nightmares are made of. They're vicious and symbolic, meant to get under your skin and creep you out. Its rare that you'll see creatures like this in another film or outside of Silent Hill. Their movements and appearance represent something, though its not used as intricately as it is in the game. And when that siren sounds... A sense of dread sweeps over the audience. You know you're going to descend into even more of a nightmare, the next dimension of hell. There has never been such an ominous sound as that siren. The descent into that hell dimension is gorgeously done. The ash that permanently descends on Silent Hill melts into darkness, then the screen dimly lights up to reveal the walls rusting and melting apart. It's beautifully disgusting. <br /> <br />Oh, and the music, which is taken almost entirely from the video games is at its best here. Akira Yamaoka, the composer, uses these grinding, threatening sounds to make your skin crawl. When the monstrous Pyramid Head appears, the music rises to a grating groan that beats into your head and makes you feel like you shouldn't be there; That it is wrong to be in that room. The games created that effect perfectly. <br /> <br />But then comes the plot. This plot is utterly incomprehensible for those who haven't played the game. Not only that, but it's convoluted. For the first half of the film, nothing happens. Then all the explanation occurs in the next half, and it still doesn't make any sense. Don't get me wrong. This movie isn't supposed to lay everything out for you. Silent Hill is a place filled with clues that make you piece them together into something vaguely comprehensible. If they explained everything in this movie, I would've been very disappointed. The warped world of Silent Hill isn't for those who are out for a quick and gory horror film. It's something to reflect on, to sink into your dreams at night. It's about isolation, loneliness, and hopelessness.However, I felt as though some things could've been delivered slightly better in the grand scheme of things. The film drags in some parts, and at a little over two hours, its too long. <br /> <br />This film is not for those that haven't played a survival horror game nor for those who cant appreciate a survival horror game. Its that simple. Christopher Gans set out to make a game FOR the fans-- Screw what the rest of the world thinks, and he did it well. No other director would be that loyal. I give this film a 4 out of 5 rating, but it will mean different things to different people. 95% the moviegoers are going to despise this film. The rest, who can understand what he was trying to accomplish will love it. Its that simple.
B000FVBLEI|3.0|This album is pretty disappointing compared to This Darkened Heart. I put them ahead of the pack of the whole \\"metalcore\\" thing before but this album really is just Killswitch Engage-lite. It's not terrible by any means but I don't see myself rushing to listen to this any time soon. Still, if you're trying to decide between this album and something like Bullet For My Valentine, then definitely go for this. If you want something with some real value wait for the new Misery Signals.
B00005JOQS|5.0|First, I thought that Superman Returns was a really good movie.  I thought that Bryan Singer did a great job in his attempt to be true to the first 2 original Superman films, as well as to the Superman mythology.  I've heard several complaint about the romantic aspects of the film, but I've seen it a couple times and I wouldn't cut any of it.  It's important to reastablish the Superman/Lois Lane relationship.  THe actors all do a fine job in their roles, Routh does a great job as both the man of steel and as Clark Kent, and Kevin Spacy is malevolent as Lex Luther, but he can't seem to find the right balance between Hackman's more campy version and the malevolence that Singer looked for.  Kate Bosworth has great chemistry with Routh for the whole Lois Lane, but she doesn't seem as confortable in the role as the other actors do in theirs.  Marsden is great as Richard White, while the other characters for the most part have bit parts.  Parker Posey as Kitty is entertaining.  Now the not so good.  1) Both Routh and Bosworth are too young to be the ages they're supposed to be.  Both of them appear to be more in their early to mid twenties as opposed to late 20's early 30's.  2) In order for Lois Lane and Superman to have a child and for Lois to know Jason's paternity, she would have to remember all the events of Superman II which Superman wiped out with his super-memory powers at the end of that movie.  3) Once again the whole Lois and Clark dynamic is missed.  Clark Kent and Lois Lane are supposed to be friends as well as reporting partners and none of the movies can capture that dynamic.  At one point Clark says to Lois \\"I don't want this to damage out relationship.\\" and Lois quizically looks at him and says \\"Relationship?\\".  In the comics and the Superman mythology, Clark and Lois have a dynamic, I hope by the next movie, that dynamic is found because it makes Clark Kent a very one-dimensional character.  Overall this is an excellent movie and a worthy continuation ofthe Superman series, it ranks right up there with Superman the movie.
0316236551|4.0|Ed Emberley is a cottage industry when it comes to drawing and teaching children to draw things like animals, faces, trucks and trains, weirdos, the world and oh, so much more. While these books are directed toward early school-age children, I know many adults who would benefit from and find the books and instructions helpful and fun. <br /> <br />In each book Emberley provides the basic elements for drawing the subject matter and continues to add, piece-by-piece, the elements necessary to complete the object. The illustrations are clear and detailed and allow for each child/person to successfully complete the objects. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Ed Emberley's books are fun for children and adults and are a confidence builder for those who use his tips and techniques. There will be hours and hours spent mastering the concept of drawing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UB3|3.0|I found this last recorded Beatles album extremely enjoyable, or should I say I found about one fourth of it to be so.   <br /> <br />The Lennon-McCartney track \\"Come Together\\" I, of course, love. Arguably on of the most charismatic songs of the Twentieth Century, the smooth instrumentals and unobtrusive beats instantly charmed me.  Its lyrics are also very nonchalant, in the best sense of the word, yet manage to convince me that there is a profound meaning in them; though apparently hidden to such a lowly mortal as myself. <br /> <br />Another one of my favorites was \\"Something,\\" one of the two songs on Abbey Road written by Harrison.  In Frank Sinatra's famous words, it well may be \\"the greatest love song of the last 50 years.\\"  The instrumentals are very low-key, enhancing rather than distracting from the very sincere and approachable lyrics.   <br /> <br />Another Lennon-McCartney song, \\"Oh! Darling,\\" would best be described as sexy.  I wouldn't go so far to say that McCartney sounds completely genuine when he croons the slightly cliché lyrics.  Nevertheless, I do have a habit of skipping to it.  <br /> <br />\\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" the other Harrison track, I also (predictably) enjoyed immensely.  A lullaby for grown-ups, it also proves soulful. <br /> <br />One last song that made the cut (barely) was \\"She Came in the Bathroom Window.\\"     <br /> <br />On this album at least, I prefer Harrison's understated songs and apparent sincerity to McCartney and Lennon's predominately garish and too cutesy music and lyrics.  <br /> <br />Many of the songs border on annoying, enough so that I generally skip them.  An example would be \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer, a song with an admittedly catchy chorus, but overall repetitive instrumentals and unsatisfying lyrics-not because they're pointless, but because they're boring.  <br /> <br />That seems to be the main problem with most of the tracks on Abbey Road.  Too often they are cerebral.  They didn't transport me anywhere.  A good song conveys feeling rather than thought.  That's why some songs can survive time, and the reason \\"Come Together,\\" \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" and \\"Something\\" have done just that. <br />

0812550757|5.0|Comes together well with Ender's Game. Card himself say's that Ender's Game is just a setup for Speaker, and he did bring together the series quite well.  <br />Also note that the people that gave this book a 1 out of 5 are very biased and seemingly uneducated. One even states that he didn't understand what some words they used meant. Being fictional words made up by Card, I would be able to understand this, except for the fact that the book explains what the words mean every-so often. <br />Be warned, though. This book is more adult than Ender's Game. Not in a sex/violence way, but the characters display adult attitudes.
B00007KWHP|5.0|YES WAS ONE OF the finest progressive rock bands and fragile was one of the best albums after 90125 and their self titled debut albums.HUGELY RECOMMENDED,BUT AVOID THE FORTHCOMING ALBUM FROM THE AWFUL JESSICA SIMPSON.
B000002OX5|2.0|I hate to say this, but \\"The Who Sell Out\\" is my least favorite album from The Who (only counting the albums I've heard).  As much fun to listen to as Psychadelic Rock is, I don't feel The Who do Psychadelic Rock quite like The Doors or Jefferson Airplane.  And I realize that the radio inserts are part of the feel for the album, but I find them to be a bit annoying.  I would definitely say a fan of The Who should get this album, but anyone that is new to experiencing The Who should look at \\"Tommy\\" or \\"Who's Next\\" or \\"Who Are You\\".  But I'm sure there are many big fans of The Who that really like this album and are most likely pleased by what they hear.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|With so many bands nowadays making music for the sake of MTV and their local top 40 radio stations, it's nice to hear a band that makes music that doesn't always conform to the corporate standards.  Jet's classic style of rock 'n' roll is a welcome change from the pop music scene that tends to flood the media.  It's such a nice change to see musicians that do more on their instruments then just hack away on chords and yell into the microphones.  It's also a wonderful change to hear songs that aren't about the same old pop music subjects.  Bands like Jet, the Wallflowers, and the Black Crowes are quickly becoming tomorrows \\"classic rock\\" bands that have a chance of lasting throughout the years as opposed to the typical 5 year popularity a pop rock band sees and then is rarely heard from again.  I highly recommend this album and am hoping that future albums arrive.  It would be a shame to see a talented group like Jet get lost in the corporate madness because they don't make music that no one wants to listen to after 5 years.
0486281523|5.0|\\"My best mathematical and logic puzzles\\" presents 70 of the best of the brain teaser that Martin Gardner published over a period of 25 years in his Mathematical games column at Scientific American. It some cases references to new developments related with specific puzzles have been added.    Martin Gardner was always especially careful to present in his American Scientific column only new and unfamiliar puzzles that have not been included in classic collections before. Now you can challenge your solving skills and rattle your ego with a compilation of his best mind-benders.    Here is an example of what you can find inside this book (31. The absent-minded teller}:    \\"An absent-minded bank teller switched the dollars and cents when  he cashed a check for Mr. Brown, giving him dollars instead of cents, and cents instead of dollars. After buying a five-cent newspaper, Mr. Brown discovered that he had left exactly twice as much as his original check. What was the amount of the check?\\"     One of the best things about Martin Gardner books is that a carefully explained solution follows each problem, this way you learn and add new abilities to your problem solving skills, that will sure be helpful in solving real life problems, while entertaining yourself with a good and challenging reading.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|Bob Dylan is by far one of the greatest song writers around.  His music has spanned the decades and continues to thrive into the new millenium.  Even though the events have changed, the references made can still pertain to things happening today and tomorrow and probably forever.  Dylan's creativity continues to thrive and change on his third album and every album he continued to make.  There seems to be something that everyone can enjoy.  From traditional folk to rock influenced, his sound will be forever etched in stone.  The Time They Are A-Changin' is a must have for all Bob Dylan fans and just another way for the younger generations to feel the emotions that were flowing throughout the 60's.  Highly recommended!
B000021Y7X|5.0|An excellent concert film showcasing the avant garde talents of a very intriguing musical group.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I cannot believe the series was cancelled thou I only saw a few episodes on TV. Glad I bought the DVD set.

B000FGFSPG|5.0|This is the best live CD/DVD of 2006 no question. If you have not heard of this band. Shame on you. BUY THIS CD. The DVD is not out in the US yet but soon will be.. Poor Tarja got the shaft after this show. So even more reason to own her last performance with this band. Every song on this CD is performed to perfection.
0060989157|5.0|I decided to read this book because it had been highly recommended by Q magazine and Blender magazine, which are my favorite music magazines.  Despite living my teens in the 80s, I was never a fan of Motley Crue or heavy metal in general.  But I decided to read this biography of this band that I didn't care about beforehand, and I'm happy I did.  The stories are incredible, many of which are hilarious, and many of which are hard to believe are even true.  But despite the humor, the biography has heart, especially the section which deals with Vince Neil's 4 year old daughter's battle with cancer and ultimate death. <br />Go read this book, you will love it!
B00008JLKL|2.0|I heard the first eRa album some years ago and I loved it... It's wonderful music... The ancient-sounding choir, the pseudo-Latin language and the guitars here and then as well as some drums... Also the solos were great! That formula was really good, I think...<br /><br />This third album is much like the older ones, but has also become a bit more symphonic... That last change I like pretty much (though I regret the lack of guitars in the last few songs), but other small changes took also place... The mystic feeling has disappeared... The solo's no longer have some kinda melancholy in them, but have become rather poppy... The first half of the cd is just pop music with a choir now and then (I really hate that beat in the songs 2 til 5)...<br /><br />There are also good songs, like the Mass... Wonderful! And Foxifera has a great epic ending!<br /><br />Another shame: 3 songs have already been released on former albums (be it slightly different in sound and performance)...<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed and I like eRa's first album most...
0399143904|4.0|This book is a strange one to rate.  It was a solid book that was well thought out.  The pages turned easily as you read.  The problem was that it didn't inspire me to keep reading long into the night.    The pluses are how well it was written and thought out.  The story flows and is very believable.  The characters tough and powerful, though not as scary as the young Clark of Without Remorse.  You get a military action book that no one but Clancy can deliver.    The minuses are minor, but still there nonetheless.  We know that the Rainbow guys are tough and strong and in shape, that they are the best at what they do.  Must we be told this every time they appear in a chapter throughout the whole book?  Also, there is no mystery or suspense.  You know Rainbow is going to utterly devastate the terrorists.  In one part the plan for an attack was laid out, and in the next the opposition guessed the exact same thing that they had just laid out.  This makes for the story to be a little too neat without getting the reader too involved.    A small comment in reference to other reviews.  This is a book of fiction.  An author creates his works based on the frames of mind that his characters fit into.  So fiction can in no way be construed as the author's \\"political agenda\\" or that these are Clancy's personal beliefs.  It is fiction, not a treatise or diatribe, and therefore should be read as entertainment, not as Clancy's personal venue to assert his beliefs (as other reviewers have asserted).    All this being said the book focuses more on getting from point A to point B, rather than the military action so enjoyed in Without Remorse (although there is plenty of the military action).  I would recommend this book definitely.  Would I say it was great?  No, I wouldn't.  But I would say it is worth the read.    3.75 stars.
B00005JP0C|5.0|nicely done. only the boy friend cast was not appropriate enough. there's nothing wrong with the materialism, the brands, the brand names. men or women, without clothings, or without beautiful clothings, would all look the same. human beings are differred from other creatures only with clothes. men or women, once naked, would just look almost the same. what makes the world more interesting? those beautiful clothes and the accessories. this is a highly entertaining movie.
B00003CXB2|3.0|There is a truism that if a person is caught lying on some matter then that person cannot be believed on other things.  This is also true of films. <br /> <br />Lawrence of Arabia tells the story, (essentially 1916-1918), of a known historical figure in a well documented arena of the First World War.  Is the film truthful to this figure and this period? <br /> <br />The film opens with the death of Lawrence.  He is riding his motorbike (from Clouds Hill Cottage to Bovington) and approaching a slight rise two boys on bicycles appear in front of him in the centre of the road or on the wrong side of the road.  Lawrence tries to avoid them and crashes.  The film implies the boys were to blame - this is a travesty of the facts. <br /> <br />The crash happened on 13 May 1935, Lawrence died several days later, and an inquest was held on 21 May 1935.  The inquest established that the two fourteen year old boys, Frank Fletcher and Albert Hargraves, were riding on the correct left-hand side of the road in single file.  It was a relatively straight part of the road with a couple of dips and Lawrence came up fast behind them (he was probably doing around 50mph without a crash helmet) and in attemting to brake he hit the rear bike and was thrown over the handle bars.  The cause of the crash was clear - Lawrence was riding too fast - speed kills. <br /> <br />Winston Churchill once described Lawrence as the biggest liar of them all.  The film should be seen from this perspective - that it depicts events from the viewpoint of a person who cannot tell the truth; the film follows Lawrence's account of the Arab campaign described in his Seven Pillars of Wisdom - a book that is subject to much historical questioning.  The film also distorts other events - like the crash.  <br /> <br />Of course this is precisely what films are about - the depiction of fictional characters and events!! <br /> <br />The two boys (now old men) were interviewed in 1991 for a book.  It is a pity that theywere not asked about the crash scene in the film.  <br /> <br />

B00008OLIO|5.0|A great album.
B000GFRDN6|5.0|I have bee anxiously awaiting this one for awhile now. Let me tell you it was well worth the wait. This to me is Steve Miller's finest effort with Book Of Dreams running a close second. This classic was released in 1976. I was 13 at the time and I wore out the album. Well let me tell you this disc sounds far better than I have ever heard this album sound. The bass is very deep and clean, the mids and highs are clear and defined. The soundstage and imaging are incredible. This to me is one of the best,if not THE best sounding remasters of all time. A must have for fans of Steve Miller or good Classic Rock!! Go buy this now you won't be disappointed.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Are you interested in a place where you can relax and enjoy seeing a budding superhero, an evil arch enemy in the making, various adventures each week, and an interesting cast of friends and family to provide an extra bit of drama?  If so, Smallville is for you.    The basic premise is that we are watching Clark Kent (Superman) before he actually became Superman.  In fact, he's just a freshman in high school (even though he and his friends look like they're in their 20s) and he doesn't even fully understand what his powers are and how he can utilize them.  I should also mention that the series is set in the modern day (around 2001 or so), which keeps it current.    The creators of the series did a great job of creating this world, which has several key features.  Here's the key features in order of importance to the show.    1)  Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor.  This is the most fascinating part of the show.  Michael Rosenbaum does an incredible job as the future evil mastermind.  He and the writers have created an incredibly complex individual who is very multifaceted.  You can see him struggle with his identity and he tries to find his true self. Clark and Lex have a very unique relationship that must be viewed to be appreciated.    2) Clark's relationship with friends and family.  Clark goes through many of the typical teenage issues, but also has to protect his \\"secret\\" (his powers).  This affects his relationship with his parents and his friends.  He also struggles to build and maintain relationships with Lana Lang (the girl he's in love with) and Chloe (the girl who loves him).  While some of these story lines could have been lifted from 90210, the interesting characters and actors pull it all off.    3)  Clark develops his powers.  Since Clark doesn't already know of his Superman abilities, we get to see him develop many of them as the season progresses.  The series has some pretty good special effects (for TV) and does a good job with things like his x-ray vision, for example.  For fans of Superman, this is a fun part of the show.    4)  \\"Freak of the Week\\" guests.  Most episodes there are various \\"freaks\\", people who have been affected by the meteor rocks that came when Clark's ship arrived.  Most have unusual powers, and it is often up to Clark to stop them without letting anyone see him do it (he has a secret to keep, after all).  While this may seem to be the main event each week, I really consider this to be just filler.  The meat of the show is the first 3 items I mentioned.  Don't get me wrong, the various \\"freaks\\" have entertainment value, but they're just not the real focal point.    All in all, this is a very good series that will have you constantly looking forward to the next episode.  I will tell you that season 2 gets even better, so you definitely have something else to look forward to.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|I have great admiration for the performance of Ralph Fiennes here. He treads the fine line between compromised (nearly feminized) British diplomat and impassioned defender of his wife's honor and principles. That he comes to acknowledge her love for him as the unquestioned given of the film is what finally redeems him and this movie as well. The quasi-erotic rendering of the African continent is also an enormous virtue. A beautiful film in many ways, especially in the cinematography and the rhythm of the scenes as one blends into another. Also, I love the musical background.    Still, it's just too d**n tilted against Europe. In this movie, a British accent simply condemns a guy, and the representation of the pharmaceutical industry is finally too easy and politically correct. Wouldn't you guess: It's all about the bottom line, unless it's about love (for which read sex). Presumably this perspective derives from John LeCarre's novel, but that doesn't justify it. Even set against the substantial virtues of the film from an acting and cinematographical point of view, the limited politics keep it from being a five or even a four-star movie.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|This film is about a young Jewish man searching for his roots in the Ukraine, part of the former soviet union. He travels from America, where he lives, joins up with a translator, the translator's grandfather who is also their driver, and the translator's grandfather's dog. <br /> <br />All he has to go on is an old photograph of his grandfather and the young woman who helped him leave for America. Will he find the village where his grandfather came from? Why is the grandfather acting so mysterious? And who is the mysterious Augustine? <br /> <br />I'm not even sure of the answer to these questions, even though I've seen it. I didn't really understand what they were looking for, or why it was so hard to find. And I didn't understand the ending either. I think I was just missing something.  To be honest, I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a comedy, a drama, or something else. It didn't really have enough suspense to make it work as a mystery, and it wasn't really funny enough to be a comedy I thought. Perhaps a few more twists in the plot would have helped, or more jokes. I also found the soundtrack off-putting and annoying at times.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, my girlfriend liked it a lot. Apparently it's based on a book, though she said the film only covers half of the book, which she says is much better because you get a better idea of the history of the place he's looking for. She told me to read the book first before I jumped to conclusions, so I suppose I'll have to have a go at it and see if it all makes sense then. <br /> <br />In short, I'd say if you've read the book, this might be a good film, but if you haven't, as I haven't, you might find it confusing. <br /> <br />
B000244FDW|2.0|I love Jane Austen and I really wanted to like this movie.  I've seen the version with Colin Firth, the Bollywood version (Bride and Prejudice), the Mormon version, and the Keira Knightly version.  I just couldn't finish the movie.  It was so dull.  The acting was very wooden and seemed lifeless.  I hate to give it a bad review, but I liked it the least of all the versions that I have seen.

0060012358|5.0|I travel for a living, and Terry Pratchett's discworld books are always a good standby because a) they are easy to read, b) enjoyable, and c) available in most airport bookstores.<br /><br />However, my favorite by far is The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents. The story is light and fun, with a deeper lesson for those who want it. It is cleanly written and the story progresses nicely. Subjects such as religion, the afterlife, right vs. wrong, and wisdom vs. intellect are all flirted with, but nothing is jammed down your throat.<br /><br />The characters are largely stereotypical on the surface, but again there is more to them, if you dig in and pay attention (with the possible exception of the mayor's daughter, who is pivotal to several analogies about life and stories, but otherwise is fairly two-dimensional). The character of Maurice (a cat) is the heart of the story, and will likely be a favorite among readers. Maurice represents a facade of control and power that borders on arrogance... and that most of us are forced to adopt to some extent in our own lives/careers; yet like most people, Maurice is not as in control as he thinks, and his wise alley-cat exterior crumbles in the face of morality and courage, proving that he's a good guy (err, cat) after all.<br /><br />T.A.M.A.H.E.R. is fun and appropriate for all ages, teaches some good life-lessons about compromise and culture-tolerance, and gets five bright pointy stars from me.<br /><br />I should also note that the story is short -- a refreshing change from novels (especially \\"fantasy\\" novels) that are often stuffed full of sawdust and slag in order to round out 400 terribly written pages. In contrast, Pratchett has written a beautifully concise and well structured story.<br /><br />[Edit: As I am a huge fan of--and therefore inspired by--Terry Pratchett, I feel I'm justified in pointing out my new book [[ASIN:1419682644 Cluck: Murder Most Fowl]].  Many of my fellow Pratchett fans have been early readers and have enjoyed it.  Apologies for the shameless self-promotion, -edk]r the shameless self-promotion, -edk]
B00031TXBI|5.0|This has to be the hardest album Mr. Frusciante has done. It is many forms of rock sandwiched between layers of raw emotion. The thing I've noticed is how it differs *completely* from every other album he's done. While each of them have a different feel or tone to them, I must say that this one stands out. Another thing I liked about it is the heavy distortion he uses on most of the tracks, adding more to the Grungy feel of the album. <br /> <br />I've listened to this album numerous times, and it's been hard to choose, but this is my favorite of all of John Frusciante's work. <br /> <br />Highlights (for me) are: A Firm Kick, Emptiness, I'm Around, and Scratches.
B000AMJDHY|2.0|Oh my god. Have you heard this band? \\"Panic! At The Disco\\"? <br /> <br /> <br />This has got to be one of the worst bands of all time. There's no doubt about it, I have a new most-hated band. My sister loves this band, and wanted to put their CD on her iPod. So I figured, while I had it on my computer, I'd give it a listen. I listen to mainly old music, and I know a lot of people my age (17) that listen to this band. I truthfully have NO idea what my generation listens to. So I thought I'd give Panic! At The Disco a listen. <br /> <br /> <br />Oh yuck. Are you kidding me? Nearly every song title on here is an entire sentence. Now, I'm not one to take things at face value, but my previous experience with song titles that are complete sentences hasn't been great. \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide Is Press Coverage\\"? \\"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines\\"? \\"There's A Good Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet\\"? No! The title of a song is supposed to be a sentence FRAGMENT, if even that! <br /> <br /> <br />Anyway. So, I thought I'd give it a listen, right? And I did. I put the CD on play, and continued playing Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine. About ten minutes later, I said \\"Damn, this is a long song. When is it over?\\" So I clicked on iTunes and... <br /> <br />...they HAD changed songs! In fact, they had changed songs three times. EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM SOUNDS THE SAME. The only song that dosen't sound like every OTHER song on the album is \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\", and that's only because of the strange sounding \\"twiddling\\" part at the beginning. When looking at this band, but not listening to the music, you think \\"Wow, these guys look inventive!\\" I mean. They have an organ and accordion player. When is the last time you saw those in a modern rock band?  <br /> <br />Panic! At The Disco sucks. Now I know why they're \\"Panic!ing\\", though. Because I'm gonna burn that disco down.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|That's not to say I don't still think Stadium Arcadium is a work of genius, it's just that nothing could ever touch it until now.   <br /> <br />I am kind of a newbie in the world retro rock, I'm only 27 and was raised on hip hop and r&b, and was turned on to rock by some friends when I was 11.  But I know good rock when I hear it, and no sooner than I saw the video for \\"Woman\\", I immediately ran out and bought this cd.  I just knew it would be one of those cds where if you think the single was good, wait 'til you hear the rest of the album.  <br /> <br /> I know who they sound like, and who cares?  I can see the freshness and the futuristic tone to their music, so they are not completely biting in my opinion.  Every band has to have an influence, so why not be influenced by the best.  I think Ozzy and Plant would be very pleased or jealous, depending on how they look at it.  But even they can't deny that these guys are off the hook.  Love the lead singer's voice, I can tell it's one that will have to grow on some.  But when it does, watch out!   <br /> <br />\My favorite tracks: <br /> <br />2. White Unicorn:  Pretty song, the ending is sick! <br /> <br />3. Woman:  The whole reason I purchased the cd, great \\"Introducing Wolfmother\\" song, but filler in comparison to the rest. <br /> <br />4. Where Eagles Have Been:  Pretty pretty pretty <br /> <br />5. Apple Tree:  Fast upbeat White-Stripish.  Fun song, one of my favorites <br /> <br />8. Mind's Eye:  Slower song, showcases lead singer's voice very well.  Great lead in for: <br /> <br />9.  PYRAMID!!!:  Favorite song on the album at this point, I love the oooh, oooh, and the guitar riffs.  Very retro. <br /> <br />10. Witchcraft:  Just like the name implies, it's very hypnotic and mystical, especially the chorus vocals. <br /> <br />11. Tales:  Love this one!  Slow during the verse, more upbeat during the chorus.  <br /> <br />12. Love Train:  Funky guitar beat, definitely a head bouncer or headbanger, whichever you're into. <br /> <br />13. Vagabond:  Great end song to a great record.  Only listened to this one once, I'm sure I'll have an even higher opinion of it later.   <br /> <br />Overall:  9/10.  I don't think this is a fad, these guys are the real thing. Cop this album if you love rock that actually seems as though love and effort was put into each song.
0312995423|4.0|In reference to some of the bad reviews posted here, I have to say... ok... this book won't teach the reader any constructive knowledge about Information Technology, Mathematics and Cryptography, and yes, there are a few sides to the plot which I found questionable. The biggest one for me was: If I was a language professor, and my partner's boss (who just happens to be the commander of a multi million dollar corporation), suddenly mistook me for a trained secret agent and sent me to Spain on a covert mission of high importance, instead of sending one of the highly trained personnel specifically recruited for that reason, would I just hop on the Jet provided, no questions asked?<br /><br />But apart from these minor imperfections, Dan Brown's skills for writing a page-turner are still evident in this novel. For anyone thinking about buying this book, my advice is, don't scrutinize every minor detail... enjoy the story and remember... it's just FICTION.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Okay, so I think disgusting, crude, lewd, and poor tasts is funny...so what?!?!?  I know I'm not alone in that.   <br /> <br />This movie was one of the funniest things I've ever seen!  Trey Parker and Matt Stone are true geniuses, and have a few hilarious movies to prove it.   <br /> <br />If you like truly foul humor and haven't seen this yet, shame on you!  You go buy now! <br /> <br />There's a couple scenes in particular that I thought I was going to laugh myself to death, but I won't spoil them, just see it, damn it all! <br /> <br />For more parker/stone fun, check out: <br />Cannibal, the Musical <br />Baseketball <br />Orgazmo
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Definitely the Classical Music has survived in the form of Scores for films. This CD is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED specially because it has the feel of the music of Italian films, or Italian musicians like Nino Rota, Nicola Piovani, Ennio Morricone. This movie gets the best of Dario Marianelli.
1594481938|4.0|In the interest of full disclosure let me say up front that I'm a major Nick Hornby fan.  I thought High Fidelity was brilliant, and About a Boy was extremely good.  However, How to be good was at best pedestrian.  A major fall from excellence. <br /> <br />A Long Way Down is Hornby back on his game.  While not to the height's of High Fidelity, it's a major improvement on his last offering. <br /> <br />The book revolves around four distinctly different personalities who all arrive at a high rise London roof on Mew year's eve to commit suicide.  Their collective presence chills their fervor and they end up becoming a sort of support group for one another. <br /> <br />The book serves as a vehicle for what amounts to an in depth character study.  The four have literally nothing in common other than their despair and their sense of failure from their abortive effort.  Over the course of the book they deal with their depression, their angst, their problems and their disdain for one another.   <br /> <br />The book is a wonderful platform for Hornby's acute sense of social farce and biting, sarcastic sense of humor.  As with all of Hornby's better works this is not a grand story but the response of ordinary people to the various foibles and vagaries of life. Hornby wisely avoids the grand gesture and the major plot turn and focuses rather on life at street level. <br /> <br />It's very good to see Nick back in stride. <br />
6300216047|2.0|The zero gravity spacesuit striptease in the opening title is the best thing about this film. The rest is pure camp, but it's so bad it's not even bad enough to be funny. The plot, dialogue, acting, sets, special effects, and music are all horribly bad and boring. The most memorable line is, \\"An angel doesn't make love, he is love.\\" But let me tell you, that angel was making plenty of love; unfortunately we never got to see any of it. Watching this movie now, I can see that the only reason it created such a stir in 1968 was because it snuck in soft porn to mainstream theaters. But this film is droll French humor; it has no morals or heart and as such is not a reflection of the \\"free love\\" and liberation of the times. What's worse, even the villains in this film are absurd and boring. If I need a fix of bad science fiction, I'd rather watch The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
B000002UA0|5.0|In my opinion, no other album better exemplifies just how good psychedelic rock can be than \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\"  Alternately intense and melodic, yet always seeming to transmit from a distant cosmic satellite, Pink Floyd's stellar debut is a consistently engaging musical experience.  In fact, even though Pink Floyd went on to be one of the world's biggest bands, I think that their debut is their best (narrowly beating out \\"The Wall\\").  Then again, early Pink Floyd sounds like a vastly different band when compared to the one that would record \\"Dark Side...\\" just a few years later.  Much of this is due to the mad genius of Syd Barrett, who would disappear from the band (and most other things) after this album.  \\"Piper\\" contains jazzier elements than any other Floyd album, culminating in the almost apocalyptic \\"Interstellar Overdrive.\\"  Barrett's Pink Floyd is obviously more indebted to sing-along pop than the later incarnation of the group.  Just listen to songs like \\"The Gnome\\" and \\"Matilda Mother\\" if you doubt me.  Buy this album now.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|This is a fatally lacking album. Don't get me wrong, I'm a diehard GNR fan and it contains some of my favorite songs. But it's just not Guns N' Roses.  <br /> <br />There are two kinds of Guns N' Roses fans -- (1) those who sing along to Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City, and Welcome to the Jungle when they come on the radio, and (2) fans who are acquainted with the rest of GNR's body of work, meaning any or all of Lies, Live Era, the Use Your Illusion albums, and The Spaghetti Incident. The former, the casual fan, probably owns Greatest Hits. This album will most likely irritate/anger the latter. <br /> <br />The real problem lies in that Greatest Hits, unlike many excellent compilations (The Beatles' 1 comes to mind), is not even a good introduction to GNR. The best introduction for the aspiring 'true fan' is Appetite for Destruction, an album full of the tight, heavy, brazen songs that were GNR's starting platform. From there, it's best to branch out to UYI I/II, which contain some AFD-esque songs but with a surprising number of tracks that break the mold, such as long November Rain-like epics, bluesy Stradlin-penned songs, and the utilization of the piano on tracks like Bad Apples and Breakdown, as well as some of Axl Rose's more introspective lyrics. (And definitely check out Lies - the first four tracks are just good, but the second 4 acoustic are AMAZING. Lies' You're Crazy is FAR superior to that on AFD). The Spaghetti Incident, eh, not so much. Some fans like it, I hate it. <br /> <br />However, Guns N' Roses never had a chance for a good Greatest Hits album, because many of their fans' most beloved songs weren't hits. A song like 'Breakdown' on UYI II, with its length, use of the piano, and calm, searching lyrics is miles away from any Guns radio hit, probably with the exception of November Rain, but some consider that a 'power ballad' which seems to qualify it for radio play. On the other hand, a song like 'Double-Talkin' Jive', while as fast-paced, hard-rocking, and downright audacious as many of the AFD tracks, contains swearing that couldn't be allowed on radio or be edited out. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that much of GNR's work, the part that many fans love the most, just hasn't qualified for radio play and therefore can't make it onto a Greatest Hits album. Which makes this CD absolutely worthless beyond the casual listener. And PLEASE don't say things like \\"Why isn't My Michelle on here\\" because guess what, it wasn't a hit for one of the reasons stated above, and that's why it's called Greatest Hits. Maybe a 'Best of' album would be better. <br /> <br />BUY AFD!! <br /> <br />
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is the first series of shows depicting the true life stories of the Easy company during WWII.  It has interviews with the real men of the war and I think tells their stories the exact way they happened.  It is a must to own.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X & Y is an amazing album. Coldplay truly shows their creativity in each song on the album. This new album is much more upbeat from Rush of Blood to the Head and definately Parachutes although some songs still have the classic Coldplay sound to it. They keep getting better in each album they make. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B00006JIA4|3.0|I don't know that I can say Queen was the greatest band of all time, but they were easily the most versatile and unique band to ever grace this earth, thanks mostly to Freddie Mercury's incomparable vocals and Brian May's songwriting talents.  With that said, you can't really go wrong with buying a 3-disc Queen compilation for a great price, but I think those just getting into the band would be better served by buying a couple albums.  While it is true that Queen was a band that constantly morphed and changed album by album and that a compilation album can do a better job of representing that, alot of the track choices on disc 1(Queen's vastly superior 70s era) here are a bit dubious.  Now I'm Here is actually my LEAST favorite song on the Sheer Heart Attack album.  Flash Gordon and Bicycle Race were indeed hits, but are really novelty songs and don't hold up particularly well.  Good Old-Fashioned Loverboy is a decent song, but music hall is already represented by the superior Killer Queen here.  Spread Your Wings in particular is a glaring omission that could have served as a superior replacement.  Bohemian Rhapsody, Another One Bites the Dust, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, We Will Rock You, and We Are The Champions are the five \\"duh\\" tracks included that the most casual fans will buy this set for. <br /> <br />Disc 2 chronicles Queen's spotty 80's era, largely comprised of, as even Freddie Mercury described it, \\"disposable pop\\".  Under Pressure is the biggest hit on this disc.  Two great hard rockers in \\"I Want It All\\" and \\"Headlong\\" are included, and while it's not a favorite of mine, the decent-sized Radio Ga Ga is present as well.  The highlights of this disc however are Who Wants to Live Forever, which features one of, if not the most, incredible vocal displays Freddie Mercury ever recorded, and the heart-wrenching autobiographical tour de force, The Show Must Go On. <br /> <br />If you've read the other reviews here you know that Disc 3 is often maligned.A majority of the tracks here are indeed disposable, but the worthy tracks here are well worth your attention.  No-One But You is the final song Queen ever recorded and is a eulogy to Freddie Mercury in the form of a ballad.  Great, great song.  The singles from Made in Heaven are present as well, as well as a rap remix of Another One Bites the Dust that seems ridiculous the first time you listen to it but might actually grow on you as it did me. <br /> <br />In the end, I believe Queen, along with Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, is an album-oriented band above anything else.  I would point prospective buyers of this collection towards A Night At The Opera and either Queen II or Sheer Heart Attack. <br /> <br />
B000660UN0|5.0|But I don't confuse the two. As Sam King says above, this might be the album Robert Johnson would have recored had he had the chance.<br /><br />Nuff said.
B00005JO20|4.0|Not to take anything away from the new CGI enhanced version.  I actually enjoyed the usually obnoxious Jack Black as Carl Denim and Adrien Brody looks like he belongs in the 1930's.  (He could be Ray Bolger's (the scarecrow in Wizard of Oz) double. Are they related?  Ann Darrow was ok.  I loved the 30's look of the movie and the old New York flavor.  The only problem with this movie is the length,  too  l  o  n  g.   Enjoy!
B00005JO9J|4.0|I had heard so many good things about the show and was pleasantly suprised to find that after watching the fist season on DVD, I was hooked and enjoyed every episode.  Am now awaiting the arrival of the 2nd season. Great show, very humorous, very interesting character and plot developments.  So much more than a hospital show.

1594200823|5.0|This is probably one of the most important books I have ever read. Give this to your boss, your senators and representatives, your grocery's meat department staff, the Board of Directors of your firm, your friends. It should cause us all to drastically change our personal lives, purchase differently, further question our industrial and corporate \\"values\\" and vote differently.
B00005JP4W|5.0|For all the reviewers who question the science behind this movie, I wonder, did you even see it?  The idea of global warming is not based on evidence that the earth has suddenly been warming up.  The idea of global warming is based on three indisputable facts: <br /> <br />1)  Through burning of fossil fuels, we have increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere to levels never before seen in the history of the earth <br />2)  CO2 is a greenhouse gas, meaning it traps heat in the earth's atmosphere <br />3)  For the past hundreds of thousands of years, there has been a direct correlation between fluctuations in the earth's temperature and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere <br /> <br />With these three facts in mind, how can you come to any other conclusion than that our CO2 emmisions are going to unnaturally drive up the earth's temperature?  It is irrelevant to argue that the earth is going through some kind of natural warming/cooling cycle, because it does not have any bearing on these three facts.  Using the natural warming cycle argument against global warming is like turning on the oven and saying it's only going to heat up as a result of the ambient temperature in the kitchen.  Although he doesn't say it in so many words, this is the point Gore drives at in the film. <br /> <br />As far as an actual review of the movie, I thought it was captivating and well made.  The only downside I feel is that it was Al Gore who made it--not because I hate Al Gore, but because people think the movie's just a political stunt, which it is NOT.  I hope people will be open-minded enough to give this movie a chance regardless of political affiliations, because it is perhaps the most important documentary you will ever see.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The DVD delivers the Floyd sounds better than I imagined possible, and the visuals effects of this concert are awesome. It has been a long wait for this release, but well worth it.
B000053VAF|5.0|Even though there is a disclaimer at the beginning of this film, I didn't find the film as offensive as I thought I would. As a matter of fact, I didn't find it offensive at all. This is entire film is in good humor and there are many laughs to be had in this movie! Jay and Silent Bob make the film when they are on, but there are many other characters just as funny.<br /><br />Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Alank Rickman, Chris Rock, Jason Lee and all of the others come through and make the characters they play really come to life and be believable. Ben and Matt are great as the two angels killing those they say are sinners to bring the fear of God back into peoples lives. Alan is great as the angel who isn't allowed to drink, even though he isn't on that much, he's really cool. Everyone is great! Overall, this movie is really worth seeing if you are a fan of Kevin Smith.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|I think this is a fantastic album - it may not have a standaout track, but the consistency of the songwriting, the sparse, economical production and Mark's guitar playing is fantastic.  This is definitely a slow-burner, which you will keep returning to without getting bored.  My personal favourite song is 'Follow me Home'.  This is better, in my view, than the over-blown production of the later albums.
B000002GJH|5.0|Temple of the Dog was a one-off project which was started when Soundgarden's Christ Cornell and Matt Cameron hooked up with Mother Love Bone members Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard, as well the then-unknown vocalist Eddie Vedder and guitarist Mike McCready. Some of these members would later go on to form Pearl Jam and upon releasing their highly acclaimed debut Ten, this would also reflect on the sales of Temple of the Dog, parachuting the release to platinum status.<br /><br />This is a tribute to the late Mother Love Bone singer Andrew Wood who died of an overdose and happened to be a close friend of Cornell's. Cornell is the primary songwriter on the album and all his lyrics mourn Wood's death or were inspired by stories of loss and addiction. The first two tracks, \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" and \\"Reach Down\\", are also the strongest pieces. Not only do they display Cornell's amazing vocal talents, they are also very well-written and powerful compositions. \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" would become one of the album's hits and is to this day considered among Cornell's best moments. The elegiac blues guitars and mournful vocals pull at the heart strings and when Cornell's uncontrolled screaming induces goose bumps. \\"Reach Down\\" is over eleven minutes, but you never know how fast it's over. The bass is more prominent on this piece and Cornell delivers the lyrics like a blues singer. There is an extensive instrumental section, allowing Cameron's drums to stand out together with the duelling guitars playing off each other, and abusing the wah pedal. The song's climax is the final second, suggesting not a single second of the piece is overplayed nor wasted.<br /><br />The song that pushed the album to the charts was \\"Hunger Strike\\", featuring Eddie Vedder on backing vocals. Even though Vedder sings on a total of three songs on this album, his work on \\"Hunger Strike\\" is the most noticeable. His expressive tenor voice does a great job complementing Cornell's more throaty and bluesy singing. The duo particularly shine during the chorus and the vocal harmonies are both amazing and emotive. The guitar melody that supplements their singing is also among the best on this disc. Interestingly, \\"Call Me a Dog\\" is severely overlooked by some fans even though it is another standout number. Complete with hammering blues piano, elegiac guitar themes, and heart-wrenching vocals, the song also features a very moving solo at the end. \\"Times of Trouble\\" follows in a similar vein, addressing addiction as its subject matter, and featuring both piano and harmonica to add more texture.<br /><br />This being a tribute album lamenting the loss of a close friend, most of the songs are slow and bleak. Highlighted by plenty of blues licks and melancholic vocals, none of the songs are as heavy as some of the stuff on Soundgarden or Pearl Jam albums. However, there are still a couple of tracks where the band churns out some rocking leads and rhythms. The somewhat funky bass on \\"Pushin Forward Back\\", one of the few tracks with contribution from other members, is relatively more melodic and fast-paced, but how well it fits the flow of the album is questionable. Same goes for \\"Your Savior\\", another piece with Vedder on backing harmonies (hardly audible though), solid drum and bass rhythms and weird, and unusual vocal harmonies. Other highlights include the percussion on \\"All Night Thing\\"; the intense \\"Wooden Jesus\\" where Cornell questions the impact of religion on the individual; and the heartfelt ballad \\"Four Walled World\\", with more ripping screams at its finale.<br /><br />Even though far from being a pure grunge release, Temple of the Dog is historically significant both in that it helped spawn the Seattle scene and proved how powerful music can be if written in the right mindset. Cornell has never sung like this again, nor have we heard Vedder or McCready play with so much emotion. Goes to show some things can never be recreated, and that's what makes this album so special.cularly shine during the chorus and the vocal harmonies are both amazing and emotive.

Even though far from being a pure grunge release, Temple of the Dog is historically significant both in that it helped spawn the Seattle scene and proved how powerful music can be if written in the right mindset. Cornell has never sung like this again, nor have we heard Vedder or McCready play with so much emotion. Goes to show some things can never be recreated, and that's what makes this album so special.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|Decemberunderground is an album that bears witness to a sad irony: AFI now sound like the bands who aped their sound to begin with.  In other words, this album sounds like a second-rate Sing the Sorrow, with a few other infelicitous qualities throw in for (not so) good measure. Does Decemberunderground wear its 80's influences on its proverbial sleave?  Yes, and while that would not necessarily be a bad thing, it just seems unoriginal here, especially in light of the glut of bands who are currently doing the same thing.  Does this album sound like emo?  In spots, unfortunately yes.  And when I say \\"emo,\\" I mean bands who effuse emotions without substance, twenty-something suburbanites who find the responsibilities of growing up to be oh-so-hard and pain the rest of us by putting their whining to song. Thankfully, Decemberunderground is only emo-esque at points, but even that is too much from a band whose last album (Sing the Sorrow) was a triumph of emotion, of somberness and frustration intertwined.      None of this is to say that Decemberunderground is a bad album, that it does not have its catchy songs or its more memorable lyrics.  But it is to say that it is a more forgettable, more mainstream, and less artful album by a band who formerly, with a bit of punk and a bit of goth, created high art.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I've been waiting forever for this to come out on DVD, I was fortunate enough to see them in concert on this tour twice, it's like being there again. A must for every fan.
0060922583|2.0|...and dump it...great advice given in a previous review.<br /><br />I think the \\"shame\\" about this book is that it glosses over some very interesting ideas with (in my opinion) some wholly unsupported and mostly un-related crap.<br /><br />Talbot is to the theory of the Holographic Universe what Mark Furman was to the guilt of OJ Simpson.  Whatever truth there is to it will be hidden by his presentation of \\"false evidence\\".
B000F1IQNM|5.0|Interesting take on the Mary Poppins phenomenon: Where morals are placed into some relatively ambiguous situations.  The theme here sounds a little dicey, but somehow it all works because of the great performances by the incomparable Emma Thompson and the more than adept Colin Firth. <br />  <br />There are several tough turn-your-head-away-you really-don't-want-to-see-this scenes, particularly early on in the film where the kids behave ever so badly to other prospective nannies.  However, in the end, it is a great family film.
B000008I4Z|4.0|...Unless you are willing to give it time to sink in. This is one of those 'Concept' albums that few listeners will get instant gratification from. When I first recieved \\"Brave\\", I gave it the mandatory three spins before I even tried to come to any conclusions. Well, I decided that I did in fact like several songs/musical passages, but as a whole, it didn't quite strike me as much as more acsessible releases from the band such as \\"Afraid of Sunlight\\", \\"Seasons End\\" or \\"Holidays in Eden\\". So I ended up 'shelving' this release for several months----my mistake! After viewing the awesome \\"Marbles\\" DVD (deluxe edition), the material from \\"Brave\\" really captured my attention...enough so that I 'unshelved' the CD and gave it several more listens. Lucky Me...thats exactly what it took for me to see the light...\\"the bright lights and the noise\\". Now I can honestly say that I like everything about this album (with the possible exception of \\"Paper Lies\\"). Personal highlights are \\"Bridge\\", \\"Living With the Big Lie\\", \\"Goodbye to All That\\", \\"Alone Again in the Lap of Luxury\\", \\"The Great Escape\\" and \\"Made Again\\"....but again, I like the album as a 'Whole'. Now, as other reviewers have stated, this isn't a 'sunny', 'happy' listening experience---it is definitely a dark, somber story of a tortured (misplaced?) childhood. I would agree with another reviewer here...this album can instantly bring you 'down' and  be somewhat depressing, so its not an album you will want to put on just anytime. But when your in that kind of mood, this will take you to a wonderful, Strange place that few albums can. 4.5 Stars...Strongly recommended if your willing!

B0002W18MU|5.0|This release can be described as one his best from the last decade, even if Johhny passed away he hit No.1 in US.<br /><br />American Recordings V has been eagerly awaited since Johnny Cash passed in 2003, probably especially so after the \\"Walk The Line\\" film has placed Johnny Cash squarely back into popular culture focus.<br /><br />For those familiar with the American Recordings series, this title is the most mellow of the bunch. It is similar in tone to much of the 'Redemption Songs' disc from the Unearthed box if you need a reference point.<br /><br />The recording is superb, understated and melodic acoustic guitar backing Mr Cash's vocals, which were recorded independently of the musicians. Rick Rubin (producer) states in the sleeve notes that Johnny's vocals were sometimes weak during these sessions, but somehow the delivery adds such an extra dimension and gravity to the songs.<br /><br />Standout tracks for my mind are 'God's Gonna Cut You Down' with a stomping feet backing, and 'Like The 309' which features the great couplet: \\"Talk about luck, well, I got mine/ Asthma coming down like the 309\\" followed by a wheezy exhale over a bluesy shuffle backing. Yes, Mr Cash had IT right to the very end. Cover versions of Hank Williams' 'On The Evening Train' and Gordon Lightfoot's 'If You Could Read My Mind' are also fantastic.<br /><br />If you are a recent fan of Johnny Cash based on seeing 'Walk The Line' this is probably not the place to start your Johnny Cash collection. Only because you probably wouldn't recognise the voice, for Johnny's vocals mellowed into something much different than the voice which sung 'Walk The Line' and 'Folsom Prision Blues' back in the 1950's. For an introduction to Mr Cash I thoroughly recommend the only single disc compilation to sum up all facets of Johnny's career: The Legend of Johnny Cash. If you have this and enjoy the Rick Rubin produced tracks- you will enjoy this disc.<br /><br />I you love the American Recordings series, which I must admit I do, this volume is magnificent and well worth the wait. High praise to Rick Rubin for his work on getting this release completed. The only shame is that the man himself isn't around to read the reviews and take in the acclaim. But you know that somehow he is.rdings series, which I must admit I do, this volume is magnificent and well worth the wait. High praise to Rick Rubin for his work on getting this release completed.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|much like post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd, this obviously isn't going to have the same style that die hard old school Pink Floyd fans, like myself, are used to.  However, this is an awesome album, and I disagree that \\"Take a Breath\\" is a bad song.. its a great song.. kind of reminds me of \\"Money\\" on DSOTM, where its definitely a good song, but feels completely different from the rest of the album.. almost like an intermission period.   <br /> <br />Either way, great album, worth the buy, and you can definitely tell Gilmour enjoyed himself while making such a wonderful album.
B000002H4Q|5.0|I followed the infectious scent of Just Like Heaven (the greatest pop song ever written) to this album, and found myself listening to one of the greatest records I've ever heard. A few of my favorite songs on this record are as follows: <br /> <br />Torture <br />If Only Tonight We Could Sleep <br />Why Can't I Be You <br />Just Like Heaven <br />All I Want <br />Shiver and Shake <br /> <br />There's just so much mood and euphoria in these songs. The greatness of Just Like Heaven spills over into all the other compositions. Love it! Always will.  <br /> <br />
0618477942|5.0|I have been a fan of Ms. Bechdel for years, and I have collected all the books in her Dykes To Watch Out For series. I wasn't sure how she'd handle her autobiography, and I was pleasantly surprised to see she drew it in comic form, the same as her DTWOF series. Even for those who are not already fans, this is a must-read.  It's funny, touching, sad and poignant, and I'm sure I'll read it over and over again.
B0007LCNKM|4.0|What does that mean? I'm not sure. Frankly, a lot of 'The National's' lyrics are, in the vein of something like Interpol, a bit on the absurd, nonsensical side. Maybe I'm just too daft and attention deficient to really concentrate on the more quirky words, but like Interpol, these guys' have the ability to combine oft bizzare lyrics with lovely music and a distinct, charming personality. These guys are, dare I say it, cool.  <br /> <br />As is the case with some of the lyrics, I don't really know how to verbalize 'Alligator', suffice to say, it's pretty wonderful. Took a bit to grow on me, but when it did, it really did; dug into my brain, as another reviewer stated. It's pretty low-key for the most part, and the songs don't pretend to be something large and pretentious, avoiding a common lack of substantiality when the album's core is reached. Substantial of course is up for debate, as most the album enjoys fixating itself on songs revolving around the various emotions of a relationship. In that sense, the album is a relief, at least for me. I'm not much into relationships and likewise am ashamedly unexperienced -- don't make me get into that -- but it doesn't really seem to matter, because the songs are still totally affecting with some imagination; I can only imagine what some of the album might bring up with more relevant circumstances. The most obvious examples of this are the surprisingly moving 'Baby We'll Be Fine' (\\"I don't know how to do this...\\"), the tender, regretful 'Val Jester' (\\"Cause one day, when she goes, she's gone.\\") , and the oddly beautiful 'Geese', which is probably my favorite song on the disc. <br /> <br />I don't know really who to recommend this album to, but I have shared it with a few people. It's a grower, certainly, and the general earnestness of it is definitely compelling and ultimately won me over. While not ecclectic, the album has a few dominant moods, primarily the more morose, intimate side and what is essentially the opposite,as heard in the lively, animated 'Friend of Mine' and the anthemic finale 'Mr November'. The remaining songs sort of hover in between these two temperaments and, for the most part, fare as well as the demeanor's they meld. <br /> <br />Like I said, it's cool. At the moment, though, 'Geese' is playing, and while it definitely possesses shades of cool, it's too damn elegant to limit these fine musicians to but one summarizing definition. When a band can pull off this matter of assuredness with two sentiments that rarely coexist, they're probably worth clinging to.
1878424777|5.0|I would give this book 1 billion stars if I could. I have read so many self-help books in my life time, but known can compare to this valuable information. I have never had a book to impact my life in such a profound and spiritual way. <br /> <br />I will be forever greatful. I can't remember who said: \\"When the student is ready the teacher will come\\" but one thing for sure it definitely pertains to me. I listen to this book on CD  every single day sometimes twice a day. I listen to it before going to work, while in my car to and from work.

0425173933|5.0|This is one of Poirot's best mysteries.  On this train, everyone is a suspect and there are few clues.<br /><br />This book dosen't have any boring parts.  It's allways fast-paced and intriguing all the way.
B000059XUI|4.0|\\"Superman II\\" picks up right where the first flick featuring Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel ends.  During the opening credits, the viewer is briefed quickly on the first film.  After that, we learn that Lex Luthor has escaped prison (leaving Otis behind bars), Superman has fallen hard for Lois Lane, and the evil trio from Krypton, headed up by Terence Stamp, are freed from their window-pane prison via an H-bomb that Superman tossed into space in order to save Paris, France and Lois Lane.<br /><br />In order to do a newstory, Clark Kent and Lois pretend to be a married couple on honeymoon at Niagara Falls.  Once there, a sequence of events leads up to Lois figuring out who Clark really is.  He gives up his powers so that he can live the life of a mortal with her.  Little does he know that once he loses his powers, his father's old Kryptonian enemies show up, take over the White House, team up with Luthor, and basically call out Superman for a big fight.  The rest of the tale unfolds with typical superhero flash.  I won't say too much more because I don't want to give everything away.<br /><br />Reeve reprises his role as the overgrown Boy Scout with flair.  His performance as Clark is even goofier than in the first flick.  Margot Kidder has lost a little edge with Lois Lane in this film, probably because she's got her love blinders on.  Gene Hackman is solid, if not funnier, as Luthor in this film.  The real scene-stealer, however, is Terence Stamp as Zod, the leader of the villainous trio of Kryptonians.  He chews up the screen with silly one-liners like, \\"Not God, ZOD!!\\"  His two lackeys are along for the ride (Jack O'Halloran and the lovely lady who's name escapes me).  The dazzling Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty have brief but funny appearances in the flick, reprising their roles as Luthor's lover and oafish henchman, respectively.<br /><br />The special effects haven't aged well at all.  Limitations are revealed in this flick that weren't as noticeable as in the first film.  The \\"power loss\\" scene where Superman gives up his powers is downright horrid to watch on the screen.  Also, there's a lot more humor tossed into this second-helping of Superman, but it never takes away from the story as much as the effects.<br /><br />The effects are understandable, and the humor is a nice touch, but the really glaring bad spot for this flick is the DVD itself.  Poor audio quality (I had to crank up my volume to hear the dialogue and then crank it down due to the loud music), only a couple of \\"special features\\" (if you call actor's film credits and a trailer, special), and the flimsy packaging all add up to a bad disc.  But, as another reviewer stated, this is currently the only version of this flick that you can pick up on DVD, so I guess we'll all have to deal with it.<br /><br />Hopefully, Warner Brothers will do something nice to this and the rest of the \\"Superman\\" flicks when the \\"Superman Returns\\" DVD hits store shelves.  It'd be nice to have these films in a decent hardback case with a couple of decent special features.  Till then, I recommend this sequel to folks like myself who've grown nostalgic about ol' Christopher Reeve since the new flick hit the screen.  He is sorely missed.<br /><br />And in case you're wondering, when I originally wrote this review, the new version everyone is writing about wasn't out yet.  It seems that a lot of people feel that my review was done on the incorrect version of this film when, in fact, I wrote this review about the DVD that I own.

B00005JOVN|2.0|Given that diesel generators do not normally produce electricity while suspended upside down, where did the lighting come from?  Pretty ordinary compared to the original where special effects were virtually non-existant.
B00005QFE5|5.0|If you are familiar with Zhang Yimou movies like: \\"Raise the Red Lantern\\", \\"Ju Dou\\", \\"To Live\\", \\"Hero\\", \\"House of Flying Daggers\\", \\"Shanghai Triad\\", \\"The Story of Qiu Ju\\", and \\"Not One Less\\", then you already know that he is a master of film making. \\"The Road Home\\" (Wo De Fu Qin Mu Qin aka My Mom and My Dad), is no exception. This is a heart warming, beautiful and powerful love story of what true love really is. Ziyi Zhang is captivating with her natural beauty and sense of realism. If you want someone to see what Asian cinema is all about, this is the film to get them to watch. This film is one of the best films of this century and in my all time top 10 list. If you want to see real film making, buy this film and put in your DVD collection.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I am 30 years old and I watch the movie for first time. It is a fantastic movie and I am very pleased of it.As C. Stuart Carter from Indianapolis said Grand Prix is the film to accompany the best sim ever, \\"Grand Prix Legends\\".Thank you for bring me the great era of 60's.
B000EGDC0A|5.0|Goldfrapp is yet another artist that I was introduced to on the Tonight Show. After I heard Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory's revitalization of synth-pop, I then listened to their first two albums to get up to speed. While those albums ARE good, Supernature still turned out to be their best album to date.<br /><br />The best parts of the album are when Alison gets sensual, like on the single \\"Ooh La La\\" and especially \\"Slide In\\". But even when the songs are more basic (for lack of a better term), they're still impressive, as evidenced by funky, rhythmic tracks like \\"Satin Chic\\" and \\"Number 1\\". But other tracks not to be missed include \\"You Never Know\\", \\"Lovely 2 C U\\", \\"Time Out From the World\\" and, hell, the whole album. If you haven't discovered Goldfrapp yet, now's the time to do it because Supernature proves that the duo has definitely struck gold.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00005JN2Z|5.0|From the outside, this movie doesn't seem like it would have very much \\"meat\\" to it.  Tom Cruise gets his chance to play a bad guy, and he puts in one of his better performances.  He plays a hitman who needs a ride.  As I suppose most hitmen would be, he's tempermental and invokes his own brand of ethics in order to justify his actions.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx portrays a run-of-the-mill Joe Nobody cab driver who gets caught picking up the \\"wrong\\" passenger.  Kind of wrong place / wrong time - squared.  As viewers, we end up putting ourselves in his place, and the result is quite a psychological thriller.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed Michael Mann movies & would not mind his making more films.  His works always bring an \\"intensity\\" to the table not normally found too often in most other films.  If you feel like being taken for a ride tonight, you can do a lot worse than COLLATERAL!!
B00081912E|5.0|I have always been a fan of movies that mix special effect animation with live action and the Mask is no exception. I would also have to say that the Mask is one of a kind in terms of unique films. There are many good things about this film aside from the well written script and good acting but I think the one thing that shines the most about the Mask is the special effects and the humor that goes along with it. For those of you who don't know, a big portion of the effects and humor from this movie stem from the old Tex Avery cartoons such as droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub dancer in a red dress (this feature is shown in the bonus section of the dvd). These kind of cartoons were always my favorite growing up aside from looney tunes. Getting back on the subject, what I also found thrilling about the Mask is how well the dog Milo was trained to perform certain task. If you have seen this movie, you know what I'm talking about. The training of the dog is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd. The movie itself was a take-off of the comic series of the Mask. Though not quite as dark as the comics, the film itself managed to portray enough adult humor and semi-violence so that the Mask would not be deemed as a children's film hence the PG-13 rating. A big plus to the Mask was how Jim Carrey portrayed the different character traits of Stanley Ipkis and Stanley Ipkis wearing the mask. Another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting hold of the mask. And of course, who can dislike Ben Stein's typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks? Oh, and Cameron Diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well. As for the dvd, this re-release is an improvement from the previous. You get 5.1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture. The added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to appreciate what was put in to making this movie.
B00002DF9N|2.0|This seems like a great deal with the amount of material and the price, but the truth is \\"cheap price, cheap recordings\\" . I highly suggest if you want to get the most of Richard Strauss's tone poems you should buy  different recordings. The main thing I was disappointed with on this box set was the recording of An Alpine Symphony.  The recording of the alpine symphony was too old and weak, sloppy and loud (only at times),and just ok overall. The alpine symphony is on the first cd so I after I listened to that, I had a bad attitude about the rest of it. Even though, all of the other recordings are pretty good or ok.<br /><br />Personally, I would suggest Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic when it comes to Richard Strauss's tone poems.
0307001466|5.0|This is a classic story book.  Very simple, but the best thing about it are the pictures by the late Disney Legend Mary Blair.

B0007OASII|5.0|The power metal kings strike again with The Black Halo which is one amazing piece of metal mastery.  From the opener March of Miphesto I was enthralled by this album with its soaring melodies, driving beats and intricate guitar solos...I was mesmerized.  Roy's amazing vocal range is really shown off here with tracks like: The Haunting, Soul Society and Abandoned.  All the songs are incredibly melodic and catchy yet still make you want to bang your head.  One other thing to mention here is the symphonic parts which give this album its epic feel and really helps to round out the band's sound. The Black Halo is one incredible musical journey one which everyone should take.
0684824906|5.0|&#34;Team of Rivals&#34; is an exceptional book about America's most trying time.  Doris Kearns Goodwin sets the stage by richly detailing the life and times of Abraham Lincoln and his key cabinet members.  By this device, we understand even more thoroughly the amazing political career of Mr. Lincoln, going from defeat to defeat only to emerge triumphant to lead a divided Republican Party in 1860 to victory in a divided nation.<br /><br />President Lincoln, seeing his nation's dire situation, set out to surround himself with political rivals - enemies really - because he needed their talents and their constituencies to hold the Union together through its toughest test: a great civil war.  Through extensive research, much of it original, Ms. Goodwin tells this tale and makes us feel as if we are witnesses to history.<br /><br />My only critique is a small one: too much time was spent detailing the private life of Kate Chase, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase's daughter, and to a lesser extent, the lives of the relations of the other cabinet members.<br /><br />&#34;Team of Rivals&#34; is a must-read for anyone interested in Civil War history or as a study of political leadership at its best.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. He served in the California State Assemblyman from 2004 to 2010. Before his election, he was an executive in the aerospace industry.

B0000073I5|3.0|I love Genesis. This is a decent enough solo project. I'm not thrilled by the entire set list, but there are some nice instrumental passages. However I do feel that overall the depth of the sound is not full enough. Even when there are guitars, keyboards, bass and drums trying to impart something dramatic it just lacks impact. Even the singer has a very middle-of-the road vocals that seem to plague a lot of Genesis solo efforts, (obviously not including Phil and Peter's solo work.) Not a must have, but something for the curious.
0811833887|4.0|The colorful artwork in this book really gives you an idea of the development that a film like \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" goes through to get to the screen.  It is also inspiring because it shows that art in film specifically is a genesis -- and can be very collaborative.

B000EULJLU|5.0|AFAIAC This is the Master of Puppets from tool. If you were in high school when puppets came out you'd know what I mean. The CD is pretty good at first, but it becomes part of you after listening to it straight through daily. It's hard to compare tool CD's to other tool offerings for me because they offer such distinct, yet varied sounds from their library of masterpieces, that it's hard to describe so I chose to share memories of master of puppets in high-school to describe it. The tape (back when those existed), or CD was in every persons car stereo for an entire school year, from the football team to the nerds, and that was all you heard anywhere, and you were absolutely psyched to hear it every time you hopped into someone's car. That's what I think of this tool CD. It has the same feel to it. They sound nothing alike, but it's got that kind of power that you just cant ignore.
0375758992|4.0|Having personal knowledge of the area and time she writes about, I enjoyed the read very much. Fuller writes in a unique style which takes a little getting used to but you do so quickly and enjoy her form and the reader gets quickly engaged. Unlike her next book, Scribbling the Cat (which I do not recommend), this is factual as far as I could determine and well worth the read. I still think that MUKIWA is still superior but this is a close second.

B0001ZX0OW|5.0|MYSTIC RIVER is an excellent movie which deserved the ton of praise it received at the time it was released in 2003. The plot centers around the tragedy that unfolds as one of three boyhood friends is abducted by two pedophiles while playing on the street in a tough working class neighborhood in Boston. By the time the three former pals reach adulthood they are no longer friends, but the murder of a daughter of one of the men brings them back in contact with each other. This is definitely not a feel-good film but it is certainly unforgettable. <br /> <br />The leading roles are played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden. The director is Clint Eastwood and the movie is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane.
B000FMGTTE|4.0|The John Ottman score for the beautifully created feature film SUPERMAN RETURNS is a fitting and mostly worthy score for the film. No one can completely replace John Williams, but his original themes are peppered nicely thoughout the score, especially the universally recognizable Superman Theme...seems to me like this release doesn't quite match up to the music in the film as it appears a tad short on the running time...could we see a complete motion picture score to coincide with the impending DVD release?  Let's hope so.  Superman Returns, indeed.
0618477942|4.0|If I hadn't read Art Spiegelman's \\"MAUS: A SURVIVORS TALE\\" <br />I probably wouldn't have read Alison Bechdel's \\"Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic.\\" I was curious to see if Bechdel's execution of the \\"graphic novel\\" was as successful as Spiegelman's and in my opinion she doesn't just match his success she actually comes out ahead. <br />     When comparing artwork Spiegelman wins because he had the hard task of getting people to see a human tragedy using a stereotypic group of animals as the people. It shouldn't have worked but it did. <br />     Where Bechdel comes out the winner is in the area of interest in subject matter. By this I mean that Spiegelman wrote on a subject that is of interest to a lot of people but Bechdel wrote about something that probably appeals to a smaller slice of society, in my opinion a much harder sell.  Many readers may not be interested in the relationship between a father and daughter who are both gay.  Yet \\"Fun Home\\" is as compelling and important as the Spiegelman book. It too is a \\"survivors tale.\\" One that shows that Bechdel knows that the long stretches of everyday life that get lost between the drama are as important as the drama in defining a life. In her attention to detail she shows us real people. And because they suffer alone they are much harder to see.
0451196716|5.0|I read this short novel over 14 years ago while in high school. It's still one of my all time favorites and in a way, it still haunts me. I remember the characters vividly: Garraty, McVries, Baker, Olson, Barkavitch, etc. All unique and likeable in their own ways. How many stories can you say that about, where you clearly remember characters 15 years later? The plot been told here in other reviews, but it's simply the ultimate test of mind over body, with exceptional dialogue between the characters, as they try to figure out why they are doing this and what's led them here. I'm sure our soldiers in the Middle East have similar thoughts. You really get involved and feel like you know these guys. It's also an extremely prescient tale. Just look at the limits today's reality shows take contestants to: we are really heading towards a day where someone will die on something like Fear Factor or Road Rules Challenge and no one will bat an eye. On Road Rules Fresh Meat yesterday they were swimming with sharks! But this novel is so much better than anything you'll ever see on t.v., trust me. I wish the ending were a little stronger, and would love to here King talk about it sometime. You will not regret reading this.
B000003TAW|5.0|i've been listening to this masterpiece since \\"buddy holly,\\" \\"undone\\" and \\"say it ain't so\\" were popular on MTV!  to this day, it remains simply one of the best albums i've ever heard.  weezer had played these songs a million times before they recorded the blue album, but they pushed the songs to absolute perfection in the studio.  the production on songs like \\"the world has turned and left me here\\" and \\"say it ain't so\\" is absolutely breathtaking.  the guitar sounds rivers and brian cranked out of their marshall stacks is absolute rock fan BLISS.   <br /> <br />there's many emotions on this album, but the main vibe is upbeat and sing-along.  this DOES NOT mean it's a shallow album.  there's a lot of depth here.  \\"my name is jonas\\" is about people wasting their lives working for \\"the man.\\"  \\"no one else\\" is a love song of jealousy.  \\"the world has turned\\" is a beautiful, heartbreaking love song.\\"  \\"buddy holly\\" is on the shallow side, but it's catchy so who cares?  \\"only in dreams\\" remains perhaps the most devastating love song i've ever heard.  some indie fans will put down the blue album and say pavement is so much better or whatever.. don't listen to them.  music is for the people, and everyone i've ever known who heard the blue album has loved it.  also check out pinkerton, for a very different vibe but 5-star rock music.
B0007LHBZE|4.0|Two cars drag race on a desolate stretch of road in rural Kansas.  One car runs off a bridge, plunges into a deep river and quickly sinks.  All three young women inside are assumed dead.  However, hours after the crash, one woman emerges from the river, alive and unharmed, but unable or unwilling to explain her miraculous survival. <br /> <br />That intriguing premise, ladies and gentlemen, is merely the pre-credits opening sequence of CARNIVAL OF SOULS. <br /> <br />I hadn't heard of this movie before.  However, quick trips to IMDB and Wikipedia tell me that I should have.  It was an cheap, obscure, throwaway flick when it was first released, but has gained a cult following in the decades since.  And it's easy to see why.  Because despite its flaws, there is a lot of atmosphere and horror here. <br /> <br />The story follows Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), the young woman inexplicably left alive when all reason would indicate that she be dead.  Following the accident, she leaves town as she has been hired as a church organist in Utah.  During her trip, she is haunted by bizarre and unexplainable visions.  After her arrival, the sightings continue and she finds herself drawn to a mysterious, abandoned carnival.  Also, despite making a serious impression on a man living in her building, she begins temporarily slipping out of reality, unable to make herself seen or heard by those around her. <br /> <br />I'm not the first (nor will I be the last) to notice that CARNIVAL OF SOULS has the definite feel of a lost, elongated episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE (indeed, it contains similar themes to \\"The Hitchhiker\\", although CARNIVAL is creepier and has more going on).  This is very atmospheric, very creepy and unsettling.  It's the kind of movie you watch and then don't want to look out of dark windows at night because if you don't look, you won't have to see what's out there. <br /> <br />I liked that the central character is both an identification point (we, like her, want todiscover what is going on around her) and a enigmatic mystery.  How did she survive the car crash?  That event must have something to do with her visions, but what is the connection?  Why is she drawn to the carnival?   <br /> <br />Of course, I found it difficult to watch CARNIVAL without being distracted by the cheap production values and numerous technical flaws.  While occasionally the mistakes add to the atmosphere of confusion, overall they can't help but detract from the film as a whole.  Keep in mind that this film gets a lot of attention based on how good it is despite its flaws.  So don't go into it expecting perfection. <br /> <br />However, those flaws almost enhance the genuinely effective moments, because they seem to rise like roses out of, well, if not manure, than certainly ordinary film making.  There are many creepy individual shots I'll remember, most of which concern the unnerving ghostly apparitions.  Sometimes simple, primitive special effects are more chilling than there expensive counterparts, and the shots of the specters stalking the protagonist are clear evidence of that. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the ending of the film.  Sometimes a script will attempt to explain too much, leaving the movie feeling a little too neat.  Other times, the producers will leave things so vague as to render any coherent theory impossible.  CARNIVAL hit the magic median for me.  I got a lot out of the ending, and was happy to see that while there are numerous theories on-line \\"explaining\\" the conclusion, not one of them exactly lines up with my own.  I like that about a film. <br /> <br />The inexpensive Digiview Productions release of this DVD is quite watchable, and while I'm sure the Criterion version has a vastly superior picture, this is great for people like me who are discovering this for the first time.
0393327655|5.0|This is a truly brilliant tome and argues a POV that deserves discussion. For several years, I've been hostile to all forms of religion (particularly, but not limited to, the monotheistic faiths) and Harris has encapsulated my otherwise rambling arguments very well. My only quibble is with Harris's acceptance of psychic phenomenon, proven no better than is the existence of gods, and his uncritical efforts to promote a specific approach to Buddhism as an alternative, evidently having not reached a comfort level sans \\"spirituality.\\" But his discussion of faith as a potentially--nay, certified--danger to people in the 21st century is solid and cogently presented. And he's been kind enough to confine the necessary digression to the exhaustive footnotes in the back; those footnotes, in and of themselves, make for fascinating reading. <br /> <br />This book is a must-have on any atheist/agnostic's bookshelf and deserves scrutiny by people of faith who might question religion's effects on modern society. His conclusion is inspiring--the demolition of all religions and return to the fundamental of the Enlightenment, scrupulous reason and popular respect for the scientific process--though I realize that this hope is quite dreamy and highly unlikely, given the very nature of our Christ-haunted United States. But the subject cries out for discussion nevertheless.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Best damn WW2 series I have ever Seen! I definately recommend it to anyone and everyone :)
0393312836|4.0|I found A Clockwork Orange very slow to begin with but about half way through it picked up and became very interesting. <br />This book has been recommended to me by many a friend and they have all claimed that the main character, Alex aged 15, would annoy me with his violent attacks and Burgess would create situations where I, the reader, would feel rage towards Alex and at others times, sympathy.  I was surprised then to find that the story didn't really evoke any feeling from me. <br />What kept me hooked was the way that Burgess has written A Clockwork Orange,  The clever way that the title is woven into the story and the way in which Alex speaks and narrates the story.  Alex has his way of speaking and as I read the first chapter I tried to decode what he was saying which I found hard and stressful.  I then read the first chapter again but this time I just accepted the strange words (slovo, ptitsa, bezoomny, litso etc) and the reading of the book became easier and the meaning of these words became very clear and no longer a problem.  I think these words help the reader relate to Alex but also, especially at the beginning, alienate the reader from him as well. <br />This is a really good book and I'm glad that I didn't give up on it.
B00005JP5J|5.0|I caught this movie at a free screening and it has been a long time since I heard people clap and laugh hysterically (lots of snorting) in a theatre.  Little Miss Sunshine is a comedy with an indie feel and follows a family as they transport their daughter (Olive played by Abigail Brensen) to a children's beauty pageant via their VW bus. Many van breakdowns and other hijinx occur.  The movie is perfectly cast with many good comic actors, Greg Kinnear (determined Father), Steve Carell (suicidal Uncle), Alan Arkin (cracked out Grandfather), Toni Collette (seemingly functional Mother).  Abigail Brensen and Paul Dano (Dwayne, Olive's brother) really outshine in their roles.  The brother Dwayne does not even speak in his scenes for the majority of the movie but gives fantastic presence regardless.  They are a very funny, very dysfunctional family.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I am the first to admit it. When I heard of the title of the movie, I said this have to be a stupid movie. I never bothered to get it but a friend of mine made me watch it.  I was blown completely away, how sarcastic this picture was. It's a movie that you have to pay attention because they throw the jokes so fast you'll miss a lot of them.  It's very sarcastic, I will tell you this if you live in a quiet neighborhood? Please don't watch it too late because you'll disturb your neighbors by laughing to loud.  I will promise you THAT you will laugh very very loud!  This is a detective story that has a lot of twists in the movie. I will also say that if you're thinking about buying it, you will enjoy this movie over and over again!  This is a type of movie that gonna have a cult following.  This is Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. best work and if you asked them they tell you the same thing.  I know I haven't told you much on this film because it's best you don't know much about it because they are pioneering some new forms of comedy. I promise you will definately wake up your neighbors if you watch it too late at night.  It's a rollorcoaster of entertainment a must for you collection.
B000BYY0RY|3.0|While I hold Madonna as the Queen of Pop, I hold Kylie as the Princess of Pop.  I've loved her from Locomotion all through I Believe but I have yet to see a concert of hers that truly moves me.  The most moving live performance I have seen from her is her Brit Awards show Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head.  I'd like Kylie to really dance and not just walk around the stage for one, get rid of \\"dancers\\" who only pose and not dance on stage as they do on this DVD, and hire a production team that can produce a show with captivating visuals and moving sound mixing(stop using neon paint and peace symbols, so overdone).  I have watched this DVD several times and it fails to make me get up in my living room and dance.  Kylie is talented and I'd just like to see her take it to the next level.  Buy this DVD only if you are a hardcore Kylie fan.
B000F5GO0A|3.0|Bloggers have been hyping this thing for a while, so I bought it, but found it to be more or less a standard indie attempt at complex instrumentation.  It's interesting, but it's nothing special.
0767817710|1.0|I have seen this film several times and still can not figure out if it's suppose to be a comedy or a drama.  If it's a comedy, it's very bad.  If it is suppose to be serious, it's even worse.  The characters overact and are totally unbelievable.  The plot is very predictable, and the dialog, well, it must have been written by a thirteen year old, if that. <br /> <br />In one scene, Sharon Stone walks up to Gene Hackman.  Hackman says, \\"You got a problem with me\\".  Sharon Stone snarls. \\"I'll let you know.\\"  I died laughing. <br /> <br />Looking at all the four and five star reviews, I have concluded I must have been watching a different movie.  I have just watched it again......it's a comedy.
B000FIMG68|5.0|after i bought the first season of Lost, i became a Lost-aholic and tuned in every Wednesday to watch the show. the first season focused on the castaways, there lives before the crash, problems they had, and unresolved issues. in the second season, since we are now familier with the castaways, the show focuses more on the mystery's. like the 'Others', the hatch, the island, and everything else. the season begins only moments before the season 1 ender, we learn the hatch is like a underground home with a guy inside it named Desmond. they learn of a button that must be pressed every 108 minutes or supposidly, the world will end. meanwhile, after there raft is destroyed Jin, Micheal, and Sawyer land on the other end of the island and discover that the survivors of the back end of the plane, which we though was destroyed, are ok. this introduces new characters Anna-Lucia, Libby, and Mr. Eco. the rest of the season plays out like season 1, we learn more about the new characters, and some new mystery's. besides the mystery's we still learn more of the survivors. we learn what Kate did to put her on the run, what happened to Claire during her two week abduction, more of Sayid's past, and plenty more. the one episode i like the most was the one were we learn about the other 48 days were we learn about the tallie's. the season finale is also a great episode, and like the first season finale we are left with a cliffhanger that will leave everyone pondering over the summer until season 3. a great season, a must for every fan.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|I was a strong Sarah McLachlan fan up until she released Surfacing. NOw, I like Surfacing, but I felt it was inferior to her earlier albums. Then, she took a long break and, like so many others, I thought \\"Great! she will be rested and blow us all away!\\" Wrong, Afterglow is the worst of all Sarah's albums. It is unimaginative, boring and not as musically solid as Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Touch and Solace. Case in point, the last song on the album, Dirty Little Secret, is actually painful to listen to for me. It is awkward musically--choppy and discordant--and lyrically it is only slightly better than Britney Spears' attempt at song writing with, Dear Diary (don't bother listening to that song--it is trash). <br />Having said all that, I do like a some of the songs on Afterglow: <br /> <br />Stupid <br />Fallen <br />Drifting <br /> <br />This just was not a justified purchase (not to mention a justified wait of 5 years). It was almost like she realized at some point, \\"Oh wait! I have a music career, don't I? I better put something out quick so I can support my family.\\" <br />If I were you, I would pick up her first three albums and maybe Surfacing (it is at least better than Afterglow).
B000002UAR|5.0|One of the best albums of all time, and the Beatles finest accomplishment of non-whimsical psychedelic rock. The bonus tracks like \\"Doctor Robert\\" that aren't on the US version make it all the better! A real nice mixture of pop, indian and gritty rock and roll.
0895260131|5.0|Having a liberal mindset, at first I agreed with the majority of the left that extremists were responsible for the violent muslim terrorism in the world and not Islam itself. Furthermore, the treatment of muslims in the United States (and muslim \\"look a-likes\\") was unquestionably horrible. However, I am also well aqainted with Islam, having read the koran and other important works, and I knew that Islam is not the peaceful religion that liberals claim it to be. <br /> <br />This book is extremely accurate, in that it uses an excellent mix of historical fact, qu'ranic text, and the speaches/teachings of Muslim scholars to show that while not all muslims condone terrorism, those that do are actually being far more true to their faith, which was founded on violence and teaches violence. In the same sense, religious leaders like Phelps hold far more literal interpretations of the bible than the majority of Christians. The difference is that the bible is subject to interpretation and never directly advocates violence (especially in the ghandi-like teachings of Jesus), which is why very few (if any) christian terrotists have ever killed in the name of passages in the bible. In fact, the gross majority of christian fundamentslists, while having controversial beleifs are never violent (except in the case of murdering abortion doctors, which while in my opinion is unexcusable, is at least understandable at a non-religious level). <br /> <br />Spencer points out through surveys, that in Islamic countries, high percentages of people do condone jihad violence against the west - and they should, their religion literally commands it! However, Spencer never appears bigoted. He does not attack people but rather the religion which they follow, which according to history, they only follow because because their ancestors were forced to by Muhammad and later muslim leaders through warfare and unmatched religious intolerance legislation. <br /> <br />The more one comes to understand Islam, the more one realizes how dangerous it really is, and this book does an excellent job in delineating the problems which cause people to kill in Islam, while clearing up lies about the crusades and showing the unmatchable intolerance of muslim societies against nomuslims and women. It is also noteworthy to add that this book is readable in liberal and conservative circles. While I got the distinct impression that the author is Christian, he goes on to defend secularism and often quotes atheists as well as theoligans, politicians, and historians. The end product is relatively moderate. Though I expect that many liberals will never even open this book due to the lies in the media today/the title (which is admittedly not liberal friendly), I, as a liberal urge everyone who can to read this book. <br /> <br />Other reccomended reading on the subject: Howard Bloom, the Lucifer Principle. <br /> This helps to understand why people are violent in the name of ideas/religions, and has a very long section on Islam which caused Howard Bloom and his publishing house to be subsequently threatened by muslims.
B000002UDB|5.0|While not a favorite of critics, Magical Mystery Tour shows the Beatles during the height of psychedelia. Great songs, some awesome studio work and a nice follow up to Sgt. Pepper which was released the same year. My personal favorite Beatles song of all time is included, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and the album contains what in my opinion is Harrison's best guitar work. Buy it, You'll love it if you love the Beatles!
0142800821|2.0|On this side of the Atlantic, newspapers are so desparate to entice people away from the internet and TV that they advertise attractive freebies with the purchase of their paper. Usually it's a CD or DVD, but now they're also offering audio books, which is how I ended up with this one. I can honestly say I never would have spent any money on either the audio or printed version. <br />To be fair, there are a lot of interesting titbits in the book/CD, such as the history of the punctuation marks. (Whoever would have thought \\"comma\\" came from a Greek word for \\"cut off\\", or that punctuation stated as a way for actors to know if they would be delivering a long, medium or short monolgue?) And yes, the appearance of apostrophes in standard plurals annoys me to bits as well. The author does have enough of a sense of humour to admit she's a stickler, and tells the story of how she was grossly unfair to her teenage American pen pal in a way that I can empathise with. But her sense of humour and decency go only so far. <br />I just find too many things about this book unsympathetic, and the overall hypocrisy is unforgivable. Having not seen the printed word version, I wonder if during her rant about punctuation being the key to clear communication she remembered to put a full stop/period after the abbreviation in \\"fruit and veg\\"? And why can't she say \\"the Fruit and Vegetable seller\\" while going on and on about proper British English? <br />The most irritating thing about the book is the oft repeated extremely ethnocentric \\"without proper punctuation, you aren't thinking clearly\\" thesis. Really? A mathematician coming up with formulas is using commas and question marks, as the cardiac surgeon is being careful not to use apostrophes as he saws through the ribcage? And what about natives of tongues where there is little to no punctuation? Are these automtically savages in need of a kindly imperial overlord to show them the right way and teach them glorious English, the \\"languageof the Bible\\" as Shaw's Henry Higgins says? <br />This book should be treated as light entertainment, and shouldn't be taken nearly as seriously as I have done. You can learn some things from it, but do take it all with a big pinch of salt.
B000002UA9|4.0|While mainly covers, it is still clear that from the three beatle-written songs on the album that they would become the greatest band of all time. And the covers are great too, although \\"Boys\\" really doesn't make sense because they started changing the genders in the lyrics. Still really good album, but go for the real classics first.
B000001IPL|5.0|Ive been listening to this album for what feels like forever. and i still analyse the songs and relate. For those who know the offspring and what there newer albums have to offer please for the love of god check this out and it will be a life changing experience.. then thank me! After all who else writes legendary lines like \\"if you look away, you'll be doing what they say, and if you look alive you will be singled out and tried\\" i mean who? Also(going off the album) you get a cance to see them live, the atmosphere created is one of a kind.
B00004YZFR|4.0|While not a piece of cinematic brilliance, if you like the Stones and rockumentaries you'll be pleased. It has some nice footage and really shows what happened at Altamont, which is what the film mainly focuses on. If your looking for a film full of performances, this is not it, though there is footage of some songs from the '69 tour before Altamont, as well as a great clip of Tina Turner, who opened for the Stones during the tour. Check out the book True Adventures of the Rolling Stones for more from '69 Stones!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|There are plenty of fans well-versed in the buzz of breakthrough musical acts who may feel repelled by Sufjan Steven's seemingly folksy hubris. The long song titles, soft-hearted folk balladeer reputation and overly-ambitious goal of releasing 50 albums that represent each US state seem to create an image of simple hype for a wimpy prodigy praised for his youth and prolificacy.  <br /> <br />The solution, as with any bad impression you get of a praised figure in the pop echelon, is to listen to it, of course. The sincerity immediately shines through the appearance of snootiness, as fully developed and realized songwriting; a lush, imaginative palate of instruments; and a choirlike swirl of backup singing serve as a backdrop for Stevens' gentle, unobtrusive voice to deliver the listener epicly personal lyrics. The elements build together to feel anthemic, urgent and angelic. <br /> <br />Illinois is, without a doubt, worth a listen. Despite the personal feel and melancholy tone there are spots of elation along with the humor of the longwinded titles to keep the world knowing that Sufjan Stevens isn't out to shower you with remorse or emotional turmoil, but instead to offer a glimmering look at the joys of life and the knowledge of self-worth.

0515123447|2.0|Amazingly tedious for a thriller.  Reacher is a good character, believable in his expertise, but a bit cold blooded in his use of violence. The book takes too long to tell everything (and I mean everything) - it seems every minute of the week long plot is chronicled as is every thought Reacher has (many repeated over and over). I hope Child fixed these flaws in later books.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|This is the first film of the director's where he completely misses his mar: Think \\"Abbot and Costello Meet Fairy Tale Theatre.\\"  Their mischaracterization of the Grimm Brothers is inexcusable. The real Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were born in Hanau, Germany, studied law at the University of Marburg, became amateur folklore collectors, were in short, the exact OPPOSITE of the con-men characters who bear their names in this otherwise incredibly entertaining fantasy. Why the writer or director felt such fictionalization was neccesary is beyond me. Other reviewers who talk about the historical accuracies of this film leave me completely baffled, other than recognizing that Germany was under Napoleonic occupation at this point in that country's history, this film fails in most other points of historical accuracy. Marvelously magickal special effects and wonderful attention to detail on the actual \\"fairy tales\\" themselves leave me to wonder how they could have blundered so badly in the portrayals of the title characters.

It's definitley worth a look. <br /> <br />This quadrilogy set to the \\"Alien\\" films may or may not be the final release to these films. But if there is another re-release it will be hard to top this one.
0060899190|5.0|I received my UPS box just as I was leaving for work, and I opened it and took the Post Secret book with me so that I could look at it on a break or at lunch. At a red light, I started flipping through the pages. I had to stop. I read the entire book right then, in my car. It is so beautiful, I want to give it to my friends. I want to read it with every single one of my friends and talk about the beautiful artwork on and in the secrets. I want to give it to a stranger and let that person fall in love, like the random stranger who gave me the link to the blog where people express themselves in such meaningful, quiet, and unignorable ways.

038073186X|5.0|In many ways, \\"Shutter Island\\" is a typical Dennis Lehane book, and in many other ways, it isn't. If you have read other books by this author, you'll notice the easy yet hard, dry style of narrative, the complex characters with lots of skeletons in their closets, the seemingly impossible investigation and the brilliant descriptions of places that come alive in the readers' minds.<br /><br />On the other hand, this time nothing is what it seems. For example, in the Kenzie/Gennaro series, there are many plot twists, but all of them are based on reality, on characters' motivations and actions. But on Shutter Island anything can happen, because it's a prison for the most dangerous and crazy psycopaths in the country.<br /><br />Sheriffs Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule arrive on Shutter Island on the eve of a tremendous hurricane storm, in order to find Rachel Solando, a woman who has murdered her three children. Rachel was able to get out of her locked cell, past a bunch of guards and has disappeared in the island. As Teddy and Chuck try to find out what happened to the lost woman, they get to know the doctors, servants, guards and even pacients of the place. With terrible secrets connecting their past lives with the present in Shutter Island, Teddy and Chuck don't know if, as the time passes and they unfold what's really happening at the island, they could get saner or crazier.<br /><br />Dennis Lehane's departures from his famous Kenzie/Gennaro series - like \\"Mystic River\\" - are always welcome, as the author keeps writing in his usual dry, compelling style, creating interesting characters and a complex tale where nobody knows what the truth is.<br /><br />Another good book by Lehane.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|If u are really a ff fan, then u will love this item, is the best CG movie I ever seen, and its simply fantastic the details and the magic it contains.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wish I had seen this series when it first aired.  I think it's the best sci fi... no make that the best television series... I have ever seen.   <br /> <br />Incredible writing, fabulous costumes, sets and cinematography, fascinating characters.  Why didn't I hear about it when it first aired? <br /> <br />I guess that if there's any consolation, it's that I don't have to sit through commercials to see the episodes on dvd. <br /> <br />If you have even the slightest inclination, BUY THIS!  You won't regret it!
B000A2H8WQ|5.0|I grew up listening to great music from artists like Ella Fitzgerald and writers like George and Ira Gershwin.  And today I enjoy everyone from Nelly to Yo Yo Ma, and Tom Jobim to Earth Wind and Fire.  Q assembled an amazing variety artists on this CD and covered every genre from rap to soft Brazilian jazz.  I love every cut on here.  My favorite is \\"The Places You Find Love.\\"  I have put it on a couple of compilation CDs and I choke up frequently when I hear it.  Jones' rendition of \\"Birdland,\\" bringing together so many wonderful jazz greats is also an emotional treat. I rarely agree with Grammy choices, but I was SO happy to see this album win in 1991.  They just don't get any better than this.  Thank you, Quincy Jones and to everyone associated with this amazing CD!
B00005JKO3|4.0|Like Mann's other well-known feature, \\"Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" El Cid has a lot going for it: breathtaking Spanish scenery and fabulously authentic set pieces, two very competent and attractive leads with Heston and Loren, and an interesting protagonist whose story is steeped more in myth than reality.<br /><br />Although this DVD has not yet been released, this film, like \\"Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" is worthy of a \\"special edition\\" replete with interviews, extras, a behind-the-scenes documentary, deleted scenes, and the like--should they even exist. The film was released almost 45 years ago. (I am reviewing a Region 2 encoded disc from Amazon UK which has been expertly restored to widescreen format but alas, no special features to speak of.)<br /><br />While not as opulent as \\"Fall\\" that would be released three years later, the love story between Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (El Cid) and Chimene, his wife is a more interesting one--as interesting as the story of the Cid himself.<br /><br />These are characters one feels emotionally attached to unlike those of Livius and Drusilla in Mann's 'Fall,\\" which resembles yet an additional prop to the sets to Mann's $16 million dollar epic, but Mann got off relatively cheap with \\"El Cid,\\" utilizing many of the existing medieval castles that dot the coastlines of sunny Spain.<br /><br />Chimene loves Rodrigo who is to be her husband, than hates him for killing her father who insults Rodrigo's father and his family name. She marries Rodrigo out of spite at the request of King Ferdinand, and Chimene colludes to kill Rodrigo with a fellow conspirator who also loves her. Later, she ultimately learns to love this selfless knight who shows mercy to his enemies, earns their respect, and defends a brat of a king who is nothing more than a spoiled tyrant--wonderfully played by popular 60's British mod, John Fraser who would later win a coveted supporting role in Roman Polanski's \\"Repulsion.\\"<br /><br />The movie gets 4 stars because the battle scenes seem rather brief and could have been better orchestrated on a slightly more lavish scale.  Mann's \\"Fall\\" clearly has an edge here; what we see in \\"El Cid\\" for the majority of the film are really skirmishes of no more than 15 to 20 men at a time.  The Miklos Rosza score, obviously influenced by the achingly beautiful coda in Tchaikovsky's Symphony 4, and like all of his splendid soundtracks, will compel an exhaustive search for the compact disc at your local retailer. Clearly, this is music to be savored like a fine Castillian wine.<br /><br />This was a role Heston was born to play: physical, larger than life, and majestic in scope. In a death-scene that is perhaps one of the longest, most touchingly portrayed, and perhaps Heston's finest in an epic like this, will move you as will the story of this heroic 11th Century knight who attempted to unite his divided Spain.and could have been better orchestrated on a slightly more lavish scale.

0446364495|5.0|I haven't read a book in one sitting for a long long time. I like to take my time while reading books pausing every few pages and thinking over what I read till then. This is the same whether the book is fiction or non-fiction, but the pausing time is usually greater for non-fiction books, understandbly. Today I went to Minneapolis Central Library and while browsing the shelves I saw the book, \\"Bridges of Madison County\\". I had seen the movie earlier and had liked it very much, especially towards the ending scenes. I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood and I like all his movies, so me liking this movie was no surprise. I had heard that this movie was a special case where the movie out-did the book, which usually doesnt happen.  I took the book from the shelf and read the first few pages and I got interested. I just sat down on the floor and continued reading it. Soon I reached 50 pages and I thought I should read the book fully and so I found a comfortable chair and read the whole book in one sitting. Many a times my eyes filled with tears (it is not surprising anyway, I am a typical cancerian - emotional and sensitive).   I finished the book just before the library closed and sat there for atleast 10 minutes pondering over the greatest love story I ever read. Contrary to popular opinion I think that, in this case also, the movie didnt reach to upto the beauty of the book. I really cant figure out what made me read a book whose story I knew fully (as I had seen the movie), yet move me so deeply. Whatever the reason I am glad that I read the book. Try it, I am sure you would too...
0140186409|5.0|As a quick comment, the ending of the book is different from the movie. The book is a bit more depressing, especially near the end. Overall, the movie and the book are similar in plot, but here in the book the reader will find much more detail. In short, the book is a literary masterpiece while the movie is good but not great.<br /><br />I came across an Amazon.com \\"Listmania\\" list for the top 10 American works of fiction. I had read a few of the books, but not all so I decided to buy all those that I had not read. These include the present book, and some that I have now read and posted reviews including Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov and On the Road by Jack Kerouac. All of the books have been interesting reads and not what I had expected - lots of surprises.<br /><br />When I bought the present book I did not realize that this book is actually two books in one. There is a 44 page introduction (what I call the first book) by the Steinbeck scholar Robert DeMott. His introduction is much longer than I had anticipated. This is in fact a mini-biography that describes Steinbeck's state of mind prior to and during the writing of the book. Also DeMott describes Steinbeck's life leading up to the book and what happens after the success of Grapes of Wrath. In addition, DeMott has \\"suggestions for further reading\\". So I would recommend the present book.<br /><br />It is hard for me to rate the Grapes of Wrath since it has become something of a classic with about 15 million copies or more in print. The rating is a bit subjective, but I would say 5 stars, even if it was not famous. The book is a \\"reality fiction\\" or simply realism, i.e.: pure fiction but like many other fiction writers it is based on real events that are accurately described and has a few characters based on friends of the author.<br /><br />Steinbeck received both praise and criticism for the book. Many thought he had exaggerated the problems of the migrant workers. But as explained by DeMott if anything Steinbeck who had first hand working experiences with the migrant worker has slightly moderated the descriptions of the hardships faced by the migrants as presented in the book, and in no fashion did he exaggerate their problems.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book and I would highly recommend buying and reading. It seems that the world has not changed that much since 1939. We still have migrant workers working under bad conditions although they are no longer from Oklahoma. They have been replaced by illegal aliens from Mexico, eager for the jobs. We still have some corporations and politicians trying to deny the reality of the hardships and issuing counter propaganda. We have perhaps even more problems today such as global warming, also denied by some. The world has not changed in 65 years - but the book is still of interest and perhaps even timely.Steinbeck who had first hand working experiences with the migrant worker has slightly moderated the descriptions of the hardships faced by the migrants as presented in the book, and in no fashion did he exaggerate their problems. <br /> <br />This is a very interesting book and I would highly recommend buying and reading.

Both albums were pretty darn good and gave me a good reason to stick around w/ DT.  Then today I bought Images an Words... It kicked the **** out of me!  This album blew me away!  There's not one song on here that I don't like!  Anyway... if you're a DT fan, don't hesitate to buy this album!

1400062756|5.0|This book has a simple premise: The world is divided between people who are open to learning and those who are closed to it, and this trait affects everything from your worldview to your interpersonal relationships. Author and psychology professor Carol S. Dweck has scoured research papers and news clippings to extract anecdotes about the pros and cons of both mindsets. Thus, stories about Michael Jordan, Lee Iacocca, John McEnroe, Wilma Rudolph and Babe Ruth, among others, find a place in this book. Dweck addresses the ways that mindsets have an impact on people. She explains that you can have a closed mindset in regard to some traits and an open mindset in regard to others. The thought-provoking insight comes from learning when you need to adjust your mindset to move ahead. The author extends her basic point by viewing all areas of human relationships through the prism of mindset. That is interesting, but we believe that this material would still be useful and illuminating even if it applied only to leadership and management.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Porcupine Tree really outdid themselves this time. If you thought \\"In Absentia\\" was brilliant, then you're in for a real treat! \\"Deadwing\\" picks up where \\"In Absentia\\" left off, with metal and pop elements blended to perfection. The title track is a mindblowing jugerrnaut that begins the epic album. \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" is a breathtaking epic featuring Mikael from Opeth that will leave you emotionally drained some twelve minutes after it begins. \\"The Start Of Something Beautiful\\" will likewise screw around with your insides and moisten your tear ducts. \\"Deadwing\\" is ultimately a better record than \\"In Absentia\\". Granted, it will take a while to grow on you, but great music does NOT equal instant gratification. There. I've said too much. Pick up a copy NOW!
B00000JLEP|4.0|This is a spectacular reading of the Poem of Ecstasy.  Boulez's calculated logic and mathematical objectivity are not always effective in the mainstream, \\"common practice\\" repertory (his performances of the Mahler symphonies, for example, range from passable to simply awful, cold and emotionally disfunctional), but in the Poem of Ecstasy they reveal a masterpiece of thematic development and elegance of line.  Where other readings (Neeme Järvi's, for example, recorded nine years earlier with this same orchestra) render this music an amorphous, directionless exercise in ambience, Boulez fascinates by his grasp of symphonic architecture and ability to bring subtle details of counterpoint and orchestration out of the dense texture.  And what an orchestral performance! <br /> <br />As an aside, this was my first acquaintance with the Piano Concerto, and I was struck by how much it sounds like Chopin.  By the time of the two symphonic poems on this disc Scriabin had come a long way down the radical experimental path he took in his short career; but the Piano Concerto is an earlier work, accessible and immediately likeable while still possessed of the progressive, experimental elements of Scriabin's writing in their early stages.
074327931X|3.0|This book gives hard sets of questions. It does a good job explaining the answers. However, hard problems are not always what you need to study. This book does not give any practice tests so you won't know how you do on the real exam. This means that you may never even get to the hard questions on the real GMAT if you can't do the simple ones--therefore, this book would be a waste of your time. The verbal section is excellent though. The math is lacking.
B000FA57RG|4.0|Timed to coincide with her disco-fied Confessions World Tour, Madonna's CD/DVD package \\"I'm Going To Tell You a Secret\\" is worthwhile for fans of the legendary entertainer. The CD contains her first-ever live album, while the DVD sports a 2 hour documentary chronicling her 2004 Re-Invention tour in addition to various bonus materials.<br /><br />Some fans may be reluctant upon viewing the tracklisting of the CD. However, despite its rather limited 14-song setlist the concert album is high-quality and, most importantly, captures the energy of the stage show.<br /><br />Madonna has always been known more for her the pop sensibility of her songs and the quality of her performances than for particular vocal prowess, but she tackles her material with ever-abundant confidence and a sense of purpose. Her 1985 gem \\"Into the Groove\\" sounds quirky with a Scottish bagpipe intro, while her 2003 Top 40 hit \\"American Life\\" from underrated album of the same name packs as much political punch and cultural awareness as it did three years ago. Also, no one could go wrong covering John Lennon's endearing \\"Imagine.\\"<br /><br />The biggest highlight, however, is \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" which sounds light years better in a live setting and shows great wisdom with its life-affirming lyrics.<br /><br />\\"No one's telling you how to live your life/But it's a setup until you're fed up/It's no good when you're misunderstood/But why should I care what the world thinks of me?/I won't let a stranger give me a social disease.\\"<br /><br />The documentary, which includes many electrifying performance excerpts, gives an all-access pass to her 2004 tour from its very beginnings, complete with dancers' auditions and the creation of the concept for \\"The Beast Within,\\" each night's opening sequence. Madonna also talks religion (in an enriching, non-preachy way), family, literature and, of course, music.<br /><br />Her husband director Guy Ritchie is featured interviewing a fan about Madonna's husband, mischievously not identifying himself, while her children, father and stepmother are also shown, revealing touching moments that give unique insight into the entertainer.<br /><br />Most touching of all, however, is her interaction with the dancers.

B00005JOQS|4.0|Superman Returns really does for me recall the first two  starring Christopher Reeve. First of all the physical resemblance of Brandon Routh to Reeve is striking. Second, neither of them can act. So what? That doesn't prevent either of these movies from being near great. Let's conveniently forget about 3. You once again have an over-the-top Lex Luther. Kevin Spacey v Gene Hackman? Not bad. So, nobody has seen Superman or Clark for five years. He just left. Superman was chasing a hunk of his home planet Krypton hurtling through the universe. Clark? Who missed him? Maybe Jimmy. He returns as if nothing had happened to resume his old job. Lois now has a son, also five years old. She must have hooked up, very quickly apparently, with a math whiz who can't add months & the kid calls him dad. That's the hook for the next chapter. Kevin Spacey is eating every scene he's in. He is creating a new continent off the shore of North America & billions will die. His girl friend, Kitty has a thing for Superman & talk about deja'vu. Anyway, Superman is again saved from deadly green kryptonite. Lex Luther is not killed. He is very much alive & free. I've left out the details, of course. They can make 10 more of these if they like just don't change Superman like they do Batman with every new movie. Brandon Routh is fine & Kevin Spacey is great. The rest of the cast is interchangable. Hardcore fans have probably already seen this one. Its been out for a while. I expect there will be a double disc dvd to look forward to in time for Christmas.
0446677450|5.0|This book will teach you that you need to depend on yourself to become wealthy.<br /><br />I read a couple of other reviews that said a couple things. First, if you want to become rich, just work harder. Secondly, that the author said to save money and not spend it, but he had a Rolex and a Porsche. As a result of this book, I have been investing in Real Estate for only a couple of years, and I now have a Rolex with diamonds and saphires, my wife prefers her Cartier:-).<br /><br />At over 50 years old, I lost my job with a six figure salary from a corporate down-sizing, and I did not care, because I had my own money from real estate investments I made on my own.<br /><br />The most important lesson he teaches in this book is, most people don't make money because they are chicken, chicken to make their own decisions. I'm glad I leaned not to be a chicken. And, anyone who is not excited about what this book teaches is a chicken, will always work hard for someone else, and any money they have saved will come from not spending on the things they want.<br /><br />The Rolex and the Cartier I bought together for over $15,000 was easy, I had just made over $80,000 on a single real estate deal. I would never have spent that kind of money if I had to work for it. In fact, I call my Rolex my \\"Badge of Boldness\\".<br /><br />Thank you Rich Dad, Poor Dad.

0312330537|4.0|This is indeed, as prior reviewers have noted, the kind of book that only comes along rarely, the kind that can keep your attention firmly locked in for over 900 pages.  It is also truly fascinating to read about such a vibrant, foreign city and culture.  The author's descriptions and imagery are so vivid that they leave you feeling like you've lived in the crowded streets of Bombay even if (like me) you haven't.  The sense of high adventure in this book is tough to duplicate, and the characters really come to life, leading the reader to emote along with them.  The reason I give this book four stars instead of five, however, is the author's tendency to deliver paragraphs, if not pages, of heavy-handed \\"deep thoughts\\" at the end of most chapters.  Far too often Roberts bends over backwards to say something truly profound by speculating about the meaning of life, love and happiness, using flowery metaphors and drawing nonsensical comparisons.  It gets a bit old, and borders on making for an inconsistent protagonist -  making one start to wonder how Linbaba can be stabbing strangers nearly to death during mafia hits in one minute and babbling on so pointlessly about love and tenderness and \\"the heart\\" etc., in the next.  Furthermore, the main character seems to learn major life lessons entirely too frequently (you'll see the phrase \\"it was in that moment that I realized...\\", or something very close to it, more than a few times).  Luckily, these areas are fairly easy to predict (as they come at the end of most chapters) and can thus be skipped in order to get back to the thrilling storytelling and imagery that comprises the bulk of Shantaram.

6305364648|5.0|True Lies is a great movie. It has frenetic action sequences, sarcastic sidekick humor, funny domestic Ozzie & Harriet scenes, and great dramatic denouements. I personally consider it to be Schwartzenegger's last great bonafide success (Terminator 3 didn't live up to the hype or the box office take-in predictions).<br /><br />Harry Tasker is a deadly secret agent, toiling for the Omega Sector, where he can be found usually hip-deep in dangerous shenanigans. As a spy, he deals daily in death, foils madmen's plots with easy aplomb, and dances a mean tango. Meanwhile, his personal life is slowly circling down the drain. His spy job takes up most of his attention; he barely has time for family commitments. His longtime wife Helen, unaware of Harry's clandestine profession, knows him as a sales rep and thinks him boring and plodding. His teenage daughter Dana is rebelling. But Harry's world is shockingly upended when he suspects his wife of extramarital behavior and goes comedically ballistic. His ensuing inappropriate use of government resources is laugh out loud funny. The resulting events range from slapstick antics to calamitous, high stakes jeopardy, as Harry's professional and personal lives finally converge.<br /><br />This has to be one of Arnold's best films; it ranks right up there with the Terminator movies, Predator, and Total Recall. True Lies is an exhilarating blend of all-out spy action and romantic screwball comedy. The eye-popping stunts alone are worth the price of admission (the hotel game of tag with Arnold on horseback doggedly pursuing his motorbiking quarry, the extended shoot-em-up chase scene on the 7 Mile Bridge, the awesome Marine Harrier sequence...). Think what you will about the egocentric James Cameron. He knows how to dynamically direct a movie. But, in my opinion, the frequent touches of humor are what gives the movie its heart and carries this film past the generic action flick, making it into an all-time classic (the priceless hotel room scene with Helen posing as a stripteasing \\"escort\\"; the terrorist lackey who video records his insane leader's ranting manifesto, only to find the camera battery running out, etc.). The chemistry between Arnold and Jamie Lee is only surpassed by the buddy chemistry between Arnold and Tom. The performances are pitch perfect. Arnold has fun playing the clueless domestic father and husband while still living up to his trademark \\"I'll be back\\" persona. Jamie Lee plays it sedately at first and then hilariously over the top as the bored, thrill-seeking spouse. Tom Arnold, at his wise-cracking best, hams it up as the irreverent but faithful sidekick. These actors have never been better. To round out the superlative cast, you have Bill Paxton (great sleazy character!), sexy Tia Carrere (shwing!), a pre-Buffy and -Tru Calling Eliza Dushku, and the deadly serious Art Malik, who plays the main baddie.<br /><br />It sucks to say, but the only halfway decent films Arnold made after True Lies were Eraser, End of Days, Terminator 3. He's a bit past it now to be playing the action hero. He pretty much admitted as much when he cameod in the Rock's The Rundown and officially passed him the torch. \\"Have fun,\\" he tells the Rock.

B000BTC5LW|2.0|After waiting so long for this release, I can't believe the poor video of the concert footage - the dark sequences of the concert pixelate and pulse, like the footage was compressed too much.  Do I have a bad copy, or does anyone else have this problem?

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently watched Serenity, the movie based off of the Firefly series.  It was a good movie and was excited to see that I could continue the adventure through the television series.  I bought the first season DVD in hopes of catching up with the show and was...well...blown away.  I could not believe a show this great was actually on television.  This is possibly one of the best television shows ever made - every angle has a unique touch, the scripting is excellent and the feel of the cast is perfect.  When I watch these episodes I feel like I am part of the crew.  If you like good entertainment (whether you like sci-fi, drama or whatever) you will love this show.  I can't get over how great this series is - it really, really suprised me.  Not to mention the music scores. You can see the love that went into crafting this show in it's many nuances.  Shortcuts were not taken here. <br /> <br />Imagine my suprise when I discovered it had been cancelled.  What kind of dumb TV exec did this, I mean, my God - I hop ethey didn't cancel it due to ratings because I saw no advertisement for this show AT ALL while it was being aired.  Someone in entertainment with a decent IQ needs to get smart, reassemble this cast and crew and make millions of dollars - becasue if they bring this show back to TV that is exactly what will happen.
B0000584V3|5.0|No Opeth in my reviews until now? How absurd!<br /><br />Then again before I heard them I was immediately turned off by Mikael's monster vocals and the tone of this band. It was unbearable and I found people enjoying this stuff to be extreme. Now that was when I still liked mainstream rock and MTV. By this time the only song I ever heard from Opeth was \\"Blackwater Park\\", and only a few seconds of it. During this time I was adapting to the Music Choice channels and on one chosen day \\"Blackwater Park\\" was being played and I decided to just listen to it, because I had this feeling - this, mindset of thought, knowing that there was something in Opeth I had to find. It was hard to bear in the beginning, but 'twas the instruments that took me over.<br /><br />The fusion of unique riffs by Mikael and Peter became the bane of the melody, that is, until things would break and scatter into beautiful acoustic interludes. Things would start to pick up until they were thrown back down again, only leaving you with the beauty of acoustics. Solos would find their way perfectly into the rhythm. The atmosphere stays muggy with the production and bass support, which drew in quite the wetland feeling. The originality of the drums would never play unless it was to leave a mark. The vocals...how does a human have the voice of a beast? But not just any growling, no. Mikael certainly keeps his range, which helps because it fits well with the tune.<br /><br />Now this is just the title track, and with all of this packed into one song, the rest of the CD is a sure buy, hands down. After this, Opeth have become one of my favorite bands, but that was a couple years back. Other favorites include...well, the whole thing; it really is that perfect (Especially with Steven Wilson's production), though I do have to give nods to \\"Bleak\\" and \\"The Drapery Falls\\". Mikael also does beyond comparable singing as well, which is hard to believe with the monster vocals he already possesses. If you haven't checked out Opeth already, you should do so as soon as possible. Opeth were one of the bands that saved me from the horrors of MTV and radio rock. If they allowed it, Opeth would be included in the definition to words like beauty, tranquility, art, elegance, exquisite, and class. Many should not compare Opeth, for it would only downgrade who they truly are. A league of their own indeed...n't checked out Opeth already, you should do so as soon as possible.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse broke out internationally with their stellar third album \\"Absolution,\\" after two albums of just-as-good-but-not-well-known work.<br /><br />Now they've returned with \\"Black Holes and Revelations,\\" a simmering symphonic rock tapestry that expands their sound into darker territory. It's also more electronic in nature, but the core of the band still lies in their magnificent, haunting rock'n'roll and classical arrangements.<br /><br />It opens with a rippling keyboard melody, which blooms out into a soaring guitar melody and lots of blippy electronica. That feeling only grows as Matthew Bellamy starts to sing of death, damnation, and corruption. \\"You behold/And beholden for all that you've done/And spin/Cast a spell/Cast a spell on the country you run/And risk/You will risk/You will risk all their lives and their souls...\\" Political? Sounds like it.<br /><br />Muse heads towards more pleasant territory in the bittersweet, yearning \\"Starlight,\\" as well as soft mournful balladry, and wistful pop that blossoms out into spare, sizzling electro-rock. Bellamy shows the beauty in the bleakness when he sings, \\"During the struggle/They will pull us down... Let's use this chance/To turn things around/And tonight/We can truly say/Together we're invincible.\\"<br /><br />But the heart of Muse is still in rock'n'roll, like Led Zeppelin fronted by Beethoven. They still specialize in walls of embroidered sound, like elaborate rock tapestries. They play symphonic rock that sweeps all over the board, explosive bass-laden rockers, and fast-paced violin rock that ends with a whisper.<br /><br />Muse hasn't abandoned their sound in order to go mainstream, even after making it big on this side of the pond. Their music is still dark, lacking in hope, and meditates on wastelands, glaciers and how \\"There's no justice in the world/And there never was.\\" In case you were wondering, this is not fun music.<br /><br />Don't be worried about the electronica. Muse only really goes dancy on one song: the twisted love song \\"Supermassive,\\" which has a hypnotic dark beat. The rest of the time, it's just another instrument in the mix. Alongside the typical rock instruments, Muse adds in cascading piano and violins, as well as a glorious trumpet and some gypsyish acoustic guitar.<br /><br />Matt Bellamy has that soaring, angsty voice that would sound emo if it weren't so powerful. As it is, his pipes are strong enough to soar over the complex hard-rock, but can also drop down to a soft ballad. \\"You'll have to set us free/Watch our souls fade away/Let our bodies crumble away/Don't be afraid/I will take the cold for you...\\"<br /><br />Muse score another win in their dark, powerful fourth album, full of spacey electronica and sweeping hard rock.

B000002KDI|5.0|Not going to comment on another reviewer's complaints about the sound quality compared to the vinyl - never heard it on vinyl and not qualified to compare. <br /> <br />But the music is awesome.  It's pure angry beauty, Hurricane sounds better here than anywhere else, ever, except MAYBE Weld.  (Weld's great too!)  I Am A Child...Sugar Mountain...Needle and the Damage Done (his perf at the Grammies a while back of this was great)...all amazing songs. <br /> <br />Young is the genius.
B0009VCSXW|5.0|The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. \\"Sin City\\" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes \\"Sin City,\\" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,\\" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike \\"Sky Captain,\\" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three \\"Sin City\\" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is not quite a \\"Kill Bill\\" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. \\"Sin City\\" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler.

B000EWBKKI|5.0|I don't understand why some people are saying this is a bad transfer, it is not.  It is very sharp and colorful.  Explosions are filled with great separation of color and no bleeding.  I can only guess that the negative reviewers are not watching blu-ray titles on a proper HD monitor with 720p/1080i/1080p.

B000BCE918|4.0|I purchase this item as a gift and it was well recieved.the reciever liked it <br />
B00004Y6NT|4.0|In a world with so many opinions, one is allowed, I would think, to change one's own occasionally. I had reviewed this album previously, and not all that favourably. That was several months ago. Since then, I have been reeducated.<br /><br />I will say, straight out, that Dire Straits was the finest rock band ever in existence. Please don't send any nastygrams; this is a personal opinion, backed up, I might add, by a multitude of people as slavishly devoted as myself. That said, I was initially - and for quite a long time - a tad disappointed in COMMUNIQUE. It had the appearance of being produced in a bit of a hurry, to ride along on the wave of the first eponymous album. I have since that time taken each song on its own merits.<br /><br />Right at the top of my list of all-time favourites - and it is difficult, really, to separate Mark Knopfler's solo work from the Dire Straits years - is Once Upon A Time In The West. I have read that this song is the result of an all-nighter fueled by booze and a bad late-night B-movie he found himself in front of; whatever engendered it, I lower the car windows, turn up the volume, and play it for the countryside on my latenight travels. The beat, the minor key, the growly rough voice; everything at once makes this a great song, and I never get tired of it; I have a 40-minute ride to work, and there have been nights when that song is ALL I play the whole trip.<br /><br />\\"News\\", a song that sounds suspiciously autobiographical, addresses the issue of boys and their toys and the women who have to worry about what they do with them; I go back and forth with this one, and have to be in the right frame of mind for it. At the right moment, it really hits a chord. \\"Where Do You Think You're Going\\" is another one of my favourites, a song full of heartache and bruised ego; listening to it, I've never been able to understand how anyone could walk away from someone who could write those lines. Whatever. One woman's loss...\\"Lady Writer\\" is a snappy little piece made to boogie to. \\"Portobello Belle\\", which is the rare DS tune I've never been all that fond of, slows the pace of the album down, taking the listener on a sleepy stroll through a seaside town and observance of its denizens. \\"Angel Of Mercy\\" is slyly naughty and full of anticipatory hormones; forget Barry White, all you need is this song and a bottle of wine to manufacture the right mood. The title song, \\"Communique\\", is not a bad song, but one I tend to lose in the shuffle; it has a different sort of beat, and as with many of Mark Knopfler's songs, lyrics that inspire investigation. Sometimes I'm just not in the mood to think that much about the words.<br /><br />The last two songs are the best two album enders I can think of in my entire vast collection of music. \\"Single-Handed Sailor\\" and \\"Follow Me Home\\" are probably linked because they flow together so well, the first a jazzy, cool piece that makes you sway along with it, evocative of dark piers and salt breezes and seaport romances, leading into a deceptively slow invitation (demand?) for further romantic exploration with \\"Follow Me Home\\". One of my friends waxes positively poetic about this song, and it's not surprising; there are all sorts of visions that come to mind here, and different aspects of it come back to me at odd moments - the sound of small brass bells, surf shussing onto a beach, crickets, a sleepy guitar, a quietly hungry voice.<br /><br />This album is the closest in timbre to the first album Dire Straits produced, but shows some evolution from it, a bit more innovative than the first album with different pacing and tones. After really listening to every song on this album, I have revised my previous review. This was the introduction to Dire Straits for a lot of people; nearly 30 years along, I know quite a few of them, and they are still avid fans. If you like Dire Straits, this is an important link in the chain, and a must for the music library of the real fan.de to boogie to. \\"Portobello Belle\\", which is the rare DS tune I've never been all that fond of, slows the pace of the album down, taking the listener on a sleepy stroll through a seaside town and observance of its denizens. \\"Angel Of Mercy\\" is slyly naughty and full of anticipatory hormones; forget Barry White, all you need is this song and a bottle of wine to manufacture the right mood.

B000FVQYYK|4.0|When I first heard \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" as a single, I had definite mixed feelings about it. I thought, \\"The main guitar riff is cool, but Bellamy's continuous high vocals may be a bit tiring.\\" So, basically, I was surprised and uneasy. But the next day, I couldn't stop listenning to the song. It totally grew on me. Just like that. <br />Then I got the album, \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" and gave it a run-through. Immediately, the key tracks stood out: \\"Starlight,\\" \\"Supermassive Black Hole,\\" \\"Map of the Problematique,\\" \\"Assassin,\\" \\"Exo-Politics,\\" \\"Knights of Cydonia,\\" and \\"Glorious.\\" <br />I kept listenning to it, and just like the first single, the whole album grew on me. It's kind of a new sound, but Muse is always making new sounds, so in a way it's not new... Anyway, the more mileage it gets on my iPod the more I like it. <br />The guitar, bass, drums, piano, and synths blend so pleasantly together that it's intoxicating. If you are an alternative rock fan, you should buy it. If you are a Muse fan, you already have. And by the way, as always, the lyrics are awesome and intriguing. <br />Sadly, on this version the album doesn't include \\"Glorious\\" (a bonus track which is even better than \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" in my opinion), but oh well. <br />Overall, this album was an appreciated break from mainstreamness. It took a bit of getting used to, but once you do become familiar with the sound, you will love it. <br />And oh, I'm not Sheryl Oda, I'm her 15 year old son. ;) <br />Cheers
055350259X|5.0|Loved this book. Someone recommended this to me before I began my study abroad in Australia. This book is so funny yet so informative I really enjoyed it.  It's not complicated to read and it moves very fast.  I bought this book for other family members before they visted Australia and they loved it as well, and everyone actually laughed out loud throughout the book. This is a must read if you are going to Australia. It's a great country and this is a great book to read prior to your visit.

B000000LZV|5.0|If the show Jackass ever did anything worth admiring, it was choosing \\"Corona\\" by Minutemen as its theme. At two and a half minutes, it's one of the longer tracks on this nearly 45 track album. It's also one of the more conventional punk anthem's they've done, considering how far the horizons stretch when it comes to this band and being creative.<br /><br />Not to sound pretentious, but Minutemen are someone I admire because they seem like me. That is, they seem to get awfully bored, really quickly. That may just be an allusion created by this bands short and brilliant bursts. Tracks like \\"Cohesion\\" are an example--here, in between these polka-influenced punk songs, we get an arpeggiated Spanish guitar demonstration. And, somehow, it works beautifully.<br /><br />\\"Nature Without Man\\" seems to outdue everything Pearl Jam every did, in just over 90 seconds. \\"Love Dance\\", along with \\"Jesus and Tequila\\" treat us to some blues; and \\"Do You Want New Wave Or Do You Want the Truth\\" is just as inspirational as any hymnal.<br /><br />It's sad that in this \\"Jackass\\" generation Mr. Boon and his companions have been forgotten. Minutemen are comprised of ideas, and not just power chords (though, they do those damn well too!). I've tried to introduce this album to the \\"punks\\" that I know, but they're so easily turned off when they don't hear pop punk that's been taught to them as though 20 songs about the bands girlfriends have substance; it seems the punk mentality has died.<br /><br />Very few albums span across so many genre's with this type of skill and tenacity (if you know of some I may not, please tell me). Everything here seems so incoherrent that it begs for repeated listens; begs for that \\"shuffle\\" button, too. It should also beg for your attention. Beg to turn your head to a past time, where emotional and political music didn't have to be covered by a label or a haircut or a t-shirt.

0553582461|5.0|I don't normally read Amazon's recommendations for me, but I was looking for a new author to read, and noted that they had recommended this one to me based on my prior history. (Honest, this isn't an advertisement for Amazon.com.)  In any case, I read the first book of this series, Fool's Errand, and was immediately hooked. <br /> <br />This last book of the trilogy was very well-written, thoroughly engrossing, and even had me tear up in a few spots.  (Books VERY seldom make me do that.)  I only wish that I knew that this trilogy had two trilogies before it, as I would have read them first.  I now plan to go back and do so.  The only downside is that, because of the necessary explanations in this one to cover prior history, you already know most of what's going to happen.  Still, I look forward to reading how it DOES happen.   <br /> <br />Wonderful book.  If you haven't read any of Robin Hobb's books, I highly recommend starting with Assassin's Apprentice, which I am planning to read next.  (It has been rated 4.5 stars by Amazon readers, so it seems to be as good as this one.)

B0000584V3|5.0|So much has been said of Opeth over the years, and all has been true as of yet. Beauty, technicality, anger, fear.... all these are but a fraction of what Opeth has to offer on any respective release. <br /> <br />Blackwater Park is hailed as their greatest achievement, and rightfully so. As soon as one hears feedback that begins the monstrously riff-laden opener \\"Leper Affinity\\", it can be sensed that this band will be a force to be reckoned with. An entire review can be written on this song alone as riff after pummels you into death metal ecstacy up unto the acoustic interlude and back into the progressive death metal that we all know and love Opeth for. <br /> <br />Next comes the astounding \\"Bleak\\", establishing Mike's intense clean vocals as another element of sheer perfection in this seemingly perfect band. This song opens with an almost Arabian influence as the acoustic/electric opening descends into an astoundingly catchy riff that will become this song's identifying riff. Then comes the verse. This is the obvious work of production genius Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree). It becomes apparent that his production on this album is that of which is comparable to Neil Kernon's effect on Queensryche or Bob Rock's on Metallica's Black Album. This is what sets this album apart from the other amazing Opeth albums. From the pummeling riffs to the jazz influenced midsection this song is a highlight to the album with \\"Leper Affinity\\" among others. <br /> <br />Then comes the beautifully written mainly acoustic \\"Harvest\\" identifying Opeth's prog-rock roots. After this seemingly simple arrangement (by Opeth's standards, of course), comes the most complex and captivating songs in Opeth's catalogue, if not one of the best songs ever made- The Funeral Portrait. This would come to be the Opeth song that all other songs should be judged by- end of story.  <br /> <br />The album drifts on in a haze of surreality and aggression similar to that of its opening tracks, but never thesame or even unoriginal at any time. From the opening words \\"We've entered winter once again\\" to the closing \\"The sun sets forever over Blackwater Park\\", this album holds its own as a completely perfect album. It is best illustrated by the art of the original release as an eerily beautiful, mystifying journey into the portion of the human psyche previously unexplored. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks were left unreleased for a reason, they simply do not fit with the album, and quite honestly, don't deliver.  <br /> <br />Other than the bonus tracks, this album is a MUST HAVE for anyone. Yes, anyone. I believe that a rap fan could even find the essence that makes this album what it is. Life-changing music. <br />
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|The first album from Cryptopsy since 2000's \\"And Then You'll Beg\\" was not dissapointing at all! While I didn't think it was as good as \\"Blasphmey Made Flesh\\" or the classic \\"None So Vile,\\" it is still up there & was probably the best technical death metal release of 2005. Now if only they would do more tours in the USA besides just the east & west coasts... hmmm...
B000683VI4|4.0|A romantic movie must be seen once in a while to remember a part of our life and some of our emotions. Nicholas Sparks is a great romantic writer and this movie inspired by one of his first novels is pretty effective.<br /><br />It has been reviewed so many times that I only want to point out what I believe is the reason for it great appeal on the public.<br /><br />I am a doctor and it goes without saying that the way Alzheimer disease is described is totally unrealistic since loss of recent memory is the first feature of this terrible disease, while past memory is well conserved until the disease is far ahead.<br /><br />James Gardner and Gena Rowlands are excellent actors but their parts were either miscast or they were not convinced of the script.<br /><br />The reason the movie works is in the two young actors, which even if too young to play the part of the adults that meet again after 7 years, are very good at manifesting their attraction for each other. They are having fun and kissing with \\"gusto\\" and they are talented enough to show attraction for each other in their gaze.<br /><br />The peak scene, when under the rain they give way to their true feelings, is one to remember. The love making is clumbsy and fresh and sincere.<br /><br />The editing of the movie is annoying, some on the scenes are cut off when you least expect it.<br /><br />I would leave just the love story between the two teenagers and young adults, taking away all the the part on them 40 years later.<br /><br />The setting of the film in the 1930-40's is very well done and I can't but remember Norman Rockwell illustrations.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling and Racheal McAdams are promising new faces of American cinema!
B000FVQYYK|3.0|One of the first things I noticed about this CD was that all my favorite songs had something in common. They all contained the word \\"of\\" in their title. \\"Map OF The Problematique\\", \\"City OF Delusion\\" and \\"Knights OF Cydonia\\". And by the same token, I noticed that all the one-worded songs were fairly unimpressive and didn't do much for me. (\\"Starlight\\", \\"Invincible\\", \\"Assassin\\", \\"Exo-Politics\\" and \\"Hoodoo\\". Throw \\"Soldier's Poem\\" in there too). If you've ever come across a tour schedule of the band, you can understand quite plainly just how busy these three fellas are. They've had three years to produce these eleven songs and while the good ones are prime bona fide Muse, the not-so-good ones give off the impression that this could very well have been a B-Sides album.  <br /> <br />\\"Take a Bow\\", the CD's intro, absolutely rocks my socks off. It combines Bellamy's best with rapid and intense synthesizing organ that will turn any head to the car in which it is cranked up with the windows down. Though no one is personally mentioned in this song, it can no doubt be said that its scathing lyrics, damning its intended recipient(s) to burn in hell for their sins, calling them corrupt, committers of crimes against the earth, are targeted towards the Bush administration. Much like \\"Apocalypse Please\\" this intro kicked its album off with a politically charged thunderbolt, though I can say this one is far more intense and far more malicious. I enjoyed it thoroughly, though as you'll read shortly, it came as a bit of a disappointment to find a great portion of the remainder of this album to greatly lack in the high expectations that this song laid into me right off the bat. <br /> <br />\\"Starlight\\" was one of the not-so-impressive songs I mentioned above though I bring it up now because it is one that quite genuinely reflects the overall so-so quality of this album. The vocals are absolutely superb. Bellamy shines in this song as much if not more than he typically does, though there seems to be this underlying pattern of cheesiness in much of the lyrics and in the overly-used synthesizer that attempts to create a sort of goofy science-fiction atmosphere that doesn't quite know what it wants to be, split between an epic tone and one reminiscent of the 80's rock that we laugh at today. <br /> <br />The first single off the album, \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", is the first song off the CD I heard and I was immediately disappointed. The guitar harmony is very fun and catchy but the vocals sound EXACTLY like those in \\"Blue Orchid\\" by the White Stripes--very high-pitched and throaty. I actually played both songs together in quick succession to affirm my comparison and it's very weird how freakishly similar they sound. While I have absolutely nothing against the White Stripes by any means, I want to hear Muse when I listen to them, not someone else. I suppose the song is slowly growing on me but it's still not one of my favorites. I don't mind the high-pitched, tight-mouthed squeal. In fact, Bellamy pulled it off phenomenally back in Origin of Symmetry with \\"Micro Cuts\\", however in this new single, he attempts a more jovial tone as opposed to the highly epic and emotional one apparent in Origin. <br /> <br />The gem of the album is undoubtedly \\"Map of The Problematique\\" with its trance-like array of electronic techno combined with Bellamy's epic echoes and fluid piano keys. I hit BACK as soon as I finished hearing it for the first time and almost every time thereafter. This song is unlike any I've heard from Muse and yet it sounds as though it has been their specialty the whole time.  <br /> <br />I could tell almost immediately into it that \\"City of Delusion\\" was going to be another of the highlights of the album. Luring you in with a lingering acoustic guitar, the song takes off with Bellamy delivering a keen reminder of \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\". I particularly loved the hint of string orchestration apparent in the background just barely heardover Bellamy's catchy guitar harmony. I did not expect the trumpet solo. I know what you're thinking. Trumpet? Muse? Huh? It worked. I can't tell you how, but it worked beautifully. Great song. <br /> <br />\\"Knights of Cydonia\\" finishes off the album spectacularly. I did myself a great disservice after having heard it the first time by overplaying it for several weeks causing me to grow tired of it, but I only did it because it was in my head all day and all night. The intense build-up rich with horse noises and sirens will no doubt make you smile in preparation for what is to come. When I listen to it, particularly the beginning, I suddenly get the urge to make a cheesy sci-fi movie and stamp this song to the opening credits. You are then treated to a great drum and guitar build-up as Bellamy chants with an obvious Queen influence. Not moving in some way shape or form during this song is damn near impossible and verges on blasphemy.  <br /> <br />One aspect that really seems to separate this album from its predecessors is the tone. The others focused primarily with upbeat yet consistently epic vocal ballads transfixed with the mind-numbing and awe-inspiring instrumentals we have come to know and love from this band. Certainly, they included slower songs as well to compliment the faster ones, though Black Holes seems to have offset the focus and placed it more towards the softer and in my opinion, more insignificant songs (I say \\"insignificant\\" referring to their tone, not their lyrics or their content). I appreciate very much the increasing political focus apparent in this album, though with this focus I was both hoping and expecting for there to be more fire, more flare, more of what we're used to when we listen to Muse. I hoped after hearing \\"Take a Bow\\" that I was in store for another epic compilation of emotional ballads wrought with vitality, fervor, and intensity. While I am politically very liberal, I care not for the aim of their emotion, be it political orpersonal, just so long as it's present and intense. And as far as intensity is concerned, I heard it present in less than half of the songs on this album. <br /> <br />When it comes to Muse, I want to hear epic rock, plain and simple. The thing I love most about this band, my very favorite of all bands, is that every song of theirs is played as though it could be the last track--the grand finale. Epic. All the \\"of\\" songs as well as the CD's opener, \\"Take a Bow\\", really live up to that standard. However, that's only four songs among a compilation of eleven. The good ones are great. The majority, I must admit, I've been skipping due to the increasingly slow and increasingly cheesy tones that they've been laden with. I must give credit though to Matt Bellamy. His voice only continues to grow more unique and impeccable, being one of the primary attributes separating this band from all others. Certainly give this album a listen though do it not for the purpose of comparison but rather to appreciate the four or five real successes that it has to offer, for while they are few, they are not by any means weak.

B000001FTA|4.0|Don't know what you got until it's taken from you.<br /><br />What a band and what an album.<br /><br />Again, you CAN'T go wrong purchasing this album.<br /><br />From strength to strength.<br /><br />1. Soldier Of Fortune- Typical loose and powerful Thin Lizzy. Love those guitars!<br /><br />2. Bad Reputation - Listening to Scott Gorham play on Bad Reputation seals the deal.<br /><br />3. Opium Trail  - One of the few leads Brian Robertson plays. Solid.<br /><br />4. South Bound - Incredible. One song I NEVER get tired of playing at loud levels<br /><br />5.

0740748475|5.0|This is for the true C&H fan. It is the canon.<br /><br />It is not meant to be casually perused; these are very heavy books more like a reference library. They are beautifuuly printed. The individual strips are set so they appear to be cut from the newspapers. The dates of each strip are shown on the bottom of each page. It is a great way to watch Bill emerge and watch C&H define their characters.<br /><br />As sad as I was to see Bill stop the strip, I am happy that it did end on a high note. The last cartoon is wonderful and, as Bill says, they are out there still looking for adventure.<br /><br />Capt Tom<br /><br />I can't recommend this set enough!
B00000K3D4|5.0|Who can ever forget Jim Henson's masterpiece `Labyrinth' released in '86 starring a very young and beautiful teenager named Jennifer Connelly as Sarah and rock legend David Bowie as the frightening Goblin King (how's that for type casting). Add to the mix a myriad of madcap muppets and you have one of the most delightful, imaginative and original family films of all time.<br /><br />With 842 reviews posited to date with an overall rating of the maximum allowed - 5 Stars - this is clearly a film with a large following of adoring fans. And why shouldn't it? This is state of the art cinema displaying a commitment to detail that is truly amazing; cast, script, costumes, set design and music are out of this world. Henson has successfully created a magical landscape that will enthrall and fascinate viewers of all ages.<br /><br />Join Sarah on her perilous journey through the labyrinth as she overcomes physical obstacles, an assorted collection of mischievous muppets and a frightening encounter with the Goblin King as she attempts to rescue her baby brother before it's too late.<br /><br />Sure to become a family favorite. Highly Recommended!
1577314808|3.0|Why is it that when you hear something one time, it makes no impression, and yet when you hear it the next time it appears profound? What's up with that?<br /><br />Is the egoic mind trying to avoid wisdom because it knows that wisdom sounds its death knoll?<br /><br />The first time I read 'The power of Now', it seemed simplistic. And now years later, it seems like the story of my life.<br /><br />Go figure.<br /><br />Same with Wayne Dyer. I had a cassette, a very early one of his, and his delivery was amatuerish and the material was simplistic.<br /><br />And yet, later, I saw him on TV and he seemed profound. Same guy, same material. Vast difference.<br /><br />They say when the student is ready, the teacher will appear.<br /><br />Wonder if that means that if the teacher appears too soon, the material will be wasted? We are back to perception again, aren't we? The more I look into the lesson of perception, the more depths I see. And they were there all along.<br /><br />Like Leonardo drawing the gatling gun and the helicopter before there was industry and the technology in place to produce them. The teacher, Leonardo, appeared, but the student. Industry, was not ready.<br /><br />Pennicilin was there all along, and yet millions died for lack of it.<br /><br />Christ came too early?
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|This movie was shot on a low budjet (i think amazons is wrong) and it came out unbelievable! People criticize the movie because it is different from the games but they have to calm down! The movie was made with aspects of the game in it but was intended to be different.....think of it as a side story. but really the movie was great.
B000FGGE68|2.0|Over abundance of fight scenes, many taken directly from the form and style introduced in \\"Equilibrium\\"(a much better flick by the way). Unfortunately they got in the way of a potentially interesting plot. I liked Milla in 5th Element and the Resident Evils, disappointed with this one.
0767834739|5.0|People are mad because it has nothing to do with the game but they have to get over it! It was a fun movie to watch.....why do we have to analyze every part of every movie we see. This movie was entertaining and thats all that matters. Cant wait till #3.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|After reading a review of this CD in USA Today slamming it for being too overblown, essentially, I question the way reviewers are assigned music. For a critic to nationally review a band without understanding their choices of style (not that they would admit that) they are doing a disservice not just to the band but to the possible audience. This out of the way, I consider BHR to be an excellent album, thought a tad inconsistent.  <br />   Starlight will be the song I listen to many times over, and I'm sure the band predicted this. Supermassive Black Hole will only be acceptable at a club either drunk, high, or spazzin. It is not a 'alone in in your car/room feeling the epic weight of the world' song, like most Muse songs are.  <br />  Map of the Problematique is incredible the way it provides me with an extra pound of energy. When going to work in the morning, I turn this up full blast, roll down the windows, and let it burst. It is an ignitor, somewhat close to Hysteria, which still remains the one song I play for people who haven't heard of them yet. <br />  I'll go to the excellent stuff. Two songs that show the awesome, incredible potential of the band. 'City of Delusion' and 'Knights of Cydonia' are continuing to be wonderful blends of art. I hope, when making the next album, that they view these two songs as the next step, because they are truly incredible. I have never heard anything like it. Knights of Cydonia is a song that Clint Eastwood would have made in his twenties while hyped up on acid looking at a spacecraft. Just being able to imagine such a thing is the beauty of Muse. They inspire creativity and excitement in the largest of ways. Perhaps some critics are too wooden to experience such mind-expansion. That's all Muse asks, I believe. Oh, and to scream too.
0321213351|3.0|I agree with the reviewers who complain about the lack of full source code (either in the book or on the Web for me to download), as a C# programmer I found it very difficult to follow the changes he was making from the small densely packed Java snippets.     Thats not to say I wouldn't recommend people to buy/read this book as its a decent book with lots of useful information and I really hope that any future editions improve on the quality.
B000FDECGA|5.0|\\"Shogun Assassin\\" is a great film. Much \\"controversy\\" has arisen over the years regarding this film having been cobbled together from two other films in the Lone Wolf series. I think that what has been achieved is an extremely entertaining, fast-paced piece of action. By eliminating non-essential story lines and including a voice over narration, the action moves at break neck speed. The amount of blood spilled is so over the top as to be cartoonish, which only adds to the uniqueness of the movie. The DVD transfer is excellent and the restored picture is high quality. Some reviewers have complained about certain scenes being unrestored, it is actually only two shots totaling maybe five seconds in length. Both shots are of a castle and the excuse for not restoring them was that they were stock footage with no original element available. I do not know why the company had to place the disclaimer of this fact on the film, as I doubt anyone would have really noticed anyway. An added bonus on the DVD is the inclusion of the trailer which, I had never seen before. I can only imagine an audience seeing this trailer and somehow not wanting to see the film, it is awesome. Anyway, if you have never seen \\"Shogun Assassin\\" or have seen it a thousand times, buy this DVD, it is well worth it.

B000056CU9|5.0|A top secret government program is installed to develop the psychic powers of a certain breed of special individuals known in the underground as 'scanners', who can be used for espionage as well as super-human weapons; yet there is a rift even here between them. The most potent of these scanners named \\"Darryl Revok' {Michael Ironside, here displayed with a scar on his forehead where his 'third eye' would be, self-inflicted in an attempt to keep 'the people' out, during his formative development} seeks world domination, and is fully aware of the artificially pharmaceutical origins of these elite mind gods. After forming his own organization, he searches decades for his long-lost younger brother Cameron Vale, whom Revok finally locates in the custody of a Dr. Paul Ruth {\\"father\\"}, after being discovered as a vagrant whose powers were spurious at best. With the help of Dr. Ruth, Vale begins developing his abilities to a razor's edge and soon comes into his own meeting with other scanners to find an understanding for his condition.<br /><br />These scanners are stalked by Revok's goons who dispatch every one they see, so that Revok may finally build that society in which he is lord of all. Vale meets Kim Obrist {Jennifer O' Neill}, and they fall in love by mutual survival. He meets artist Trevellyan who deals with his scanners talents through his wonderfully dark art, but is assassinated - here, Vale defends himself in a most magnificent scene.<br /><br />Revok and Cameron finally meet in a covert meeting arranged through subterfuge, and even though Revok reveals the truth of those who would keep he and his brother as veritable mind slaves, a psychic war ensues between them which ends in a very surprising manner.<br /><br />Key scenes include Revok impressively dispatching a scanner at a paranormal convention, in which his victim's head literally explodes. Revok forcing a company enforcer to kill all his accomplices, then comitting suicide so Revok may continue his goal of world domination. And of course the concluding scene in which the two prime scanners battle with an optimum and extreme intensity so as to be awe-inspiring.<br /><br />I Am reminded of certain independent as well as officially-funded programs underway experimenting with what is now referred to as 'remote viewing' {telepathy, telekinisis, & clairevoyance}, actually employed by governments for special military intelligence purposes, by which this film may have been inspired.<br /><br />To those interested in developing these types of mental abilities {which are largely comprised of that occult 90% of the brain}, just keep practicing, and like exercising the body, there will be steady progress by visualization and sheer force of will, which will lead to greater and greater results.

B000056H7W|5.0|Opeth is one of my favorite bands. They're easily the metal best band to come from Scandinavia and one of the (if not THE) best metal bands of this 3rd millenium (not talking of that nu-metal/metalcore garbage). I know it's hard to tell which Opeth album is the best since all their 8 albums are good (something rare for any band), and they all deserve the praise they get and even more. Even though if I had to vote for a 1 it will be Deliverance. But this is nonetheless a brilliant piece of work. However it's not the easiest to get into, I first heard My Arms and was blown away, then I heard Ghost Reveries and Deliverance and was even more blown away, then I heard this, and at the first few months I haven't thought highly of it. But now I love it, as any other Opeth album.  <br /> <br />Anyway, Blackwater park is Opeth's breakthrough album from 2001, considered by many to be their best work. It is perhaps their most diverse work since it has both heavy parts and acoustic parts. You have heavy stuff here such as the title track and acoustic like 'Harvest', and a fusion of both like 'The Drapery Falls'. The whole band made here a perfect job. Mikael Akerfeldt is one of the best metal singers ever, not only he's my favorite growler, but he has beautiful clean vocals. And he's growl is actually COMPREHENDIBLE, unlike most growlers in DM and BM. He's, along with Peter Lindgren, is a very good guitarist too, while not the most technical, his riffs and solos are very intense. Also Martin M (bass) and Martin L (drums) did an awesome job (listen to Lopez' double-bass in the title track). All in all though, you get the most talented metal band in this new millenium. <br /> <br />The album starts off with the great, dark, yet not one of the best Opeth album openers 'The Leper Affinity'. 'Bleak' is the 2nd track, my favorite song on the album, and one of my favorite Opeth songs EVER. It strats with a kind of an oriental riff, the \\"growling\\" phase is awesome as well as the \\"cleansinging\\" and the acoustic riffing phases. 'Harvest' is the only acoustic song on the album. Personally I prefer 'A Fair Judgement' off Deliverance to this but it's still amazing, 'The Drapery Falls' is a huge fan favorite. Like I said above it's a fusion of the heavy and the acoustic stuff. 'Dirge For November' is a very underappretiated track, it has a weird intro but it has the best bassline from the album, 'The Funeral Portrait' is another fan favorite. 'Patterns In The Ivy' is an instrumental that leads into the longest song and my 2nd favorite on the album, the title track. It's also probaly the heaviest song here, aside from the  interlude in the beginning it's HEAVY, HEAVY, HEAVY. It's the only track here with no clean vocals. <br /> <br />All in all, it's another awesome perforamance by one of the best bands in the genre. And is easily one of the best albums of 2001, it is better than any old school thrash band that came out with an album in the same year. It even destroys Lateralus (and I'm not a Tool hater BTW).  <br />...Just stop reading this already, switch off the computer and buy this okay?!?!?!
B000F3AAUW|4.0|On Wednesday, July 5, 2006 my son and I were headed east for college freshman orientation. We had encountered an I-40 five-hour traffic jam just past the Tennessee River. My son turned on the radio and Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" was playing. He mentioned he liked it. I then told him I had a MD of the album and would play it for him when/if the jam ever broke. Sho Nuff it finally did, we listened to the whole MD on the way to Nashville. We both agreed it was \\"most excellent\\" and great driving music...especially after sitting in our car stranded for that length of time. I will always think of that traffic jam when I listen to this great album.
B00005JOYM|5.0|Saw the screening of this last night here in Phoenix and although I was kind of bummed that Mr. Stone, who was supposed to attend the screening, had to back out at the last minute, I really enjoyed the movie. Mr. Stone has been sensitive to the material and made a truly powerful film. He never shows the planes actually hitting the towers, probably because we have all seen enough of that in the media. Everyone in the theatre seemed to enjoy it and no one walked out. There were some first responders in the audience and at the end, everyone applauded the film. In fact, no one even got up to leave until part way into the credits. I think people were really moved by the movie and needed to sit a bit and absorb what they had seen. I was kind of disappointed that they didn't really show all of the extraction of the two main characters, but that is minor. All of the actors in the film did a great job and I definitely recommend this movie. Well done, Mr. Stone, well done!!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|It amazes me how so many people don't get this film.  The last review is perhaps the most telling of how shallow people are when they watch this movie.  I'm sorry if some might have found some of the depictions of addiction to be repulsive, but here's an eye opener: DRUG ADDICTION AND THE LENGTHS THAT PEOPLE GO TO SATISFY IT IS NOT A ROSY THING.  I'm not really sure what you could have expected, but to say that this film isn't realistic makes no sense, because it depicts specific individuals and what they experienced going through THEIR own story, not the story of others.  Also, the reality  of any addiction is that there are people that will go to pathetic depths to satisfy the insatiable addiction.  I don't see how anyone can say the writing was horrible.  Having just finished reading the book, that has to be one of the most absurd and comical statements that I've ever heard.     And, you have to pay attention to exactly the context that the drugs were used in in order to understand what the author, Hubert Shelby was trying to say when he wrote this story.  Maybe actually reading the book would help you understand the story better.    First, the story deals with dreams and hopes.  Harry, Marion, and Tyrone each had dreams of their own.  In the beginning, they fantasized a lot, and talked about how they'd attain everything. But when it came down to actually doing what they needed to achieve their goals, they saw that there was a lot of work behind it.  More and more, each time that they were faced with an obstacle in the way of their dreams, they took some drugs to be able to deal with it.  Unfortunately, through the use of the quick fix, which were drugs but could have been anything, they were not able to deal with reality, and they only pushed the problems away but never fully solved them.  They're dreams were so important to themselves that they continued patching up hardships in the hope of keeping that dream alive. This was a running theme through out the story, and it's just not independent to drug users, but it speaks on the human spirit.  So many times we're afraid to accept that there will be bumps in the road, and we're so afraid to go through them that we use any type of quick fix to erase them, and to keep our dream alive in our mind.  I think that this is the thing that people need to focus more on than the obvious usage of drugs.   In the end, they quick fixed themselves through so many problems that they became addicted to the feeling.  They became addicted to the illusion that everything was ok when, infact, it really wasn't.  Where is the direct knock on the drugs that were depicted in this movie?  What I see is a theme central to humanity, not a senseless and artless depiction of people doing nothing but shooting drugs into their system.     I think Sara's story is more so a need to feel loved and wanted, and to not feel alone.  So many people go through this.  She did everything that she could to get on the show and she did everything that she could to lie to herself that maybe she wasn't going to be on it.  The saddest thing about her story is that her son, Harry could have solved part of her problems.  All that he had to do was visit her and he would have eleviated some of that aloneness that she felt, yet he never came.  He was so wrapped up in the pursuit of his own dreams that he forgot to take the time to see how she was doing.      This movie is in no way a simple knock on drugs.  I think it more so shows the dangers of denial and covering up problems.  I've learned a lot from this movie and the book.  One of the most important things in life is to go through what you're going through no matter how hard things seem.  Requiem for a Dream is as beautifully presented of a story as any that I've ever seen.  It's absolutely gut wrenching, and will make move you--that's if you're open minded enough to think beneath the surface.
B00008DDRX|1.0|If you love car racing, and don't care that there's barely a plot, and catatonic acting, then you won't mind this self-indulgent documentary masquerading as a narrative film.  <br /> <br />Steve McQueen had this film made after kicking himself for 5 years for turning down the opportunity to star in the far-superior, GRAND PRIX. His friend John Frankenheimer designed GRAND PRIX with McQueen in mind, but McQueen was quirky and didn't always pick the best properties to star in. So he turned thumbs-down to GRAND PRIX, James Garner got the lead, GRAND PRIX went on to earn three Oscars and worldwide fans, and McQueen felt like a fool for passing it up. <br /> <br />With a multi-picture production deal set up at a fledgling studio (CINEMA CENTER FILMS) he had his own answer to GRAND PRIX made, only they got a hack director, and forgot to write a screenplay.  <br /> <br />As a film on its own, LE MANS was just another one of McQueen cache of flops.  <br /> <br />Watch it just for the car racing sequences alone, without judgment, and you'll probably like it, although it comes nowhere near the visual and aural excitement to be found most other films that cover the same subject matter.
B000EWBKKI|4.0|I wish they had also included the extended version (even if it required 2 discs for now) but I prefer the original version anyway. <br /> <br />The HD picture is quite good. The \\"studder issue\\" can be eliminated by choosing the Dolby Digital audio track from the menu; this entirely solves any playback issues. (The DTS track is the default so you must change it from the audio menu).
B00005JLEU|3.0|I like every Miyazaki work I've watched except Spirited Away. The girl's parents turned into greedy pigs! I won't watch this. I'm glad someone else shared my view and wrote a similar review. Buying this DVD for my mother on mother's day would be a hurtful insult.     I watch a lot of Japanese animes and the art work for Spirited Away does not strike me as being better than many others. The characters are not charming, I'm not impressed. The award should have gone to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind or Howl's Moving Castle.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is the best Madonna album ever! This was the first Madonna album I had ever heard and it was awesome. I have also listened to some of her earlier albums--\\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"True Blue\\", \\"The Immaculate Collection\\", \\"Bedtime Stories\\", \\"Something to Remember\\", \\"Music\\", and \\"American Life\\". \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is awesome compared to any of the older ones that I have listened to.      1. \\"Hung Up\\" --- Uses the music from Abba's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\". I have heard \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)\\" by the A-Teens and \\"Hung Up\\" is much better, it makes you really want to dance.  5/5      2. \\"Get Together\\" --- Another great song, not as great as \\"Hung Up\\", but the lyrics will get stuck in your head and you can't help but start to dance when it plays.  5/5      3. \\"Sorry\\" --- This song is one of the better songs on the album. At the beginning (and in the middle), Madonna says \\"Sorry\\" in many different languages. I thought that this was a good thing to do because it shows how talented she really is. Like \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Get Together\\", \\"Sorry\\" will make you really want to dance.  5/5      4. \\"Future Lovers\\" --- Although not as good as \\"Sorry\\", \\"Future Lovers\\" is a great song, with good lyrics. It may not make you want to dance as much as \\"Hung Up\\" will, but the song is great no matter what.  5/5      5. \\"I Love New York\\" --- Better than \\"Future Lovers\\", \\"I Love New York\\" has Madonna dissing all other cities such as Los Angeles by saying \\"Los Angeles is for, people who sleep\\" and also Paris and London. Again, it may not make you want to dance, but it is still a great song.  5/5      6. \\"Let it Will Be\\" --- Better than \\"I Love New York\\", \\"Let it Will Be\\" has captivating lyrics, and once you know them, every time you hear the song, you won't be able to help yourself singing along. Maybe it's a little slow to dance to, but as \\"Future Lovers\\" and \\"I Love New York\\", it is still a great song.  5/5      7. \\"Forbidden Love\\" --- Picks up the pace after a couple ofslower songs. The lyrics are great and maybe you'll even want to dance.  5/5      8. \\"Jump\\" --- This song will definitely make you want to dance and jump. The lyrics in this song--as in \\"Let it Will Be\\"--will get stuck in your head. \\"Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump.\\"  5/5      9. \\"How High\\" --- It may sound like a part 2 to \\"Jump\\", but it has a completely different concept. The lyrics to \\"How High\\" are some of the best on the album. \\"How high our mistakes? How much fortune can you make?\\"  5/5      10. \\"Isaac\\" --- Madonna sings stuff from the Bible and about the heavens. The lyrics, as in \\"How High\\" and \\"Let it Will Be\\", the lyrics are good and captivating. Maybe not a song to dance to, but to listen to.  5/5      11. \\"Push\\" --- In my opinion, the best song on the album. It really makes you want to dance, and the lyrics are great. \\"You pushed me to go the extra mile. You pushed me when it's difficult to smile.\\" \\"You pushed me, see the other point of view. You pushed me when there's nothing else to do. You pushed me when I think I know it all. You pushed me when I stumble and I fall.\\"  5/5      12. \\"Like it Or Not\\" --- The closer to the album. Slower than \\"Push\\", but still a great song and the best closing song someone could ever have on an album. The lyrics are also great. \\"You can call me a sinner, but you can't call me a saint.\\"  5/5      This album gets a rating of 60/60 or 100%, which is definitely 5 stars.
B000EU1PKA|4.0|How do you follow up Two Groundbreaking, Classic albums like the \\"Keepers I & II\\" ?  Well Helloween decided to put this album out, Pink Bubbles Go Ape.  Now Sure, this has good tracks like Kids of The Century, and the amusing Heavy Metal Hamsters, but there are no great tracks here.  The band just sounds like they were tapped for ideas, and with a new bigger label, they through stuff together to meet a deadline.  Chameleon actually had more recognizeable songs than this. <br />   The bonus tracks Blue Suede Shoe's, S*** and Lobsters, Les Hambourgeois Walkways are again filler, much like Chameleon, and You Run With The Pack is Ok.  These were all definine burrried B-Side on singles for a reason. <br />   The Packaging, continuation of the remaster's interview in the booklet with the new slipcase are neat, and it upsets me again that this version cost me less than what I paid for the original disc without bonus tracks.   <br />   Again, for a slight Helloween fan, this album can be overlooked.   Since I am a Fan, Love complete collections, and feel this packaged deal is a good component to my collection, a 4 is the lowest I can give this album. If I had not been a fan, a 2 or 3 could have been pulled.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first viewed the movie \\"Serenity\\".  It fasicinated me enough to buy the TV series DVDs.  Excellent entertainment.  The dialogue is often priceless with humor. <br /> <br />Definitely well worth the price.
B000C3H4M2|5.0|I bought 'Fear of Music' back in 1979 on LP when it was brand-new.  It was like nothing I was into at the time (the Beatles, Queen, ELO, Yes, AM radio hits) -- you can say it was one of those albums that changed the direction of music for me (I had no such 'fear'!).  At the time I was 12 years old, and only heard \\"Take Me to the River\\" from their previous album, and took a chance on FOM (after all it was only $4.99 at the time, the good old days of vinyl!) and was glad I did.  From the opening of \\"I Zimbra\\" I knew I was in for something totally different from the standard rock I was into at the time - the funky rhythyms, the words in whatever language I didn't know (which reminded me of how at the time Queen's last album 'Jazz' opened up with \\"Mustapha\\" which was not sung in English - seems the Talking Heads decided to surprise and throw people off by doing the same, it worked) ... and from there the rest of the album was a winner with every track.  Tracks like \\"Paper\\" and \\"Electric Guitar\\" with that great nervous, paranoid voice of David Byrne and unusual arrangements the likes of which I never heard in rock before (this is years before Radiohead -- hmmm....a track from the 'True Stories' album...that will come later!) ... the hit \\"Life During Wartime\\" which made me think and dance at the same time.  Remember, 1979 was in the midst of disco, punk, and new wave all attempting to push aside the old guard of classic rock -- and somehow LDW managed to be all of that in one song (sort of the way the Cars' first album blended all of that, the other great 'new wave' band of the time).  Overall 'Fear of Music' became my favorite Talking Heads album, although 'Remain in Light' stands at a close second.  Having now heard the 5.1 surround sound mix of the album, it is like hearing it for the first time -- it is that good and that worth investing in the DualDisc.  Just for the mix of \\"Drugs\\" it's worth getting, \\"Memories Can't Wait\\" also.  You will hear the album as you nevercould before (the regular CD side is good too, a sonic improvement over the long-availabe Sire release which was in need of an upgrade).  About the only downer about the DualDisc is that I was not able to play the CD side in the my Mac Mini - seems that slot-loading players would have problems playing the disc, and in my case, only the DVD side played (just as well, that's the side I most want to play anyway).
B000F4LPJ6|1.0|Now before I get started I want to let you all know that I'm a major fan of Battle Royale. I've both read the book (I read the novel first) and seen the movie. The book was excellent in both plot, development, action, suspense, and surprises galore. BR is my absolute fave book of all time, hands down.<br />  Now on to the movie. The BR movie had a lot of discrepancies that made me stare into the cathode ray tube of my TV and scream \\"WTF?!\\" the dream that Noriko has in the movie was a major WTF moment. Then Kitano's painting of all the dead students with Noriko standing in the center of it with a golden halo of light.(?) Kazou Kiriyama and Shogo Kawada's being \\"chosen\\" to liven up the game was totally off. The timeline was skewed a bit too.<br /><br />Now I know that book-to-film adaptations are rarely all they're cracked up to be. But this was an atrocity. The book was amazing and rightfully claims a seat on my \\"Top 5 Books of All Time\\" List. The movie took everything that was good with the book and threw it out the window. Yes, the skeleton of the story is mostly there but continuity is horrible, special effects are even worse, and the acting is the absolute worst I've ever seen in my life...period. (No, seriously, the acting is painfully bad.) The stupid alterations to the plot only added to the sense of how bad this movie is. The director Kinji Fukasaku is hailed as one of the greatest directors in Japan. How did this movie get to be so horribly executed? We'll probably never know.<br /><br />Don't watch the movie. Don't read the manga.<br />Save your money.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: Read the novel instead.
B000F48CD8|5.0|I absolutely loved Broken Boy Soldiers. The Raconteurs are a fresh, imaginative band with creative sounds. They're a bit remiiniscent of bands such as The Beatles. Every song on this album sounds a little bit different than the last one, which is a good change from most of the modern bands, where all the songs on an album sound the same. They did an awesome job on Broken Boy Soldiers. Hopefully they make more cd's like this one!
B0009UC7H0|3.0|\\"Sahara\\" is not a brilliant movie.  Its plot, to the extent there is one, is ridiculous and chock full of as many laughable and astounding coincidences as any Bond film.  Perplexingly popular Penelope pairs poorly with Matthew McConaghy.<br /><br />And yet, this movie works for what it is, and is an enjoyable and good-natured action picture.  If you turn off the logic part of your brain (and you will have to), the picture doesn't take itself too seriously, keeps moving at a good pace, and has a good sense of humor.  Steve Zahn and Matthew McConaghy are excellent, as is William H. Macy.  While not a top-tier actioner, this movie is entertaining, and is at least worth a rent.  Hey, it's better and more plausible than at least half of the Bond films.
0064407667|5.0|I wont attempt to be as witty, creative, or original as the author in trying to review this book--which is now one of my all time favorites in a long time love of great (particularly British, which I think this is not) children's literature--much less try to dazzle you with fantasmagorical, origmatical adjectives to describe it.  Heck, I wont even spel czech.<br /><br />Simply: It's a great book, and the best 'children's book' reading experience I've had since the original J.M. Barre version of Peter Pan.<br /><br />I don't see it being inappropriate for children of any age.  It's like the old Bugs Bunny cartoons; so much of it is over children's heads and of such high quality that they'll enjoy it when they're old and fat as much as they did when they were tots.  Maybe it gets a little scary in parts, but still appropriate for very young readers (or beddy-bye listeners).<br /><br />Frankly, though I love the series, Harry Potter doesn't hold a candle to this in terms of just plain literary quality and a good read.
0743201140|1.0|In order to take the online test you have to enter a unique number printed at the back of the book. If someone else has used it, you're stuck, as I found to my cost. The publisher will not provide you with another one.
B000023VR6|5.0|What was the whole world let alone cali doing in 92/93, not what they where doing 99, that just maybe 7 years apart but rap was not heading into 2000 without a bang, if it wasnt 4 Dre-2001. greatest album by far, and im speaking on albums concept, beat production, this was ahead of its time. people may say there party songs and what not, but since this album's been droped, it still hasnt got old, Snoop came, heard beats, and reestablished his an Dre's career, eminem just stamped his trademark lyrics, X 2 tha Z was good(then died out)but not in this album. all in all if dre showed people how 2 do it in 1992 Through 99, he showed them how 2 keep it going. Next Episode, Xplosive, every track had it going, the only problem is some songs needed 2 be a little bit longer. So you could say the lyrics where not better, not as good, but it had everybody pouring there heart out on some creative rhymes, from six 2, Snoop, kurupt, dre even brought back The D.O.C., devin the dude, i mean come on, this was and 4 ever will be the greatest album, until maybe detox. PLEASE BELIEVE ME.
B00005JP4U|4.0|I was reading over criticisms, such as the theory that an ice cube in a glass of water will not change the water levels.  That's strange, Gore used this exact same imagery to illustrate that land-based glaciers, which are not already in water, do in fact melt to raise water levels. <br /> <br />Someone else said that it's the natural cycle of things, and Gore didn't fully go into this.  Well, what's with that chart that *showed* the natural cycle of things, including the last six or so ice ages, and then showed where we are now - far above the hot eras the world has seen before? <br /> <br />As for the world warming up over the last 20th century, the early half included, where are the numbers there?  Gore showed information on a year by year basis in most cases.  What grabbed me especially was that the recorded ten hottest years in history happened within the last two decades, 2005 being the hottest.  How do you explain that away with averaging out the changes over a century? <br /> <br />Some of the criticisms I saw made actual points, such as that some glaciers are getting bigger.  This is the kind of debate that actually works, not just picking holes that can be filled by rewatching the movie.  The thing about the upper atmosphere not getting hotter sounds fishy or nit-picky, but that was close to a good point.  I'll probably look into both of those, so good job, skeptics. <br /> <br />I personally found this documentary to be very enlightening, as it gave concrete facts that I have not been exposed to before.  It tied in things such as hurricanes and draught, things that humans should actually be concerned with, even if they can somehow ignore all the \\"little\\" things like ocean level trends and air pollution.  It also not only explained ecological effects of global warming, but how it relates to us, such as the point about insect populations and diseases. <br /> <br />I figured there would be some criticism for this coming out in a congressional election year.The fact is, wouldn't you rather know about this when there's something we can do?  If it's for Gore's personal gain that's one thing.  But wouldn't it be much better to keep environmental issues in mind when we are electing leaders, knowing now that it is an issue?  I would say so. <br /> <br />I gave it four stars because of Gore's tangeants into his personal life and political career that were not always strongly tied in.  But as for the actual facts, and the actual conclusions drawn, I would give this five stars.
0553213105|5.0|I originally read this for my sophmore English class, and didn't enjoy it too much because of all of the analysis we were required to do.  I re-read it the following summer and discovered it makes much better leisure reading.  I'd say the ideal audience is obviously female (considering the main character is the fiesty heroine Elizabeth Bennet), of any age.<br /><br />Even though it is a classic, it still manages to be quite a page-turner, with unexpected plot twists and witty dialogue.  The most enjoyable aspect of this novel is watching the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy develop.  I've read the book several more times, and each time I find myself anticipating their eventual confession of each others' feelings for one another.  Although the ending of the story is predictable, it is how this ending is reached which makes for an interesting read.<br /><br />The book is largely character and dialogue-based, so I'd shy away from it if that isn't your thing.  However, to any classics-lover, this book is a must!  I'd also highly recommend viewing the BBC mini-series (the one featuring Colin Firth as Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth) to fully experience the Georgian England setting.  But, trust me, you won't want to simply ditch the book to watch the movie version.  Nothing can quite compare to Jane Austen's original writing.
B00008WG3U|5.0|NOFX is an awesome band who expresses their opinon about the f**ked up stuff thats going on in our country because of our Prez. Most all of the songs are diracted against whats happening to our country, though some are funny like the old NOFX such as \\"She's Nubs\\" A good buy if you dislike Bush and want him OUT....not that good of a buy if you like him, since the cover has him in a clown mask. As for the reveiw a few below this one that gave it 1 star..Why are you saying its childish lyrics and music when it says \\"Kids review\\"? plus what true american would want to deport fellow americans because they express their freedom of speech? meh, just wondering, be careful how you choose your words next time
B00009W0WM|5.0|In response to one of the reviewers below, there is no such thing as an authentic widescreen version of Casablanca. Movies made prior to the early 1950s were shot primarily in 4:3 ratio (also known as 1.37 to 1). Gone With the Wind is another example of a movie you will not find in widescreen. <br /> <br />That being said, there's absolutely nothing to disappoint if you purchase this DVD.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Superman is my favorite superhero, and this was a great and honrable comeback for the man of steel!  Way to go, Bryan Singer.  Admittedly, when the familiar theme song and familiar opening credits to Superman Returns began, my heart fell a little to see the names Christopher Reeves, Margot kidder and Gene Hackman replaced by Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey.  But it's time to let go.  The torch has been passed. <br /> <br />Superman comes back after spending five years in Space looking for remnants of his home planet Krypton.  He returns to Earth after finding nothing and also discovers that life on Earth has gotten along without him.  Lois lane has a five-year-old boy and practically engaged.   <br /> <br />From this point, the movie jumps right into the plot without explaining too much of Clark Kent's absence and presses forward.  Really no need to do a re-hash of Superman's background.  Bryan Singer takes this story on a more emotional journey that surprisingly both Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth do pretty well.  On top of that, Bryan Singer refines in outstanding special effects what Richard Donner started in  1978.  Expect more graceful, vertical shots of Superman flying as well as beautiful twilight cinematography.  Witness a sonic boom when he shoots up into the air or creating ripples as he darts across the water's surface.   <br /> <br />As the movie goes along and we've become used to seeing Superman's familiar life-saving strokes, the story becomes more interesting...in fact, very interesting.  I never thought I'd say this, but there is a scene towards the end of the movie that is somewhat of a tearjerker.  Bryan Singer shows his ability to tug at heartstrings as well as put out some great action.  Last time I saw that was X-men 2.  <br /> <br />Without a doubt, this film was made with a sense of grace and reverence for the world's oldest superhero.  Definitely a must see.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Just to clarify those video details. As an ex-editor I can tell you this was probably shot on a (at the time) broadcast quality Betacam cameras. The biggest problem was that because of the spectacular light show which will range from a few lights to a lot of lights, sometimes the gain on the cameras is so high it's more grainy than it should be. But only sometimes!    Basically, when it's low light a camera will artifically 'enhance' the video, and the side-affect is grain. And sometimes the Pink Floyd light show is low, so the camera compensates, and then next thing you know the lights are way up and the quality of the video isn't grainy at all because the camera doesnt have to compensate. Does that make sense?    So compared to David Gilmor's or Roger Waters' solo dvds the quality isn't AS GOOD, but it's a vast improvement on VHS days still.    But the audio is great! Althought this new Dolby Digital higher bitrate soundtrack isn't playable on my somewhat new Denon DVD/DVD-Audio/SACD player which is a bit perplexing. But the mixing is great. I thought they would just put people cheering in the rear channels of the surround mix, but they've actually put music back there. It's like listening to a Super Audio CD in 5.1 surround, but with video!    And someone earlier said the inflatable 'pigs' have been cut out of the film. I'm glad to tell you that they are in plain sight (and cut to shots of a little more frequently than what I would have liked) during the non-Pulse-CD-track: 'One of these days' at the end of disc 1. They don't float down, but just sit there. I vaguely remember a pig floating in the Delecate Sound of Thunder concert video....maybe thats what they were thinking of.    Oh, and before I go I gotta say the editing in general is a bit poor for those interested in the techicality of making the music. As someone who loves Dave Gilmor's artistry with the guitar I found the shots were way too short of Dave. And rarely did they focus on his hands while playing except for when it was just simple pieces. When he is on the slide guitar for instance, most of the shots are dedicated to the light show. Great to look at sure, but I would have preferred looking at Dave get right into the music and make those 'guitar expessions' when he gets to the high notes. I just don't think the editing was really in synch with the feel of the songs.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is an amazing CD. Along with it's follow-up, X&Y, it's literally all that I've listened to for about a year. I'm not exaggerating, THESE TWO CDs ARE ALL I'VE LISTENED TO FOR A YEAR. It never gets old, which is a true sign of a classic in the making.

A 2 hour concert....that's right..all the  old  chestnuts...surprise guests ...some  cool  blues jamming...WOW...and on top of that a \\"making of\\" portion of the DVD  which is as good as the CLASSIC ALBUM  series..with STeve talking about the history of the recording  etc etc...just wonderful...and all for  under  $20!! <br /> <br />Trust me...if  you have the CD and you're wondering if you should spring  for the \\"30th Anniversary\\" edition...DO IT!!  I'm watching Steve pick  away on his acoustic while discussing James Cotton and \\"Sweet Marie\\"...how cool!!!
B0000508U6|4.0|Even though this CD has one of my all-time favorite Coldplay songs on it, Trouble, it still isn't as good as their two follow-up CDs. Don't get me wrong though, this is a very good CD by the best band in the world.
0312330529|4.0|Shantaram...an engaging thriller that I couldn't put down. It is written as to make you think that this is a true story. But the storyline itself is rather farfetched in some places. I checked out the bibliography and it is listed as \\"fiction.\\" So I am going to assume this is an extremely embellished account of the author's life. Regardless, it is quite engaging and hard to put down. Sometimes the author seems to go over the same themes, but I just glossed over those pages, which wasn't much of a loss, considering the substantial size of this novel. I cannot wait for the movie to come out; I only hope they do not ruin this book in theater as they did \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is an amazing CD. Along with its predecessor, A Rush of Blood to the Head, it's literally all I've listened to for about a year. I'm not exaggerating; THESE TWO CDs ARE ALL I'VE LISTENED TO FOR A YEAR. It never gets old, which is a true sign of a classic in the making.
B000063V8S|5.0|The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order although Season Three was aired fairly much according to the chronological produced order except for episode one and two which are switched around. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.<br /><br />Not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" would deliver on at the end of Season III, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There was no time to loose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh... so here we are. Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG) had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' With Season Three it was the dawn of the 90s and CGI had undergone some development and improvements (better looking planets with moving gaseous atmospheres, particle effects, lighting and subspace effects). With Season Three things started to have more of a movie budget look. Season Four tries to maintain that class. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (who keeps growing that hair), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data, Dr. Beverly Crusher and Ensign Wesley Crusher (now a Starfleet officer with full uniform, also departs from TNG half way through this Season, and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons). Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien and Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for Season Four such as Worf's lover K'Ehleyr, the Traveller, K'Mpec the Klingon leader, Duras whose dishonesty caused Worf's discommendation and the Romulan Tomalak. There is also a surprise character at the end of this season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Borg, family, Dr. Soong and the AI emotion chip, adoption, the space-time continuum, hostage rescue, the Klingon High Council, Romulans, alternative universes, holographic projection, survival,  loosing special abilities, renegade captains, the devil, amnesia, first contact, love, nightmares, mutations, super intelligence, Robin Hood, witch hunt trials, euthanasia, host life forms, mind control and honour. Like Season Three most the episodes in Season Four have great stories, combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did. It is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established. Apart from containing Part II of `The Best of Both Worlds', the introduction of the Cardassians, who would become major players in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine franchise, makes it even more valuable. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, `The Best of Both Worlds, Part II' concludes the cliff-hanger from Season Three with some great battle special effects, `Family' has Picard going home to see his brother and family, `Brothers' features Dr. Soong who is Data's creator, `Reunion' returns to the story of Worf and his Klingon dishonour, `The Wounded' features the Cardassians for the first time, `Clues' has Data disobeying Picard, `First Contact' sees Riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring, the `The Nth Degree' has Barclay taking control of the Enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence, `QPid' for its historical recreation of Robin Hood and of course `Redemption, Part I' which deals with Worf's dishonour. The bottom line for TNG: Season Four is that it keeps up the pace of Season Three, and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. Everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want. Although not quite the cliff-hanger end episode that \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" was, `Redemption, Part I' still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know. We are left asking ourselves, if the `hard man' is really gone and why does `she' look like a Romulian! As Picard would say \\"I can live with a mystery\\" but we just can't! Onto Season Five as quick as we can...rough this Season, and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons).

B000EDWKXI|4.0|What does it take to make a man who has had it all happy?  Or a woman who can do it all happy?  Each other maybe?  This is the essence of this story.  Heath Ledger plays a witty, intelligent, and charming Casanova in 1700's Venice.  Abandoned by his mother at a young age, he alleviates his sense of longing by seducing and bedding women left and right.  Francesca is the a beautiful, intelligent, cunning lady with spunk and good fighting skills to boot.  She cannot find a man to make her happy.  They encounter each other when her brother challanges Casanova over another woman.  He immediately falls in love with Francesca and begins to woo her.  But nothing is ever simple in love, esecially in the movies.  A fearsome Vatican inquisitor and a fat businessman complicates things, along with the local authorities, neighbors and friends of course.  Slowly but surely, Casanova gets Francesca to fall in love with him, the inquisitor is duped, Francesca's mom finds another man, and all ends well.<br /><br />The movie is brisk, lighthearted and funny.  The romance is gentle and the sex scenes are fleeting at worst.  Outside of Casanova and Francesca, the other characters range from ridiculous to ludicrous, thereby adding to the show.  This reviewer highly recommends this movie.
0380799006|5.0|This book is wonderful in helping parents deal with sibling rivalry. Most of us tend to do the oppossite of what is recommended, and this almost never works. When you do it the way they describe things become a whole lot less stressful. <br />Higly recommended.
B00005JOVH|3.0|I enjoyed \\"The last stand\\" but they still can't get it right. There were a few things that the fans were begging and expecting to see but were left out which hurt my impression of the film. One, no sentinals. The sentinals could of easily been included into the polt to add excitement and eye candy. Seeing that Magneto is prepairing for war against the human race the president releases the Sentinel project to take out Magneto's forces only to have most of the Sentinels distroyed by The Phoenix. They could of used \\"Mastermold\\" as the main antagonist instead of that Crreeeeepy bald kid(he was just a kid but still). 2) No Gambit. Gambit is probably the most popular X-Man second only to Wolverine, it would make sence to put him in the films then right? Nope.. even when there was a golden opportunity to introduce him. Iceman and Rouge are having relationship problems. Iceman is falling for Kitty Pride and Rouge finds herself falling for the new kid in class. The charming and rougish badboy with a golden heart Gambit. 3) No Nightcrawler, another very popular character missing. 4) What they did to professor X....why?!!. It's not a bad film but it's the last film and seems to have ended in a \\"bamph\\" instead of a BANG!
B00005JNEI|5.0|This was quite a shock watching the movie. I knew lots of stuff was wrong from the news, but I never knew the full details to it until this movie. Keep up the good work Michael.
B00006690G|5.0|Of all of Eminem's albums, this one is his best.  The beats on this album are outsatnding with Eminem's clear rapping, and good featured artists.  The radio played \\"Without Me\\" is a good representation of the whole album- strong vocals, comedy within the music, ect.  While some of the material is violent (especially towards his ex-wife) it is less than his first- Slim Shady.  He seems to enjoy the \\"rap-game\\" and shows it thorugh this masterpiece of rap.  Very few albums in this genre are better.  The one down is the song feat. Obie Trice (who is not a bad rapper- see his Cheers CD) \\"Drips\\" which is somewhat obscene.
0760750920|1.0|I made it to chapter 8 in this book when lo and behold it skipped all the way to chapter 13!  I was horrified because I am really enjoying this book.  I searched the entire book, and this is only place where pages are missing.  Does anyone else with this very book (ISBN 0760750920) have the same problem?
B000002INR|5.0|All that I have to say about this one of many metal masterpieces is that it rocks from start to finish unless you count the awesome ballad \\"I remeber you\\". Totally worth it all but I wouldnt say the same for the greatest hits though.
B000000OAL|5.0|My first Queen album, and still one of my favorite. Mercury's vocals are incomparable; his range is as far-reaching as his lyrics. The band is tight, the music is unique and powerful. Queen rocks. Vive Freddie!
B0000931QA|5.0|Queensryche is hands down the best metal band in my eyes. Geoff Tate has the voice of an angel [I'm a girl in case your wondering from the last statement] This IS the best concept album ever written and you have to be mindcrimed not to like or even love this album. I rest my case.... you just have to buy this album- a million billion times better than OM2. BUY THIS ASAP!!!!!!!!!
B000BNI95Y|5.0|I picked this up to give it a try and it is amazing. All of her songs speak so strongly to what women feel and go through. I can identify with each song on this CD and her voice is comforting in an alternative way. I would recommend this disc to anyone who likes latin rock/pop. Has a good message in each track.
B000000OQ5|5.0|This cd is a keeper, I'v always wonderd who that band was in my dad's cd rack and thank God that I borrowed it. I would say the highlights on this cd are Modern Day Cowboy and Rock Me To The Top even thought I'm a fan of just about the whole cd. Get this cd and get it quick!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This review is solely for the purpose of getting OK Computer back up to 5 stars, though I could go on and on about how deeply Radiohead and particularly this album have affected me and, ultimately, changed my life. <br /> <br />Bottom line is this: Anyone who doesn't appreciate OK Computer cannot appreciate music.
B000002IGP|5.0|This cd is one of Ratt's personal best right next to invasion of your privacy. This is just an all around great cd. I could go on and on about this disc so I'll just make it short and simple..... if you are a 80's headbanger get this disc!!!!
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I can tell you that this is gonna be an awesome DVD just cause I was at the RCMH show...and it was so good!!! DT is by far the most underrated band ever, wish them the best and do your self a favor, buy this DVD, you wont regret...LONG LIVE DREAM THEATER!!!!
B00009UW0N|4.0|Perhaps anchor bay rereleased it's horrific masterpiece two years too early for an anniversary spectacular edition, but Halloween still remains the holy grail of all slasher films. When the immortal killer Michael first donned his rubber mask in 1978, fear sparked across the globe at this nail biting, edge of your seat thriller, catapulting audience members into a state of pure, exiliharating suspense. The film, with it's perfect cult status, was later followed with a grueling number of deficient sequels, each copying and belittling it's predeccesor until audience members shifted their attentions to other characters in the same macabre genre. The original Halloween continues to be the grandest horror movie of the past millinium, backed excellently in this special edition dvd by a slew of delicious bonus features. So gather your loved ones in October, cozy around the television, and scare yourself silly with this piece of hair raising entertainment.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Amazing!  Wonderful!  There are not enough superlatives to describe this fabulous concert - hauntingly beautiful music, and a gorgeous, spectacular presentation.  The women are beautiful, and they sing beautifully.  Most of the tunes are traditional Celtic tunes, with a couple in Gaelic, but there are also some more recent songs - Someday, from Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Somewhere (a four part female voice arrangement) from West Side Story are just a couple  The show stopper song for me is You Raise Me Up, but Nella Fantasia might be my favorite song of the concert.  I enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend this wonderful concert.
B000679N96|4.0|If you like The Cure and are interested in hearing their early material, this re-issue might be for you. Punk fans may also appreciate this. The album itself is a little spotty, with the high-points being '10.15 Saturday Night', the incredibly catchy 'Grinding Halt', and the haunting 'Fire In Cairo'. The demos were interesting to hear once or twice, but they don't have much lasting value. On the second disc, I found the demos 'I Just Need Myself', 'Heroin Face', and 'I Want to Be Old' most entertaining. The second disc also contains the studio tracks 'Jumping Someone Else's Train' and 'Boys Don't Cry' are included, as they were not on the original 'Three Imaginary Boys' but were included on the American 'Boys Don't Cry' album. In short, this is a great re-issue for a hardcore Cure fan that likes punk, but you can get all the best songs off this re-issue on the 'Boys Don't Cry' album (the one with the pyramid and the palm trees).
B000F7CMRM|4.0|Movies like this, that have multiple storylines that eventually coincide (though you may not pick up on it initially) can easily slip into the 'I lost interest in it' category...not this one. The storyline is topical and fascinating, the situations of the 3 main characters is believable and well executed. There is a quality about this movie that motivated me to keep watching, even though I wasn't sure where it would end up. Enough things sort of slipped by me , that a repeat watch will still be entertaining...something I very, very rarely care to do. Even if your opposed to the premise, or think it too fictitious or too much of a  writers stretch at 'showing things how they really are', in terms of the US gov't's role in oil, etc there is no denying that this is quality movie-making.
B00005NWM3|4.0|Silver Side Up is one of Nickelback's finest albums.  However, I do agree with others that say a lot of their songs are repetitive and sound alike.  If you want to hear some truly astounding music, just pick up Master of Puppets by Metallica.
B000FFJ85I|2.0|This album is not the AFI that I've listened to for years. I know that it's just yet another step along the long afi-sound-road, but I think it's a step in the wrong direction. The Killing Lights (track 10) almost made me want to cry. Even Davey's lyrics have lost that delicacy that he touched on so perfectly in The Art of Drowning and Sing the Sorrow. <br /> <br />It's killing time again.              &lt;-- bad line. <br />Put on your face and let's pretend,        &lt;--a little more like Davey.. <br />These killing lights won't kill us all again.      &lt;--?! <br /> <br />That is...not...good. <br /> <br />Anyway. <br /> <br />Despite everything I've said above this album isn't bad. This is the sort of album that bands produce when they're still trying to get popular before they become awesome. Not something they produce after they have a huge and sickeningly loyal (almost cult-like) fan base. This album shouldn't have taken as long as it did. <br /> <br />If you're new to AFI then you'll probably enjoy this cd. <br /> <br />Otherwise prepare to be disappointed..
B0000028UK|5.0|Released in 1993, this is Pearl Jam's second album.  It is 46 minutes long and the sound quality is very good in a grunge kindo of way.  The original CD came in a cardboard cover that was hard to figure out how to open.   <br /> <br />This is just a very good CD throughout.  There are no weak songs on it.  There are some great numbers, like W.M.A. and Rearviewmirror.  There is a lot of energy in the music. <br /> <br />The only real problem is the mix, in some spots.  The drums can be up front too much on some tracks, especially Leash.   <br /> <br />Pearl Jam's first two albums were great.  Later CD's were a mixed bag.  Some people say that is because the first CD were hard rock drivers and the later the group got into experimenting.  I disagree.  I think the hard rock part got stale after the first 2 CD's and it is was the newer music that saved those CD's from being completely worthless. <br /> <br />In spite of the unevenness of some of their CD's Pearl Jam was and is one of the most important bands in rock history.....and I am not a Grunge fan.
B00005JMCT|4.0|Probably not.  While not quite as good as the first two Pie films, American Wedding does have it's good points and does continue to make us laugh.  The bad thing is that none of the orininal girls are here except for Alyson Hannigan and even though the guys are back, Chris Kline is missing...oh wait, that's not so bad.  Anyways, this movie is really more about Stifler (William Scott) and Finch (Kaye Thomas) than really anyone else.  I mean, the film is about Jim (Biggs) and Michelle (Hannigan) getting married, Jim trying to impress her uptight parents (played brilliantly by Fred Willard and Deborah Rush) while trying to keep Stifler under control.  The real story though is Stifler's efforts to woo Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones) upon finding out she's still a virgin.  The problem is Finch is also trying to woo her as well.  Of course things go bad, people's feelings get hurt, the wedding gets jepordized as does Stifler's friendship with the gang.  The funny scenes mostly include crude humor and sex related antics, and of course there are beautiful strippers (Amanda Swisten & Nikki Schieler Ziering)...but the funniest part happens in a gay bar when Stifler has a dance off against Bear (Eric Allen Kramer) which is just drop dead hilarious!  It's almost as good if not better than the dance off in 'Starsky & Hutch'...and it's makes this movie stand out a bit from being just another random sex-comedy.  Yes, the American Pie series is over (well, 'Bandcamp' was released straight to video but I'm not sure too many people cared to see it...I mean, Eugene Levy was in it, but I don't even think he could have been enough of a draw) but it ended with a decent bang, not an explosion, but more than a pop.  Jim's dad is still hilarious and I'm sure there is bound to be a lot here to please the die-hard Pie fan, that's for sure.  If nothing else you get to watch Stifler eat poop.
B0000214F0|4.0|The unrated version definitely earns an X rating, and not just for sex. I really don't like to mix sex with violence in movies because the former is the most natural thing in the world while the latter the most unnatural. Having said that, I consider this movie successful as a biopic. The excesses are intrinsic to the story, though whether they are graphic or implied is another matter. The graphic nature of the movie doesn't bother me, though some of the violence is rather gruesome (castrations, etc.). I am very glad the filmmakers decided to show the excesses graphically because it really drives home just how depraved Caligula was (or at least was purported to have been), giving the film that much more impact. However, some of the sex scenes are unnecessarily long, such as the orgy scene where fellatio is shown to the point of climax. The same effect could have been achieved with just a few seconds of the act shown rather than a few minutes. Nonetheless, if you are interested in this period of history, Caligula offers you a remarkable glimpse of the mad emperor.
B00000612Q|5.0|This album was the soundtrack to a (for me, at least) painful breakup with Janet, who seriously broke my heart at the tender age of 19. Every track brings back memories, and I consider it to be one of the best albums of all time, with \\"Every picture tells a story\\" bringing up a close second. It was simply Rod and his mates at their best, playing good rock an'roll as it should be played, with a bit of a sense of humour,and it was all downhill when they broke up. I actually got to see them live, (in '72, i think) and I wish I still had the haircut! it would be good if some of todays bands could sound as good live.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Be warned: THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!<br /><br />The first of the late Christopher Reeve's appearances as the legendary Man of Steel is also the best. In this one, we learn of Superman's origins on Krypton, starting with his father, Jor-El, conducting the trial of 3 Kryptonian criminals (who would appear in Superman 2) charged with treason & sedition. Jor-El sends his only son, Kal-El, to Earth so that he will not perish with the doomed planet. Kal-El lands in the midwest U.S. and is adopted by the Kents, who name him Clark. After Jonathan Kent dies of a heart attack, Clark learns of his true identity, and the 'Fortress of Solitude' is created from the Kryptonian crystals contained in his ship. As an adult, Clark takes on a job with the Daily Planet paper. One night, as he leaves work, he sees a helicopter crash on the building's roof. From this night on, he will be known as SUPERMAN! His mission: 'To fight for truth, justice & the American Way'. A devious psychopath named Lex Luthor has other ideas - including a plot to hijack 2 nuclear missiles to strike California's San Andreas Fault, creating an earthquake that will wipe out the California coastline. Superman must race against time & overwhelming odds to stop Luthor & the missiles before millions of innocent people perish.<br /><br />Considering that digital effects didn't exist when this was made, the flying sequences are AMAZINGLY realistic! Reeve looks like he is actually flying. Not to mention the story is well written and includes a couple of unexpected plot twists. And John Williams does it again with an amazing score that personifies the characters & story so well, not surprising, considering that this one came on the heels of 'Star Wars' the previous year. It was also good to see the extended footage in this DVD, especially the one as Superman goes through Luthor's gauntlet of doom, where he faces machine guns, napalm, and sub-zero temperatures - and emerges unharmed.<br /><br />Long live the memory of Christopher Reeve - 1952-2004ry of Christopher Reeve - 1952-2004
B000FIMG68|5.0|This is better then 1, IMO. If someone tells you otherwise, don't listen. Just watch and judge for yourself. (Possible spoilers ahead, but nothing major)    This year introduces new characters Ana-Lucia, Mr. Eko, and Libby as well as several other characters that play a role on the island. The 3 above as well as a couple others are survivors of the tail section. The first third of the season has them finding their way to our old group and this creates new alliances as well as rivalries. There are surprises everywhere, new flashbacks, and many mysteries are answered. We find out that there is a bigger picture then we realized. A couple organizations are introduced that may have played a part on the crash. We find out a LOT more about the Others (and actually see them).    Some highlight episodes include:  Man of Science, Man of Faith: What's in the hatch? Look here.  The Other 48 Days: Shows everything that happened to the tail survivors during season 1.  The 23rd Psalm: First flashback of Mr. Eko (now a fan favorite) and includes the first full look at the monster.   Maternity Leave: What happened to Claire when she was abducted? Look here.  Two For the Road: The last 5 minutes shocked everyone, even spoiler readers like myself.  Live Together, Die Alone: Season finale. Why did the plane crash? This is my favorite episode yet.    Anyways, this is sure to get any fan hungry for season 3. But please if this is your first time, you must watch season 1.    Oh, and I like the cover art, extra points for that.
0553260111|2.0|Admittedly, the reason I read The Bourne Identity had everything to do with how much I enjoyed the recent film of the same name.  However, the book bears very little resemblance to the movie.  So little in fact that I wonder if the writers of the movie recognized the same weaknesses in the book as I did: shoddy writing, a confused and over-complicated plot, and a ridiculously juvenile, untenable love story. <br /> <br />I kept expecting the story to pick up and sweep me away as most great novels do, and I tried to gloss over my own revulsion at the soap opera dialog, and blaze undaunted through the remainder of the book...sort of like sitting through a movie you know you don't like much, but sticking around because you've already spent your money to see it. <br /> <br />The premise of the story is also hampered by a sort of cowboys and indians, good versus evil, over-simplified rationale on the part of Ludlum's characters.  Their motives are described plainly enough throughout the book, yet those motives are difficult to understand because they seem so casually overwrought.  Both Bourne and his nemesis, Carlos are laughably thin characterizations.  So much so that I found myself reminded time and time again of The Young and the Restless...especially when the story involved Marie.  Too often, her character came across as wooden and forced.  I don't buy her devotion to Bourne for a minute.  I was actually hoping that she would turn out to be an undercover agent or a psycho or something...anything to make her character more interesting or believable. <br /> <br />I have heard that the second and third books in this series are better, but The Bourne Identity doesn't give me enough reasons to find out for myself.  This is the only instance I've found where the movie is better than the book.  So, rather than waste four or five days slogging away at another Ludlum \\"best-seller,\\" I'll just stick to the films, thanks.

B00003CX9E|1.0|To enjoy Citizen Kane, you have to be able to answer the question above. I just hate almost everything about this film. I think it's easy to create a hype how such a terrible film look great and deep. Many people will fall for it. But it's very hard to make a truly GREAT FILM!
B00005A1PR|5.0|The beloved India Arie is the muscial equivalent of the \\"girl next door.\\"  With her earthy, unassuming style and her smooth, melodic tones India reminds us all of a good friend.  If she isn't singing about self-love via an upbeat tune that we can groove to (Video), than she is reminding us gently that we are beautiful and to rejoice in our Blackness (Brown Skin).  A musical compilation that is worthy of a Grammy simply on the strength of the messages contained in the lyrics...the songstress herself is gravy.  Loved it, loved it, and still do. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Since I've been unable to see Mr. Buble perform in person, I was so excited to find this DVD presentation.  From the his initial stage entrance to the final song its just fabulous!!  His \\"bubbly\\" personality shines through each performace and the banter he carries on with the audience is funny/charming/very entertaining.  I recommend this wonderful viewing experience to anyone who enjoys a great show with great songs that are timeless.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Any CD that speaks of \\"squares\\" has already peaked my interest.  Being a self-proclaimed \\"square,\\" I was ready for John Mayer's debut CD \\"Room for Squares\\" to speak volumes to me, and I wasn't disappointed.  Released in 2001 by Sony Music Entertainment and produced by John Alagia, the CD contains 14 songs written and performed by Mayer with Clay Cook working on the music for three of the tracks.  Mayer's first release in September 2001 went gold by April 2002, and in August 2002 he was nominated for MTV's Best New Artist award.  In February 2003, Mayer received the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance Grammy for \\"Your Body is a Wonderland.\\"   <br />First, the collection of songs on this CD establishes Mayer as a strong vocalist and a supremely talented musician.  Considered a pop rock artist, this CD demonstrates Mayer's blues leanings mixed with jazz.  His voice is smooth, almost sultry, in his performances, backed up by upbeat arrangements including guitars, bass, various percussion instruments and even violin and cello on some tracks.  In a Downbeat Magazine article from July, 2006, Yoshi Kato summed up Mayer's musical style this way: \\"Then again, this shouldn't come as a huge surprise, as Mayer has been a blues fan since a neighbor gave him a Stevie Ray Vaughan cassette at age 13, after which the Connecticut native attended the Berklee College of Music. This pop star can really play\\" (par. 6). <br />Next, my initial impression is that Mayer is a talented young artist who has a nice sound.  His music has an infectious rhythm and sticks in your head after you've turned off the music.  After spending time listening and absorbing his lyrics, I discovered that his talent goes beyond the music; his lyrics have a depth and poignancy that make him a performer with substance.   <br />Also, like many listeners, my curiosity was first peaked by the track \\"Your Body is a Wonderland,\\" and then I discovered the other treats on this album.  For such a young artist, Mayer at 25 years old has captured ideas and feelings well beyond his age.  In his first track, \\"No Such Thing,\\" he tells his thoughts of looking back at his high school years and uncovering the fallacies he was told this way: \\"I wanna run through the halls of my high school/ I wanna scream at the top of my lungs/ I just found out there's no such thing as the real world/ Just a lie you've got to rise above.\\"   Another profound song, \\"My Stupid Mouth,\\" Mayer talks of his experiences in social situations and now understands his mother's lessons of his youth.  He explains, \\"Oh, another social casualty/ Score one more for me/ How could I forget? Mama said \\"think before speaking\\"/ No filter in my head/ Oh, what's a boy to do/ I guess he better find one soon.\\"   <br />Besides the popular tracks, there are a few that are less notable.  For instance, the 14th track, \\"St. Patrick's Day,\\" unlike his other songs is much less upbeat, almost droning musically and vocally.  In the same way, track 11, \\"Great Indoors,\\" falls into the same rut of monotonous rhythms and unmemorable lyrics.  However, for a first release Mayer has accomplished more winning songs than flops. <br />Moreover, Mayer is enjoying a large fan base with this initial release, and from the number of awards he has received, he has been accepted by the industry, too.  This first release is anything but \\"square\\" as it demonstrates a well-rounded, consistently high caliber of work throughout all fourteen tracks.  If this release is representative of his work, I expect we will be hearing from him for a long time to come.  If you're not able to remember all the words, then happily, you will certainly have the tune in your head long after the music has ended.  <br /> Finally, if there were a down side to his album, it must be that Mayer is too new.  With age comes lessons, and although it is not apparent in his lyrics, he still has many life lessons ahead of him, hopefully.  If his first venture is this polished and profound, imaginewhat is yet to be!  Likewise, musically, there are so many directions his future endeavors can expand into; hopefully, his first big venture will give him the confidence to explore more of his blues roots in future sessions.  <br />
B0000001PW|5.0|I remember buying this on cassette when it was first released, way back in the 80's. I was still going through my Buddy Rich phase at that time [still am!], and although I'd heard other fusion bands - none had really made an impact, until I heard this! I was familiar with Chick Corea's earlier work, but Dave Weckl and John Patitucci were new to me.  <br /> <br />These three players were the core of The Elektric Band. Guitarists Scott Henderson and Carlos Rios joined them on various tracks. The first thing I focussed on was Dave Weckl's drumming. I'd never heard anything like that before; especially the way he combined electronic percussion with his acoustic kit playing. And of course his amazing drumming abilities!  <br /> <br />Once I got more into the actual music, there were more surprises. The compositions were at times extremely complex, or quite jazzy and funky. I was also impressed with the way keyboard and guitar melodies would merge as one, with Chick even bending notes on his keys whenever Scott or Carlos used their whammy bar! Of course, this \\"doubling up\\" melodies has always been around, but I'd never heard it quite like this. It's a very effective technique.  <br /> <br />There's a track on this album called \\"Rumble\\", which has sequencers, electro-acoustic drumming and Chick's trademark melodic lines playing over this - not to mention Patitucci's bass-work driving it along. Quite amazing. Remember, this was all happening in 1986 - 20 years ago! Other highlight tracks for me are; \\"Cool Weasel Boogie\\", where Patitucci switches to acoustic bass to provide a more laid back feel. The showcase track would have to be \\"Got a Match?\\" a fast tempo tune displaying the band's virtuosity to the full. But, my favourite track is \\"Silver Temple\\", which is a masterpiece, and a wonderful way to close the album. Weckl lays down some nice grooves on this, typical (now) of his style.  <br /> <br />All in all, I think \\"The Elektric Band\\" set a new standard in fusion, and must have spawned a whole new generation of bands, trying to reach that level. And I can still listen to it today and get the same enjoyment from it. Amazingly, a live gig of the band was actually shown on TV around the time of the album's release! Scott played guitar throughout that performance. It was incredible actually seeing these players carrying it off live! I only wish someone would re-release that particular gig on DVD. I'd love to see them in action again, when they were at their best.  <br /> <br />A ground-breaking album. A MUST BUY for anyone new to fusion.  <br /> <br />Yanek   <br />
B00008CLOA|3.0|As I'm writing I'm listening to the original CD edition, mastered shortly thereafter the debut of Compact Disc format, 20+ years ago.  Moments before, I was listening to the 30th anniversary edition on my discman, to confirm what I've felt while I've listened yesterday in loudspeakers.<br /><br />I'm not an audiophile, but I do own a reasonable stereo system and I'm a musician and so I have some good ears. And alas, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in its 30th anniversary edition does not deliver. It sounds more like the \\"Tamed Side of the Moon\\".<br /><br />Take for instance the guitars and sax on \\"Money\\". On the 30th anniversary edition, their sound has been so softened that it sounds like Huey Lewis and the News, like almost any 1980's song of the genere. Or Clare Torry's vocals in \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", where he seems to sing backstage with the group ahead him. Or even the drums on the intro of \\"Time\\", where Nick Mason seems to suffer from arthritis if we take the sound for granted.<br /><br />There are some improvements, sure - there's no distortion in some moments here and there, and sometimes the drums (but not the cymbals - excessive noise redution?) sound clearer than the 1983 remaster. But the emotional feeling and the fury have been lost, in some way. Perhaps it's the aging of the tapes, but I don't particularly believe this - listen for the DVD-Audio/CD edition of \\"Elis & Tom\\", recorded in 1974 and you'll notice the difference - there's a big, big improvement relative to original CD edition.<br /><br />In short, a lackluster. It's my first SACD, and I must say that I'm not impressed - actually, it's quite the contrary.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I think that this CD is great and relaxing. When you come home and make a cocktail turn her on and you can't help but get in the mood. I prefer her over Norah Jones anyday because she have more soul in her music.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is a fantastic album. And other people have said it better than i can already. Go buy it. <br /> <br /> <br />But, as i noticed with a few of the reviewers, The Mars Volta made a serious diservice to the listening audience when it devided Cassandra Gemini into 8 Tracks, while only giving it 5 Movements. This leaves 3 tracks which are essentially untitled, but which ones?! <br /> <br />iTunes makes the entire problem worse by listing the movements of Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore individually also, which encroaches upon Cassandra Gemini. Amazon gets that portion correct. Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore is ONLY TRACK #4, ONLY. Don't let iTunes fool you, like it has already some of us. Miranda is only 13 minutes long, while Cassandra is 30.  <br /> <br />Which brings us to my main point: the Cassanda Track Listing, which goes as follows: <br />5: Tarantism <br />6: Plant a Nail in the Navel Stream <br />7: \\" <br />8: Faminepulse <br />9: \\" <br />10: \\" <br />11: Multiple Spouse Wounds <br />12: Sarcophagi <br /> <br />remember that. Its important. That, or just fuse them into one track and listen to the the right way
