B003D83DPA|5.0|The review by Robert Hedges here rather hits the nail on the head in my book so I won't rehash - great musicianship and a lot of fun to watch. Not having seen the VHS version, can't comment on the relative sound quality, but it's very good on Blue Ray. The photography is good qualtiy for a stage performance - multiple camera angles and the editing keeps things moving along. The problem with the visual qualtiy seems to be the lighting that shifts from bright white spot to blue to red to other colors; this change intensity of light must have been a cameraman's nightmare f-stop wise. Quite often there is a lack of fill lights, so when the high-beam white spot is on illuminated areas are washed out in places whilst non-illuminated areas are very dark or simply black. However, this in no way - for me - detracted from the performance; gave it a bit of a psychadelic look at times! Aside from his incredible guitar playing, what I found most interesting about this performance was Mark's vocal delivery. Let's face it, he doesn't have a voice with great range, but his delivery and timing are fascinating. The band - including a great keyboard player amongst others - looks like it was having a grand old time and I think viewers of this DVD will as well. The item is a bit pricey, reason for this explained by others here.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|I saw the trailer in the theater and thought that I would like to check it out.  As soon as it became available on Red Box I rented it.  I don't have blue ray or even HDTV but the picture quality was vividly amazing from the first scene to the last.  The acting is superb and the characters are believable.  Almost from the beginning I found myself trying to figure out the twist.  I knew there was one and as the story played on I changed my mind several times about what I thought the twisted plot was.  It was enjoyable for me to watch a movie that allowed me to engross my brain.  I was entertained until the very end and was not disappointed in the ending.  The only reason I didn't give this movie five stars is because it reminded me very much of another movie which starred Johnny Depp.  I won't tell the title of that movie as it may be a \\"spoiler\\" to some.  So I'll just keep it a \\"Secret\\".

0765322889|4.0|I have to admit that starting this series can feel a bit like being dumped in the deep end of a dark pool. Nothing is as you are used to as a fantasy reader. You are grasping for the familiar, but it eludes you in most cases. Warrens? Ascendants?  Its one of the first times I spent any time looking at the sections in the front and back of the book to figure out what was going on. It made me realize how much i was taking for granted in reading fantasy books. I realized the author wanted you to feel like you had been dropped in this real world that had been going on for centuries without you. It was your job to figure everything out. This book made me a better reader. i pay more attention to the small details because you may need them later.<br /><br />The characters are amazing and the setting is quite exciting. The book flowed well from begining to end (if you discount the \\"wtf is going on moments\\") Overall the ending to this book was outstanding. So much happens as powers converge. It can be a bit confusing at times, but the author really isnt trying to make sure you know everything. Sometimes things dont dawn on you until 3 or 4 books later. It's wonderful when your eyes open up to the deep world! I say take your time slow down and enjoy it. This is the first of a very great series and I cant wait for the conclusion.
030745455X|5.0|Honestly!  I wrote about Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, oh, last summer maybe?  I just purchased the paperback of this one, and I don't know if I can manage to wait for the paperback version of the next one!  (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest)<br /><br />Let me begin by saying what my difficulties with the book are:  I have a hard time keeping track of who the characters are, as well as the difference between character last names and place names.  This is a Swedish author, so obviously the characters are going to have names that I (and many of you will be) am unfamiliar with.  There are many, many names that begin with a `B' and I had a hard time differentiating them from each other.  However, as the story progressed I became more sure of who I was dealing with.  I still have a little confusion, especially over some who have a known name and a `fake' name.  Another issue is that sometimes the characters are referred to by their last names a majority of the time, but on occasion they are referenced by their first name which also caused me a little confusion.  The deal with the place names deals is that a lot of those begin with an `S' which caused me confusion.  The other issue is that I have no idea where things are in Sweden.  A map would have been a fabulous help!  I at least would have known where things were!<br /><br />But.  And this is a HUGE but.  The story is so darned good that you won't want to take the time to jot down notes as to which character is which, whose bad, whose good, and who you think is bad but is hiding it really well.  The pace of the book is just fantastic.  Larsson hooks you in and keeps you going.  I stayed up way past my bedtime with this one again!<br /><br />I have to say that Lisbeth Salander is one of the most fascinating/interesting/intriguing characters I have ever come across in my reading...and that's saying something!  I want to know more about her all the time, and that is partially what keeps my reading pace so fast!  I caught myself skimming so I could find out what happens next, then I'd have to go back because I knew I missed something. (Which I usually had).<br /><br />Oh, what's the point of this one?  Silly me!  Lisbeth is being sought for causing three murders.  Mikael Blomkvist and the Millenium staff are in this one as well.  And there are a few who think Salander is innocent, or at least totally misunderstood, while there are others who are ready to convict her without a trial.  Will Salander avoid the net?  Will she figure out why she's so desperately sought after?  There are many, many things going on in this book, and you will get some more answers as to Salander's background, but I continuously have questions about her!  I also have a theory as to what happens in the next book, but it would be a shame to ruin it!<br /><br />Notes on the Cover:<br />I like that the covers for this trilogy are similar in nature.  The reds, oranges and yellows for fire go great with the theme of this one!lf skimming so I could find out what happens next, then I'd have to go back because I knew I missed something.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|Lost in Austen is charming. It makes a modern person want to read the Austen books to see what all the fuss is about. It never laughs at itself. Because the characters take themselves and the absurd plot premise seriously, it is totally believeable. I can't wait to watch it again.
B003DO13NS|5.0|When I first bought my original copy of this album it was the vinyl lp version back in '78. I played it to death it got me thru my GCE's at secondary school. With the advent of the cd era I bought my second copy on that format however, the recording had been shortened due to problems with the source tapes. So one of my favourite albums had been bastardised in the name of technological advancement. In time though I grew to like it and lived in hopes of Mike actually revisiting the original recordings and producing the original in its entirety.<br /> Well dear reader that moment is at hand... this is original recording hitherto only available on vinyl however; there are some caveats and warnings that go with this recording. First off the mix is so well cleaned up that everything that was lost in original low technology version is brought to life and forefront of the recording. The trumpet and oboe solos are quite astonishing especially the missing links that were lost in first cd transposition and rerecording of the album.Now some downsides the guitars have been pushed back in some parts of the recording from where they were in the original. Also the bass solos are a bit overpowering and at the end of part one there is now a new guitar overdub which takes a little getting used to and detracts from the mellowness of original mix.<br /> This can be explained by the fact that Mike was \\"assisted\\" (I use this term advisedly...!) by two other people during the remixing and rerecording of this version and it shows in parts quite starkly. However, I'm very pleased with this new recording and would recommend it to anyone who is a die hard Oldfield fan.
0393072231|5.0|I read this book over vacation.  I couldn't put it down.  Reads almost like a novel with fascinating characters and the finiancial story is great.  I never realized how stupid the major market players can be.  The crash should have been obvious to everyone.  Now I know that when someone claims in the press that we \\"never could have predicted this\\" they are either lying, or should be removed from their job immediately.    When I finished, I bought Liar's Poker which wasn't nearly as engrossing.    Great book.  Please read, so maybe we can avoid this disaster next time.

B002ZG997C|2.0|I am not sure whether the directors have any religious message in it. If yes, forgive me that I dont really quite catch it, but the premise that Denzel Washington apparently received a call from God to recite the whole Bible on Alcatraz Island in the end of a long travel after WWIII?. Despite the incomplete story and those not exciting action scenes, the two main characters (Washington and Oldman) are outstanding. Pardon me that I cant find anything else worth mentioning, except the killing of the cat in the beginning which I cant find any relationship of it with the main story or anything about the character of Washington/Eli at all. In short, not recommended!
B000SEFDP0|1.0|Maybe there's a story buried in this mess.  Maybe it's even a great story.  A lot of people seem to think so, but I found the method of narration so irritating that I quit reading this abomination as soon as I found that the second volume would carry on using it.
0439023483|2.0|I finished the novel thinking that this entire book was comprised just to sell other books.  While books like The Giver force you to think and evaluate humanity, morality, society, etc.  this book simply alluded to some of those issues and let them fall flat.  SPOILER:  There was much predictability here (except for the surprise robot/wolf/dead kid attack out of nowhere).  I sincerely hoped that after all the initial build up at the beginning of the story and later touched on about individuality winning out over the controlling government that the kids would have given the cameras, audience, and leaders the finger and made some proclamation that you CAN revolt... THEN actually killed themselves to prove it.  Instead, it ended with some sappy, team edward v. team jacob, buy the next book to find out what happens gimmick.  Yuck.  It's a page turner for the action.  Teens of both sexes will find something appealing here.  I just wish that Suzanne Collins had the guts to write a book with a real message.  The potential was there, however, I'm still hungry.

Full of mystery, adventure, intrigue, and love with strong characters made it a page turner for me.  The story starts quickly taking place in Barcelona in 1945 following the war making it a time of finding answers and and sorting out lives.  While the hard copy I bought was a well used library edition, which the seller failed to describe, I'll still read it again and share it with friends.  I look forward to this writer's future works.

It's small, protective - feels like it's made out of something similar to wet suit material - and works great.<br /><br />We have an older camera that we take on wilderness trips and this is the perfect case. It's a bigger camera but as the case is stretchy it fit in there snugly but fine. It's nicely padded as well.<br /><br />The case has a Velcro belt loop which is great for hands free carrying. It also has a wrist strap. It has a Velcro closure and also had a front pocket that would work for extra cards, batteries, etc.<br /><br />It's surprisingly nice for the money and recommended.
030745455X|3.0|When I finished reading The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo I couldn't wait to start The Girl Who Played With Fire. Having now finished this second installment in the trilogy, I was disappointed in it and won't be in a hurry to read the final book in the series, which will remain in my bookcase for awhile. One reason for my  disappointment stems from the fact that while the book's plot was interesting, the author let the book get bogged down in too much detail which never allowed the story to build up a full head of steam. As such, I found it dragged throughout large passages of the book. For me, The Girl Who Played With Fire, would have been much more enjoyable if it wasn't bloated with probably 100-200 pages that were not much more than filler. A second big source of my disappointment stems from the book being filled with too many secondary characters that either had little importance to the story or were cartoon-like. In particular, I found Larsson's \\"bad guys\\" to be too one-dimensional and lacking in credibility. A third disappointment was that little of the mystery in this book was solved by clever investigative work by the police or others involved in the case, which would helped build a greater sense of excitement and suspense. Instead, too much of the solving of the case depends on super-woman's, Lisbeth Salander's, ability to hack into even the most sophisticated computer systems in order to obtain information she needs. A fourth source of disappointment is Larrson's leaving too many of the sub-plots in the book without any resolution. It's as if he lost interesting in them along the way and hoped that the reader wouldn't mind being \\"left hanging.\\" But my biggest source of dissatisfaction is the book's preposterous ending that had me cringing a bit from it's ridiculousness. Overall, despite these sources of disappointment,The Girl Who Played With Fire, was an entertaining book; but it could have been a very good one with some serious editing.

B003HE2B9E|3.0|Included in the \\"extras\\" of Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival 2007 is a very small clip from Orianthi's performance (not on the main stage.)  The clip consists of some incredibly emotional blues guitar playing.  I immediately came here to Amazon and bought her $35 import CD expecting more of what I had seen at the Crossroads show.  It didn't happen.  I agree %100 with the reviewer who described this as disappointing \\"pop.\\"  I can't express my own disappointmet any better than he did.  The only reason I can come up with is that some producer told her \\". . . if you want to record it's pop or nothing.\\"  I can't believe that someone Clapton believes in and can sing and play the blues like she can is happy with this piece of pop.  I read that she was currently in Nashville working on her next CD.  Hopefully it will be more blues based than this one and perhaps it will be worth waiting for
055358202X|5.0|This series has been a non-stop roller coaster ride! I love epic story arcs and this is one of the best I've seen for a long time. I only wish Mr. Martin would hurry up and get the next novel out before I finish this one. But, it's so good, I might just go back and start the series over again. The characters are so realistic and believable that when tragedy occurs (and no one is safe from this) you feel like you're punched in the stomach. The realism and gritty way Mr. Martin describes the fight scenes and landscape makes you feel like you know Westeros, the land where the epic takes place. Not just a romantic series for chicks, there's enough gore and war strategies to keep the guys happily engrossed as well. Overall, it's on my new top ten list.

What I really want is the discs in a normal package without all the extra stuff.  I'm hoping that people with the kind of decision making power that goes into whether a product is available or not will read this.<br /><br />I love the series and may end up buying just the seasons to avoid the extra stuff, so you won't lose money from me I don't think, but if you offered a boxed set of all six seasons without the extra stuff, I'd be really happy.

0307454541|4.0|After hearing so many stories about how people were hooked onto this novel, I figured I'd better try the book out.  I expected it to contain an extremely complex plot that would hook me from the start until the end and then prompt me to read the other two novels in the trilogy.  I am sorry to say, this was only partially true.<br /><br />The book at first switches back and forth between two point of views that then merge together.  This method, though keeps my interest pretty well, is very commonly used and thus didn't quite capture my attention fully.  Mostly, I found myself trying to skip over Blomkvist (who's story was the most part quite ordinary) and trying to get to Sander (more of an enigma).  Larsson could have done better making Blomkvist a more interesting character.  (By the way, there are lots of sex scenes to warn some of the younger readers out there.)<br /><br />The pace was also a bit slow.  There are about two major twists in the plot, one more or less expected, one a bit more surprising.  Both occured near the end.  I took about a week to finish the novel because it would not continually hook me with dramatic changes.  A lot of it was very straightforward, and, though not quite boring, not addictingly interesting either.  As a bit of ethos on that last comment, I would like to point out I am not the kind who will never get hooked.  I have once read from 12:00 pm to 5:00 a.m. for four days in a row to finish a 5-book-long novel.<br /><br />All in all, the book was decently good and better than a lot of books I have seen.  However, I would not consider it the best as some others seem to feel.
030745455X|4.0|Let me start by saying that I'm glad that the good folks in the Larssonverse have laid off the coffee a bit.  It can be dangerous for your health to drink so much coffee.<br /><br />The Girl Who Played with Fire is the second book in a trilogy - the first being \\"[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]]\\" and tells the tale of the infamous Lisbeth Salander - the woman who hates men who hate women - and her acquaintance, our ace investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist.<br /><br />The story starts by Blomkvist and pals working on exposing a Swedish sex trafficking operation specializing in teenage prostitutes kidnapped or lured from the Eastern block.  Some high profile people are either in that ring or have used their services are going to be exposed when all hell breaks loose and Salander becomes Sweden's most wanted criminal.<br /><br />To avoid capture Salander disappears while the newspapers have a field day with the psycho-S&M-Devil-Worshiping-Lesbian - a juicy item indeed if I may say so myself.<br /><br />A manhunt ensues which is when we learn of Salander's childhood, traumas and events which shaped her to be the adorable young anti-social person we know and love.<br /><br />Character wise with the exception of Salander no-one is really well developed.  The bad guys are cartoonish as if they jumped out of a 007 movie, the cops are portrayed incompetent caricatures and the rest of the gang we got introduced to in \\"[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]]\\" are simply just \\"there\\".  Basically the good guys are purely good (considerate, reasoned, unselfish) and the bad guys are purely bad beyond any reasonable measure.<br /><br />However, this is a fun book; the book can be ridiculous at times and riveting at others.  The character of Salander, who was somewhat believable in the first novel is taken to extremes in this one, but is still great fun even though the \\"chance encounter\\" plot twist is a bit overplayed.<br /><br />A nod of acknowledgement to the wonderful translation by Reg Keeland, even though it would be nice to see in future versions and / or other stories from the cold countries, a pronunciation key for places.n by Reg Keeland, even though it would be nice to see in future versions and / or other stories from the cold countries, a pronunciation key for places.

0307454541|4.0|I have never been a devotee of the \\"murder mystery\\" genre, though have read a few over the years and enjoyed a number of them.  This novel, written by Swedish author Stieg Larsson, is certainly a world wide sensation and acts as the first book of a trilogy by the recently deceased writer.<br /><br />The novel centers largely upon two individuals, a disgraced investigative journalist, Mikael Blomkvist and a freelance private investigator, Lisbeth Salander (the girl with the dragon tattoo).  Blomkvist is hired by an aged, wealthy industrialist, Henrik Vanger, to solve a 40 year old murder mystery involving his completely dysfunctional family.  We meet Salander prior to her involvement in the case, which she subsequently joins as Blomkvist's research assistant.<br /><br />This novel was originally written in Swedish and contains numerous references to Swedish names, places, customs and cultural idiosyncrasies.  As such, it can be slightly disconcerting and/or confusing to a foreign audience.  The themes of sexual assault, spousal abuse and other forms of violence to women are the primary focus of the novel.<br /><br />As a murder mystery, this novel is certainly entertaining.  The thread involving Salander, I found to be highly captivating and even educational.  Not being a huge fan of the genre, it is difficult for me to give a considered opinion upon this book's merit, however the payoff and subsequent d&eacute;nouement were well conceived and presented.  Despite the fact that I will not likely proceed to the second book in the series, I suspect that fans of murder mysteries/suspense novels will gobble up all three.

B003L45JLW|5.0|There has been much written about this terrific album already. Let's just say it's one of the best American bands ever, hitting on all four cylinders. They have made great music through their entire career and haven't been concerned with following any trends,doing what they do the way they want to do it. Tom & company are at the top of their game, making up the rules as they go. That said, I applaud this release in High Def as another example of them going outside the box. The difference between the blu-ray and the cd is staggering. This album is recorded so well it even holds up pretty well in mp3, but the blu-ray is a revelation. The debate between digital and analog has been fought for so long and no the war is coming to an end. This is by far the highest quality consumer format to date.If you own a nice system capable of playing the high resolution formats you owe it to yourself to listen to this. There is no going back now for me, I welcome many more albums to be released this way. In this age of mp3s, it's great to hear someone still cares about \\"real\\" sound.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I like Madonna normally but thought this album was just horrible.  The songs are monotonous, repetative, and all sounded pretty much the same to me.  I don't know why she would make an album with electronica-like undertones because it's just not her style.  She's always trying to push one envelope or another, but this one just wasn't pushed correctly.  \\"American Life\\" was the worst song.  She actually attempts to rap, but it's about yoga and coffee.  That's not exactly a very rap-like bit of subject matter.
0739476335|5.0|This book was a gift to a friend. She enjoyed it very much. Excellent reading, excellent author.
B000002N3J|2.0|This album is a collection of ballads, and Madonna's ballads have always been very boring.  This album has absolutely no energy at all.  \\"Take a Bow,\\" \\"I'll Remember,\\" and \\"Crazy for You\\" are the only ones I thought were any good.  You can find those on other albums, so this one was unnecessary for me.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much for myself after downloading it from I-Tunes that I decided to purchase it at Amazon as a gift for my sister and her daughters who also enjoy historical movies.  This movie was extremely well done with beautiful photography and wonderful acting.  If you like historical romance movies you will love this.
B003HO0RG8|5.0|I cannot think of a better rock album from the previous decade that matches this one in intensity and creativity. When I was in high school this was the album that brought together the punks and the metal heads. It compleley reinvigorated hardcore in a way that only they could have imagined. Refused took what they learned from Nation of Ulysses and made it anthemic. This album is literaly exploding with ideas and excellent song writing.
B000001ES9|5.0|This is the first Rush Album. First, to clear the air about this album. Yes, John Rutsey played drums on this and not Neil Peart. Second, this is not the \\"classic\\" Rush that everyone knows, but that does not make this a bad album. In fact, this is a 5 star album for a few reasons.<br />First, know that Rush did not develop their \\"Signature Sound\\" and songwriting style for quite a few years, and this is the very first album of their career. Yes, it is very Led Zeppelin and Bluesy, which is who they were at the time. If you are expecting Tom Sawyer, then listen to Moving Pictures, but this album does have great songs on it, which if they were not good, why over 30 years later would even RUSH play these songs live. After 30 plus years of Rock N Roll, this album still stands as the beginning of the road traveled.<br />Second, Geddy and Alex wrote the music AND the lyrics here, so you will not get your Fantasy themed lyrics or story-line lyrics. You get your straight forward rock and roll songs. And there is nothing wrong with that. As a matter of a fact, unless you are a Rush snob, (which if you are, get over it, because it is music) then this is a great album.<br />And, to all of your RUSH SNOBS, chill out. The point of music is to listen and enjoy, not to try to find some answer to life or the passage to God or whatever you think it is. If you do not like this album, then go back to your Chronicles, and let us real fans and music listeners enjoy every track that we please. It is just like TV, if you do not like it, change the flipping channel.

B000KG499M|5.0|Very nice. It stands about 1ft tall at the most, there are several ways you can attach the stand to the base. Some peices you have to use a little more force to get in place than you would think you should have too. overall i am very happy with it... allthough it says in the discription that it fits 1/144 models... which it does... its just looks kind of funny because its so big. anyway, its good overall.
B002SQ3664|5.0|Having grown up in the days of Woodstock and been a part of the hippie culture, I embraced this film for many reasons. Not only was it well made, actors top notch, but it took me on a very exciting trip back to the days of my youth. I unfortunately was not able to be at the festival but am a huge fan of the music of the time, the love that was shared (although missplaced at times) and the free open feeling of treating everyone around me as my brother or sister. The film certainly brought this atmosphere back and I felt it in the room as I watched it. I can not speak for its accuracy in how it all came about however if it was even close, it could not have turned out better regardless of the financial disaster it turned out to be. There is a part of the film that shows the reaction of the two parents after having eaten some very special brownies which was so hilarious I laugh just remembering it. Made me wish I had spiked some for my parents who needed to get off the alcohol wagon and try something a bit less destructive.....lets face it, everybody that has had pot in some form or another experienced the fun unstoppable laughter that made your stomach touch the back of your spine!!!! When I watch films or listen to music, in order for me to relate it must ignite all my senses and emotions and this film certainly accomplished all of that and more. There is much to say about this film that is noteworthy but I cant sit in this chair all day writing about it. If you relate with the times at all, buy this film, you wont be sorry, it will send you back and leave you with a sense of feeling younger while planting a permanent smile on your face. Rock on!!
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|At first I thought this would be a typical big special effects action movie, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was much more subdued than I thought it would be and I really liked the movie. The basic setting of the movie is a near-future society in which people can connect to robots and and live vicariously through them. This is portrayed as being very positive, especially at the beginning of the film. However, the conflict arises when an FBI agent becomes involved in investigating a murder in which a robot was destroyed and its operator was killed as a side effect. Without revealing a lot of the plot, I'll just say that this plays out somewhat like a sci-fi police action movie, but although there are action scenes and good-guy-has-to-save-the-world scenario, all of this is quite subdued and tastefully done compared to many current big action films. It sort of provides a background to the movie rather than being the eye-catching focus. Because of this, the movie becomes a thought-provoking exercise in which you imagine what such a society would be like and you consider some of the ramifications. Even Bruce Willis, who plays the main character is somewhat more subdued than in some of his other action roles. He does a good job with this role and it's kind of fun to see him as his surrogate version with hair and a younger look. I think this movie is especially thought-provoking not because we might soon be using robots as surrogates in life, but rather because we already substitute different forms of technology for real-life experience. In a way, participating in on-line discussions, having avatars, texting and working remotely from home are somewhat like having surrogates. While this kind of technology can open up many opportunities in life, it can also diminish our humanity and isolate us. I think this is one sub-text of this movie. In any case, do check this movie out. You will be happy you did.
B003EPPEP4|4.0|Rally enjoy the songs on this CD. Nikki has a very lovely voice I'm so amazed that's she's only 16. I love the bluezy, jazzy sound. I would buy another one of her CDs
B0021L8UQ2|4.0|I love horror movies and psychological thrillers so I had to give this a look.  If you have similar tastes you will definitely enjoy this.  The little girl who plays Esther \\"the orphan\\" is amazing.  So is Vera Farmiga, who plays the mother, otherwise known as \\"the only character with any sense\\".  Even though I dislike movies where people do unbelievably stupid things, the fact is that real people do unbelievably stupid things in real life.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie.  And I am looking forward to seeing more from the young actress who plays the title role.
0553378384|5.0|I've been into astrology most of my life and have purchased many books on the topic, always seeking more understanding of self and others.  This book is the answer.... love that it gives explanations from the perspective of lifetime lessons/purpose.  It is simple and direct and cuts out abstract information.  It is everything rolled into one and so easy to digest.  Forget the rest!  It absolutely nails the prsonalaties perfectly while explaining the behaviors.  Jan Spiller makes so much sense and has helped me understand some long time dilemmas.  I couldn't recommend it more.
030726999X|5.0|In the July 5th issue of The New Yorker, Nora Ephron wrote a hilarious satire of the annoying flaws in this thriller:<br />-the confusing Swedish names<br />-the confusing Swedish streets<br />-the pretentious product placements<br />-the needless discussion of small breasts and where a girl can get augmentation surgery<br /><br />She doesn't even get around to the inexplicable attractiveness and sexual expertise of the author's alter-ego, investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist.<br /><br />BUT....this is a great book. It has an exaggerated comic book style and multiple references to Swedish chldren's literature icon Pippi Longstockings, the lonely girl with a chest of gold and superpowers to wreck revenge upon the strong for their insults to children.<br /><br />The over-the-top style is coupled with a serious discussion of the uninhibited hostility that some men unleash on women who make them feel threatened. There is a whole catalog of bullies, abusive acts and methods by which women can be made helpless. I liked this volume the most because it shifted away from physical abuse to abuse by media, bureaucracy, courts and psychiatry. Women recognize that they are frequently (though less horrificly) abused by these institutions. Hence the appeal of a Woman Warrior with superpowers. She doesn't wear a cape, but has a special costume, an unworldly personna (think Peter Parker) and a dragon tatoo.<br /><br />Lizbeth Salander's prickly personality, black/white moral sense, and computer skills are consistent with autism. I think that the books contribute to understanding the curses and blessings associated with this personality variant. Piled on top is an enormous burden of anger, irritibility and violence consistent with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.<br /><br />Tolerance means looking beyond superficial unattractiveness to try to understand the person.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1400032717 The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Very well made documentary about the greatest band ever! Rare footage and in depth interviews with Neil, Alex and Geddy.    Be sure to watch the dinner scene included on the extras disc. not only are they top shelf musicians, they are hilarious.     It is a great story of how the band was ripped by the idiot music critics and how much Rush appreciates their loyal fans.  It is gratifying to see how Rush proved the critics wrong.     5 stars are the max, I would give this 10 stars if possible!
1401227821|5.0|I was biting at the bit to get this book ever since it became available for pre-order. I received my copy today, and I nearly died with the sheer joy of everything that was packed into a glossy 205 pages. Covers are seen side-by-side with sketches and mock-ups for color studies, and include his own feelings and insights about each. His ability to write so conversationally makes this book not only a joy to read but an immeasurable tool for up-and-coming artists. He throws small tips and helpful hints about how he constructs an image about every 2 covers, which means in a strange way this is as much a learning/teaching tool as it is just a beautiful set of his DC Covers.    My only complaint is that not every single cover (even the obscure dc ones) were full-size in the book, but I guess we'll have to wait until he gets the nerve to give us another beautiful art book? (Note to Adam: A Hardcover collection of your con sketchbooks and development studies, please? :D)

1439148953|4.0|Maybe the Old Days Simply Weren't that Great!<br /><br />It would be tempting to describe Toibin's \\"Brooklyn\\" as merely an immigrant experience novel, depicting the familiar homesickness and struggle inherent in the lives of young Irish women in 1950's Brooklyn.  However, much more animates this novel than the obvious story of cultural adjustment.  The fate of Eilis Lacy, a seemingly simple, somewhat passive young woman, exemplifies the narrow possibilities of the female sex in post World War II America.  Courageous in her endeavors to find a suitable job and comport herself with modesty and respect, she is nonetheless limited in both social and professional opportunity.  Thus, predictably, she longs for the comfort and security of her former life in Ireland before a priest, encouraged by her older sister, found her suitable lodging and a job in America.  Since presumably she is not capable of being as adventuresome as her charismatic, lively sister, Eilis relies on everyone's advice and reluctantly leaves behind her provincial Irish lifestyle and family to improve her station across the ocean.<br /><br />The novel proceeds quite prosaically as Eilis' motivations become evident.  She is a young woman who has a great deal of self-respect and who has been brought up to be righteous in all professional and social dealings.  Quiet, conscientious and inwardly resourceful, she impresses the priest, the landlady and her employer.  One glimpses from her long internal descriptions of the boarding house environment and her decision making processes, that she is deliberate in most experiences, if not calculating.  She is careful to watch out for her own needs and scrupulously tenacious in presenting her best side to all with whom she comes in contact.  She possesses a quiet, eager conscientiousness that is endearing although a little bovine in its effect on others.  Quietly attentive and self-controlled as well as steady, she impresses a young Italian plumber she meets at an Irish neighborhood dance.  It is through this relationship that the reader sees in Eilis a compliant, passive instrument, an almost dull presence.  Nevertheless, Tony, who admires her for some inexplicable reason, is immediately smitten.  As time passes, while she is not sure she wants to be married or assume the role of maternity just yet, she acquiesces to his wishes and spends all her free time with him while at the same time pursuing a bookkeeping certificate in hopes of attaining a better paying job and keeping her homesickness at bay.  Soon she is swallowed up in American life and her romance until an urgent request arrives from home, and she departs for Ireland.<br /><br />Once back in Ireland with her aging mother, she is drawn to a local man from her past whom she allows to court her.  She considers resuming her old life in the village where she grew up.  It is evident through her neglect of Tony by not answering his letters or calling to reserve her passage home, that she is clearly ambivalent about Tony and her life in America.  She keeps the relationship with Tony secret until the very last.  Because of these actions she comes across as manipulative, somewhat duplicitous and insincere and yet her introspective yearnings and insights are universal.  Her clearly enumerated ambivalence is evidence of the conflict experienced by most young women of her times.<br /><br />Before the pill, young women were supposed to remain chaste.  They were to observe rules of social propriety, even though she does violate these with Tony.  She meets his family, and the various brothers emerge as respectful except for Frank, for whom she seems to feel an attraction that is implied but not developed.  His parents' modest living quarters and their sleeping arrangements illustrate the hardships of immigrant families, while the family ambitions suggest the gumption that drove America to excel in the fifties.<br /><br />The book proceeds with Eilis' moment by moment impressions ofa series of trivial, amorphous and seemingly unrelated events through which she proceeds carefully and deliberately until small actions add up to a fairly complete portrait of Eilis Lacy and her ordinary life.  In this manner, characterization is achieved through simple, linear narration of mundane events.  A problem with characterization might be that everyone seems to step up to the plate to assist Eilis: Rose, Father Flood, her fellow passenger on the boat, Mrs. Kehoe, Mrs. Fiorino, Tony, Jim, and other townspeople in Ireland and Brooklyn.  Her passivity and neediness compel others' assistance.  While this is believable in that Eilis is a prototype of fifties femininity, she does little to arouse the imagination of a self-reliant and imaginative contemporary American female reader.<br /><br />In the end Eilis is denied ample opportunity to make the most important choice of her lifetime and instead must allow circumstances to make it for her.  Her honesty as well as her genuine practicality propel her back to America and Brooklyn, where in all probability she will live with Tony in a house his family built on Long Island while the couple pursues the American dream of family and upward mobility, goals she could not have achieved in Ireland.<br /><br />The book is simple with fluid, poetic prose, and it does manage to move through a storyline, but it is often slow and unimaginative, a record of a simple, uninformed life of little intellectual stimulation or imagination but laden with earnest endeavor and a dogged pursuit of stability and happiness, reflecting the judicious plans of most young working women of the fifties.  The book suggests a subtle conspiracy on the part of society to hold a woman to conventional objectives and prior commitments.  It would be anathema to divorce, for example, or to openly defy convention by entertaining a man in one's room.  The alternatives were limited for the female sex which is ostensibly why the more lively and imaginative older sister Rose refrains from the stultifying conventions of provincial marriage, instead remaining single and earning her own keep.  Most concerning is the fact that at the climax either Eilis submits to Miss Kelly's terms of extortion or she admits to herself, her mother and her Irish suitor her own doubts about her future in America.  In the face of a decision that would require mental strength rather than compliance, she capitulates to convention and chooses the path of least resistance, the one most women of her generation fell back on.  Thus, in this sense, Toibin illustrates the restrictive conventions and limited opportunity that held women in their place and narrowed their choices.  Consequently, one senses that Eilis' marriage will lack fulfillment even though Tony will do his best to be a good provider.  The fault will lie in herself that she cannot extract from matrimony the satisfaction she yearns for.  Part of this is because she doesn't really know who she is; in those days, women weren't encouraged to understand what they wanted or to pursue their dreams.  It is made clear she isn't certain she's ready for children, but the demands of the times will squelch her fears and reservations because the moral conduct, the expectations of fifties society will demand her compliance, and alas, Eilis Lacy is no rebel.  She lacks the imagination to buck convention or the assertiveness to confront other people.  Like her associates of the times, she seeks to please and thereby fulfill her role of a dutifully \\"feminine\\" post war woman.  An automaton, for sure.<br /><br />Women, aren't we glad, the roles have expanded and society has become more complicated?  Eilis' life with its sweet, plodding, simple pleasures and predictable nuances reads like an \\"I Remember Mama\\" episode.  Please spare me the fifties.  No wonder many women resorted to valium!  Bridge or canasta anyone?  How about a coffee klatch in suburban Long Island?<br /><br />Nevertheless, there is in \\"Brooklyn\\" a compelling, quiet tone even if it is almost somnambulant in parts.  There are beautiful descriptions of the city and Coney Island and meditations on Eilis' part that spring vividly to life through the haze of robotic activity.  There is also a sweetness to the book, a sense of our collective loss of innocence as Americans and women.  The book is well worth reading, if a little ponderous and disjointed at times.  Read it for a sense of the post-War immigrant experience and of an earnest period in American history, now gone with the wind.  Read it for the elegant, subtle prose.<br /><br />Marjorie Meyerle<br />Colorado Writer<br />Author of \\"Bread of Shame\\"s of provincial marriage, instead remaining single and earning her own keep.

B00005AG7K|3.0|Ok it's a art film Sir Paul says. It's still hard to watch all the way throyugh, some minor editing and a few scenes removed would help, also throw in the video Hello/Goodbye into the film would be a nice addition. The songs have been remastered into full stereo and sounds great in the film. Film quality lacks much, but until Apple redoes this, its as good as it gets.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|I liked the movie but felt a little left out as some scenes developed. I thought the inclusion of more character background came out was one of the best parts of this movie.  Worth Seeing.
B003J27WFW|3.0|One thing about Rock films that always piss me off is they always seemed to Rush (no pun intended) the audience. I mean, hey I got all night long to watch this movie!  Why cut the songs off half way through!!!!????????<br /> I GUARANTEE you people, this is fun to watch the first time then COLLECTS DUST! Had they included FULL Versions of the Songs, it would be fun to re-watch anytime! The \\"Beatles Anthology\\" to me is a masterpiece, they didnt give a crap if it was 8 hours, why doesn't this film do the same thing!<br />You want to watch a movie of Rush gabbing about their songs, ok then , this is great, you want to see a song play out and see the videos of Tom Sawyer and Early Distant Warning, or a live shot of YYZ, then this ISNT'T For you!<br />To the producers of this film: Go back and put the songs in full length, add a few more songs and videos in, then come back with a 4 hour movie and I'll rave all over it and give it 5 stars and say it's the best ever!<br /><br />Ok....next subject.<br />I did like the interviews, many things tho either time has changed them or the truth was never told.<br />Examples...1) Geddy Lee said in earlier interviews that John Rutsy left on his own, this movie says they made him quit for health reasons and he took it hard....which is right?<br />2) Terry Brown who produced all Rush up to Signals, the original story years back was HE wanted to quit and Rush took the news so bad they almost quit but found a new producer. This movie states that Rush basically fired Terry and wanted new blood in the productions.  who knows which story is right.<br /><br />PS---To all you boneheads you rip me apart for giving this 3 stars, Oh excuse me! 3 out of 5 isnt bad, it's a B- score. I am MORE A RUSH FAN THAN YOU ARE because I want MORE, I want the whole songs...for that you run me down....LOL!
1577314808|5.0|I like the way Eckhart Tolle speaks in these audio's. In fact all talks by Eckhart Tolle are brilliant. The audio of The Power of Now gave me a silent mind for a few days and now I'm sure that listening is better than reading. In all the traditions people used to listen. I'm not sure if this was because the presence of the master was important or because sound is a clearer medium? Sound transmits clearer whereas the visual penetrates through the glass darkly as they say.<br /><br />The definition of upanishad is to sit and listen. I suppose listening to talks like these are the closest we will ever get to a teacher who can directly zap us with the teaching!head, churning out toxic thoughts. If you can conquer your thoughts you will be happy.     Rebel: But experience cries loudly against this. My hurting is nothing to do with my personality. It's all out there, in the world. I'm poor, my environment is horrid and relationships don't make sense. Suffering is outside my mind; out there, people are bad so let us educate them. Institutions humiliate and abuse us, so let's change the institutions; we can put people before profit for a change. The work cycle, you see, is amoral, unfair and wrong. This sense of unfairness instils the wellspring of revolution in my belly as it does yours. So fight the system and get away from horrid people; this is the route to happiness for all. Together we can build utopia; us and always. So the road to my happiness is in smashing the system to build a brighter tomorrow. Happiness is in society, community and better people. I need a holiday now; I need to get away for a week.     Seneca: The trouble going on holiday is that you take yourself along!     Tolle: I agree with Seneca. Your ego is focused in the wrong direction and this is the wrong path to true happiness. Your thought patterns are bludgeoning your world view. It was the philosopher Wittgenstein who said that the world of the happy man is different from the world of the sad man. Your inner voice is trapped in a tape loop or revolutionary anguish and existential frustration; this is making you miserable. You are anguishing over a future that will never arrive and you worry over long dead events that continue to play in your head, over and over, like a record. This time-flailing of the ego spaces bare neither relation nor relevance to your present state of being. The distance which makes objects look small to the  eye, makes them appear big in the mind. There is no alternative to your suffering as long as you carry on this, stuck in past, future ego cycling, from one frustration to another, like a rider in an eternal journey withnobody listening but you and your ego's echo chamber.     Rebel: Like a lonely prisoner in an echoing cell?     Tolle: Yes exactly, the echo chamber gives form to a droning introspection that mumbles indefinitely. Like an object unseen to your eye. The distance which makes object small to the eye causes them to appear large in the mind. From your minds introspection emerges your grasshopper mind; the grasshopper mind hops hither and thither, from one random thought to an unannounced emotion. Your mind is an unfocused, out of control time hopper; hopping to the past were you worry about incidents that for other people are lost in the overgrowth of time but for you, you still dwell where your mind takes you. Or you're always worrying about the future. Like I said, you can only dwell where your mind takes you. You always stay in the past or the future; where is the moment? You are not in control as your mind controls you, because you are not aware. What you think of as your mind is a bundle of electric shocks or sparks firing in your brain; firing off in your head incidental mutterings and random thoughts that, if you can only pay attention, you may be surprised at what is happening behind your eyelids.     Cicero: Oh, mister Eckhart, what intensity, oh, what inanities! How long will you grace us with your discusting verbiage, oh vanity? How long will you stupify, and haunt our hearts and our world? The intensity you show in your eternal mumbling, like an over hatched turd, only bemoans the sleeping multitudes with rolled eyelids. You represent the dark God who turns the mind to madness. Naught will come from your colossal piece of plagiarism, oh Meister Eckhart, tongue forged from the hardest silver!     Rebel: This is the most stupifying verbiage since man first put pen to paper! You may have fooled the masses with your wacky foreign accent and your hobbits grin, but all you are doing is stifling all revolutionary progress. I do mutter to myself thought but tis a soothing muttering. Who ever said a still mind is God?     Tolle: God is a loaded term indeed; your Being on the other hand, is your only ground, and the random, unexamind, muttering, we do all the time, is the fog that blinds your true Being. The good news then, is that you are not this random muttering. Your true self lurks underneath. Thus if you slay the egoic mind, the seeds of enlightenment will flower and your true ground of Being will start to blossom; and the suffering of existence will be cleansed, and the evil within will be broken on the pillars of your true being,     Rebel: But that is selfish and escapism! It takes a leisure class with philanthropic support to pursue this kind of foolishness. What about work, what about the IMF and the third world? You said somewhere that there is an awakening and the majority will indeed awaken soon, but it's the minority that rule the world. We should agitate for better working conditions to improve our lot.     Tolle: The distance that makes object small to the eye causes them to appear large in the mind.  The moment is all you will ever know.   Tolle: People thirsty for more so they try to find themselves in books or property but more stuff means suffering. You cannot escape into material stuff as the stuff of thought is what we need to cleans.       Rebel: I am right then, it really does take a flabby leisure class with philanthropic support to pursue this kind of zen foolishness. Most people in the world have no material possessions but they are miserable. How will you sell renunciation to those who are poor beyond Oprah's imagining.                     Tolle: king or poor, suffering is outside yourself.  Cicero: Oh, the passion, oh, the vanity!     Seneca: Our predicament is like that of a dog chained to a cart. It is wise to follow the cart!     Plato: I don't know which side you can take, but its well worth downloading the audio torrents of Tolle reading his own books. He's worth a listen I think!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I am amazed how this great series continues to go outside of the box and score.  Season 4 is a straight up shocker, the way it ends all you can do is sit there with your mouth agape.  Dexter continues this season with all of his balls in the air as usual, and his move to the burbs is truly a sight to behold.  This season like last season and like the season before hinges on the foil for Dexter and John Lithgow is fanstastic in this role.  He has to be one of the creepiest people I have ever watched on screen, the way he occilates from kind to menace at the drop of a hat is chilling.  Dexter has his work cut out for him this season, Lithgow really takes the action to him in the most personal way.  This could be the finest season of a truly ground breaking series.  Highly recommended.
B003U21TBO|5.0|I have to say I was hesitant when I first heard that David Tennant was stepping down as the Doctor.  Like most people I grew up with Tom Baker, and felt that his portrayal was the standard to which all doctors were to be measured.  Then there was Tennant; who, in my mind, redefined that standard.  His portrayal of The Doctors neurotic behaviors coupled with his perfect timing of transitions to a being over nine hundred years old, were perfect and made me believe.         For this fan Matt Smith had a huge gap to fill.  I feel that he has filled it well.  Though I still feel the loss of Tennant, I'm more than satisfied with Smith.  As with all the doctors he has brought something new to the role, while still preserving the flavor of the character.  My one reservation, silly and personal as it is, is he is the first actor to play The Doctor younger than I.       The writing is as sharp as ever,  which I have always felt was the trade mark of the Who universe.  The series maintains the great mixture of modern effects and effects that border on cheesy.  The last telling comment as to my enjoyment of the show is that I have purchased and watched the entire available 5th season and felt it money and time well spent.
B003KUSUG8|1.0|He used to have beats that were unique to any other. But this album seems to sound just like another rap album. I miss the days Dr Dre would mix the beats because who ever put these beats together needs a new career.

9889979942|5.0|Aside from a few fleeting facts and stereotypes, the majority of the Western world knows very little about China and its people. Tom Carter has created a comprehensive work of professional art that effectively documents a seemingly impossibly large and diverse nation. I reached out to Tom a few months ago in hopes that he would hold a talk with a group of students from the Chinese Language Institute ([...]) and he agreed without hesitation. From his quaint village in eastern China it took an hour hike, an hour bus ride, followed by an hour train ride just to meet us at a small hostel tucked away well within Shanghai, yet he arrived in high spirits and delivered an open and honest overview of his experiences compiling material for CHINA: Portrait of a People. It was a highlight of the students' 3-week journey through China and particularly enjoyable for me, a part-time China photographer and full-time China adventurer. Tom has accomplished something timeless with this book; I highly recommend it to any and all.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|This is a very small case which was packed in a small cardboard carton. The carton was packed in a box big enough to ship a Hummer. Go figure. I placed my Canon PowerShot IS in one of the pockets and there was still some available space. I decided to place my Flip MinoHD Camcorder 2nd Generation, 2 Hours (Brushed Metal) in another of the pockets and both items fit nicely. I still had an empty third pocket into which I placed some miscellaneous items. Very nice little case at a very reasonable price.
030726999X|3.0|This book has been a real disappointment to me as I have read the first two in the trilogy and thought they were wonderful.  It is very hard to believe that the last book was authored by the same person.  Hornet's Nest is lacking in the suspensefull writing that the first two had that made it hard to put them down.  I was anxious for this one to end and even the ending was a big let down and huge disappointment.
0307463745|4.0|A fantastic business book that I'd thoroughly recommend to anyone serious about being in business, especially their own business. If you want a book that challenges your concepts about business and business processes then this book is it.<br /><br />The books is simple to read and broken up into small bite sections so it is easily read between appointments for busy business owners. Like many good business books this should make you stop and question the conventional wisdom about running a business. Sometime the best way is not the same way that everyone else is doing it.<br /><br />If you are open to the new, welcome a challenge and want inspiration about how to do business better by getting smarter then this book is for you.
0345495004|5.0|Loving Frank is a novel about a woman, rather than a novel about a famous man and his lover. The entire novel illustrates Mamah's view of her relationship to Frank Lloyd Wright. Should she leave with her lover? Did she abandon her children? Will her sister forgive her? Should she doubt herself when Ellen Key, the philosopher changes course? Should she stay with such a flawed man? How to win her children back?     I'm tired of stories told about the lovers and wives of famous men. Most of them portray the importance of the woman to the man and his career. They go on about  how the men gained by their lover's support, then cheated on them,  but the woman will always love them because she can't help it. In the course of stories about famous men the women important to them so often turn out to be fawning empty vessels.    I only started this book, because it was required of my book club. So I was so relieved to find that from the beginning it is a story about Mamah. Her relationship with Wright is compounded by his amazing and compelling personality and talent, but they do not make her into a hollow character.    So read away at this great story of a woman in love. And thank you to Nancy Horan for bringing Mamah to life.

B003ELOQCA|4.0|I was one of the many who had a ticket for this concert summer of 2010 that was postponed. This is an excellent concert video. This will hold me over until I can see the real thing. I bet this DVD provides a much closer look at this fabulous band than my seat would have. The pre-order price was the lowest anywhere.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|It is what it is. For those of us who didn't get to see this in the theaters, it is an excellent choice to not only own the DVD for a decent price, but also provides that first Blu-Ray and a reason to get into Blu-Ray. Sure, I'll probably get the 3D version when it comes out in two years...I also bought four friggin' copies of the Star Wars movies too. The choice is yours, wait for the best and pay once...or enjoy it now and again in two to three years when they decide to give us what we really want.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I enjoy listening to this CD while driving. I think it is wonderful for Susan Boyle to come from nowhere and then skyrocket! If you are looking for a professional singer with great sound quality, this is NOT the CD for you. There are areas of some songs that she sounds \\"pitchy\\" and even off key. All that said, I LOVE the CD and am a true fan! Susan Boyle had a dream and achieved it! That is what this CD is all about.
0385523904|5.0|I had never given North Korea any thought at all, other than it being some strange little country under the sway of a madman. But I picked up this book because I'm always interested in people's stories of their ordinary lives.    Reading this book was a real eye-opener. It reads like a novel, and yet the truth of the situation made my hair stand on end. Since reading this book I have read 4 other books about North Korea. My fascinated horror is something like being an onlooker to a terrible accident, tempered with lots of sympathy for the people of the country. I simply can't imagine the mental state of the children who have grown up under this system.    Best book I have read in the past year. Hope to see more by this author in the future.
1401923119|1.0|I'm embarrassed to have spent money buying this book. Perhaps if it had more appropriately been titled Mr Lipton's Ego Trip, I would have been better forewarned. Instead of simply presenting his scientific information he tries some kind of smoke and mirror trick trying to distract or emotionally incite the reader against scientific dogma and evil scientists hoping you won't notice that he does not ever actually present the biology of belief.   One of his evil scientists is Darwin. He erroneously characterizes Darwin's ideas and attributes push button sayings such as \\"dog eat dog\\" to Darwin.  Instead these perspectives should be appropriately contributed to the non-scientific Social Darwinist's who misunderstood and misused Darwin's ideas. Darwin was a man of awe of the biological world and presented ideas not dogma as Lipton portrays. Lipton seems to want to set his scene with \\"bad scientists\\" and of course he is the good and enlightened and wondrous scientist.   Lipton puts down practically every scientist except himself. Though he writes about how our beliefs affect our biology he presents NO scientific evidence. Always in the NEXT chapter he will explain.    I found myself believing Lipton had cobbled together this book of \\"biology and science\\" with a false claim of new information, for the primary purpose of selling books, lectures, and programs to make money and not to enlighten. This is about the strongest reaction I've ever had to a book and I plan to stop my copy from circulating in this universe by taking it to my recycling center.
0525423842|3.0|I don't know what happened to John Grisham the great legal thriller writer,  but his latest books (\\"Ford Country\\" for one, and his first non-original story \\"The Innocent Man\\") leave a lot to be desired, and lack the spontaneous brilliance of his former works (such as \\"The Street Lawyer,\\" \\"The Rainmaker,\\" \\"The Client,\\" \\"The Pelican Brief\\" - I do miss the spark of those former works and every time I buy a Grisham book I'm hoping to find some of that breathtaking appealonce again.<br /><br />\\"Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer\\" is another plunge into mediocrity. It was the first time that reading a few pages of a John Grisham book put me to sleep. It took me many days to plough through the first 100 pages until finally the great secret is revealled to the nerdy kid and the book kind of takes off on a dull journey to nowhere.<br /><br />I think it'd still be intersting to a kid to read this book although I believe it'll take a better story to grab the attention of any kid away from the magic world of the internet and social networks.
1847245455|5.0|This book is so well crafted.  You really get the feeling that these are people you could actually met, work with, be friends with.  I was transported to their world and only found the cultural differences interesting, not at all distracting.  I was on the edge of my seat a lot of the time and stayed up late reading every night until it was finished.  I left it eager to read the next book, The Girl Who Played with Fire.  I am only disappointed by the fact that the third book, The Girl Who Kicked a Hornet's Nest will be the last as the author died before writing any more in the series.
B000O599ZS|5.0|I am currently reading S.C. Gwynne's book Empire of the Summer Moon about the Comanches. He asserts that The Searchers is based on the kidnapping of Cynthia Ann Parker and Rachel Plummer in 1836 Texas by a Comanche raiding party. (The Searchers was based on a novel which was based on the true story) Fascinating story, which you may be familiar with. Natalie Wood's character was supposedly inspired by Cynthia Ann, who married a Comanche chief, Peta Nocona (Scar, in the movie). Wayne's character was based on the obsessed James Parker, Cynthia Ann's uncle, who made 5 journeys into Comanche lands over many years searching for her and other white captives.
006145205X|5.0|Finally, a book that gives one a reprieve from the daily diet of doom and gloom and says \\"Don't worry, it will be ok.\\"  Matt Ridley takes you through a positive journey though the history of mankind taking every opportunity to point out how resourceful and clever mankind can be.  His journey makes sense even in the face of the doomsday predictions of global warming, poisoning of the environment, crime, etc.  It is said that \\"Attitude is Everything\\" and this book has a lot of it.  I would call it a behavioral economics book that's really fun to read.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|This is a nice little camera carrying case that actually provides protection for your camera.  Made for the smaller digital camera, it has two pockets.  One is for your camera and the other is for batteries or SD cards.  The Neoprene is water-resistant (not waterproof) and has a very nice feel to it.  A wide flap covers the pockets and closes with a hefty Velcro patch. The back side has a nice belt loop that is also connected with a 1.5 X 1.5 Velcro patch.  It's strong enough to attach to your belt without worry of detachment.  For the price, it's a bargain.<br /><br />On another note, this small box came in a huge box, which was totally unnecessary.  Here is what Amazon says about that reasoning:  \\"This Amazon Basics product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging that is recyclable. It comes without excess packaging materials, such as hard plastic clamshell casings, plastic bindings, or wire ties. The packaging is designed to be opened without the use of a box cutter or knife, and it will protect your product just as well as traditional packaging. Products with Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging can frequently be shipped in their own boxes, without an additional shipping box, saving on resources and reducing waste. In addition, the packaging materials that we do use are easily and frequently recycled, composted, or reused by our customers, and all the inks and dyes are biodegradable\\".<br /><br />Sure, it was easy to open, but it was a huge waste of paper product.  I thought Amazon would be a little `greener'.
B003L16FAE|5.0|I just finished watching the ultimate hunter edition of predator  and it a far superior version than the previous blu-ray edition.

B003LXM1RS|5.0|The Scissor Sisters' latest outing is by far their most fun and shows a coming of age. Reading the other reviews and the official review you can really understand how they came to make this album. There are lots of good upbeat tracks to sing and dance along to. I couldn't stop tapping my feet listening to my iPod on the way to work. Fight Fire with Fire is the odd one out stylistically but is a real grower and in my belief was put on there to capture the American market which until now has been slow to catch on to the genius of the Sisters. It's hard to pick out a favorite on an album of stunners but for a high energy funk workout listen to Any Which Way. BUY IT NOW!!!!
0385504225|4.0|How does one follow up one of the bestselling novels of all time? How does one write knowing that the finished product will sell millions of copies regardless and will certainly be made into a movie? Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol is no Da Vinci Code, but it's also a pretty good page-turner on its own. Brown's protagonist, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, finds himself an unwilling participant in a plot (this time in Washington D.C.) to steal the lost symbol from the Masons, a brotherhood dating back hundreds of years. Like the previous books this one is part thriller and part travelogue. As Robert and company are racing to save the lives of others as well as their own, we are treated to a historical tour of the more notable parts of the nation's capital.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is worth reading, especially if you enjoyed the first two books of the series.

1423113381|4.0|My twelve year old daughter loved The Lightning Thief and its sequels. She seems to be equally enamored of this story. Her copy is beginning to look a little ragged as she carried it back and forth to school with her and then loaned it to two friends who had also enjoyed the Lightning Thief. I'd recommend reading it while you wait for Mockingjay  to come out in August.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|Movie aside (Amazon reviews does not criticism make), the quality of the print transferred is very good. Noticeably more clear and lending itself to Hanson's split-diopter effects for whole-screen compositions than the cable TV televised resolution of 720p. Nice to see that the extras were also photographed in native HD, and also play well from the transfer. Also nice to see that the bonus CD of period-appropriate tracks from the movie was also included in the Blu-Ray, and not just the Special Edition DVD.

After watching this I have become a fan. I have the New York and Barcelona concerts, and while both are very good, this one knocks me over. Put on Rosalita and watch The Boss command the stage like no other.Pure,unbridled enthusiasm..Like a kid playing his guitar with his mates for the first time, and in great voice too. Reference quality picture, sound and direction only add to this killer disc. Phenomenal!

B000002LMK|2.0|His constant banging on the cymbals is so annoying.  Neil should have gotten rid of him 40 years ago.  People need to believe me.  If you don't believe me, just listen to the sample Amazon provided of \\"Love and Only Love\\".  The cymbals are awful  (listen before you write some knee jerk comment).<br />Start listening for the cymbals in songs and you will soon agree with me that any drummer who bangs on the cymbals with every beat is annoying, uncreative and stinks out loud.  If Neil weren't so great on guitar, Ralph would have reduced every song they made together to an unlistenable mass of clanging.
030726999X|5.0|This book is a great as the third book in an a three part series. As a stand-alone book it would only be fair sinc it would be difficult to understand and follow. If the author hadn't died there could have been more in this series.

0385528752|5.0|Though it looks, and reads, like your typical psycho-babble business-improvement book, the Heath Brothers have put together a bunch of ideas that can actually help you make changes -- in your life and your business.    A quick, breezy style provides some surprisingly valuable insights here. Pointing out that the Elephant (emotions) and the Rider (rational thought) are often in opposition, isn't new. But finding ways to mitigate that tension, often by simply changing the Path, provides real insight into common, often apparently intractable, problems.    I was skeptical when I received this book as part of a conference package, but picked it up on a plane; now i recommend it to friends and colleagues. If you are struggling with change in your life or organization, check out Switch.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Following the drama-filled storylines of the first Sex and the City movie with Big ditching Carrie at the altar and Steve cheating on Miranda, writer/director Michael Patrick King made it clear that in the sequel he wanted the girls to have fun. Much like the overindulgence and excesses of the big studio films made during the Great Depression in the 1930's, Sex and the City 2 follows a similar note by letting the audience escape America's current economic downturn and enjoy the decadence and glamour of an exotic vacation in Abu Dhabi.    Those going into this film expecting substance may be disappointed. While there is a clear story and theme among the four women, the film lacks the weight of the first film. The first film explored Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha's separate lives, the sequel's focus is on the women as a group. Taking a vacation to Abu Dhabi allows the audience to enjoy these women together for much of the film while still exploring what is going on in their personal lives.    Without giving too much away, tradition is the overall theme of the film. The film begins with a non-traditional marriage of Carrie's gay bff, Stanford, marrying Charlotte's gay bff, Anthony. The wedding leads to the introduction of the four main storylines in the film. Carrie is pondering the traditions of marriage and the roles that a wife and husband play. Charlotte struggles with the life of traditional motherhood that she always dreamed of. Miranda's professional life is turned upside down with a chauvinistic boss. Samantha is having a hard time maintaining her sexual appetite and lifestyle with the onset of menopause and later on, the restrictions placed on her sensuality while in Abu Dhabi.    Having the women on vacation in Abu Dhabi is the perfect place to explore tradition. In a place where a woman's role is still very restricted, the Middle East helps the ladies explore their lives and see that even in America some of these archaic expectations for women arestill prevalent. One part in particular that I found interesting is that while Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha realize that America may not be as forward-thinking as we tend to believe, they come across a group of women in Abu Dhabi who secretly are breaking away from the traditions that they are expected to maintain, however, they carefully conceal it under their hijabs and burqas. It was a fun way to show the two worlds colliding.    This film has a sophistication and layer in it about gender roles that I don't think many of the mostly straight, male critics understood (There is a reason why King chose to have the ladies sing \\"I Am Woman.\\" Look beyond the glitz of the scene and at the actual thematic elements of the song.). Majority saw the film as the girls being spoiled and going on an unrealistic and unnecessary trip to the Middle East. Yet they failed to see the commentary that King was making with the exploration of these modern New York City women in a world where a woman's sexuality is frowned upon.    Overall, I enjoyed the film. This sequel was appropriate because it explored what happens after marriage. In films, it's so easy to end on a marriage, but that's not where the story ends. This film explores Carrie and Big after the wedding and how the non-traditional Carrie handles it. This is a fun movie and made more for laughs than anything else. It's over-the-top at times and overindulgent always (gratuitous costume changes and Liza Minnelli singing `Single Ladies' comes to mind). However, this film is a romp, it has a modern feel of the road pictures made in old Hollywood with characters taking lavish trips and getting themselves into high jinx trouble. This film is one that you can sit back and enjoy and escape, the way Michael Patrick King intended.
0812406273|5.0|When my son was 3 this was his favorite book.  We knew it by heart - he and I both, and we would laugh at owl's adventures and not so wise solutions reading after reading.  My son recently turned 35 and this collection of short stories about owl has delighted his children and numerous young nieces and nephews just as it did him when we first discovered them so many years ago.  They are timeless stories that don't seem to age.  Treat a young person you know to the fun contained between the covers of this book and years later you may still be laughing together about some of owl's funny one-liners - because you both still remember them !
B002WTC93S|3.0|I share some of the opinions of both the fans and the critics of this book. The characters are well developed and the plot is engaging, but the translation sucks and there are too many similar characters to avoid confusion. I'm assuming a bad translation that gets common American English expressions laughingly wrong and also, as others have pointed out, reveals ignorance of common gun facts. A revolver does not have magazines, and a Glock is not a revolver. For a crime novel, that's pretty basic stuff. Getting it wrong presents inexcusable distractions. Also, although this book is available from an American publisher, I assume the folks at Harper never read it. It is actually a reprint of the translation to British English and spelling. It's odd that the biggest potential audience for this book does not get more consideration.
B001HN6940|5.0|I was delighted, as a Johnny Depp fan; he never ceases to entertain his audience as only he can do.  This movie came in perfectly condition and earlier than expected.  I would recommend this seller highly!!!
030726999X|5.0|A fitting finish to the trilogy that leaves you wanting the next in the series, even tho there wont be one. An amazing capacity to hold interest and attention thru  the 3 books, which fly by like a mesmerizing movie. Only one caveat: good luck on trying to keep straight the too similar Swedish names of characters.
B00000IQW3|5.0|This quick-moving sf-adventure clearly owes more than a tip of its hat to [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]], but it has a charm and a story all its own.  17-year-old Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) lives with his mother (Barbara Bosson) and 10-year-old brother Louis (Chris Hebert)--there's a father in his wallet photo, but we never meet the man--at the Starlite Starbrite Trailer Park, built on an impressively terraced hill somewhere in Northern California.  Like Luke Skywalker, he longs for adventure and travel--outer space, Paris, even just something other than City College--and while he waits for his chance at them he spends much of his time as the park's all-purpose handyman, \\"patching 30-year-old fuse panels and unplugging people's toilets.\\"  The only bright spots in his life are his girlfriend Maggie Gordon (Catherine Mary Stewart), who lives with her grandmother (Meg Wyllie) in one of the other trailers, and the Starfighter video game outside the park's mini-store.  On the evening after learning that his application for a college loan has been refused, he starts playing out of frustration and breaks 1,000,000.  The next evening an odd-looking car arrives, driven by a fast-talking stranger (Robert Preston) who calls himself Centauri and persuades Alex to come with him for purposes undisclosed--which turn out to be recruitment (the Starfighter game is actually a screening/testing device to locate potential gunner-pilots) to the space-fighting forces of \\"the Star League,\\" whose frontier is threatened by the traitorous \\"Xur (Norman Snow) and the Kodan Armada.\\"  Bewildered, Alex hesitates at first and even succeeds in being returned to Earth--only to discover that Xur knows where he's from and has put the mercenary and murderous Zandozans on his trail.  But his reluctance saves the day, for while Centauri is returning him home one of Xur's agents plants a bomb in the fighter bay and kills all the pilotsand navigators, except Grig (Dan O'Herlihy), Alex's assigned partner.  Now it's up to them and their ship, or gun-star, to stand alone against the armada's fighters and flagship.    The effects aren't anywhere near what we're familiar with 25 years later, but their video-gamish look actually suits the story very well.  The action is fast-paced and Alex's hesitancy is completely plausible and understandable.  But the best part of the film is Preston in his last big-screen role (he died two years later), portraying Centauri as more than a little like his mildly larcenous Prof. Harold Hill from [[ASIN:B00000F14B The Music Man (Special Edition)]].  StarWarriors and videogamers as well as family audiences should enjoy it equally.

B000066NRH|5.0|this region 2 two disc set of Predator is a better quality print from 20th   century fox UK IS the DIRECTORS CUT. the big difference with this edition compared  to the us version is not just the time ratio it is in fact the Predator alien played with mastery by the late kevin peter hall \\"a brother from another mother\\"(R.I.P) (with the power of invisibility and deadly skin melting plasma shots can actually be clearly heard and understood when it speaks, which i found to be incredibly fascinating. if you can still get this edition there are a few shots of the Predator which were not included in the american version. disc number 2 is filled with very revealing behind the scenes \\"making of\\" \\"interviews\\" \\"screen tests\\" \\"deleted scenes\\" (which were left out for very good reason(s)) among other tid-bits. the one thing i did find surprising in this extras disc is \\"even the most muscular of men can prove to be the kindest of gentlemen with wonderful senses of humor. especially arnold schwarzenegger and carl weathers (for the time this film was made. though i do hope they haven't changed much since then).    I LOVE THIS FILM!!!!!!!

B003KUSUN6|5.0|This is the blu-ray version of the outstanding Shadows 2004 concert recorded in Cardiff, UK.  Contents are the same as the standard DVD.  The menu system is a different, specifically there are more song titles displayed per screen than the original.    If you have a blu-ray player, I have a pioneer elite BDP-23FD.  Picture quality is fantastic (even the standard DVD looks great on this player) and you can see more of whatever was being filmed.     I'd have given this DVD 10 stars, if possible.  The performance is outstanding.  If you've never heard The Shadows live, here's your chance.    I have only a standard stereo system, but the sound quality (just like the standard DVD) is great.    I'm now awaiting the blu-ray release of the Cliff/Shads Final Reunion DVD...hopefully coming soon.
0060558121|4.0|The characterization and over-all character development in this novel are superb, though the plot itself takes a second-hand to the wonderful people that play major, minor and cameo roles throughout the novel.  Neil Gaiman looks for the soul of America in this novel, and while he doesn't quite reach it, the stories and the people and the places in the novel  will stay with me as some of the most sympathetic and wonderful characters ever developed.  It's unfortunate that the plot wasn't better developed, but perhaps that is in some sense the point of the novel: that America isn't about gods or technology or about fearsome battles - it is about the people who have traveled here from near and far and the relationships that we have developed.
B00001U03Q|1.0|IMHO, this is the worst of Clapton. His early music was awesome, this music is main stream pop @rap they play on the radio. This version of Layla is terrible. It lacks the passion and desperation of the original. Somehow I think if Pattie Boyd had heard this version over the original she would have thought he was kidding around. You want to hear some good Clapton? Check out Cream, Derek and the Dominos, Blind Faith, The Bluesbreakers or just some older stuff before the radio friendly muzak started coming out.

0312330871|5.0|Summary: Ten people are lured to an island and then killed according to a macabre nursery rhyme posted in each of their rooms.<br /><br />Thoughts: One of the best-known of Christie's many mysteries, I have also found this to be one of my favorites although with some qualms namely the killer's sense of justice. One character certainly deserved to die based on a callous disregard for the lives killed through a car accident while others I was less convinced. But it is brilliantly written; as I've done with many Christies, I question if the reader could have actually solved this. Also SPOILER the killer does not die or receive any punishment for killing these people. I think it's a bit like Dexter in that: latent psychopath kills other killers which is troubling to my morality END SPOILER. One difficulty at the start was sorting out all of the characters as they are introduced one right after the other. But then they start dying and that makes it a bit easier to sort them out.<br /><br />But it is a very quick read and enjoyable. I liked trying to puzzle out how they were committed and how they would be committed although I knew I wouldn't be able to figure out who did it. I flew through it even with my mom's persistent interruptions.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 Despite my perceived flaws, obviously a standout and definitely recommended!
B002RV01QI|5.0|Very soothing. I don't really like symphany music, however this type music does the trick. Very smooth and relaxing.  Her voice is so amazing! Soft, even keyed, other singers have their back up singers to make them sound good. Enya is the oppisite of that. She makes the music and the back up singers sound good.
0425129608|4.0|Summary: Arlena Stuart-Marshall is found strangled at a seaside resort. Who did it-her possibly cuckolded husband; smitten Patrick Redfern; the displeased Mrs. Redfern; or someone else? Luckily Hercule Poirot is on the case.<br /><br />*No spoilers*<br /><br />Thoughts: Poirot was not annoying in this book! I think it's because she'd been writing him for a while and then the involvement of the English police diluted his presence, which made me very grateful.<br /><br />I did not figure out the murder and to be honest I think one of the clues the reader would be unable to use because it was based on physical description and there is a lack of it. I wonder if for my next AC I should make up a table and just input all of the information I receive. For example, physical description, likes/dislikes, alibi, possible motive, etc. Yet I still don't think I'd solve it. I did think the murder was committed in a very clever way. I was afraid this was going to end, like another one of Christies, in a manner which irked me the first time I read it but it's doesn't! I realize that doesn't mean much to you because of course I'm writing around the plot point which references the murder but I was very happy!<br /><br />I loved the Gardeners; Mrs. Gardener talks and talks and talks while Mr. Gardener nods his head and obeys. They were good comic characters to include in a murder mystery which is rather dark by nature.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5. Another good entry in the Poriot category.

B0017U7PT6|3.0|The movie is a lot better than i had though it would be, this is the same director that made 2012 and honestly i like this movie a lot better. Is it corny? Yes. Its in probably totally inaccurate in its portrayal of ancient man(if they existed) definitely. But it is one visually stunning and non boring movie to watch. There is never a dull moment as the son of a tribe hunter takes off in search of his girl friend who he was foretold to be so at the beginning. The best scenes are the hunting of the wully mammoths and the parts where the saber tooth tiger shows his face, after the young man saves him. Yes they speak broken English which if there were cave man i'm guessing they didn't have a language of there own. So its either make up a fake language with subtitles throughout or let them speak English, which i prefer instead. The story is flimsy but the journey is pretty exciting, also why the so called \\"four legged demon\\" people speak in a processed low electronic voice i have no clue, obviously because they think they aren't human. So yes its a decent movie that holds your attention, yet if you want something historically accurate your barking in the wrong cave, though if you want a fictional type journey like Lord Of The Rings this movie is just right for you.
B00006AUIG|4.0|\\"Session 9\\" is a highly atmospheric, chilling horror movie which evokes credible suspense by the fact that it is shot on location at what was once known as the Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts, which was used since the 1860s as an asylum for the insane. The building itself is imposing as viewers get to see it when two of the main characters drive up to it - an imposing, red-bricked Victorian-era structure which almost seems to be glowering at viewers - truly a chilling spectacle.<br /><br />The story centers around a small group of asbestos abatement workers, including Peter Mullan as Gordon, the owner of the business and David Caruso as Phil the supervisor. Then there's Josh Lucas playing Hank, a lazy and irresponsible worker, and a few other secondary characters. Well, Peter gets the job of cleaning out the institution of asbestos by guaranteeing that his crew will get the job done in a week, which almost seems a Herculean task given how huge the building is.<br /><br />The scare factor in this movie is quite high, and even my husband (who is NOT a horror fan) expressed how creepy he felt as he watched it with me. Viewers get a foreshadowing of what is to come when Gordon, who seems emotionally troubled throughout the movie, `hears' a voice calling his name as he spies an abandoned wheelchair in the dreary darkness of the institution. Another worker gets obsessed with listening to old recordings of `sessions' with patients, particularly a patient named Mary who had apparently suffered from multiple personality disorders. A slow sensation of dread creeps up one's spine listening to Mary's disembodied voice take on different personalities, even a man's as she engages with her interviewer during these sessions - there's three alternate personalities, i.e. the Princess, Peter and Simon, and as the viewer listens in on these sessions (there are nine of them in all), one cannot help but feel these sessions are key to unlocking the mysterious goings-on at the asylum.<br /><br />The movie takes its time developing the plot - director Brad Anderson keeps the suspense going though and there is no resorting to gratuitous violence or gore here, every scene is carefully engineered to elicit dread and scares. Yes, the movie did remind me of the classic horror movie, \\"The Shining\\", yet I also felt it was original in its story and execution. This is definitely a must-watch for any fan of horror movies, especially those who love atmospheric and psychological horror.e takes its time developing the plot - director Brad Anderson keeps the suspense going though and there is no resorting to gratuitous violence or gore here, every scene is carefully engineered to elicit dread and scares.

0307454541|5.0|Too bad that this author had to die so young, I would have loved to read some more about Mikael and Lisbeth.  I must agree with some of the reviews that said that the first half of the book was rather slow but it was not boring.  The author was almost as meticulous as Mikael was when researching the Harriet Vanger mystery in revealing fascinating details of its main character slowly but surely.  As you know this story is about the disappearance of Harriet Vanger and and how her uncle Henrik he hires Mikael to research the disappearance to see if it was murder, accident or maybe suicide.  For years, her uncle has been receiving a rare flower on his birthday in order to taunt him about Harriet's disappearance and how it has never been solved.  On his 82nd birthday; he hires Mikael to stay one year on his island to write an autobiography on him which is really a ruse for Mikael to find out what happened to Harriet.  It almost like watching an onion being peeled layer by layer to see how Mikael and eventually Lisbeth go about solving this mystery that has haunted the Vanger family for over 40 years.<br /><br />I know that some will give up before halfway through because this author is taking his time in building up this mystery but DON'T give up.  Rarely have I read a mystery so well put together where you feel you are right next to Mikael and Lisbeth disovering each clue.  When the mystery is solved, it will blow your mind.  I have read tons of mystery books and am accustomed to the surprising ending but this one was like WOW, I can't believe it, I can't believe it.<br /><br />I am on my second book because I can't wait to see what Lisbeth is up to.  That girl can't seem to stay away from trouble.  Lucky she is a genius even though she weighs like 90 lbs.
1416955070|3.0|Even though I'm a horror fan and prefer books to be scary, I fully enjoy reading City Of Bones. The Book is based on a teenager named Clary who discovers that magical world went she sees a shadow hunter kill a vampire. Shadow hunters are a powerful warrior who hunts and kills downriders, who are vampires, werewolves, faires and warlocks. They also kill demons as well, but they only fight them when they are free from another deminsion.     The book has a major love triangle between Clary, Jace and Alec, which becames even more complicating at the end.     The book plot is mainly about showing the shadow hunters world and finding Clary mother who has been kidnapped by a demon. She also learns about the father she never knew and the life she should of had.    I still rate this book three stars, even with the clever major twists at the end. It good read and a book you can read through in one go, plus if you enjoy the book you can read the other two and they are better.    Darcy Kath, Author Of Tyson Stone And The Legend Of All Legends

0452286751|1.0|This is one of the most disappointing books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. It started out with great promise. The characters were very simplistic and the writing style was easy to pick up. After a long dry spell of not reading I was surprised at my own enthusiasm to read this book, and I found myself in Part II of the book in no time. Then everything went downhill.<br /><br />The story focused entirely on a woman named Dominique, who had thus far just been a secondary character. Her interest with the main protagonist was painful to read, and I felt like somehow I had picked up a tawdy romance novel, but I endured because I had suspected these two characters, by the respective non-conforming natures, would get together. At some point I just gave in and started to giggle at their impending romance, even if it was taking the oft-traveled \\"I hate him so much I must love him!\\" road.<br /><br />Then he raped her. Our main protagonist. The uncompromising underdog who you want to root for, who you know in the end is the guy who will end up on the top vindicated. Some people don't want to view this certain part of the text as rape because the author tries to explain it away in good old boy fashion that despite the violence \\"they had been united in an\\" unspoken \\"understanding... beyond the deliberated obscenity of his action\\". Isn't that the same old fictional line we've been fed over and over about rape? That even though the woman fought (and she did, left with bruises) the fact that she never explicitly said no means that she wanted it and enjoyed it? That she was glad of the fact that someone came along and took the option to abstain or indulge out of her hands and just \\"defiled\\" her because if the decision was left up to her she would never of had the great \\"sex\\" that she secretly wanted.<br /><br />I stopped reading the book at this point. I can't read a book where the main protagonist rapes and it's not seen as a great character flaw but seen as him asserting his rightful control over the world and whoever gets in his way. I wanted to enjoy this book, I did at first, and I wanted to educate myself about this woman's philosophy but if violence against women is part of that philosophy then she can just stuff it.over the world and whoever gets in his way.

For those of you who read the book and haven't seen the movie yet you're in for a real treat, as the movie does not stray from the book.

It's about 2 hours long (which in my opinion isn't long enough)...but I still got to see plenty of my Edward!

0061122416|5.0|Many people start their adventure with Coelho's literature by reading the Alchemist. It is a best seller for a reason - it touches the soul in a way that few books do.  It helps the reader understand themselves and their destiny in an approach that reads as a story, but hits like an autobiography.  Most readers will stop with the Alchemist - but that is cutting this amazing author and your self exploration short.  If you like the Alchemist as much as most readers do, please don't stop there.  Coelho authored many other books - some of which are in my opinion even better than this amazing work.  Dive in, suspend disbelief, find your destiny.
0142410314|5.0|This book is a classic and I was thrilled to read it again this week. When I'm working on a middle grade project, I like to spice up my reading with both new books and books I loved from my childhood. Roald Dahl was/is my favorite author (him and Stephen King), and I figure when I'm seeking inspiration I could do a lot worse. For that reason, expect plenty more of Dahl's books to be my Book of the Week.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother with a summary of this book. If you're reading a blog about middle grade novels, I'll assume you're familiar with the basic story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. That's one of the reasons I chose to reread the book now. Its story is so well known to me I can all but ignore it and focus my attention on Dahl's craftsmanship. I know that Charlie is a character we're hoping will find a golden ticket and get to tour the chocolate factory, but why do we hope this? How does Dahl convince us to care about Charlie and his lack of a chocolate factory tour?<br /><br />What I learned this time through is that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is actually a horror story for children. Seriously. How else is one to explain the chapter in which a little girl is attacked by an army of squirrels in what has to be one of the creepiest scenes in all of middle grade and adult fiction? And after all, Roald Dahl wrote a great deal of horror for adults (another reason I love him). When I read this book as a child, I hadn't spent any time watching, reading, or writing horror, so I never picked up on it before. Reading the book again as an adult, I have now written a fair amount of horror and I know it when I see it.<br /><br />Willy Wonka is a scary dude. So get this: he invites 5 children to tour his chocolate factory, then disposes of one child after another until he is left with one child (innocent and pure like the best teenage virgin horror heroines) who is rewarded with survival and a chocolate factory. Note to any screenwriters reading this blog: you could totally adapt this plot to a teen scream fest. Imagine five teenagers go someplace creepy, like say a factory, and a maniac kills the ones who have sex, who do drugs, who drink, who pollute the environment (it's your morality play, pick your vices), until there is only the one virgin left who defeats the maniac or reaches a compromise and gets to live happily ever after because he/she is a virgin.<br /><br />Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the same story, only instead of doing drugs or having sex, the sinners in this tale watch too much television, chew too much gum, eat too much food, and are spoiled to the point of being a \\"bad nut.\\" If you don't believe me, reread the rhymes spoken by the oompa loompas who serve mainly as a Greek chorus, and are pleased when each sinner has been disposed of. Willy Wonka accidentally on purpose puts each of these terrible children in a situation where their own vice is turned against them, sort of like Kevin Spacey's character in Se7en, but for kids! If I were Charlie, by the end of that tour I would be screaming my head off in terror, worried about how Willy Wonka was going to blow me up into a blueberry, shrink me to the size of cockroach, let me get sucked into a pipe, or sick an army of squirrels on me (just thinking about it sends a shiver up my spine).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Knowing that Dahl wrote a horror story for children almost as scary as The Witches only makes me love him more. Part of the appeal of the horror story is that the reader is able to see characters get what they deserve. If a person is a jerk in a horror story, the reader can look forward to seeing that character get what's coming to him. Children have to deal with jerks just as surely as adults do. I think part of the reason I loved this story as a child is because it was fun to see the bad kids punished.<br /><br />The last observation I want to make is just how skilled Dahl is at moving a story. He conveys settings and actionsthrough dialogue, thus saving space and increasing his pace. He jump cuts frequently and isn't afraid to have characters state their motivations so long as they do it in a funny or clever fashion. Roald Dahl moves his stories along so fast he could have written War and Peace in about 150 pages or so and you wouldn't notice anything missing from the original.increasing his pace.

B003A4IFGY|3.0|Prior to listening to \\"Mojo\\" I prepared myself by listening to all of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' previous albums in sequence (including the three Tom Petty solo albums and the Mudcrutch album). The first noticeable difference with \\"Mojo\\" is that the band has taken a decidedly bluesy approach, with many tracks having a strong blues component. The first track sets the tone, \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues\\" is a full out bluesy rocker not unlike something you'd hear from George Thorogood and the Destroyers. The second track, the epic seven minute \\"First Flash Of Freedom\\" is not unlike something you might find on a Doors album.<br /><br />And so the rest of \\"Mojo\\" plays out, alternating between these two sounds with some folk thrown in like \\"Something Good Coming\\", or some pop like \\"Candy\\" or even reggae like \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\". So the band at least tried to shake things up a bit. I appreciate the diversity of \\"Mojo\\", but there does seem to be lack that old Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers bite--you know that sneer like on \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\" or \\"Refugee\\" or even \\"The Last DJ\\". \\"Mojo\\" also misses the acoustic bliss of \\"Wildflowers\\" as well.<br /><br />I don't know about anyone else, but I would not mind having Stan Lynch back in the band. I think he might have been the perfect tension and foil for Petty. Things have been a little tame without him around.<br /><br />With 15 tracks, inevitably there could have been some cuts for inclusion as b-sides such as \\"No Reason To Cry\\", \\"Takin' My Time\\", \\"Lover's Touch\\" and \\"High In The Morning\\". The strongest tracks are \\"Something Good Coming\\", \\"Let Yourself Go\\", \\"Running Man's Bible\\", \\"U.S. 41\\" and \\"Candy\\". The rest are good.<br /><br />This will be no comeback for Petty and the Heartbreakers, and they don't really give anything new here, but it is enjoyable, serviceable Petty, no more, no less.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Mojo\\" compares to other Petty releases:<br /><br />1976 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: Five Stars<br />1978 You're Gonna Get It: Four Stars<br />1979 Damn The Torpedoes: Five Stars<br />1981 Hard Promises: Four Stars<br />1982 Long After Dark: Four Stars<br />1985 Southern Accents: Five Stars<br />1987 Let Me Up (I've Had Enough): Four Stars<br />1989 Full Moon Fever: Four Stars<br />1991 Into The Great Wide Open: Four Stars<br />1994 Wildflowers: Five Stars<br />1996 She's The One: Two and a Half Stars<br />1999 Echo: Four Stars<br />2002 The Last DJ: Three and a Half Stars<br />2006 Highway Companion: Four Stars<br />2008 Mudcrutch: Three and a Half Stars<br />2010 Mojo: Three and a Half StarsThe Torpedoes: Five Stars  1981 Hard Promises: Four Stars  1982 Long After Dark: Four Stars  1985 Southern Accents: Five Stars  1987 Let Me Up (I've Had Enough): Four Stars  1989 Full Moon Fever: Four Stars  1991 Into The Great Wide Open: Four Stars  1994 Wildflowers: Five Stars  1996 She's The One: Two and a Half Stars  1999 Echo: Four Stars  2002 The Last DJ: Three and a Half Stars  2006 Highway Companion: Four Stars  2008 Mudcrutch: Three and a Half Stars  2010 Mojo: Three and a Half Stars

0374531269|4.0|Ishmael Beah's straightforward and relentlessly honest account of his days as a \\"boy soldier\\" in Sierra Leone's civil war is difficult but necessary medicine to swallow, given the increasing use of children by warring factions all over the globe.  It is one of the great crimes against humanity because even if, like Beah, the child survives, a part of him has died -- namely, his childhood.<br /><br />The death of innocence is especially moving as Beah opens with scenes from his childhood before the war.  The reader sees the universality of youthful joy in the simple things -- swimming, fishing, playing soccer, listening to music, telling stories, and joking with parents and siblings.  Then one day the war comes to Beah's village and he is separated not only from his family but from life as he knew it.  The book turns into one harrowing chase scene after another as Beah and friends try and fail to stay ahead of the rebels who seem to surface in every village they take refuge in.<br /><br />From here the book moves to the most disturbing part.  Beah is enlisted in the army and taught to kill.  Drugs are used to help the boys become used to guns, killing, blood, and gore.  They quickly become addicted to both killing and drugs.  They are told again and again it is for vengeance, to get back at the rebels who killed their families, and yet, to the reader, it is hard to discern the army's tactics from the rebels'.  Both kill wantonly.  One interesting character, however, is the lieutenant who, like Beah, loves Shakespeare and can quote entire scenes from JULIUS CAESAR and MACBETH.  Talk about strange bedfellows!  (Though Caesar and MacBeth might disagree.)<br /><br />While the language is not as eloquent as you see in many other memoirs, its simplicity reaches an eloquence of sorts -- one perfect for this particular narrator and one appropriate for his tale.  The ending is a bit abrupt but, overall, A LONG WAY HOME is a worthwhile addition to your library of memoirs.
B001ROAK9E|4.0|Lots of good points and guides for the lay person and possibly a good refresher for the more experienced negotiator.     The big limitation this book for me is that it seems essentially about negotiating a flexible solution with othere parties of some good faith and willingness to be reasonable.     Unfortunately I would suggest the negotiating skills and strategies most important at the cutting edge are about dealing with exactly the opposite kind of person.

Incidentally, we meet Kirsten Stewart who has gone on to become a tween idol in the \\"Twilight\\" movies. She's cute but not much of an actress. Most of her acting seems to consist of fiddling with her hair.<br /><br />Well, this movie provides a perfectly harmless and pleasant hour and a half of your time.

B0029NY9YO|5.0|Watchmen, the graphic novel by Alan Moore upon which Watchmen, the film, was based has a huge cult following. From the DC Comics Vertigo line, it is a comic book for adults. Not just because of the graphic violence, and graphic, if not quite pornographic, sex, but also because of the philosophical, psychological, and the historical content. Allusions to Aristotle and Allen Ginsberg's Howl are mixed with cultural references to Lee Iacocca, JFK, and Richard Milhous Nixon. Laced with post-modern irony throughout, we have a comedian with a very perverse sense of humor; a sociopath vigilante whose face is an ever shifting Rorschach pattern; a physicist endowed with strange powers after a tragic accident and ominously named Dr. Manhattan; and another who takes his name from the famous sonnet Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias: I don't mind being the smartest man in the world; I just wish it wasn't this one.<br />==========<br /><br />The climactic scenes of Watchmen take place in 1985, but it is a parallel universe to our reality with a few interesting twists: Masked and caped super heroes are a part of everyday life, and have been since before WWII. Nixon doesn't resign in disgrace after Watergate, but serves for three terms. Nixon uses Dr. Manhattan as a secret weapon to win the war in Viet Nam, and Viet Nam becomes the 51st state of the U.S. The U.S. is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia, and the tension is higher than it was at the height of The Cold War.<br /><br />--------------<br />Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II: What happened to us? What happened to the American Dream?<br />Edward Blake / Comedian: \\"What happened to the American Dream?\\" It came true! You're lookin' at it...<br />==========<br /><br />Though Alan Moore preemptively disowns all filmed adaptations of his work, I can't imagine a more faithful adaptation. I admit that I haven't read the graphic novel, but that will soon change. Meanwhile, you can see that a lot of the storyboard shots were taken from the comic's panels, and not only the story, but the original artwork was respected. I love the look of the film, a kind of gritty realism that wove the superheroes seamlessly into the tapestry of their times. The 40's era scenes were true to their period, and likewise, the scenes in the 80's also captured the 80's zeitgeist. I love Nite Owl II's Owl Craft, the way it looked as it cruised over the city, those big round windows like the owl's eyes. The only false note for me was Dr. Manhattan sometimes looked like an animation superimposed over live action--which I suppose he was. Still you could tell that they used some very sophisticated special effects, trying some new things that almost worked, but most worked spectacularly well. And Dr. Manhattan, put on some pants!<br /><br />-------------------<br />Laurie Juspeczyk / Silk Spectre II: The most powerful thing in the universe... still just a puppet.<br />Jon Osterman / Dr. Manhattan: We are all puppets, Laurie. I'm just the puppet who can see the strings.<br />==========<br /><br />I have to hand it to Director Zack Snyder and the cast. Especially Malin Åkerman as Laurie Jupiter / Silk Spectre II and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II. The scenes where they suit up in their superhero costumes and cruise the night in the Owl Craft, which was for them a kind of aphrodisiac, were excellent. It brought to mind a similar scene in The Losers, also highly recommended, where Jeffery Dean Morgan (who plays The Comedian in Watchmen) and Zoë Saldana also use fighting as foreplay. Patrick Wilson not only captures the heat, he also portrays Dan Dreiberg as a stodgy middle aged fuddy duddy when he is not in his Nite Owl II costume. Malin Åkerman is excellent both here and in scenes with Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, who is growing increasingly distracted by the threat of a nuclear Armageddon, and more and more detached from any human connections. Laurie is a complicated woman, who also has major issues with her mother, Sally Jupiter / Silk Spectre, played by Carla Gugino. Don't even get me started on her Daddy issues.<br /><br />Still, when it comes to major issues, no one tops Jackie Earle Haley as Walter Kovacs / Rorschach. His name refers to the Rorschach inkblot test used in psychotherapy, and he wears a mask with an ever shifting Rorschach pattern on it. He doesn't call it a mask. He calls it his face. Rorschach channels his sociopathic urges into vigilante actions, like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. Like Travis Bickle, he waits for that Someday. \\"Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets.\\"<br /><br />-------------------<br />Walter Kovacs / Rorschach: The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout \\"Save us!\\"... and I'll whisper \\"no.\\"<br />==========<br /><br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Matthew Goode as Ozymandias round out the band of Watchmen, and Alan Moore, though he has vowed never to watch the film, couldn't ask for a better portrayal of his characters. I was ready to write off Jeffrey Dean Morgan after first seeing him on Grey's Anatomy, especially when his character came back as a ghost, but thankfully I gave him a chance here. He was excellent as The Comedian, though he never told a single joke. Maybe that was the punch line. He is also a winner in The Losers.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Edward Blake / Comedian: Once you realize what a joke everything is, being the Comedian is the only thing that makes sense.<br />==========<br /><br />Director Zack Snyder made excellent choices in music, using several iconic songs that could almost be too powerful and distract or overwhelm the narrative were they not placed in exactly the right time and place. Three Dylan songs: Blowin' In The Wind done by Dylan, but All Along The Watchtower in the famous Jimi Hendrix version and Desolation Row done by My Chemical Romance. Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen has been used in countless films, but nowhere as appropriate as here. We also get 99 Luftballoons by Nena, The Sounds of Silence by Simon and Garfunkle, and Boogie Man by K.C. and the Sunshine Band! Get down tonight!<br /><br />-------------------<br />Walter Kovacs / Rorschach: Man bursts into tears. Says, \\"But doctor... I am Pagliacci.\\" Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.<br />==========<br /><br />The bottom line is Watchmen is a very watchable movie that combines comic book action with deeper, more adult themes. In a perfect world it would be watched by more people, but it appeals strongly to its cult audience, kids who have grown up on comic books, and who still enjoy reading comic books, but demand a more sophisticated, grown up story.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Jon Osterman / Dr. Manhattan: They claim their labors are to build a heaven, yet their heaven is populated by horrors. Perhaps the world is not made. Perhaps nothing is made. A clock without a craftsman. It's too late. Always has been, always will be.

I thought it was very original and didn't fall into the main stream topics that YA has been falling into lately. I've been waiting a long time for a wonderful epic fantasy in YA and finally I have it. I think this book will appeal to teens and adults alike and fans of any genre. Cashore is one of my favorite authors and I will continue to buy her books for as long as she writes them.

0307454541|4.0|No need to rehash with a synopsis here.  I am normally a fan of young adult fiction, but finally purchased this because it was highly recommended by a friend and frequently made my Amazon recommendations list.  I am a mom to three young kids that works outside the home so reading has to be an escape, not a chore.  This was most certainly not the latter!<br /><br />PROS: Fast and fun - at times I felt like I was playing a game of Clue!  The pace at the 3/4 mark in the novel kept me up hours past bedtime!  Despite the difficulty of the foreign(to me) names, the key players were consistently fleshed out so I found I didn't have such a hard time keeping them apart.  In fact, Larsson did a good job reminding you who was related to whom without being too obvious about it.  The main characters were seriously flawed (especially Mikael and Lisbeth - I actually found myself completely loving Henrik), but sympathetic enough to look past those flaws, or at least accept them.  The sex and violence are explicit, but not detailed; just enough to avoid offending adult intelligence, without cheapening scenes by focusing on shock value.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the differences between American sayings/culture/conventions/politics and those in Sweden - that was almost as fun as the mystery.<br /><br />CONS:  There were a few \\"oh seriously?!\\" moments which somewhat impacted the momentum of the story.  Larsson's own views and sympathies seem to be strongly imprinted on the characters and the storyline - usually this is ok, but a few times I felt like it was a little patronizing.  Ocassionally, I felt that Larsson was killing the female characters in the book with \\"kindness\\" - they are so pretty, they are so strong, oh wait, they are so damaged, they are victims, but wait women are not victims...The BIGGEST CON?  The LAST 40 pages!  If you are fully satisfied with the ending after the second \\"big\\" reveal, don't feel compelled to read on.  The affected and frankly boring financial intrigue (told in part by a series of awkward emails) was completely anti-climatic for me.  You don't have to read them - seriously, you don't.<br /><br />I liked it enough to buy the second novel in the \\"Girl\\" series.  Perhaps that one will answer the final BURNING QUESTION - Does everyone in Sweden drink 10 pots of coffee a day and have casual sex with everyone they encounter?by a series of awkward emails) was completely anti-climatic for me.

0441009425|4.0|Despite its *numerous* problems, this book kept me reading until the last page to see what would happen. (Then I threw it across the room into the donation box, cursing profusely.)<br /><br />Revelation Space is a conundrum. The characters are so two-dimensional and shallow it is almost impossible to tell them apart, the pacing may be the worst I have ever read, the editor should be fired (and reminded how to use spell check), the author needs writing lessons; and yet, it was a good yarn -- mostly. (The last hundred or so pages made me stop and look at the cover to make sure I hadn't picked up another book by mistake.)<br /><br />This could have been a truly excellent book.

0452286751|5.0|OK, I have read everything Ayn Rand ever wrote.  I am a Randian nut. Her notion of capitalism and government applies to me.  I believe in the free market economies and that only through free markets will society be achieved. Fountainhead speaks to all those factors brilliantly in the Randian style of pictorial wording and pithy elegance of character creation.<br /><br />Howard Roark, is an individualistic architect who chooses to struggle in obscurity rather than compromise his artistic and personal vision. We follow his battle to practice what the public sees as modern architecture, which he believes to be superior, despite an establishment centered on tradition-worship. How others in the novel relate to Roark demonstrates Rand's various archetypes of human character, all of which are variants between Roark, the author's ideal man of independent-mindedness and integrity, and what she described as the \\"second-handers.\\"<br /><br />Powerful, visionary, and moving. Rand gives us ideas as poignant as The Republic by Plato.

0393078299|5.0|There are a number of very striking themes and trends in Quantum that other reviewers have not brought out, being dazzled, no doubt, by the swift pacing, tantalizing prose and cliffhanger hooks that Kumar employs so magnificently in Quantum.<br /><br />First, as someone who has struggled to understand quantum mechanics when it is presented in textbooks as a whole system, I was delighted to find that physicists have the same problem. Even  (if not especially) Albert Einstein. By taking us through the history of it, and enjoying the exhilaration of every incremental discovery, theory and step, I find I am really comfortable reading about it, and have no difficulty assimilating it. When you're along for the ride instead of the textbook, it makes a gigantic difference. Bravo, Kumar.<br /><br />Second, it became painfully obvious that physics is far more philosophy than science. I felt like the arguments came from my Logic 101 class. Socrates would have enjoyed crossing swords with Bohr. The arguments of the scientists were really basic, philosophical differences of opinion, not the least bit esoteric or idiosyncratic. It seems that medicine is not the only \\"science\\" where they tell you to get a second opinion. That was a revelation, and it made physics all that more human.<br /><br />Third, Quantum confirms a lifelong suspicion that this was and is a young man's game. It seems that every time things started to get stale, some precocious 26 year old student would come along with a new portion of a theory, and rock the establishment. And then live off that discovery for the rest of his life - winning the Nobel Prize (as almost every one of them eventually did), getting professorships - but never shaking the tree again. In music we would call them one hit wonders. Einstein was about the only one with two hits - brainstorms in 1905 and 1916 - but then, even he couldn't fathom the totality of quantum physics and never made another major contribution to its progress. By the age of 50 he was calling himself an \\"old fool\\".<br /><br />So in addition to all the praise heaped on Quantum for its superior exposition, I think it's a wonderful addition to the discussion of the human condition. Valuable on a number of levels.<br /><br />What a great book.himself an \\"old fool\\".

B003CFBQBW|5.0|I do love the series, but for me, there always seemed to be something missing in the first two soundtracks (and movies, for that matter).  There were a few gems in Twilight, and a few more in New Moon, but it just didn't seem consistent.  My guess is that as the franchise grew, it could sink progressively more resources into beefing up the quality of both the movie and music.  Maybe the franchise finally found its groove in terms of getting people with the right chemistry involved.  Maybe it was both.  Whatever it was, this soundtrack delivered, matching the tone of the book note for note. I didn't have to see the movie to feel that.  The score was amazing, but I'd expect no less from Howard Shore, though Alexander Desplat did a fine job too.  The icing on the cake was that the movie itself FINALLY did justice to the book it represented.  Of course, everyone interprets each installment differently, and I'm likely biased b/c Eclipse was my favorite in the series.  However, as my favorite, my expectations were higher and I wasn't expecting the movie/music to reach them.  Pleasant surprise.      Eclipse (All Yours) is definitely my favorite track, particularly the version on the score that has Howard Shore's orchestral lead-in (Wedding Plans).  I love strong heroines, and this song soars, epitomizing the transition Bella finally makes from damsel-in-perpetual-physical/mental-distress to chick-taking-charge-of-her-destiny.  Let's Get Lost is fantastic as well, and may as well be a Bella/Edward duet.  I agree that the rest of the album is split between light and haunting tracks, with the haunting tracks solidly representing Jacob's battle between hope and despair.  All in all, well-worth the price of all three: the score, the soundtrack, and the movie ticket.

0780622553|5.0|One of the greatest strengths of Dark City is the slow unfolding sense of mystery which exists for the opening few acts of the film. John, the frightened hero, awakes in a bathtub with a hole in his head and no sense of how he got there. He runs, before receiving a call from a man claiming to be a doctor, played in a very odd, plodding way by Keifer Sutherland at the height of his powers. John does not continue the conversation more than a few seconds, running into the night pursued by men in dark coats. The film then cuts to William Hurt, a powerfully talented investigator played in a serious and brooding way, who has been summoned to where John has run from to examine the body he unwittingly left behind, a body with circles cut into it. Then we move to Jennifer Connelly's character, John's wife who hasn't seen him in three weeks.             But in a city this literally dark, nothing is as it seems and John is quickly caught up in a three way battle between Keifer Sutherland, a man who is allied with the men in coats somehow and the police, led by William Hurt with the help of John's wife. But the problem is not John's identity, it is the nature of the city itself, and the strange things that happen at midnight. I won't spoil any further.             Alex Proyas, a cult icon, directs the film with all the resources at his disposal when the film was produced in 1998, and the elements of solid production design remain. Buildings shift, time change and the viewer begins to question what the strange beings behind the city's movements question, \\"what is the nature of the human soul?\\" I can't escape that the characters are somewhat one-dimensional and the script is lacking. What is not lacking is imagination, which makes Dark City a stroke of genius.

B0038Q3UKA|4.0|Collections like this one puzzle me. If you're a Lupu fan, as I am, you probably have at least a few of these discs already. I own half of this set--the incredible Impromptus and Moments, the wonderful Schumann, the excellent Brahms, and some of the less impressive Beethoven. So the question becomes whether to buy this set just to get Lupu's Schubert sonatas in one package.    I guess if you like Lupu and don't have much by him, it might make sense to get this set. But it might make more sense to buy individual CDs of Lupu's very best--you can't go wrong with his Impromptus, though Schnabel's is also great--and shop around for better versions of other works by, say, Kempff, Rubinstein, Richter, or Andsnes.

I was envisioning those scenes from the book and imagining the way that they would come across on the big screen.  I also told myself to not get too excited that most books that become movies do not always turn out the way we all wish for.  This movie was an absolute disappointment.  Even if I never read the book the excitement was just not there.  They focused on one main objective and left out soo much for the viewer to take in and experience.  What a waste of time to watch, I am glad that I only paid to rent the movie.

The thing is his flow is the same as always his content has changed. There is no way anybody would go through the things he went through and not change. He lost his best friend and then almost overdosed, how can you expect him to continue to rap about the same things as before.  Give this album a few listens and you will not be dissapointed. The punchlines are still there, he's just evolved like EVERY artist to reach a new generation.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was recommended to me from an unlikely source--from a server at an Austin, TX hotel.  I was there for a conference and took my Kindle with me to read over dinner one night (you've probably done this before too, don't judge).  As he was an excellent server we made small talk and asked to see the Kindle (I gave it a glowing review).  Before the end of the conversation he told me that I had to read this book, he had only heard about it and hadn't got to read it himself yet but just knew that it was going to be great.  Flash forward--a couple of weeks later I downloaded it.      For the book itself I don't know what I expected but was definitely surprised since I'm not so much into the zombie genre.  Written as an eye-witness account from survivors of the Zombie Wars (or WWZ) it was pithy, heartbreaking, and globally patriotic.  The writing is witty, intelligent, and definitely thought-provoking.  I have recommended it to all my bookophile friends as a must-read and to anyone else I might meet.  So a big thank you to the waiter in downtown Austin--you did me a solid and I'm glad I tipped you well.

No way.<br /><br />OK, I get it, every hipster band these days worships either Joy Division and Jesus & Mary Chain or Beach Boys (and in the case of Fleet Foxes, both).

Joy Division whipped up a credible melody when they wanted to, and there's nothing here I am going to hum after a few weeks of listening to \\"High Violet.\\" It's like Interpol with no hooks or JMC without the wicked subversive humor.<br /><br />There are two moments that I can get hints of what all the excitement is about, and they're both at \\"High Violet's\\" midpoint. \\"Bloodbuzz Ohio\\" sounds like The National just finished watching a season of TruBlood and hit the studio. As a love song gone wrong, it's the best thing here. It's also the moment where the depressive poetry of the lyrics hits a level of intrigue that most everything else here doesn't.<br /><br />Right afterwards is \\"Lemonworld,\\" which carries along only a stuttered chorus and its brevity. I guess it is one of those old songwriting saws that if you run out of words, 'la la la\\" (or in this case, doo-doo-doo) will make it all OK. Those two songs keep \\"High Violet\\" from sinking below an average 3-star rating. If anything, The National remind me of The Editors at the moment they recorded \\"An End Has a Start,\\" seemingly stuck in a loop of what made them interesting early on. The Editors broke that chain by moving off towards a new direction. Maybe next CD, The National\\" will make that kind of leap as well.
1400067936|5.0|The book is great in its own manner. This book is not the body of a new scientific theory nor will it teach you how to invest your money etc. I've come to see this book as a self-help one, for it helps dealing with the randomness that pervades life.
0439023483|4.0|Everybody told me to read this book, and I'm glad I did. The Hunger Games is a hot YA novel that is definitely science fiction, but it's not marketed that way from what I can tell. I finally read it and and finished last week. It started pretty slow, but the main character, Katniss (named after flowering water plant), was awesome. I really enjoyed how the author portrayed her and was impressed at how much I was made to care. Katniss has a self-deprecating sincerity that makes you love her. The book is very character driven and tells the story of a future North America that has been brought under the control of a cruel central government that imposes its will on twelve districts with starving populations kept poor and hungry by draconian policies. The government (referred to as, \\"the capital\\") forces each district to send a boy and girl to participate in the Hunger Games once a year--they draw lots to see who goes--but it's probably rigged. Then the capital game makers lock the teenagers into an arena where they proceed to kill each other live on television--which shows how big and powerful the capital is--and keeps the districts in line.<br /><br />Only one person can survive and win. Good thing Katniss is an amazing archer--she hunted illegally since she was young. She's a truly interesting character and the entire novel is from her point of view. I love it that Suzanne Collins didn't muddy the waters with other characters points of view. She stays in tight on Katniss and this really allowed me, and I think any reader, to really become vested in the character. The story is a little far-fetched for me, but I can mostly buy it, and the world that Collins created is fascinating. In the end, the book is well written, interesting, and has some cool characters, especially Katniss. I don't see it as a must read, but I was quite entertained. I'm now listening to the audio book of the sequel, Catching Fire, and I like it a lot so far. Book three in the series is out now and I'm glad I'll be able to read it without a long wait. In summary, Suzanne Collins has created an excellent series for young adults and adults, that entertains as well as educates the reader about the dangers of inhumanity and the consequences of having to do anything to survive.<br /><br />Paul Genesse<br />Author of The Dragon Hunters<br />[...]d I'll be able to read it without a long wait.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|1.  I'm not biased against scifi movies.<br />2.  I love action flicks.<br />3.  But I do like movies that have at least a decent script, that are well written and are well acted.  This movie has got to be one of the most over hyped  and over-rated movies of all time.  First of all, the whole storyline is... just dumb.  Second:  the acting is just lame.  Third:  you are constantly exposed to Cameron's whacked out leftist philosophy.  Fourth:  You put all of those factors together and you have a film that is frankly boring.  I just couldn't wait for this dud to end.<br />4.  Bottomline: this movie once again proves that a great movie is not based on special effects.  The old fundamentals of solid writing and acting is always going to be the underlying factors of whether or not a movie is a dud (as in this case) or a masterpiece.  The only thing more depressing than this movie is the thought of all those people walking around out there, who actually think this is anything more than a 1-2 star movie.  Wow, what is this society coming to???
B001EN71DG|5.0|Good collection of the original star wars saga.  Would have been nice to have a collection which included all six films.  They are as good here as they were on the big screen so many years ago.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended addition made me fall in love with the trilogy all over again.  How I wish Pete Jackson could have released this to the theaters.  True ringers would have gladly stayed no matter how many hours it ran.  Loved it so much, I broke out the books, starting with the Hobbit of course\\", and I am enjoying the thrill ride just as much as I did the first time I read them.  The extra's and appendices explaining in detail all that was involved in the creation of this masterpiece was amazing to watch.
B003L16FAE|5.0|I saw the movie in theaters when it was originally released(I'm 38). When I bought the initial Blu-ray release, I was hugely disappointed with the picture quality. The film grain was ridiculous and I honestly don't remember it being that bad even those many years ago when I saw it in the theater. The colors seemed washed out, nothing stood out to me that it was \\"high def\\". It seemed more like a badly upscaled dvd. The grain was so much of a distraction that once I viewed the entire movie I promptly sold it to a local mom and pop video store.    Bought the Ultimate Hunter Edition at Walmart tonight for $15. Now this is a huge improvement imo of the picture quality. I can see beads of sweat, skin pores, details on leaves, individual whiskers, everything is crisp and crystal clear with deep colors and no more annoying film grain. The jungle scenes are detailed and crisp. Nothing seems \\"off\\" with the picture to my eyes(beyond 20/20 vision )    It all comes down to a matter of taste obviously. I'm happy with my purchase. Your mileage may vary.    Hey and I got a $10 movie money voucher good towards \\"Predators\\" as well.

B0000029GA|5.0|This IS the blueprint for all hip hopers past, present, and FUTURE.  The most scary thing is that Nas put out the single greatest album in the HISTORY of Hip Hop with only 10 tracks!!  Every single track is worth a 5/5, but seriously cannot be rated as this album is what Hip Hop is all about.  Not no flashy lights, partying like a rock star, or any of that nonsense.  If you call yourself a fan of Hip Hop and do not have a legit copy of this album, seriously, go kill yourself.
0307593525|4.0|Julia has her own way of doing things and I personally like her teaching methods. Some say it is the same as others but with more butter. I disagree. Her book gives insight into the technique of cooking and leaves the reader with many options. I like Julia's style. I use the book as a reference for important aspects of cooking. I give it 4 stars which means it is a very good book but it is not complete within itself. There are many other good books with great recipes. I personally like to surf the Internet for recipes and spend a little time reviewing Julia's book. Some people will do just fine without this book.

This book exceeded everything I could have imagined. The writing is fantastic. The characters are solid. I was so invested in the story that I stayed up all night to finish it.     Words can't even express how much I adored this book!
B002ZG97RY|5.0|We really liked this movie that many don't want to see or know about the reason and truth behind the US invasion of Iraq and the lies told to start this war and how US citizens and others were duped into believing something planned and executed to trick all who listened to the lies. Matt Damien, along with all the actors, are suberb in their portrals in this multi-government coverup of war and politics at it's worse!  Although I'm a patriot, American born US citizen whole loves America, this great country, I am furious that so many from different countries have lost their lives and are still loosing their lives, for nothing!  The people caught in the middle of the wars and conflicts really have very little or no say, the decisions makers meet behind closed doors and decide for all!!!  Discerning where the fiction and truth start and end are up to you, draw your own conclusion but this reminds me of another Viet Nam on a grander scale!!!!  Wake up America!  How many more people have to die...including our US military personnel and citzens of other countries?  When did oil, greed & power become our Gods?    Carol in Virginia USA
0061353248|5.0|The author offers experiments as well as concepts to support a premise that makes sense.  This is well worth reading and an easy read at that.  But it doesn't hurt to be an economist with an MS in Psychology either.  You certainly get the jokes better.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This album is STRONG.  Not their best, but definitely the best among the newer albums (beats dance of death, brave new world, etc. by far).   I can see how others rate it as their best album ever.  It is definitely VERY VERY strong.  Compositions are very unique and refined.  Lyrics are inspiring and refreshing.  The musicianship is top notch.  In fact, I would say that in terms of production and musicianship, this album is probably their best release ever.  There is too much to be said about the songs.  Check out, just for fun, lord of light, it will give you a good idea of the playing field level of this album.  Some of Dickinson's best work ever - and his voice also comes out really nice in the mix.  I can honestly say that this is one of the few Maiden albums that I can listen to all the songs without skipping any.  I can't say that for very many of even the older albums.
B00275EGWY|4.0|There many movies that have depicted the world of war. The past has given us a very glorified, Hollywood picture. Movies from 'All Quiet on the Western Front' to 'Inglorious Basterds' have show us good vs. evil, fancy dialogue etc. War is always taken out of context in cinema, but there are very few that give us something real.<br /><br />'The Hurt Locker', now known as the best picture of 2009 is one of those movies that is not bent on giving us a glorious picture, rather they strip war down to its true, gritty roots and in this movie we see the mental anguish that soldiers go through in modern day war. This movie takes us into the lives of a battalion that has been sent into Iraq to patrol the streets in search of terrorists and suicide bombers. In the middle of their rotation they are given a new squad leader that is a bit off color when it comes to the seriousness of their cause. He is unruly and at times treats it like a game. While some would consider characteristics such as this offensive because of the real people out there today fighting this war, there is some realism to those actions. There are people that have gotten so wrapped up in this war they try to turn into something else just to keep going as they battle the enemy. The film is very tense and at times not for the faint hearted. Still, it is not suppose to be war is real and war can make you feel all sorts of emotions you never thought you had inside you. One of the things that I appreciated about 'The Hurt Locker', was the fact that not all Arab people are depicted as bad, and that those who happen to be good in nature are thrown into terrorist acts against their will and sometimes they lose their own lives.<br /><br />'The Hurt Locker', is not meant to be a cinematic legend in its field, nor was it made to be one of the greatest films of all time. I feel this movie was created to send a very important message about the war we are currently fighting and war in general. We have brave men and women who fight for freedom and a movie such as this one is here to show us, maybe not accurately, how they go about their daily lives on the battlefield. More importantly, it shows how all that these souls want to make sure that in the end they are able to go home.freedom and a movie such as this one is here to show us, maybe not accurately, how they go about their daily lives on the battlefield.

B001QOGYFO|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie \\"Whiteout\\" that is filled with mystery and action, as did my family. It starts with a story a bit similar to a few other movies but keeps you guessing each minute as to who or what the bad guys are.  This movie filled with suspense and action is a favorite of ours.  Well written screenplay and the actors are very believable in their character rolls and portral. The twists and turns leave you wanting more and the ending may surprise most of you. If you like action, mystery, suspense and a sound script with great acting, watch \\"Whitout.\\"    Satisfied Carol in Virginia USA
B0036EH3XE|5.0|The last season, as well as the ending itself, resonated not only with other themes, symbols, and motifs within the show itself, but with major literary and religious works.  The show was, from the beginning, made to entertain and instruct people with a little bit of education about the serious struggles of life itself.  If you don't have that education, or at least some experience reading canonical books with depth (literary, scientific, philosophical, religious), you will only see the show as a mish-mash and think there was nothing there to see simply because you have no eyes to see them.  You may even think that those who defend the show don't see anything either, and only defend it out of some fan-boyish tendency the way other lesser shows are defended.      This is just not the case.  The quality of \\"Lost\\" overall, as well as the last season, can be easily defended on literary grounds, most heavily relying on a mythological context.  Some large portion of today's audience, however, needs \\"answers\\" distilled down to some catchphrase, or something so simple that it makes the journey of the story pointless--and the journey cannot be pointless (\\"meaningless\\" in the Adversary's final words; the journey is not only theirs in the story, but our wider journey as humans in life).  Clearly some think the answers given made the story pointless, but those were the only kind of answers we could have gotten given the scope of the questions.  What are the numbers? The Valenzetti equation.  But what are the numbers?  Uh, they correspond to our losties who are candidates.  But WHAT are the numbers?  A sign of Jacob's influence on the world akin to the way other constants, such as pi, are found throughout nature in many different contexts.  But WHAT are the numbers?  A symbol of our interconnectedness as human beings, how our experiences overlap and are often very similar thematically and emotionally which tells us \\"we're in this together\\".  But WHAT are the numbers?  Then theysay, \\"See? You didn't answer the question.\\"  They want an answer that isn't possible for the writers to write, an answer that literally cannot exist hypothetically (in an imaginary world) or in reality, an answer that is so simple a child would say \\"ah-ha\\" and wander away to play outside.  There literally could be no bottom line, drop-dead answer (imaginary or real) to \\"what are the numbers\\" that would make the story better.  It simply would have turned the entire show into a math problem, the point of which was to solve for X, and once you do that you can move on and never think of the show again.  The show was better than that.  The show was about life, and life isn't a math problem to solve for X, although it is often a mystery in a variety of ways.  The story was a story the way a great book is a story, the way the great myths of the world are stories, NOT the way a television show is a \\"story\\" (if we can call something like CSI a story).  But as such, many people watching television would have never opened the \\"book of Lost\\", had it been a book, not just for the reasons they complain about the series.  They never would have gotten past the first few pages before becoming bored and wandering away.  But at least they were exposed to something greater, something better, than everything else on television.    If you didn't like \\"Lost\\" or its final season, fine.  But at least turn off the tv and take a hike to the local library and read some of the books referenced in the show, books that contain ideas that influence every aspect of your life even as you are unaware of it.  Since \\"Lost\\" is over, there is nothing else worth watching on television, and the history of human thought awaits your discovery.  Perhaps start with some of the island books just to get your feet wet: Lord of the Flies, Mysterious Island, The Island of Dr. Moreau, Swiss Family Robinson, Robinson Crusoe, even Shakespeare's The Tempest, among dozens and dozens of others.    If you've never seen Lost, and you are moderately educated, and you don't often watch television...give disc one of season one a spin.  All you need to know about what the show is and isn't, is on that disc.  Namaste.  And good luck.

B0030IIYYS|5.0|'Toy Story' was a landmark film for Disney and animation in general. After the mediocre second film in Pixar's 'A Bugs Life', the toys decided to come back to town. Now, of course with any sequel loads of questions come pouring in as well as a great deal of skepticism. A sequel rarely lives up to its predecessor and history had shown that a great deal. While the plot was told to the fans way before the movies released, it sounded great, but no one was going to say anything until the movie hit theaters. In 1999 the world was graces with 'Toy Story 2' and did it live up to the original? The answer is yes!<br /><br />'Toy Story 2' did a great deal of things that were right on target to making a great movie. The first positive was bringing the cast back. Tom Hanks & Tim Allen reprised their roles as Woody and Buzz and just did what they did in the first movie. Of course with a new movie it means new toys. We are introduced to some great new characters that have just as an important role to play as the originals. While it may take a little time to get use to as the movie reaches it's end you are left quite satisfied. The second positive was the story its self. This new movie put these wonderful characters into a much larger situation than just hanging around in Andy's room. The toys encounter the challenges of the outside world, at least for a toy and the humor that is thrown in as well as a few movie references all worked perfectly. Of course along with the adventure side of the movie another major positive in this movie comes with a very emotional and very real message. 'Toy Story 2' introduces the fans to the concept of children growing up and leaving their toys behind. The message is summed up by the new character Jessie and a wonderful song preformed by Sarah MacLauchlan. The montage that goes with the song is just so real and somber you can't believe that this is something that ends up in a movie like Toy Story. I think that is why people of all ages love this movie. It's because of the fact that Pixar, while it has the opportunity to make a sequel, they want it to be loved by everyone. Pixar films, while they may gross millions at the box office are just filled with so much emotion and heart. Since the first 'Toy Story', there have been 10 Pixar films added to the library and so many people love them, quote them and even own them. Each one is such a great film and filled with so much that people appreciate and it's because of the thought and heart that is added to each distinct film is why they are appreciated as much as they are.<br /><br />'Toy Story 2', now that the third and hopefully final installment has been added, is probably the weakest of the 3 films. Still, it is not to say that 2 is a bad film. It's probably because of the fact that 'Toy Story 2' was just a little larger and deeper and it takes just a bit of time to get use to. Once you have seen the final installment, you will find out just how important this film is to the saga and it will make you appreciate it so much more. I enjoyed 'Toy Story 2' so much and would recommend it to anyone young or old.because of the fact that Pixar, while it has the opportunity to make a sequel, they want it to be loved by everyone.

B00275EGWY|5.0|This was a movie I had definitely decided I didn't want to see.  I hate war movies and action films. But by mistake, I went to the wrong movie theater and this was playing so I went in.  I have never been so on the edge of my seat and sweating so much.  Most action films really are completely boring - you know who's going to come out the winner.  Here, you never know what is going to happen.  The sound track augmented the tension.  Was the cell phone just a cell phone? The silences of the film were nerve wracking.  And the characters, especially, the character played by Renner, were unique but completely believable.  The scene in the supermarket, when he is faced with the overwhelming selection of breakfast cereals told you more about why he signed up again that anything. This was definitely the best film of the year.
0385523904|5.0|Barbara Demick's \\"Nothing to Envy\\" is a fascinating book.  I would almost go as far as to call it thrilling.  More thrilling than any spy novel could hope to invent.  In depicting the 'ordinary lives' led by a half dozen residents of the the far north city of Chongjin, Ms. Demick has constructed the most extraordinary of tales.  That's because being an 'ordinary' North Korean during the increasingly desperate and dire days of the 1990s makes these lives anything but ordinary.<br /><br />She meets each of the six in South Korea where she was serving as the Korean bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times.  [She's now serving the same role in Beijing.]  In her role, she meets with a series of North Korean defectors, but she wisely decides on to focus on six from Chongjin.  This is a smart choice for the development of the book.  Life is quite a bit different outside of Pyongyang.  When food gets short, those differences between the capital and this northern city become more pronounced.  As the 90s pass, what passes for an 'ordinary live' consists of hunger, joblessness, starvation, desperation and - increasingly - death.  Each of the six loses family members from a famine that - during its three-year peak - is estimated to have killed as many as two million.<br /><br />Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-Il are merely backdrop in Demick's reconstruction of her protagonists' lives in North Korea.  In fact, what strikes you is the sheer lack of information, direction and leadership that come from these two as the country quickly collapses and falls into itself.  The citizens are left to fend for themselves.  During this time, the Kims still practiced the fear-mongering, absolute control, hysteria and brinkmanship that are the hallmarks of their regime.  But in terms of guiding its ordinary citizens, forget it.  They're left to fend for themselves.<br /><br />What unites the defectors - indeed, why they are defectors - is that they either found out or otherwise surmised that the party line they're fed by their leaders - they have 'nothing to envy in this world' - is entirely untrue.  In one case, it's the discovery that Chinese dogs eat better than North Korean people.  In another, it's a picture glimpsed of an 'ordinary' South Korean - the sharp NK observer spots a ballpoint pen and a zipper...unheard of luxuries in Chongjin.  In yet another case, it's a look at an automated rice cooker....or a simple American nail-clipper.  In each case, that little hint tells these individuals what they've no doubt feared in their hearts: that the equality of their country, that they have 'nothing to envy,' is not reality.<br /><br />Not all the defectors have met with success and happiness in South Korea.  And who can blame them?  Who amongst us wouldn't be overwhelmed from such a jarring transition, going from the 'Hermit Kingdom' to one of the world's most technologically advanced societies?  In some of the cases, Demick's tale is a bittersweet one.  But the overall effect is still one of triumph, both in Ms. Demick's superb retelling and in the strength of these survivors.their leaders - they have 'nothing to envy in this world' - is entirely untrue.

Pick it up, it's entertaining, and full of detail. You really can get a feel for the landscape of the country, political situation, violence between tribes, and the way life was in Somalia in the 1990s. Also a great book for men to read, as it has interesting, historical, and cultural information as well. This is not just a book written by a feminist. It's a book for all to read.

Here you have three 20 minutes workouts sessions, level 1 - 2 and 3. Each workout has 3 different 3-2-1 minutes circuits. 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute abs. She reaches for the main group of muscles, legs, abs, arms, shoulders, waist, and upper back. For the cardio part, she mainly uses jumping jacks, and all sorts of jumps. For the strength she goes heavy on squats, lunges, pushups, biceps and shoulders. For abs she uses crunches and reverse cunches. Each level increases progressively. I have 8 pounds to loose and I was pretty much out of shape when I started. I achieve to decrease my body fat level from 31.4 to 29.4% in 30 days of non-stop training (I am wishing for 22% level of fat) but I actually put on 2 pounds. I guess it's due to the muscles that I built up, since muscles are heavier than fat. I couldn't tell that I felt my muscles the day after the workout eventhough I pushed myself full force. I enjoyed the fact that it only last 20 minutes and I enjoyed sweating all the way. I knew I could not keep up with a 1 hour cardio and strength workout at this stage and I was happy to have purchased this tough 20 minutes workouts. It has proven to be effective and, for the price, it's really worth it. However on the long-term use I will change my routine. Firstly I want to do 1 to 2 hours workout a day and I want to do a different type of workout everyday. I want a workout that also reaches smaller muscles group. I want definition, long and lean muscles strength and flexibility. Also, I do not want to bulk up, as this is a typical bulk up workout. I do not want to kill my knees and joints with constant high impact jumps. The workout itself is not really creative, it's really about basics and for a lover of workouts like me, I seek for a little more sophistication. Jillian is great and fully committed to the results, trust she won't let you down. She might sound a little manly but it's her way. I bought two Jillian's workouts at once, but I most probably won't buy anymore of Jillian's workout as I'm seeking for a different style of workouts.
0525421580|4.0|One line review: Will Grayson, Will Grayson was a fabulous book, but...<br /><br />The Good: Will Grayson, Will Grayson is a book that will stay in my head for a long time. John Green and David Levithan created two boys I related to, felt for, and liked. John's Will Grayson is a pretty typical teenage boy. He's prefers to be in the background, stay as detached from people as possible, and is unsure of who he is or what he wants. David's Will Grayson is a depressed, in-the-closet gay teenager for whom nothing seems to go quite right. The Will Graysons meet randomly one night in Chicago and their lives become quickly linked. The link becomes Tiny Cooper, John's Will's best friend, a physically gigantic, joyful, emotion-ful, gay teenager. Tiny brings David's Will out of the closet with a whirlwind romance. Tiny tries to bring John's Will more into the center of life - hooking him up with girls, making him a vaguely disguised character in Tiny's musical, etc.<br /><br />WG, WG is the first book in awhile where I wanted to write down quotes because they were just so insightful or meaningful Most of these quotes come from John's Will, my favorite character. He is basically a male version of myself. One paragraph that particularly affected me: \\"The part I enjoy most is not the doing, but the noticing...I just want the pleasure of noticing these things at a safe distance - I don't want to have to acknowledge that I am noticing. I don't want to talk about it or do stuff about it.\\" David's Will is also a great character. I didn't always like being in his head, because he's always so miserable. I liked him in spite of himself. His feelings are so raw throughout the book that I kept wanting to reach into the pages and hug him. And slap anyone who hurt him in any way. Many reviewers thought Tiny Cooper was the best character in the book. Tiny is a fabulous literary character - he basically functions as the back-bone of the book - but if he was real, he would drive me up the wall. He is a fixer - he constantly meddles in people's lives and tries to make them happy. He seemingly loves people's \\"need\\" more than he loves people themselves.<br /><br />Another thing I loved about WG, WG are the parents. John's Will comes from a unique family in the YA realm: he has two happy, mentally-healthy parents who adore him. The stereotypical \\"traditional family\\" is quite the minority in YA lit; it's nice to see it represented occasionally. I love that John's Will's parents spend time with him and try to understand him. When he has a bad day at school, his dad comes home from work just to be with him. And the mother of David's Will is just as wonderful. She loves her son and hates seeing him so unhappy. She is someone that Will can and does rely upon for advice and consolation. When he comes out to her, she doesn't even blink. Instead, she welcomes Tiny into their home and cook dinner.<br /><br />The bad: I had so much trouble getting through this book. This happens sometimes with more literary novels: I appreciate the book but don't always enjoy it. I actually did enjoy this book. Every page made me stop and think, smile and laugh, or cry and despair. But despite that, I had to force myself to read each chapter for the first half of the book. The second half was, thankfully, much harder to put down. Part of the difficulty, I think, was due to David's Will. He's in so much pain and is so bitter that his chapters were hard to read. But I can't completely put a finger on why I struggled so much. I am very happy that I stuck with the book. It was a memorable, enjoyable, thoughtful read.- he constantly meddles in people's lives and tries to make them happy. He seemingly loves people's \\"need\\" more than he loves people themselves.

B0039TD7PY|5.0|[[ASIN:B0039TD7PY Live At The Troubadour [CD / DVD Combo]]]  We are so pleased with this DVD / CD combo of Carole King and James Taylor. We recently attended their Troubadour Reunion Tour concert in Christchurch,  New Zealand - this DVD/CD reflected the same warmth and relaxed performance that we enjoyed so much at the concert. It is also great to have a permanent record of the band - especially to see again one of our favourite artists - Lee Sklar - on bass.
B003T70B46|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of Scissor Sisters, finding their albums somewhat inconsistent meshing incredible musical moments with some forgettable filler. This is the first Sisters album that I enjoy from start to finish, as it takes you on a beat filled journey through club sounds of the 70's  and 80's.    Highlights here are:  Invisible Light: an epic 80's dance epic  Any Which Way: a naughty disco romp with hilarious lyrics  Sex and Violence: sounds like Bronski Beat or a really good old Pet Shop Boys song, dark with a great beat.  Fire With Fire: the most mainstream tune here, slightly out of place, but a fantastic smile inducing anthem  Skin Tight: another upbeat poppy number that soars much like Fire With Fire.  Running Out: reminds me of My Sharona, fun synths with handclaps and a chorus that really kills    There is not a bad track on this album and while I can see how people think it is \\"gay\\" it still will appeal to a wide audience with its genius hooks and melodies.
B002M9WW30|5.0|After shopping around - Amazon.com had the best price for the entire 6 disc set of Rocky movies.  Being my first BluRay purchase I was very nervous.  I received the movies quickly and immediately had a \\"Rocky Night\\".  I was extremely happy with the quality of picture, especially from old movies - very clear not grainy.  Even my teenagers, who are more up to date on technology stuff, commented on the great picture quality.  If you are a Rocky fan or know of one and are looking for a gift - this is it!  All 6 discs come in one box with the \\"flip\\" pages (one disc per plastic page that you flip over to the next disc).
B000UH8BTK|5.0|This little box of mini LPs on CD contains # 2,3,4,6 &9 in the catalog @<$4 bucks per disc. No frills(you'll need a magnifying glass to read the original liners),and,in a couple of cases,since the original LPs had most of the credits on the inner sleeve,lots of info is missing. The web link for the liners evidently only covers US releases,as this EU release does not show up as of 2010. But between that mag glass and the internet,you can probably piece together the information. It is strange that the Weather Report catalog has had such a mixed life in the CD era. If only for the argument that Sony really attacked the Miles Davis catalog with multiple deluxe boxes(with assistance from Mosaic Records)and eventually a \\"complete\\" 71 CD mother box,you would think that this \\"sons of Miles' electric era\\" would have at least a prodigal child treatment rather than bastard son status. Take the second US release,\\"I Sing the Body Electric\\". Half of this release was an edited version of a Japan release,\\"Live in Tokyo,1972.\\" The Tokyo album was a  pretty audacious move as the band had only been together for a short time and only one studio album under its' belt. Sure,this album made it's way stateside for hardcore fans,but the general public was given only a taste in \\"I Sing\\". Why didn't Columbia exploit the Tokyo album during the CD golden era? One possible reason was the original length of the Tokyo album was 88 minutes,demanding a two disc CD set and higher costs. Columbia had released the band's sole live release,\\"8:30\\"(itself a mix of studio and live material)by lopping of a track with mixed results. And evidently the idea of a Tokyo,'72 album with additional tracks that could justify the additional price to the listener was not an option. Pity,as the tasting of the live stuff on \\"I Sing\\" always left fans with wanting more. But this band was moving fast,changing personnel and finding its' voice. That was part of the fun. Joe,Wayne & Co. always brought something cool to the table. And you'll get plenty of that here. I only wish there was a complete pre-Jaco era box available. I loved the Jaco era,but this band changed dramatically with him and having the earlier stuff separate to examine would have been the way to go.Bottom line:5 albums under $20 bucks. A little Jaco(parts of \\"Black Market\\" and all of \\"Night Passage\\")and a huge chunk of what this band was all about. This band begs for proper catalog treatment and a detailed book before it's history is lost.
B000HWZ5WE|5.0|I have loved this album since it first came out on vinyl. A group of musicians of this caliber does not come together often enough. Enjoy.
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|This case is well made with good padding at a very reasonable price.  I bought it for my Flip Camera which only comes with a little light weight sack.  I also can use it for my pocket size Sony so universal is a good description.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|This is actually the only studio Petty CD I own, purchased partly because of a stellar recent Saturday Night live performance. I have the excellent 4-CD Live Anthology as well.    The album encompasses all of the band's usual styles, and adds a few more. All of the instruments used were notated for gear buffs. The recording quality and mastering are spectacular (not all CDs can say the same, unfortunately, even today). \\"I Should Have Known It\\" is the best Led Zeppelin song that LZ never wrote, and there are no weak cuts.    The real eye-opener is Mike Campbell's playing; he was always a very good journeyman guitarist, but here he's unbelievable. There are a few solos that give Clapton a serious run for his money, and you may be as surprised reading that as I am that I'm writing it  :)  An added bonus is absolutely beautiful packaging with an original '60s-type Reprise label.    A veteran band that never stopped practicing. Enjoy.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|The third installment of the vampire movie series, Twilight Saga:  Eclipse returns where the New Moon left off.  Tensions have now mounted between the three main characters Bella (Kristen Stewart), Edward (Robert Pattinson), and Jacob (Taylor Lautner).  As viewers will see the differing relationships have escalated to enormous heights in the form of the love triangle that trickles within the other subplots and characters of the film, the rise of the gang-like vampires the \\"new borns,\\" and the continuing problem that arose during the second film that involved the Volturi, the royal element to the vampire hierarchy who are easily identifiable with their cloaks, blood-red eyes, and somewhat sinister presence.<br /><br />But for the most part, the majority of the scenes in Eclipse involve the unique quality of vampire romance and the entanglement that Bella has gotten herself into between Edward and Jacob.  There is no denying that the competitiveness exists with the characters that come in the form of a combination of tongue in cheek and snide remarks from Edward and Jacob, but throughout the ordeal, Edward has the advantage because he has the power to read Bella and Jacob's mind as well as play mind tricks on anyone he encounters.  But as with the first and second films, Edward represents chivalry and virtuous traits of a by gone era, and emphatically tells Bella, \\"when things were less complicated.\\"  And the other interesting aspects of the film that attempts to introduce two other members of the film associated with the Cullen clan and their ties to their vampire origins that also involved romantic issues, Jasper Hale (Jackson Rathbone), a Texas Cavalry officer during the Civil War who fell for the beautiful Vampiress (Monique Ganderton) and Rosalie Hale (Nikki Reed) who after a bad romance, has become an overprotective and vengeful vampire when anyone crosses her path.  These themes and issues are essential and show what may be in store for Bella if and when she enters the vampire realm.<br /><br />In spite of the hype and the mania that has accompanied the film, Eclipse is entertaining and enlightening.  The characters may or may not grow on viewers, but with all of the action packed scenes and the beautiful landscapes, there is bound to be a part of the film that will entice viewers.vampire realm.

It was wonderful, he brought all the characters to life and now I'm thinking I need to read Georgette Heyer.
0375836675|5.0|I have been reading other reviews of this book that say the ending is terrible. I agree, however the goods of this book heavily outweigh the bad and random ending. Some have said that Ed's missions were too easy and wouldnt really be lifechanging. I am a younger reader and maybe thats how it seems to those in the older crowd, but i thought his missions were touching and well thought out. They might not have gone as smoothly in reality, but Marcuz Zusak provided great entertainment for me and i was sad when the book ended (however confusing the ending may be). I would recommend this book to adventure-with-a-little-bit-of-mystery lovers. No one under maybe, eighth or seventh grade should read this book because it envoloves some touchy subjects that may not be appropriate for the younger crowd. This is a great book that i really enjoyed reading!!!

B002VECM6S|1.0|Sure this was a feel good movie. The story of the football star is also remarkable, but seemingly far fetched in this representation. It makes the main character seem stupid. It also makes it seem like once the family took him in that it was easy to adjust and just starting living a perfect life. I struggle to believe it. Academy award Sandra? She played a role that anyone would be a shoe in. She saves the day
B003J7HOKU|3.0|It was the summer of 2008 when a friend of mine introduced me to Parkway Drive's phenomenal second album, Horizons. I was immediately taken aback by its one-two combo attack of brutality and clearly technical musicianship. It was, at once, a definitively heavy album, while bringing with it a pervasive musicianship that is rarely seen within the genre many label \\"metalcore\\". The album has an epic sense, along with strong lyrics backed by equally impressive instrument work. It truly felt like a story, with a beginning, middle, and end. Parkway Drive scaled the summit of the modern metal scene with these haunting, beautiful melodies and breakdowns that put them in a unique place. I doubt I'll ever come across a closing track as vast and sobering as \\"Horizons\\".     \\"Deep Blue\\", while having moments of this refreshing musicianship and technicality, seems to stop short of what could have been the next grand chapter in the Parkway Drive storyline. The album does shine in some aspects, however; the lyrics are incredible. Everyone in the band seems to have a definite grasp over their instruments, as tracks \\"Sleepwalker\\", \\"Karma\\", and \\"Home is for the Heartless\\" will inevitably tell the listener.     Unfortunately, nearly every song is riddled with a breakdown. Breakdowns are satisfying and cathartic when used tastefully, but all I could think of was bands like Limp Bizkit after continually hearing the pounding of the bass drums and open-chord, palm-muted growls of the guitar. It just gets a bit boring. Thankfully, there are a few excellent riffs in the album, as noted in the tracks above, but they tend to get lost in the stagnant mixing and same-y sound of the tracks.     I'm a bit disappointed, because Parkway Drive was so able to create a sonic landscape of grand proportion with their previous work. This album is heavy, no doubt about it, but it lacks the very technicality and musicianship that the band is CLEARLY capable of. Certain tracks from Deep Blue will undoubtedlyfind their way onto my playlists, but overall, it doesn't come close to what Parkway Drive achieved with Horizons. It feels as if this should have been one of their FIRST albums, as the natural progression of their sound would suggest.     In my humble opinion.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|This is some of the best music that Mike Oldfield has ever put out. Being a big fan of the TUBULAR BELLS Trilogy, it's nice to hear a bit of that style coming through on \\"Harbinger\\", the opening track. The remaining songs are gorgeous mixes of classical and new age, the latter a genre that Oldfield helped pioneer. Whilst there are prog-rock touches on this album, it's all done with subtlety and delicate touches, it's not overblown or pompous. And being a Kiwi, I'm delighted that he chose Hayley Westenra, from my hometown, to sing on \\"On My Heart\\". This album is almost like a forgotten soundtrack to a movie, one wonders why Oldfield doesn't do more soundtrack work, this is better in my estimation than, say, Vangelis, it's very accessible without being sappy. I've enjoyed several of the more recent Oldfield albums, particularly Tres Lunas and Light And Shade, Oldfield has been pretty consistent in the last few years. Here's hoping he can maintain the creative spark that he's certainly shown on this album. Recommended
0060012234|2.0|I am a 22 year old college student and have an obsession with YA fiction. I don't really understand it either, but I think they're really great stories to tell, regardless of what age you are. In the last year I have been focusing mainly on gay fiction. Reading things like the \\"Rainbow Boys\\" series, and \\"Hero,\\" among several others, I decided to pick up \\"Geography Club\\" because of how well reviewed it had been.   Let me tell you: I think I see what Hartinger was going for, but he didn't really do a very good job. I was constantly waiting for a moment where the story went somewhere or I could see some extended period of conflict. However, it felt safe, much like a half hour sitcom where, even when faced with adversity, you never feel any imminent danger for any of the characters. You knew everything would turn out all right. My other major complaint was that the kids felt extremely unrealistic. It wasn't so long ago that I was the same age of the characters, and they read more like how an adult thinks a teenager would be at that age. Everything became incredibly too easy. For example with the story, I thought it was weird that this closeted, popular jock would meet someone on the internet that he might know from school. That was one of the first issues I had.  I don't see the same thing I guess that other people did. I was really disappointed in this book.
B0025KW29U|4.0|Dr. Horrible is a musical form Joss Wheadon, the creator of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" \\"Angel\\" and \\"Firefly\\" It's the story of Billy, aka \\"Dr. Horrible\\"(Neil Patrick Harris) a low level super villain with dreams of making it big, while trying to win the girl of his dreams. It's hard to not side with the Doctor as he plots against his nemesis,Capt. Hammer (Nathan Fillion) while trying to win the love of the girl of his dreams, Penny (Felicia Day). The music is good, and the songs are catchy, and reminds me of Joss's last musical, the Buffy episode \\"Once More, with Feeling\\".  The only thing I didn't like about it is the fact that the actual movie itself is only about 45 minutes long, though it does leave itself open for a sequel (C'mon Joss, we NEED a sequel). While some die hard musical fans may not like it, I'd recommend this movie to anyone who's a Joss Wheadon fan.

Watching this is as close up as a fan get get without being on stage. Since he changed set lists at every show on the recent tour, this compilation has some fine versions of oldies and new ones.<br />If he includes the full concert version of the \\"Darkness\\" album when the anniversary set is released later this year, I'll be satisfied.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|A mysterious figure named Thomas Gabriel in charge of a team of paramilitary cybercriminals finds a way to entice the world's best hackers to invoke a Fire Sale - an attack on the country's transportation, finance, then public works (what I like to call the Monopoly strategy) - in order to unleash his insidious master plan.  It's up to John McClane (Bruce Willis) to save the country, drop F-bombs, take a beating, and pick up Jedi hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), the primary person responsible for making the Fire Sale possible.<br /><br />The flaws for this film are similar to Eagle Eye; there just happens to be too much nick-of-time, skin-of-the-teeth, missed by an inch fortune.  It's completely unfathomable, entirely impossible - regardless of how much background information is given on the genius and employment history of the primary antagonist - for a hacker, or team of hackers, to take over the entire Internet, telecommunication, DHS, NSA, FBI, CIA, and major power grids - evidently controlled by a Commodore 64 and administered by Windows ME - and even imagine the type of scheme attempted by Gabriel and his team, one of whom is the world's only Asian model/ninja/stunt-woman/computer hacker and another left Cirque De Soliel for a life of crime.  Despite the plot which left me incredulous, I thoroughly enjoyed Die Hard 4 because it's about action, not mundane reality.<br /><br />The acting from all three leads is top notch, as expected.  And why wouldn't it be?  Bruce Willis actually looks like a tough guy; Justin Long whines like a Jolt Cola drinking, World of Warcraft playing, basement dweller; and Timothy Olyphant cuts his eyes as a criminal mastermind like with the best of'em.<br /><br />The stunts are amazing.  Jets, trucks, and helicopters; mutilations, boxing, beatings, martial arts, and stair-diving; dorm room explosions, tunnel explosions, overpass explosions; it's the kitchen sink approach to action.<br /><br />If you need to be sold on this, you're probably in the wrong area.  Break out the popcorn and your suspension of disbelief, because Willis makes a triumphant return as McClane.  Yippee-ki-yay!!out the popcorn and your suspension of disbelief, because Willis makes a triumphant return as McClane.  Yippee-ki-yay!!

0385341008|4.0|What more can I say about this book? Except pick it up and read it. Is it the greatest book you will ever read? I personally don't think so, But and easy read with a wonderful story and characters is what awaits you as you open up the pages.<br /><br />This book is written as a series of letters between author Juliet Ashton and the members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society (with Juliet's publisher, some friends and her boyfriend thrown in for good measure). The German invasion after the war is over and the members of the society are trying to get their lives back together when one of their members decides to write to Juliet to tell her of a book he came across that once belonged to her. This begins a story that unfolds through each life of the member of the society, and how Juliet reacts to their letters.<br /><br />Extremely well written and easy to read, this book will be hard to put down. Each character is extremely well written, even if they only have a small part in the book. And, to read what these people went through during the war makes me realize again how lucky I am to be an American, and too young to have lived through anything of this magnitude.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|if you saw Day After Tomorrow you will like this movie.  the plane ride in the beginning is amazing and the whole movie is basically the same afterwards.  anyways, i still like day after tomorrow better because it has a better storyline.  all in all, the movies are very much alike.  was going to rate it 3 stars, but the plane ride in the beginning has it's own star.

0061743526|3.0|I purchased this book for my daughter's 16th birthday. She read this book in school and enjoyed it immensely. I was extremely excited to get it for her, she loves literature. I felt good about getting her the book as an investment in her education and her cultural future, something she could pass on to her children. When I opened the package upon arrival I was quickly disappointed in the quality of the pages. All the ends, opposite of the binding were cut unevenly. It is impossible to fan through the pages! The pages appear to have been cut before they were bound together. I gave it to her and she was happy to have it, but I felt a little ashamed.
0764169742|5.0|If like me, drawing is your preferred medium and you love botanical art then this is the book you've been waiting for. There are many books on botanical illustration out there but none that are devoted to working solely with graphite and colored pencil. At most, you may get a chapter and one demonstration in the other books, but nothing this comprehensive. I only wish the book was longer, with more demonstrations and examples of other colored pencil artists' works. But having said that, I found the book extremely informative about the nuts and bolts of doing botanical art with colored pencils. If you've read other colored pencil how-to books you may be familiar with a lot of the basics, and if you've read how-to books on botanical art you're familiar with those basics, but it was nice bringing the two subjects together in one book. Her explanations are clear and easy to follow and understand, and the artwork is gorgeous. Colored pencil has taken a bit of back seat to watercolor in the field of botanical illustration, but this book shows that it certainly doesn't have to. Definitely inspiring. I really enjoyed it and thought it was well worth the money.

B000059XUT|5.0|Toy Story is one hour and twenty minutes and was released in theaters on November 22, 1995. Basically it is a story between an old toy versus a new toy. Woody is an old fashion pull string cowboy toy that is Andy's favorite toy. Woody is the leader of all of the other toys in Andy's room. The film opens on Andy's birthday and Woody sends Sarge and the Bucket 'O' Soldiers on a reconnaissance mission to spy on the birthday party so the other toys can calm down. They go through the whole stack presents and they come down to the last one that Andy's mom hid in a closet. Sarge is unable to see what it is due to the kids gathering around it. The kids and Andy head to his room to play, but in a few moments later are called away and the new toy is left in his room. Woody climbs to the bed to see the new toy. Woody discovers that Andy got a Buzz Lightyear action figure. Buzz does not realize he is just a toy and believes that he has crash landed on an alien planet.

B0015DYIH2|1.0|I have no words to say except this story my friend told me. She went out and bought Breaking Dawn for $40 went home read the first chapter and the other chapter titles and threw it away.
B002ZG997M|4.0|This movie looks & sounds excellent on blu ray, very clean, sharp, & crisp, and the audio, gunfires & explosions can really shake your walls if you have it at the right volume, the dialog is very clean & clear as well, Denzel & Gary are terrific as usual and the supporting casts as well, this movie got the looks, feel & atmosphere of Mad Max but without the fast cars, if you're a big D.W. fan like myself, then you should add this blu ray to your movie library, ENJOY !!!
0312243022|4.0|While this book didn't grab me at first, I soon came to love reading it.  This book dealt with three characters--Virginia Woolf (who was in the process of writing \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\"), Clarissa (who is living in the present time and who is called Mrs. Dalloway by her best friend), and Mrs. Brown (who lives in the 1940s and is reading \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\").   Each chapter is given the heading of the character writing it.  I loved how everything in the story from the text, to the characters, to the thoughts were intertwined and how everything was linked by Virginia Woolf's book.
0446402397|5.0|Excellent writing and thought process----a delight to read.  This is a political thriller that is hard to put down.  My husband, who has not read for years, read it after me and now he reads more than I do!  The story is tightly wound and totally believable---the setting is in Russia during the Stalin years.  People are guarded and suspicious of nearly everyone.  The party is everything, but is there one man left with a moral compasss?  Find out for yourself, if this man can discover who killed innocents randomly and senselessly,----is it someone in the party?  A party he is a part of, which makes it much more dangerous for him , his family and his wife---
0143036556|4.0|The famous author of Guns, Germs, and Steel returned in 2005 to further explore ancient and modern civilization with Collapse.  The first book explored civilizations in the context of how environment and geography affected human activity and development.  Collapse explored deeper how human activity development affected environment.  Through his other writings, Diamond gained a reputation for being an \\"environmental determinist,\\" in which he inferred that humanity is essentially helpless and beholden to its environs.  Evidently, I was not the only person who held this perception. Diamond addressed this very early in the book.  He explained that climate and ecology is probably the largest determinant of civilization, but that humanity can play a major role - positive or negative - in shaping its ecology.      Diamond relayed several ecological collapses in throughout Earth's history.  And, he interwove a few success stories just to reinforce the notion that there is still hope for humanity.  Numerous societies in the Pacific Rim, South America, Africa, Asia, Northern Europe, and the southwestern United States, among others, destroyed their environments, and, ultimately, their societies through poor resource management.  However, some civilizations including medieval Japan and Iceland found ways to adapt and thrive by adopting sustainable resource management; sometimes through cooperative ventures of mutual benefit; and other times through governmental fiat.      Diamond notes five primary themes that affect all societal collapses to varying degrees.  One refreshing aspect of Diamond's Collapse is that Diamond does not fall into what I call the \\"naturalist trap.\\"  In other words, he notes with painstaking evidence that simpler, non-modern cultures are just as capable of destroying the environment as modern, first-world nations with automobiles and plastics.  Technology, in and of itself, is not inherently a detriment.  In fact, with proper application it can be beneficial to the environment - although Diamond does not explicitly raise the latter point.    Some of the parallels are striking, nonetheless.  The primary themes of deforestation, war, and regionalization, mass emigration, and unsustainable growth are difficult to ignore in either the ancient or the modern contexts.  Not every example is perfectly analogous to the 21st century.  But, there are certainly enough correlations to offer pointed reflection.  Near the end of the book, Diamond notes that most problems \\"will get resolved one way or another.\\"  Sometimes humanity reacts in positive and sustainable improvements.  Sometimes, resolution is achieved only through war, famine, and widespread death.      Diamond's anthropological journey provides enough insight to make even the greatest environment skeptics ponder our current consumption rates in first-world, 21st Century civilization.  Diamond notes throughout that few of the societal collapses were sudden.  Seldom was there an \\"A-ha\\" moment in which the last member of a society realized that he was cutting down the last tree in the regional ecosystem.  Nonetheless, collpase did come to many civilizations gradually.  Most did not realize the changes until it was too late.  And, similar fates may await us if we do not change our practices and lifestyles.  For this reason, I was a bit puzzled by Diamond's somewhat alarmist tone toward the conclusion of the book.  Yes, change is a-coming; but are we really doomed in the next 30 years?    Collapse provided this environmental skeptic with new insight to the manners by which we act as caretakers of our environment.

0156027321|3.0|You have to be really interested in zoos or really want to force yourself to believe in the literary judgement of the Man Booker Prize committee to like \\"Life of Pi.\\"     The best part of the book is its prologue, where the author writes with sparkling prose a purely fictitious introduction to how he came to write the book \\"Life of Pi.\\"  From then on, while the prose stays clear and sometimes poignant, the story descends into absurdity.  Absurdity is often amusing (\\"Family Guy\\" and \\"Fight Club\\" are both good examples), but it's not so amusing in \\"Life of Pi.\\"
B00G0OHMUG|1.0|Predator remains the premier action film of any era. It now looks like low bitrate HD video without any grain at all. This film was ultra grainy before and quite detailed. It has had two releases and each is terrible. The first was MPEG-2 coded and low bitrate. The second.... well the second was a gift from the devil.<br /><br />They have used digital noise reduction to the lengths where it has totally destroyed the film grain, and hence the film itself, and made textures which should be very sharp very waxy instead. That is not an understatement in any way. It appears these companies are going to double dip yet again when the film is rerereleased with a new transfer at 4K or 4K ready. I sure hope they do not mess with the film elements if and when they choose to give this classic action release a definitive transfer.<br /><br />The 3D release, which includes yet another terrible 2D version, has made its way to Bluray as yet another cash-in, using the same exact transfer as the hideous Ultimate Hunter Edition version. Stay away if you value film. This is up there with Patton as one of THE WORST Bluray transfers ever. Stay far far away from this garbage.
B003ELOQD4|1.0|this is not high definition. I repeat this is not high definition!! well, for live show production, U2 did they're ever doing: Stunning. But for blu-ray product,this is big failed! The quality of video is pretty terrible, like taken from 90's camera.

0307474712|4.0|\\"One Day\\" deserves to be the \\"it\\" book of the summer.  By dropping in on his characters Emma and Dexter for one specific day, July 15th, over the course of twenty years, David Nicholls creates slices of life that are both detailed and broad.    This structure really worked for me and made me want to keep reading, since each chapter advanced the story in a significant way.  Nicholls did a great job of propelling us into the middle of a new situation with each chapter, and I felt he only cheated once, in the year 2000, with some (understandable) back pedaling to fill in events from earlier that year.  The book's chapters are grouped into four sections, \\"Early Twenties\\" through \\"Late Thirties,\\" and I only wish I had paced myself differently, so that I read all of \\"Late Thirties\\" to the end in one uninterrupted session.    Like Tom Perrotta's [[ASIN:B000FTWB5I Little Children]] I felt that \\"One Day\\" is a book that might have been labeled \\"chick lit\\" if written by a woman, but is received as clever, accessible literature as written by a man.  This should make us reconsider our labels!  I will put this book on my husband's summer reading table, too.    I struggled between four and five stars, which is really just a detail.  I think the two humanely flawed, relatable protagonists might be embarrassed by five-star perfection.  This is an eminently readable book, a fine character study that is both worthwhile and enjoyable.  Nicholls intertwines his characters lives over decades, and in the end, makes us as readers reflect back on how we are spending our time.
1433502410|5.0|Having used several different study Bibles and many different translations over my life, I've got to say the ESV Study Bible is by far my favorite.  The ESV translation is superb - it \\"feels\\" like NKJ (genuine, original, etc), but without all the archaic and outdated language.  I have spent most of my study time with the NIV but now have grown to prefer the rendering of sentences and context in the ESV.  It is also clearly a word-for-word translation; this makes it very helpful in studying God's Word as closely to the original text as possible.<br /><br />The study Bible portion is fantastic.  It does not seem to be biased towards one particular point of view, but instead offers the common interpretations of more 'difficult' passages.  It is also not overly seeker-friendly (as in, the harder messages are not masked or glossed over) and presents the text as matter-of-fact as possible.<br /><br />I appreciate the contributors to the ESV Study Bible pointing out that one should really spend time in prayer and seek the Holy Spirit for insight into the Word and not just rely on the commentary.  This is a critical point, and highlights the thoughtfulness and careful consideration the ESV team put into this study Bible.<br /><br />The book itself is very high-quality.  It has many color pages, and feels like it will easily handle a decade of heavy use.  It's not a \\"light\\" Bible... it's nearly 3000 pages thick!<br /><br />I'm very happy I bought this study Bible... and for the price it's a no-brainer!  If you appreciate expository, deep study of God's Word, I think you will find a lot of value in this translation.
1401302378|4.0|As the title says, this is a book that discusses how decreasing marginal costs of inventory have made it possible to offer the consumer significantly more choices.  It seems counter-intuitive that selling 4 of something a year can be profitable, yet Anderson convinces you that if you can inventory a million similar items it is.  Most interesting was his discussion on the death of the \\"hit\\", that as our choices as consumers increase there will be fewer buyers of those few most popular items.  Smartly written and easily digested, of of the funner popular economics reads I've had recently.
1401307450|5.0|if you've ever seen AK interviewed, you'll feel completely familiar with how this book reads.  the guy's not an idiotic ex-addict that writes wacky music.  he's intelligent and well aware of his personal choices and tells his story exactly how it happened.  he mentions how he knew he was f-ing up, how the bandmates were pissed at him, how he struggles with it all, he's literally brutally honest.  and respectable.  i LOVE rhcp, my favorite band of all time.  and this book was a fantastic inside look at one of the leading men (of course, Flea is the other which AK declares, another being HS and then onto frusciante) of the group and how it came to be.    a must read for any rhcp fan!
B002ZG97RY|5.0|One of the most common complaints I've read about this film is the \\"liberal agenda\\" that this film represents. I didn't know that the search for truth is exclusively a \\"liberal agenda\\" and the \\"Hollywood Elite\\" is only interested in slamming the Bush Administration and not exploring other ideas and creating solid art. Why is that such a knee-jerk reaction over films of this element? If this were an \\"anti-Obama\\" or \\"anti-Clinton\\" film, would these same people be making these claims? Of course not. I believe that time will out and this film may very well be regarded as a great film, as it should already be.<br /><br />When I first heard of Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass reteaming for a film about the current Iraq war, I was very excited since I am a HUGE fan of their previous work together. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY/ULTIMATUM are two extraordinary pieces of action filmmaking and represent the best that the techno spy thriller genre has to offer. Later hearing that it was based on a true story about the search for WMD at the beginning of the Iraq war, I was even more interested to see how Greengrass would handle such a subject. After all, Greengrass, as a filmmaker, is no stranger to the territory of this subject matter, namely the great and tragic docudrama UNITED 93.<br /><br />So while we follow Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller's (Damon, excellent as per usual) quest to find WMD and find why he keeps coming up snake-eyes for all of his and his team's efforts, and why he keeps finding himself out of the loop between the Army, the Department of Defense, and the CIA keeping him in the dark while people are dying. The film turns from Iraq War film to mystery/thriller as Miller finds himself searching for a top-secret contact code-named Magellan, who is the person providing the misleading intel about the WMD. He finds himself either paired up or at odds with a Wall Street Journal reporter (the wonderful Amy Ryan, who admittedly doesn't have a lot to do in this film) who has been reporting on the confirmation of the WMD in Iraq, the top CIA man in Iraq (a terrific Brendan Gleeson), and the two-faced face of the DOD for the Administration in Iraq (played with force and conviction by Greg Kinnear). As the hunt for Magellan becomes more intense, so does the effort to stop Miller before he gets too close to the truth (represented by an unrecognizable Jason Isaacs as a mega-tough Special Forces operative).<br /><br />Before you start to think that because Greengrass and Damon have reunited for a film that this is \\"Jason Bourne in Iraq\\", you'd be dead wrong. Roy Miller couldn't be more different than Jason Bourne. They are both men of action who are on a quest for facts and that's where the similarities end. Damon is a great actor, and he turns in another great performance here. Greengrass is a tremendously gifted director with a real eye for pacing and putting the audience in the thick of the events and action in his films. Speaking of which, can we stop whining about his \\"shaky-cam\\" action style? It works. It's intense. It won't make you throw up. End of story. The script by the great Brian Helgeland, who has scripted so many terrific films like L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, CONSPIRACY THEORY (severely underrated), MAN ON FIRE, MYSTIC RIVER (and also happens to be a very good director in his own right with A KNIGHT'S TALE, THE ORDER and PAYBACK), also turns in a tight and real script here.<br /><br />There isn't really a false move in this whole film, and it explores a fundamental flaw to something that shouldn't be ignored.<br /><br />The interesting part of this film is that it is based somewhat in fact. The character of Roy Miller is based on a real Warrant Officer who was asking many of the same questions that Miller asks. Obviously there's some dramatic license taken here, but still... why we go to war is as important as the lives that are lost during that war.<br /><br />In regards to the Blu-Ray disc, the supplemental material is pretty great and the transfer looks and sounds terrific, so I'm not sure why there have been complaints to the transfer.<br /><br />All in all, Greengrass and Damon bring us another intensely satisfying film experience, and whatever your beliefs about the Iraq war, this is a film worth viewing.so I'm not sure why there have been complaints to the transfer.     All in all, Greengrass and Damon bring us another intensely satisfying film experience, and whatever your beliefs about the Iraq war, this is a film worth viewing.
0525948023|4.0|The presentation in this book was very interesting to me, especially as a sort of idealized physical model, much like a scientific model, but geared beyond the bounds of science.  The plethora of capitalized words tells us right away that this discussion is not just \\"spiritual\\" but speculating about the supernatural, and that the author's vision includes helpful advice.  I found the book to be personally meaningful, despite some subtleties, and the elaboration of \\"structures\\", like \\"ego\\" and \\"pain body\\", that seem to be a bit nebulous.  As some one who is \\"getting on\\" in years, there is an appeal in his message about the place of older people in the scheme of things, as young people expand outward, and one finds oneself \\"diminishing\\".  The balance between \\"Being\\" and \\"doing\\", in one's \\"Presence\\" is a \\"middle way\\".  This is a book that can help one to think about spirituality in our age which is dominated by science and technology.  Certainly, this age does have its special character, and perhaps Tolle has captured some of it.  I can recommend the book from this standpoint.
0545123275|4.0|If you can get past emo teen turning everything into song lyrics behavior (one of my biggest YA lit pet peeves--shut up already, Sam!), Shiver is a beautifully-written, entrancing novel.  It's the classic tale of obsession between a human and a mythical creature whose love can never be.  Or can it?<br /><br />Not one for long and winding descriptions of feelings and emotions &aacute; la Twilight?  Then Shiver's not for you.  But if you yearn to experience the young, consuming, playful passion of something deeper than puppy love (pun intended), you will be rewarded thoroughly by the mix of suspense, danger and magic in this novel and, soon, its sequel.<br /><br />Side note: I listened to it on audiobook.  If you're like me, it may take some time to get past the fact that the female narrator sounds 10 years old and the male sounds around 40.  Still worth a listen or read.
B002ZG97RE|3.0|While the acting and action in the movie is really not all that bad, you do have to realize that Matt Damon is giving his standard role and acts accordingly.  While this is not a bad thing it is pretty formula.    And speaking of formula.   One of the reviewers noted that \\"sure, there is a liberal agenda but hey, what is wrong with that?\\"  he went on to say that those of us who find this boring and more of the same old same old from the tired old liberals in Hollywood..  well.. we wouldn't be protesting if it was the Obama or the Klinton now would we?   We wouldn't be saying a thing.    Of course we wouldn't.. our jaws would drop so fast that we wouldn't be able to speak because of a dislocated jaw.   I guess it depends on your political view.   If you are yourself a liberal then this will be yet another feel good movie for you that \\"proves\\" that the good guys are your big government and not the mean old right wing guys big government.  If you are not a liberal then you will be groaning at some point at yet another big Hollywood production with big Hollywood actors all trying to out liberal each other.
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|The blu ray version is the best yet of this classic epic movie.  A very large budget epic based on a novel. And it features the monstrous nero as played by peter ustinov as a true sociopathic madman. We do know that nero did indeed fiddle as rome burned  but he in reality didn't start the fire. However he needed scapegoats and found them in the christians. The movie has him set the city alight but who cares it's still great entertainment!  Robert taylor does a great job here as the roman commander and leo glenn as a cynical confidant of NERO is also brilliant. Deborah kerr who never had a bad performance in her life also shines as a roman slavegirl.  But back to the print , the blu ray looks alot better than a standard print but they didn't remove artifacts in some scenes. These are rare , like a few lines in the print in a few scenes and several jumps do to loss of movie frames. This should have been fixed (studios need to grasp that fact!)  but these instances are rare and mostly the flick just looks outstanding! However they did remove alot of dirt from the print, and restored the color. this is something that even more modern prints are not getting sometimes.  This movie was a major hit and it still  has a great story and great acting that makes it a great color movie to watch. In black and white spectacle and period shows unless they are film noir ,look flat and take away from the production. This is full color and it was never shot in widescreen so that's not a issue. It's at the ratio it was filmed here.  And lastly why doesn't amazon.com seperate vhs, dvd, and especially blu ray reviews?  this needs to be fixed.  This movie is a great movie that is closer to the novel that true history and that's ok because in any version of reality NERO is the antichrist. His number is 666 after all!.  So sit back and enjoy the spectacle of a expensive mgm masterpiece. With deluxe sets and top notch acting.  And the best look yet on blu ray , even if there are a few flaws they are not around too much so grab this one instead of a standard dvd. And Wb's should be applauded for the time and effort they did to restore this movie.hey are not around too much so grab this one instead of a standard dvd.

031606792X|1.0|I don't even know where to start with this book except to say, WTF? Why would Stephenie DO this to her fans. Screw that, why would she do it to her characters that she created.     I mean, okay, I'm definitely Team Jacob. He has proven himself to Bella over and over again. He has protected her on NUMEROUS occasions when Edward with could not or was no where around to. And even Bella has said over and over that Jacob KNOWS her. She doesn't have to be someone else around Jacob. But whatever, everyone loves Edward so I made my peace with the fact that her and Jacob wouldn't be together somewhere in the middle of Eclipse.    But what's disturbing is the picture that Stephenie paints for her mostly teenage girl audience is:    1. Always forgive (and completely be obsessed) with the man who breaks your heart (and leaves you for dead when he knows a crazy female vampire is out to kill you)    2. Completely ignore the nice devoted guy who saves your ass on numerous occasions and repeatedly tells you that you don't have to change anything for him. That he loves you and wants you just as you are.    3. Completely change everything you are to be with the person who has continually put you in harms way. (and apologize to him along the way) Pretend to love the cars, money, clothes, etc.    Stephenie completed obliterated all of her characters in this books. She turned Bella into a sex-crazed shell of her former self. Edward went from being a hero in Twilight to being completely pathetic and unnecessary. (I mean once again, Jacob had to swoop in and save Bella.) Charlie turned from being an involved and caring father into \\"need to know\\" absent father. Her mother Renee disappeared all together. But what she did to Jacob was by far the worse thing imaginable. I mean really? Whether you are a Jacob fan or not, most could look past his immaturity and see that he has always had Bella's back. Never lied to her, always let her be herself whatever, a stand up guy. She went and turned himinto a babysitter??? That's the best thing she could come up with to keep Jacob from loving Bella? I would rather she killed him off than waste 100 pages trying to convince me that this was an okay idea.     I could go on and on but everyone has already pointed out everything I hated about this book. It feels good to know I'm not alone.    It has literally taken me all day to get over this book. I can honestly say that I have never, EVER hated a book as much as this one. I seriously almost cried.    Stephenie should retract this book and start over. Seriously.

0143038419|5.0|I bought this book after hearing about the new movie, I am the type of person that likes to read before watching the movies. So far the book is amazing and I thought that once I recieved the book from amazon it would be in terrible condition since I bought it used, but it truly is in excellent condition. It seems as though no one has read it. Of course this is through amazon so that may be why but I'm glad I invested in buying the book.

B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|This is a wonderful take on Bram Stoker's novel DRACULA. I must admit to being a big fan of all the classic monsters, but Dracula is my favorite. If you read the novel as I have, you will find that this film pays homage to many aspects of the book. The novel was written as a series of diary entries which make their way into this script. The true stand out aspect of this Dracula story is the depth at which they explain Dracula's origin and connect him to the historical figure of Vlad the Impaler. This lays the foundation of the love story between Vlad and Mina.<br /><br />Coppola's Dracula scores high on so many levels. It is difficult to tell a tale that has been told a hundred times and be original. To the filmakers credit (director/script writer), they did it. Gary Oldman does a wonderful job and makes Dracula his own! Hopkins is always enjoyable and brings presence to the screen. The issues with this film are the casting of Reeves and Ryder. Reeves is a wooden actor who was cast in this role to attract a younger audience. He is terrible! Ryder is sweet, but doesn't have the acting chops to warrant this great love affair. The other issue is the sloppy editing. Pay attention to some of the mix ups. Example: When Lucy is meeting her suitors, you can see the Texan holding his hat throughout the scene. However, when the last suitor come in, the second suitor gets up and hands the Texan his hat back which he sat on? There are other scenes as well, but you should get the point. On first viewing you may not notice these things, but as you watch the film again and again, they stick out like sore thumbs.<br /><br />BLU RAY THOUGHTS: The 1:85:1 fills the screen, but that doesn't say much. The film is shot very dimly to match the subject matter, but the grain is just too much. Coppola absolutely intended to have this grain, I just don't have to like it. The audio mix is low and lacking. SPECIAL FEATURES: Abundant and intriguing. FINAL THOUGHTS: I have seen the DVD and the Blu Ray and can't see that much of a difference. NOT UPGRADE WORTHY (if you have the collector's edition on DVD).see that much of a difference. NOT UPGRADE WORTHY (if you have the collector's edition on DVD).
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Ozzy's new CD to me is a little bit of his old school stuff and his newer sound. Its a great ride on every track and for his age, I have to give the guy props because he shows he is still the prince of darkness.
B002XMGGJM|3.0|Clyde Shelton (Butler) is the lone survivor of a brutal home invasion in which his wife and daughter are murdered. The killers are soon caught and Nick Rice (Foxx), a hotshot prosecutor, is assigned to the case. Over Shelton's objection, Rice strikes a plea bargain with one of the suspects to testify against his accomplice. The story then flashes forward ten years. Shelton begins his revenge by killing the men who murdered his family. His plans are however much larger than that. He quickly is taken into custody and admits his guilt. Now confronted by Rice, he tells him more people will die unless he exposes the corruption in the system! Rice quickly finds himself in a cat and mouse game, where Shelton always seems two steps ahead!<br /><br />This was a good movie. Butler was excellent as always. I am not a fan of Foxx, but he was serviceable in this role. This is a great revenge tale. As a husband and father, I was rooting for Shelton all the way. However, this is not a 4 or 5 star film as some suggest. The revelations at the end of the movie are a little to far fetched and take away from the suspense that was so well put together for most of the movie. Still, it certainly is worth a watch.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: The film was sharp looking and the sound was good. This is not the type of movie that has a lot of eye candy. Most of the film takes place in dark and dingy settings. SPECIAL FEATURES: Nothing special here. Standard featurette stuff. FINAL THOUGHTS: If you are a fan of the film BLU RAY is the only way to get the UNRATED version. WORTHY OF OWNERSHIP
B00364K6YW|5.0|This new 2010  digitally restored \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is, indeed, worlds better than the previous 2001 Special Edition \\"P&P,\\" which as all of us who bought the previous DVD found out, was pretty terrible.

B002ZG98J6|4.0|My review is mainly on the audio and visual quality of the blu ray disc itself.<br /><br />First off, the picture quality is very good. It's not as striking as Avatar, but it is still good, even for blu ray. However, where this disc really shines is in the audio quality, particularly the bass (LFE). From the opening 5 minutes you can tell that you're gonna be in for a real treat. The bass is the star of the show. For those who have a capable sub, you will be rewarded with thunderous amounts of LFE throughout the whole movie. Some movies only have one or two scenes of impressive LFE, but this movie is filled with heavy amounts of LFE. In fact, this blu ray will definitely be demo material for me to show off.<br /><br />Don't worry, bass isn't the only thing that's worthy to write about. The overall surround presentation of this film is just as engaging as the LFE. Each and every battle scene (and there are plenty of them) hits you with sound from all angles. Sword swings, fireballs, and lightening bolts all attack the soundfield with heart pounding authority.<br /><br />Although the movie may not win an award for Best Picture, the audio quality of this movie will make Percy Jackson's adventure that much more enjoyable to watch, especially those with a capable sound system.
0316044695|5.0|Lone Survivor kept me up half the night.  I couldn't put this book down! I never imagined all the Navy Seals had to go through to earn their Trident, and I lived in San Diego half my life & would see them running on the beach at Coronado.  Beyond the training, the mission, and his survival, is the truth no one wants to talk about - a war with a different culture that doesn't subscribe to our \\"Rules of Engagement\\", so we are at a great disadvantage. Marcus Lutrell was in Afghanistan in 2005. Here we are in 2010 and reading today's paper, read about 2 suicide bombers killing international aid volunteers there. For those who have complained that this book has a political agenda - YES IT DOES! As well it should! Our enemies don't adhere to the Geneva Convention! They laugh at us! How many wars, how many young men; our sons, brothers, husbands, fathers, grandsons, are sent to fight wars we can't possibly win!  And all these young men are trained to obey orders & fight for their country no matter what, and they do it with pride and honr.  God bless Marcus Luttrell and all our military.  They deserve much better than what we allow them.
0679731725|3.0|An eloquently written novel concerning an English butler named Stevens. This a well crafted novel that may serve as a diversion from more typical genre.     I had not idea what this book was about. I saw it on many \\"must read\\" lists.  A novel about a very proper and stuffy English butler would seem be too prosaic to be interesting. Somehow Shiguro pulls it off.     Although the accolades for this piece of work seem overdone, a book lover with a broad palette, should enjoy this unique and well written novel.

0307454541|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Like Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vince Code\\" maybe the book was over hyped to me and thus I was mildly disappointed.<br /><br />I won't repeat the story; because it is well covered in other reviews. I did like the protaganist, Mikael Blomkvist. And like most people, I really enjoyed the quiet, intelligent, confident, punk Lisbeth Salander. Despite my disappointment with the ending of the book, I will read at least the second book in the series to spend more time with Blomkvist and Salander.<br /><br />The story kept my interest through most of the book. I just felt that the discovery of the fate of Harriet Vanger was a bit lame. Also the unsavory shenanigans of Martin Vanger and his father over such a long period of time was over the top and too incredible.<br /><br />I realize the comments are sketchy; but I don't wish to spoil the ending. Despite my disappointment with the end of the story,this book makes a good summer read.
1595825045|5.0|This book makes a great addition on the bookshelf for any Avatar: the Last Airbender fan. It goes behind the scenes of the show, illustrating several key elements to creating an animated series. It has some storyboards and, what I found really interesting, the step-by-step creation of some background elements like a Fire Nation town.    It also includes several costume and facial design sketches and much, much more. When I received this book in the mail and read through it, I was blown away. I had expected a book with some bigger shots of official art, but it wasn't just that. There are sketches and bending poses, stories about creation and the good times had by the Avatar crew members.    All in all, this is a great book. It blew my expectations way. I really enjoyed learning more about my favorite show.
B002VECM4A|5.0|This movie is sorrowfully devistating and unbelievable harsh as to the treatment to Precious. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen and will stay in my mind forever.

B000002L7Y|5.0|I love this band and this CD is their best. Incredible vocal power and keyboard arrangements. It's Pop taken to a higher level.
B000056NX5|5.0|I already know you love Jesus Christ Superstar, you wouldn't be reading otherwise.  You want to know if THIS version is worthy, and I say oh HELL yeah!  Let me state up front ( so I don't have to keep repeating myself) that I love the 1973 Norman Jewison film, (JC73 from here on)  and think it sets an incredibly high bar, that few rock musicals have ever reached. Jesus Christ Superstar 2001  (JC2K1 from here on) not only reaches the bar, but demolishes it.  It's not without it's problems, however.    Where JC73 is broad and cinematic, JC2K1 is tight, small, and theatrical, sometimes to the point of being claustrophobic. The problem with a theatrical production brought to film, is that when you have to pitch to the \\"back of the house\\", it can look melodramatic in close-up.  JC2K1 crosses that line a number of times. OTOH, there are times when the closeness and intimacy of this production are mesmerizing.    Let's get to the actor smack-down, shall we?    JESUS:  Glenn Carter is good, but I think Ted Neely owns this role.  Carter arguably has the stronger voice, but his performance stays stuck on \\"angry and frustrated\\".  Neely gives a much more subtle, restrained performance, that I  think more accurately depicts how Jesus must have felt in the final week. TED NEELY. (JC73)    JUDAS: I don't want to say a word against Carl Anderson from JC73, he is amazing.  But Jerome Pradon absolutely sold me on his performance.  Pradon definitely has the weaker voice, but his performance is so damned (literally) amazing that he now is Judas for me, forever.  JEROME PRADON. (JC2K1)    MARY MAGDALENE: No question at all.  Renee Castle is the best Mary I've ever seen, live or film. You can hear her heart bleed, with pitch-perfect passion.  I don't think anyone has done this crucial and difficult role better. RENEE CASTLE (JC2K1)    PONTIUS PILATE: My biggest dissapointment, by far, in this production.  Fred Johanson comes across as a melodramiatic \\"Snydley Whiplash\\" rather than the multi-layered, anguished mess that Barry Dennen portrayed so brilliantly. BARRY DENNEN (JC73)    HEROD: My toughest call. Josh Mostel is delicious in JC73, portraying the grossness, decadence, and fun of evil.  Rik Mayall does an equally delicious job in JC2K1, but puts a very different spin on it, highlighting the scariness of decadence.  CAN'T CALL, I LOVE THEM BOTH.    THE APOSTLES: Another no-brainer.  In JC73 the apostles were fairly anonymous bit parts, necessary to move the story and songs along, but otherwise forgettable. In JC2K1, Simon, Peter, and James POP!  They take relatively minor parts, and breathe new life into them, without distracting from the main story. JC2K1.    CONCLUSION: I love Jesus Christ Superstar. It's one of my favorite musicals (and I'm a musical buff)  I've listened to the Broadway and London recordings hundreds of times, seen it on stage 5 times (twice in San Francisco), and watched both film versions at least 20 times each.  JC2K1,[[ASIN:B000056NX5 Jesus Christ Superstar]] is the version that consistently takes my breath away.  Despite a few individual performances where I would argue that I've seen better, and a few times where the filming seems both melodramatic and claustrophobic, overall, this version works at a level that few movie musicals have touched.    Andrew Lloyd Webber is quoted as saying \\"This is the version I've waited 30 years to see\\".    If you care for the musical at all, you simply have to give this a chance.  Most highly recommended.
B00005NUZM|3.0|First, I never owned the original album which was Michael Jackson's first album as a solo performer. This album only hints at his genius with his sound and the disco dancing of the time. If this was his first album, it could be seen as a potential of what came with Thriller.     Anyway, this is a must for Michael Jackson fans. I have to say I was disappointed because it's not his best work but most artists don't give their best up at first. Anyway, I was troubled by the fact that my computer Itunes needed the album information such as songs and artist and album name. Also, I was disappointed because the last tracks of the compact disc (the so-called extras) didn't have a name not even on the Compact disc. I know a couple of them are other versions of the same song and interviews with Quincy Jones. I found the interviews to be just bits and pieces and not explained enough for me. I still have listed as the track numbers and I wished that they did name them after the song listings. That's my one pet peeve about this compact disc.

0385523904|5.0|I have been greatly interested in North Korea of late, having seen their soccer team at the World Cup and seeing B.R. Myers lecture on the subject (The Cleanest Race).  I ended up buying this book instead and was so moved by it I could not put it down until I finished it. I found myself repeatedly thinking that North Korea was the model for Orwell's 1984, for this book is so powerful in its description of a totalitarian state ruled by a megalomaniacal dictator using power of the cult of personality. Stunning is the word that came to my mind over and over again as I read through the descriptions of the daily lives of North Koreans who escaped North Korea and lived to speak with the author about it.  I kept expecting a torture room and 2+2=5 to be stated at some point - this book reads like incredible fiction and yet it is certainly not.<br /><br />The story is so engrossing I found myself literally transfixed for hours on end until I had read through all 300 pages. Heartbreaking, exciting and absolutely riveting.  And this from a work of non-fiction!<br /><br />While, of course, I credit the author with writing with verve and giving an excellent narrative frame to the book, I also believe that the stories are so riveting that I often found myself believing that this was all made up, but apparently it isn't.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000UJ48WC|4.0|Even though I've always had the highest regard for Stanley Kubrick's work, I do have mixed feelings for \\"The Shining\\". Even from the first viewing, I never felt that it terrified me as much as it should have.  But it is a film I do re-watch from time to time simply because visually, like most of Kubrick's films, it is so satisfying and the Blu-ray version is even more so.   I won't dwell on the screenplay or performances except to say that they are sometimes yes, sometimes no.  But the Blu-ray disc does bring out the technical achievements of the movie.  The cinematography is excellent as one would expect, but the frequent use of the Steadicam, being used here by Kubrick for the first time, does begin to call attention to itself.        I'm glad the BD was released in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio since I'm  quite certain that it was presented in theaters using a 35mm print in 1.37:1 aspect and masked in the projector to get 1.78:1 or something close to it.  In the early aerial shot of the hotel as shown in the 1.33:1 DVD, the blades of the camera helicopter are clearly visible at the top of the frame.  I'm certain Kubrick would never have allowed this, given his attention to detail and I don't think that by 1980 there were many theaters in the U.S. showing movies in 1.37:1.  The video quality of the Blu-ray release is impressive in its clarity, color balance and freedom from graininess and the helicopter blades are nowhere to be seen.      Somehow I get the impression that the musical portion of the soundtrack is a little too much of a good thing having been, I believe, remixed at a higher volume level relative to the dialogue track for this release.  The music for this film was taken mostly from existing concert pieces by Bartok, Ligeti, et. al.   To have the greatest effect for this film, the music, in many places, should be rather quiet and needling rather than intrusive or overbearing as it often is.  Playing this film in a totally dark room and at a lower than usualaudio level will help provide the feelings of uneasiness that the viewer should have.       This release makes me pine for a Blu-ray release of Barry Lyndon.
1433502410|5.0|By the far the most helpful and thorough Bible I've owned. Great book introductions. Great articles in the back including a even a small systematic theology section that you can practically preach from. On top of that the passage by passage commentary is BY FAR the best I've read in any Bible. I'm not crazy about the ESV's readability, but it's accuracy is high. I highly recommend this Bible to teenagers and adults if you want some additional material to help you understand what you are reading in the Bible.

B002VECMAE|3.0|A \\"Wild and Funny Ride\\" is the blurb on the retail jewel case for \\"The Men Who Stare At Goats\\".  I don't agree.  I see that, with 106 reviews in as I write this, that there are more 1 star reviews than 5 star reviews.  That tells you something.<br /><br />Starring the usually excellent George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, and Kevin Spacey, the film just fell flat, im my opinion.  The film is well-photographed and the desert scenes are very convincing.  However, the story just rambled from point A to, well, where was it going?<br /><br />As I'm watching the film, I kept asking myself, 'why did they make this film?'  'What was the point?'  I still can't answer the film.  It has an slight anti-military slant to it (most of the soldiers and officers are stupid, mean-spirited, or just plain crazy).  There is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo mysticism in it, coupled with lame 'new age' spirituality and, yes, flowers.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges plays Bill Jango, a man who believes in the concept of a kinder, gentler Army (what???).  Yep, an army that uses flower power rather than rifles and tanks (yeah, that would work well against Hitler).  There is a slight plausibility in the approach, because they use some elements of martial arts, which we know is very effective.  But army-issued flowers?  Ah,...No.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor plays Bill Wilton, a reporter for a small-town paper in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  His wife leaves him for his editor, and he is a bit lost.  He wants to do something macho to maybe win her back (although that is not really part of the story).  He spies Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) at a bar in Kuwait.  He's hoping to get into Iraq as the military invades the country.  Cassady agrees to take him into the country.  Turns out that Cassady is part of a 'black-ops' team that uses psychological and psychic warfare to fight the enemy.  But there is a nemesis in the form of Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey) who has little or no psychic power himself, and he's jealous of the talented Cassady, and tries to sabotages the unit.<br /><br />Is Cassady crazy?  Does he really have some mystical psychic powers?  Maybe.  He can make clouds 'burst' and can successfully guess 241 coin tosses in a row (why isn't this guy in Vegas???), and he can stop a goats heart by staring at it (hence the title).<br /><br />The movie is OK.  There seems to be a real idea here, but the movie can't make up it mind whether to be a straight comedy (albeit a black one) or an off-beat, fuzzy lampoon of the US military.<br /><br />I can't recommend the film for most folks.

B00005JL7Q|4.0|The iconic Hugh Grant stars as Will in this pleasant British comedy about a man who does 'nothing' in his life.  Nothing except spend money, bed women, lives in a fabulous apartment, and drives a very nice car.  He's living on the royalties of his fathers novelty song, \\"Santa's Sleigh\\".  He loathes the song, by the way, because it's sappy and he's heard it a million times (or more).<br /><br />Will, for some reason, starts to have a hard time finding willing women he can have an affair with, and then get rid of them by having them dump him.  His latest fling is a beautiful woman who has a child. After she dumps him (conveniently), Will decides to attend a 'SPAT' (Single Parents Alone Together), because he thinks he's hit a gold mine.  Women who are lonely, sexually hungry, and have a great excuse to dump him after a short while.  So he makes up a two year-old named Ned.<br /><br />Well, he does end up with a boy, Marcus, who is 12 and is having problems fitting in at school, where hardly anyone wants to hang with him, since his mom walks him to school, and he has a strange habit of just singing out loud without knowing it.  Marcus has a sad-sack mom, Fiona who seems on the verge of suicide every time we see her.  Marcus decides that Will might be a good guy to hang around with; Will isn't too sure.<br /><br />Recommended.  I liked the film; it portrays a self-admitted shallow guy in the person of Will, together with those around him who want him to (finally) grow up.  With the help of Marcus, he finally does, risking his dignity and emotions with Marcus, his mother, and Christine, an attractive woman he might want to stay with for a while.

0439023483|5.0|This is one of those rare novels that will make you forget everything else that's going on around you.  You do NOT want to start reading this until you have a long weekend with no plans and plenty of quiet time.  This completely transported me from my couch to a place called Panem in post-apocalyptic America.  The book doesn't cover the events that led up to this existence replacing the United States, nor does it dwell on \\"The Future\\" with flying cars and such.  Suzanne Collins created a future that is understated and believable.  In fact, it is SO frighteningly realistic, you will believe everything is entirely plausible.    It is what it is - a land which has been separated into 13 districts and ruled by a cruel capitol.  Gone are the days of freedom.  The world our story takes place in is bleak, but reality for Katniss, a very mature teenage girl whose father was killed in a mining accident.  Her mother has lost all coping skills so keeping the family fed has become her greatest responsibility.  Survival is tough in District 12.  Hunting isn't a sport, but a means of survival.  Capitalism is gone, replaced by a meandering existence with no real purpose for living.  The only excitement are the Hunger Games, the most disturbing reality show ever created.  It's more than a reality show - it's bigger than the super bowl.  It's a national lottery where two kids between the ages of 12-18 from each district are selected at random to participate - one boy, one girl.  If you are chosen, it's as good as a death sentence.  The Hunger Games are a fight to the death and killing all other remaining contestants is the only way out.  There is only one winner...and the story begins with Katniss Everdeen's family getting the news that her young sister has been chosen.  Katniss feels protective of her younger sister, who is only 12, so she volunteers to take her place - an act that is almost unheard of.    Instantly, Katniss is swept up into a world of dread and pageantry as she prepares for her debut as a contestant in The Hunger Games.  If you're a fan of survivor tales and psychological thrillers, you're going to love this.  This book also doesn't have an age or gender base of which it will appeal to most, which is great.  You can recommend it to anyone.  It's tame enough for younger readers who can stomach the violent subject matters.  The characters are also mature enough where adults can easily slip into the roles without much difficulty as well.  I've heard this book compared to [[ASIN:1421527723 Battle Royale: The Novel]] by Koushun Takami, [[ASIN:1604500298 The Most Dangerous Game - Richard Connell's Original Masterpiece]], [[ASIN:0140345809 House of Stairs]] by William Sleator, [[ASIN:B0001932ZA The Running Man (Special Edition)]] and even fans of the TV reality series [[ASIN:B0001ZDKXI Survivor - The Complete First Season]].  In book form, it's a PG rating.  The violence is loathed, not glorified.  There are various sub-plots that will reinforce the fact that you won't want to put this book down once you start reading it.  Psychological elements of who you can trust, who you can't, a romance that leaves the reader and the protagonists scratching their heads and the thrill of strategic victories make this positively addicting.  Cat and mouse fear fests abound throughout.    What will hook you about this novel?  It's written as realistically as watching a reality show feels.  Everything unfolds like you are watching it on camera.  There are no dull moments.  Unlike TV reality shows where there is time to hear plenty of gossiping, complaining or watching contestants laze around on hammocks, there is none of that here.  Every second is a fight to survive as the contestants are thrown into a wilderness setting where knowledge of plant life, weaponry, strategy, and their own cleverness are the only things standing between themselves and a sure death.  If you're a superbowl fan, you know you can't just turn the TV off and watch the recorded version some other time.  You have to sit and watch the whole game.  That's how this book is - you can't put it down until you reach the conclusion.  Brilliant book!  Can't wait to read the sequels!

I read his other books are in the same format: interesting stories. He is going at making mundane stuff sound interesting. I will not keep any of his books on my reference list.

B001UV4XFG|4.0|Twilight: Eclipse has a group of newly turned vampires making their way to Forks and they have Bella's scent. Bella (Kristen Stewart) thinks Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the one creating them and sending them after her. But Edward (Robert Pattinson) doesn't think so since Alice (Ashley Greene) hasn't had a vision of her planning an attack. While Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and his wolf pack are in on helping the Cullen's protect Bella. Jacob however is tired of seeing Bella with Edward or the idea of her being turned and decides to tell her how he feels.<br /><br />  I was one of those people that defended Twilight: New Moon, more Bella and Jacob and less Bella and Edward was entertaining. But Twilight: Eclipse is surprisingly a lot better, despite a whole lot of Edward \\"who I can't really stand\\". There's more intrigue, more excitement and finally some vampire history and some back-stories on Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone). Just don't expect a back-story on Alice, since her back-story was covered in the first book, but skipped in the first movie. Still, this is the best made Twilight so far.
0143038419|4.0|I picked up this book in a book store two years ago, read a bit of it and put it down. It was annoying. I picked up this same book recently, read it and it changed my life. The difference? I'm on a spiritual journey myself and can relate to everything she's saying. Spirituality is a very personal, individual thing and I think she manages to capture this through the nuances of both her larger and smaller spiritual experiences in the book in a way which is very clever and thoughtful (not to mention funny and entertaining).That's what spirituality is- it shouldn't be preachy. It's a loving relationship with a higher power which is all encompassing and celebrates your uniqueness and unique place in the world, in addition to your personal idiosyncrasies. Anyone who has come discover the real nature of \\"God\\" and the laws of the universe will understand this. Otherwise, I don't think so many people would have been touched by a supposedly trite, superficial book ( 2,400 reviews- not bad) The whole story is knitted together very well and comes together nicely. I don't think it is glib or narcissistic; so much as it is blessedly honest. Everyone has their own issues to work through which are very personal and nobody should judge. This is after all her own experience based on who she is and what she knows. The only thing I would say I found annoying as an African is the way Italy is Italy, Bali is Bali, Brazil is Brazil and not Europe, Asia or South America. But Africa is ALWAYS AFRICA and never Botswana, Mali, Senegal, Morocco, Cameroon or Ethiopia etc. The continent has over forty something countries for god sake with languages as diverse as Portuguese, Arabic and French not to mention the thousands of local dialects and customs. The only time I heard her mention an individual country in \\"Africa\\" was when she spoke of Nigerians- in true Western, complacent female style. If this book was about spreading light (i.e information/truth)- for god sake- use the opportunity to spread it to as many areas as possible and don't leave Africa- the \\"dark\\" continent in the dark- therefore perpetuating the \\"darkness\\" that people in the West create themselves and then complain about. There. That was my gripe. Otherwise 4 stars out of 5    Interesting (largely irrelevant) side-note: there's a bit in the book where the author says she sees herself in the mirror and thinks it's someone else and runs towards them. I've just come from reading that there's such a thing as \\"true mirrors\\" which are non-reversed unlike conventional mirrors and make you see yourself in 3d-how other people see you. That might go a long way in explaining that funny bit.

B00026WU7I|5.0|38 years after 'Blood on the Tracks' was recorded in 1974, it still stands by common consent as the all-time masterpiece in a life-long career of excellence rarely equalled by any other performer. The songs are as poignant and powerful today as they were in those long-gone Nixon-Ford days when in 1975, this - the original 33rpm vinyl record - hit the streets to the delight of Dylan's millions of devotees and won new converts to his lyrical songwriting and powerful delivery. It's a great, great album, and it hasn't even aged.<br /><br />Much has been made of the marriage break-up of Dylan and Sara Lownds in 1974 as the background to the extraordinary writing on BOtT and it's even been stated that several of the songs are specifically about her. Dylan - and other people close to him - deny this. But for sure, something in 1974 caused him to give birth to his most poignant, poetic, extraordinary and enduring lyrical writing.<br /><br />The follow-up album 'Desire' contains a track called `Sara': they even considered re-marriage in the 1980s.<br /><br />Most fans would agree that Bob's career, though always interesting, contains a few best-forgotten moments. If you're of a later generation and don't know Dylan's work very well, this is a good place to start and might be a revelation: there's not a mediocre track on the album. BOtT is best listened to as a complete work of art from beginning to end.<br /><br />There's humour too, especially on `Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts' with a catchy, upbeat rhythm as backdrop to the unfolding narrative told through the eyes of Bob-the-storyteller, Bob-the-observer as he wryly describes the life-changing consequences a cleverly planned bank raid in a small town have for three characters as their lives are impacted by the gang-leader, the `Jack of Hearts' - an unlikely premise, but one which works. Economy of lyrical writing, witty and clever, it will likely bring a smile to your face every time you hear it and showcases Dylan's literate, clever observational storytelling to balance out the anger and heartache which accumulates through many of the other songs.<br /><br />`Rolling Stone' lists BOtT as number 16 in the 500 greatest albums ever in history, by any artist.

I just want to say that I'm not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer when it comes to guessing the endings of mystery novels, but I was a good 200 pages ahead of the big reveal in this one. As for the historical background, it's very thin. The Masons are either not as compelling as you might think or Brown was unable to find anything all that interesting about them to fill his novel. The few interesting tidbits about the architecture and history of Washington DC entirely too inadequate to make this book remotely worthwhile. It's so amateurish and badly thought out there's little chance I'll read his next one.

B002ZG97RE|1.0|I will keep this uncharateristically short and to the point. I like Matt Damon and I like his tough but real spy/military acting persona.     What I don't like is being insulted and clubbed by the Hollywood propaganda machine. Yes, we were told there were WMDs somewhere in Iraq... Yes, none of significance were found... No it doesn't mean they were never there, weren't moved, etc. Got it? Can we move on?     This movie would have been much stronger and more complex if it had muddied the propaganda message by showing the history and intelligence behind the belief of all the Western allies (and including the previous Clinton administration) that Sadam had WMDs, and showed his refusal to allow inspections that would prove his denial. But this movie didn't bother with that part of the truth because it was, as indicated elsewhere, not looking for anything as complicated or nuanced as reality.     Green Zone is merely the latest exercise in Hollywood vanity. As an anarchist friend once recognized, \\"If Hollywood, and all the little Che Guevara-wanna-be's it sees in the mirror each morning, hate the present capitalist regime, it surely is not going to like what it helps replace it with.\\" Those of you new to the planet may want to strap-in because the first rule of history is, \\"It's always later than you think.\\"    Also, would someone please wack the idiot that is behind the over-use of \\"camera-shake\\" as a device for communicating action and realism. This is the same twit who managed to all but ruin the second two Bourne movies. Please!

0307473465|1.0|This book is a pure example of why that classic tenet of writing is crucial. Too much of this story is the author/narrator telling us what he's thinking, rather than showing us.     For all his introspection, Michael was quite an oblivious guy. Hanna's big secret was obvious (and I don't typically catch on to these things unless I'm hit with a two by four...) well before Michael figured it out.     Both Michael and Hanna had few, if any redeeming qualities, which is unrealistic and why some reviewers are saying the character development is virtually non-existent.     The real secret, and more interesting angle than Michael's teenage angst that he never outgrew, is how did Hanna become the person she was? Michael didn't seem to want to know, therefore neither will we.

B002VECLVO|5.0|\\"Waking up begins with saying am and now.\\"<br /><br />These were the first words uttered from the Christopher Isherwood's 1964 book and its 2009 film incarnation, A Single Man. The story is about a 52-year-old professor's (Colin Firth) journey as he loses his partner (Matthew Goode) of sixteen years in 1962. It's fashion designer Tom Ford's first feature film and he successfully creates a film of substance rather than a hallow fashion film. The film focuses on major themes stemming from identity, loss, human connection, and death and its aftermath. While Ford claims that this film is, first and foremost, a basic love story, its themes deal directly much to the gay community. It may not be a \\"gay film,\\" but the professor deals with homophobia very clearly: his appearance at his lover's funeral is rejected, the anger that he needs to be invisible, and his best friend saying an off-hand remark that his love was a substitute for love.<br /><br />In the mere 99 minutes of A Single Man, its structure and form is rendered beautifully with Ford's attention to detail and its haunting \\"Hitchcockian\\" music. For example, the slow agonizing and repetitive steps of death are harrowing while the moments of loss are played with the sounds of drowning. Ford also adds a sense of morbid humor as Firth attempts to kill himself. And the scenes shift to many of the human body features, especially the lips. Colin Firth leaves a beautiful and sad performance as he goes through the day without his lover. Anal, passionate, pessimistic, coldhearted; He's wicked but his sense of heart is hiding and aching. His performance isn't bombastic, but leaves a realistic sense of sadness. In Addition, his style should be commended as he dresses debonair, intelligent, and couture- A side effect Ford must surely have.<br /><br />The other actors provide great performances with special notice to Matthew Goode playing the sympathetic and domestic lover as he really shines in the tender flashbacks. Julianne Moore is a conundrum as she plays a messy, yet proper British lady who unsuccessfully yearns to be with Firth. The other men in Firth's lives give stellar performances with Jon Kortajarena playing the mysterious Latin boy reminiscent of James Dean while Nicholas Hoult plays the stalker-like student who longs to feel a sense of intellectual connection with Firth. Slow at first, the film will leave an impression especially the flashbacks with the professor's lover as they first met or when they are chatting in the beach or in their living room.<br /><br />The reception has been highly acclaimed, especially from the International Venice Film Festival and the Golden Globes. Tom Ford may have intended A Single Man to be simply a love story, but thank you still for your nods to the gay community.<br /><br />My Rating: Ashe plays a messy, yet proper British lady who unsuccessfully yearns to be with Firth.

0385504225|1.0|I really enjoyed Da Vinci Code, moderately enjoyed Angels and Demons.<br />Hated this book.<br />Plot moved at a ponderous pace; numerous factual errors a 6th grader could spot; a blind man with cataracts (they cure that these day, Mr. Brown); huge lapses in federal ethics guidelines (hiring one's sister and building her an enormously expensive high-tech lab on federal property- I don't think so).  If the book were filed under \\"fantasy,\\" I could be more lenient; at least I'm supposed to suspend my sense of reality.<br /><br />No believable motivation for the villain was given. One day a drug addict in prison, next day a super-villain who can kill without leaving a trace.<br /><br />And the sexism really rankled me.  Katharine Solomon gets called \\"Ms.\\" but Langdon gets called \\"Professor.\\"<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewers  who gave this book one star; wish I could give it a negative star

0060589280|4.0|Exceptionally powerful story - well told.  Coelho explores the elements of physical, emotional and sacred sensuality - pain and pleasure, love and lust, joy and despair.  In exploring herself, starting as a teen and up through her 23rd year, the protagonist, Maria, gains, loses and regains the ability to love both emotionally and physically.  The gains and losees, pains and experiences are those of every person, just with greater emphasis and intensity in the story.  She meets the librarian, the professional, those that truly feel, those that act, and those for whom the act itself has little depth or meaning. The vulnerability of all people is exposed, and the psychology of physical intimacy takes on new meaning as Maria plays each part as part of her profession.<br /><br />The book isn't fully uplifting, and the end is as predictable as Coelho indicates it will be.  Nevertheless, the discussion of the sacred and secular elements of love, lust and the physical nature of relationships really resonate as profound.  Coelho probably spends a bit too much time on the anatomy, but it doesn't detract from the power of the message.

0061122092|5.0|I can say that after reading this, I probably liked it more than The Alchemist.  The elements of love, spirituality, the sacred gift, love lost and regained, sacrifice, denial, searching and wondering are experienced over and over again - touching the soul.  I felt that I could relate to it more, and the emotions it brought forth were powerful and broad.  Coelho also introduces the reader to the concept of the Sacred Feminine in the form of the Virgin  - and at one level, the book resounds the elements that were also present in The Alchemist - unity and universalism, the power of fufilling life's purpose, the mission of living, the role of God.  Yet, this book, by emphasizing the element of romantic and sacred love with more force than The Alchemist, added a powerful element just hinted at by Coehlo in his first work - that of the power of romantic yet sacred love.  A worthy read.

B001OQCV6K|4.0|So here's the thing:  I grew up on Sherlock Holmes. It started with the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce films when I was a kid. Hound of the baskervilles was my favorite of them. I read every Holmes story from the time I was 12 and I've re-read them several times. My wife is the same way, and we own every Jeremy Brett version. Every Christmas we watch The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle. So when we saw the previews for this movie we avoided it like plague.   I finally rented it and we watched it this past week. We were both ready to hate it with our Holmesian nerd rage but...  It turned out that we really liked it. Is it the Holmes we've come to know through Jeremy Brett? No, but it has a good story, a good dynamic with Watson, and really great action scenes.    As usual they play up the Irene Adler stuff into some type of love story. The film also errs by having Holmes being introduced to Mary Morstan when he really met her in Sign of Four before Watson married her. All in all though, I really liked it and the opening scene of Baker Street looked like a homage to the Granada series.     I'm not going to do a synopsis, I'm sure thats been done. Basically if you like Holmes you *might* like this. Robert Downey is really good (a bit dirtier than I expect Holmes to be and with more disheveled hair). Jude Law is good as Watson, although in their rooms he tends to look more working class than I'd expect Watson to look. Fight scenes and explosions are over the top but good. All in all the two Holmes nerds in this house enjoyed it.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|It can be a big mistake to rewatch your favorite films from the 1970s, assuming you saw them first run. A lot of the humor has faded as badly as the color, and a lot of the themes seem as dated as the hair-dos. That's NOT the case with Cabaret. It was a great film when I saw it first in 1972, it was better last night when I watched it again after 38 years, and I'm glad I bought it because I predict it will still be great when I play it for my grandchildren a few decades from now.<br /><br />The main character of Cabaret isn't the young Englishman Brian, played so very sensitively by Michael York, or the self-hating starlet Sally Bowles, performed so effortlessly by Liza Minelli. No, the soul of this story is a Time and a Place  --Berlin in 1931-- at the very moment when fanatical anti-semitic nationalism was poised to pounce on Europe just as Sally pounces on Brian, and as she advises Brian's fortune-hunting tutee to pounce on the virginal heiress on her own couch. The hatred, desperation, and violence that fostered Nazism in the late 1920's is portrayed almost subliminally, as fragments of a context the clients of the Kit Kat Club pretend not to note. But the fervor and triumphalism of the Nazi movement is revealed also, especially in the semi-plausible beer garden scene, in which an angel-faced German lad sings \\"Tomorrow belongs to me\\" and the entire crowd joins the chorus. That scene is the climax of the film, and it's a master stroke of irony, considering what \\"we\\" know retropectively about Germany's \\"tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />And there's Joel Grey, the \\"Master of Ceremonies\\" at the Kit Kat Club. He's the face and fanny of Berlin in 1931, all brilliant Kitsch and smirking decadence. Without Joel Grey, the film would be another romantic melodrama. With him, it's virtually a documentary of historical tragedy.<br /><br />Much of the credit appropriately goes to director/choreographer Bob Fosse, Oscar winner in 1972, and to John van Druten, the playwright who made something profound from the slim material of Chistopker Isherwood's Berlin stories. And my gratitude appropriately goes to my \\"amazon friends\\" whose reviews stimlated me to rewatch this classic.slim material of Chistopker Isherwood's Berlin stories.

B003L16FAE|1.0|After a lackluster initial blu ray release of Predator I, like many others, asked and hoped for a remastered re-relase.<br /><br />We should have been more specific.<br /><br />DNR.  Three little letters that can either spell cleaner image or plastic people right out of a Pixar movie.  Used sparingly, DNR can be a good thing.  But like most things, when not used in moderation it can be damaging.<br /><br />In this case it practically turned a great action movie into a Pixar computer generated movie.  That may be an exaggeration - but not a huge one.  The texture of people's clothing in the movie?  Practically gone.  Pores and wrinkles in their skin (details that show texture and prove that they are real)?  Almost entirely gone.<br /><br />Sure, the picture is pristine.  It's as clean as a whistle.  It's shiny and pretty.<br /><br />Predator NEVER looked like that, and it isn't supposed to.  I saw the movie 5 times in the theater, and it always looked grainy and dirty.  That was John McTiernan's call.  He chose the filmstock to use, he chose the filming techniques used.  A DVD or blu ray should ALWAYS match up as closely as possible with the director's intentions.  Predator (Ultimate Hunter Edition) doesn't even come close to what McTiernan wanted the movie to look like.<br /><br />Schwarzenegger looks like Plastic Man until he gets dirty and grimy - and even then he looks like a dirty, grimy Plastic Man.  It's really sad that this movie has been treated so badly over the years, and especially on blu ray.  For the first edition a new encoding from the best elements should have been done.  It wasn't.  It was an old, outdated encoding of a mediocre print.  This new version should have simply used the best print available, and used only a slight amount of DNR to clean up some of the spots where there had been excessive grain due to the lighting conditions in the jungle.  Instead the picture has been scrubbed clean and most of the fine detail is gone.<br /><br />There is no way that I can recommend this blu ray.  No way at all - except to recommend that you AVOID it, and that's a shame because it is really a classic action movie.  One of the best ever.<br /><br />Come on, Fox, you blew it this time - get it right for the movie's 25th anniversary.  Please.no way that I can recommend this blu ray.

0156012197|5.0|The most offensive thing to say of this book is to call it a children's book. The next is to argue between whether Woods versus Howard make the best translation.<br /><br />This is my favourite book of all time. My favourite of any genre. It is a very human story, an honest story, and a story about humanity and our \\"culture\\". If I were to try to pinpoint what it is about this book that makes it the classic philosophical tale it is, it is probably the absolute wisdom it reveals by so honestly and unapologetically describing aspects of human nature and our \\"adult\\" or \\"civilised\\" behaviour. One example is the way we have come to describe the way a house looks by how much it costs rather than describing the colour of its roof, the number of windows, etc. This book is in fact such a revealing philosophical text in the form of an adventure tale.<br />I first read this book as a child, and then it was an adventure which I found so transcending of culture and time. Growing up this book became to me what the Bible is to many people. It taught me to value love, friendship, and to understand that all people have their flaws but that's not all there is to them. Later when I read this book as a teenager and in my early twenties trying to understand \\"love\\", I started to notice aspects of the story that deal with this. Most recently I came to recognize how broadly philosophical the story is, the wisdom each sub-tale reveals, and how deep anything that once seemed like simple adventure actually is.<br /><br />If you read this book and only notice a story of a Little Prince from space, a lost aviator, a flower, a fox, and a few other characters from different planets, you have really missed the point.

Time to highlight the best \\"No love\\", lil weazy starts this off with his typical catchy lyrics but Eminem just charges in and executes the song and you forget Lil Wayne was even a part of it. \\"Changes\\" unique, amazing period. Who can actually include an old Ozzy Ozbourne song into a rap song like that and completely own it? \\"You're never over\\" touching tribute to his best friend lost. \\"on fire\\" catchy track with a touch of em's old style. \\"as the cold wind blows\\" again old style catchy eminem style but mature at the same time. \\"seduction\\" SICK beat, with a venomous tone down right dirty track, love it. \\"25\\" to life, amazing. \\"space bound\\" another   new side of eminem. \\"not afraid\\" catchy, just him telling us he is back, and in a great way .  \\"love the way you lie\\" yet another strong track. I can't say enough good things about this album it really is an EPIC record.
030726999X|4.0|I  truly enjoyed all three books, however in this final book, I didn't think the sub plot involving Erika was necessary. (Spoiler...the stalker drama just didn't fit.) Let me say that the English translator did a magnificent job on this triology. Now that all three are available, novices to this series should read them back to back. What a shame the author didn't live to see his success and to give us more.
B001B51B9M|5.0|I already have it on regular DVD but I got it on Blue Ray and what a great difference it is.I think (in my opinion) that this is the very best musical and story line ever.All of the cast fit their parts perfect and the actual music fits the story. Everything comes together and on Blue Ray it could not be better.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Excellent series; loved it.  Wish it was a little longer, but well worth the money.
B002QGSW8I|5.0|In my opinion, The Doomsday Key, is one of the best of the series. Once again, the evil criminal network that has caused so much trouble for Sigma Force has hacked a new scheme--one that could wipe out a large number of the world's population. Sigma Force, struggling to redeem itself in the eyes of its own government, must take steps to stop the coming disaster.<br /><br />As always with James Rollins Sigma Force novels, he has two stories involving different team members, which eventually converges. Grayson Pierce must trust an old enemy, who may or may not be an ally. Painter Crowe, who has been inches for field work through several books finally gets his chance. Investigating several murders across three continents, Crowe attempts to interview a corporation head, who has openly suggested he would like to institute methods of controlling the world's population. Several attempts are made of Crowe's life.<br /><br />James Rollins did a fantastic job with The Doomsday Key. If you're a fan of fast-pace action and history then this book is for you.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1438233639 The Friday House]]<br />[[ASIN:1593740581 Lost Hours]]<br />[[ASIN:1451542690 Darkest Hours: A Joseph Hooks Novel]]
B000000Y2R|4.0|What a treat to hear this music again.  I originally owned this album back in '59.  Actually, some of the pieces seem different from the album I owned back then.  Still, to hear Perdido through that oh so familiar echo of Massey Hall was wonderful.  As a teenager I only enjoyed the music -- I had no idea I was listening to the giants of jazz in the '50's.  This CD is a real treasure (and the sound quality is better than the original record -- as I remember).  Enjoy!
B000VR824S|5.0|There is not much to say, This is one of the best blues artists. Buy this and enjoy as I did. Great music, Great artists!
B002WY65VU|3.0|*spoiler alert*    Zombieland has some pretty entertaining action sequences. The final scene at the amusement park was particularly entertaining. Woody Harrelson shooting zombies with a gun in each hand as they try and break into the concession stand he's in was a highlight. There was too much slow motion used in this final scene however, and throughout the film which was annoying.    Overall, I thought the movie could have been more fun. I watched it in a small group and the laughs were few and far between. A lot of the jokes that fell flat came in the form of the main character's voice over narration, which the movie could have done completely without.    There are some highlights to the film, the Bill Murray cameo was my favorite moment. However, there were a lot of pointless, wasted scenes that weren't funny or interesting to watch-- like the four main characters breaking things at a hobby shop.    Overall, I was mildly entertained but not impressed. I wouldn't recommend buying this and I certainly don't have a desire to see it again. Though, it wouldn't be painful to sit through or anything... the fact that I rented it out of a box outside a gas station for $1 makes it hard to be bitter or feel ripped off.
B002ZG97RY|5.0|Up there with Kingdom in terms of excitement, realistic portrayal of what's going on out there.  Lest we forget.  Fiction of course, but certainly far less fictitious than the propaganda that was spewing from Fox Noise on a daily basis at the time (as if anything's changed much...)
0307463745|2.0|I bought this book after hearing about it on a radio show that I highly respect.  As soon as I started reading, I realised I was ripped off.  This is a collection of short tips loaded with full page unrelated graphics that bulk the book.  They claimed that the book was twice as long before they edited it down for publication and they claimed it was twice as good for it.  I assume that means they cut out 288 extra pages of meaningless clip art.    The majority of the short tips in this book either show a lack of understanding on their own part, or are painfully obvious in any traditional business education.  For example, they talk about specifications being nothing but an illusion of agreement and a waste.  That is not the purpose of specifications.  Anyone blindly following a first release of a specification months after it's release deserves to fail.  Specifications exist to communicate what you're trying to build and what you actually built.  If two people competent in the art covered by a specification come out with two different understandings, then it's a badly written specification.  This is actually a good look at how 37Signals has a slanted view.  Their claim is that most of their products are actually by-products that developed for themselves.  The rules are different for such a situation.  They never had to go into development with the intent to sell as most people need to.  Most of their way of doing things has nothing to do with developing products.  Just keep that in mind.    With all that said, the only reason this doesn't get one star from me is because they do point out a few things that buck conventional wisdom while at the same time being backed up by my own experience.  This book criticises workaholics pretty harshly, claiming that they are simply inefficient with their time while creating false expectations on everyone else.  I have seen this and agree.  The guy that works 14 hours a day and doesn't get burnt out doing it is spending a lot of hours doing nothing.  There are other examples like this, but for $22 this book is a waste.
0060899220|5.0|Kitchen Confidential was written 10 years ago and it is no surprise to me that it still ranks as a terrific book to read. I started watching Anthony Bourdain on his No Reservations series (go figure) and wanted to learn more about him. I found his book on the shelf of a Goodwill Thrift Store (you know you've made it to big-time when your book is in every bookstore that includes thrift stores) and bought it for myself to read. Don't go laughing! I see people driving Mercedes Benz going to Thrift stores.     In any case, his book opened my eyes to the world of cooking. His descriptions of his experiences are one-of-a-kind, and also familiar with what some of us experience ourselves. I particularly like his description of his motivation for becoming a chef. Those kind of stories don't get any better. I recently bought his follow-up book to that titled 'Medium Raw' and will begin reading this tonight. Anthony Bourdain is truly an inspiration and writes on a level that all of us can understand and appreciate.    I highly recommend 'Kitchen Confidential'. You don't need a reservation to buy and read this book.    David Lucero, author of THE SANDMAN ([...])
B000ZECQ08|5.0|I have been waiting for the two disc edition of HP&HBP to come out for a while.  I always enjoy the Special Features.  This had a suprise of \\"A Year in the Life of J. K. Rowling\\"  which covered her completing Deathly Hallows and the opening of the HPOoTP.  It was the most interesting special feature on the 2nd disc.  I had wished for more behind the scenes and out takes but sadly there were very little.  The Movie itself was very good and well worth owning. There was much more humor than I expected especially with all the different teen love interests.  I am concerned that the film did not really explain very well what Horcuxs are and just what it is that Harry, Ron and Hermione are suppose to be looking for in the last two movies.
B00004YKUY|5.0|This album was a grower for me because I was thrown off comparing Augeri's voice to Perry's.  Once I got past that, I fell in love with this album.  What a moody, atmospheric vibe this album has.  It is hard to describe but it sets the tone for the whole album and never strays.  This album stands the test of time and is never dated.  Some of Neal Schon's most melodic guitar playing really driving the mood they were trying to create on these songs.  Augeri's vocals really compliment the mood of this album and his understated but very emotional delivery is very soulful.  I'm a big fan of Jon's piano on this album.  It really adds to the haunting melody of this album on so many songs. Deen Castronovo is awesome on drums and shines on this album, too.     This is definitely not an 80s band here playing the same ol same ol, trying to relive the past.  It is an evolution of their sound.  Tremendous musicians all of them.  I gave it a five because I play this consistently over the years, and that's the true measure of a really good album.
1439102813|5.0|This book is a definite must read for women approaching the menopause years.  I'm sure many of us began to experience memory loss around this time and this book is a real eye opener.  It is also great insight into what a person going thru Alzheimer's experiences with both good and bad days and the stigma attached to this terrible disease.  I believe Alices story signifies what many patients and caregivers must feel.  The book is a very sad but enjoyable read.
B002SAUCBC|2.0|This was an amazing suspenseful read but was there horror? no. the end is a nasty letdown.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|As we are currently in the midst of the football (soccer) world cup (also taking place in South Africa), this film is no doubt timely. It is the story of Nelson Mandela's attempt to unite his country just after the end of apartheid and at the beginning of his presidency. He sees an opportunity to use sports to rally his country behind one common goal: rugby. He recruits the captain of South Africa's rugby team to not only win the world cup competition but unite the color schism  within the country.    I really enjoyed this film however, the characters/story were not as developed as one might have hoped. The story eludes to family troubles for Mandela but does not really develop it. He is seen having an argument with his daughter and is shown to become agitated when asked about his family. As this is a true story, there may not have been a resolution to his family troubles but it left me wondering why Eastwood even bothered including it in the film. The references to it were so cursory that it would seem as though the film would have been fine without it. Likewise, the black population's shift to supporting the South African rugby team seemed too easy-- formerly, blacks would root against them. A black local government even voted to change the name and colors of the team until Mandela stopped them.  It just seemed as though approval of the rugby team seemed to shift over night without any justifiable reason for occurring or at least viewable softening towards them.    The two main actors do a wonderful job in their roles. Damon, who usually comes off as very intelligent in interviews, was able to seem simple yet noble in this role and Freeman, who is no stranger to playing a Black South African (the power of one), gracefully conveys the strength of a man who can forgive despite the immense cruelty.    This film is definitely worth watching. It's an uplifting feel good movie.
B00196W840|5.0|My goodness, what an absolutely outstanding book - I could not put it down. It brought me to tears many times as it caused me some serious reflection.  The characters were vivid, sentance structure was pure art, and sometimes I actually felt like I knew the people and could completely relate to the complex drama of family secrets and the petty shames many of us (me too) locked into our smallness.  At 601 pages, I was done easily in under a week.  It was well worth my time and I believe a very compelling narrative on free will from a Christian perspective.<br /><br />This book is very relevant, well placed historically, and a testament to freedom and the creative potential of the human spirit.<br /><br />\\"Timshel - Thou Mayest makes a man great, that gives him stature with the gods...

Thou mayest rule over sin...  You must master it.\\"<br /><br />\\"The lightning shattered the air into quaking pieces.\\"
0446563048|5.0|Book divided into 3 parts - profits, passion, purpose. A lot of the book is an autobiography of how Tony Hsieh & how Zappos came to be.    1. Profits - discusses earlier experiences during high school college, what he learned from his business successes & failures. Liked how he \\"experimented\\" with his ideas, went against the grain of his parents. Discusses his experience w/ LinkExchange - made millions, & had to work there for longer in order to keep his millions in stock/options. In the end decided to forgo those millions in order to free up his spare time, in order to pursue his other passions.  Liked his analogy of his first high-paying \\"job\\", how he left it & even though he didn't know what he ultimately wanted to do, knew what he didn't want to do. Liked his analogiest btw Poker & Business. Describes true happiness is from relationships, culture, connectivity, experiences vs success, money, etc. Describes how he enjoyed the values of peace, love, unity, respect & how he found those in his experiences in & outside of work.    2. Passion - most of this is about Zappos, culture, values. The breaking point, selling everything he had, & putting everything into Zappos, even in the face of failure. Liked how Zappos evolved from an online shoe store into something bigger to improve the overall customer experience (WOW factor, free shipping both ways, excellent telephone reps, 365 days/year returns, personal growth/development for employees, giving employees a $2000 bonus to quit)  Zero advertising, money spent/lost was put into customer experience -> travels to word of mouth, increasing revenue. Like how they have a library, for employees to contribute/borrow & how over time it as grown. Recommends a lot of titles to the reader & a lot of them are mandatory reading for employees. Discusses Zappos merge w/ Amazon rather than buyout in order to keep Zappos culture.    3. Purpose - discusses science/quest for happiness. First there are physiological needs, then there aresafety/security needs, then there are self esteem/self actualization. Awesome. Maslow's hierarchy. Gives a bunch of links/resources/books to read.    One of the best books I've ever read, in terms of growth, productivity, business.
B00006IU73|5.0|Who needs Pink Floyd to get back together when you have these guys who'se music will send you to places just as surreal and fascinating as Animals or The Dark Side of tht Moon? To be honest, I thought the instrumental on track six sounded like an outtake from Joe Satriani's Surfing With the Alien, and I found every song that came after that to be almost unlistenable. I'm still giving the album 5 stars, because the first five track are five of my all time favorites. Blackest Eyes and Trains should be anybody's first introduction to Porcupine Tree.  These songs are absolutely perfect.  People can move on from here to more consistantly excellent albeit more experimental albums like Deadwing, Fear of a Blank Planet, the Incident and Stupid Dream.  I can't endorse most of their earlier works. Front man, Steve Wilson, himself mocks those albums. This is a band that truely got better with age and In Absentia was a big breakout for them.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I've read all three of these books and wish there were more.  They are the best books Ive read in a long time.

006145205X|4.0|The Rational Optimist is about how we march upwards in our quality of life by increasing exchange amongst ourselves and prosper by specialization.  The book starts by introducing the idea that humans are unique in exchange and that understanding that exchange and reciprocity are not the same, and that the former is far more important than the latter in driving innovation.  It is argued that growth is a function of bottom up discovery by individuals through exchange of knowledge and goods and services.  The author sees this march upwards in living standard that we have seen since the stabilization of weather patterns, despite bouts of regression that he sees as a result of meddling by governments, to continue and this comes from being rational and optimistic based on what we have achieved as a species in the past.    The ideas core to what drive the book are a few.  The first is that comparative advantage is extremely important and drives specialization which in turn drives innovation.  The second is that in the goods and services, rather than asset markets, Adam Smith's ideas hold true and that prices reflect the right signals.  Another major idea i see as being described is that that was discussed by Romer a few decades ago on the role of information in progress.  Implicity the value of \\"non rival\\" goods and the market of ideas is taken to be of enormous importance in our developement.  The book argues forcefully that when these mechanisms for progress are being used uninterrupted, progress ensues.  It is also argued that the plights we associate with those who are poverty stricken are usually better than their alternatives, which isnt a justification for inequality, but rather a reminder that life in the factory is better than life on the farm and urbanization is a choice.  To this effect, we look around and we say, yes life is better than it was for almost all of us, and as a result we must be doing something right.  The spirit of this book rings true, when we are provided with the right incentives, our collective intelligence can come up with remarkable solutions.  Those incentives should be generated from the bottom up rather than top down, by consumer preferences, not national directives.      The author seems to largely dismiss market failure, not as non-existent, but rather that the attempt to fix them will likely take up an even larger dead weight loss.  That is argued implicitly in the authors accepting them despite knowing that they dont align prices with outcomes.  The book is essentially a book about the factors of economic growth.  Its not written as a book about economic growth, but everything that is argued is about progress and what causes it.  If one wants to get a sense about how growth occurs, what is important about it, what impedes it etc, this provides a useful non technical background.      It is argued that our most prosperous times are when entrepreneurs can work unimpeded in bringing goods to the market for personal gains and when people are using existing knowledge to build new ideas to test out and sell.  I think this is an excellent book but I dont think that it is equally argued.  The author does get selective in his arguments and evidence presented.  An example of this is arguing about the value of being able to mortgage property to raise funds to invest in one's business and that the absense of the mortgage market stifles investment growth in countries where landed wealth cant extract home equity (discussing De Soto's thesis).  There are definitely elements of truth in this thesis, but there is also a lot which has been shown to be wrong about this.  Another example is climate change and accepting it as probably not being a big deal.  Maybe it is, maybe its not but the author simultaneously makes the foundational point which is our progress as a people started when the environment was more stable such that we could make the transition to specialization by being able to farm.  Point being the author does sometimes provide too much a one handed argument.  Aside from that, which is to be expected given he has a thesis he is arguing, this is a well argued book with a very solid depth of knowledge that is shared with the reader.
B000001EYW|4.0|I'm actually listening to this at the moment. I love all of their work.  As the title implies, I'm very biased from an early age so if you aren't a BeeGees lover, I don't know what to say to you, lol. This stays within what you'd expect from them, falsetto, beautiful harmonies, the usual high quality work.  I hadn't heard their newer work until I got One Night Only, that led to this purchase because it was featured in the video. Really great video too. My Mother turned me onto them as a child and then, of course they did more work as I matured. Watching that video was one of the last things we did together before she was killed by a drunk driver, so it's pretty important to me :)
0893860220|5.0|I spent most of my teenager years visiting Indian Ashrams and learning meditation technics. Also read probably hundreds of books on eastern philosophy, etc. On one of my trips to India a friend recommended me this book. Even though I love a lot of what the book said, I felt I was not ready and put the book aside after only reading the first 10 pages.<br /><br />It is only 15 years later that I managed to find this book again on Amazon. This time I was more prepare and things resonated in a way never imagened. I can truly say my search is over. Never again had I look or read another spiritual book.<br /><br />Interestingly, it is during certain times that I can really read and comprenhend what this book is telling me. I need to be in \\"a special state of mind\\", otherwise words are empty and I get bored after a short time. So many times I tried to open this treasure without success. Yet, there are a few special times when words in this book serve me as a tunnel to see and understand THAT. It simply cracks me open.<br /><br />This book is not for everybody, but if you are in a serious search for who you really are, I recommend reading it. If after reading it you can not get it, do not worry, leave it on the side for a few years or decades; but go back to it. Eventually the treassure will be reveled and you will never again have to look for another book.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|I have been a big Ozzy fan since the days I began listening to metal.  Everything from very early Sabbath, right up through Black Rain.  Ozzy is one of those metal icons that never seems to let us fans down.  Sure, some albums and some of his work may lack that punch, but that is of course all a matter of opinion, and is subjective.  With that said, in this review, I will try and refrain from comparisions to both his album \\"Black Rain\\" and his time with Zakk Wylde.  Let's face it, music evolvs and so do the artists that create this art.  Here is my track by track review of Ozzy's \\"Scream.\\"    1. Let It Die - This opening track is probably my favorite song off the album.  Very hard-hitting and solid rocking tune!  The guitars are perfection here, and they harmonize with the drums and bass very well.  Some may argue that the electro-tune of Ozzy's voice on this track may be overdone, but I feel it makes it more haunting!  Awesome, head-banging track!!  5/5    2. Let Me Hear You Scream - This song is the first single off the album, and in true Ozzy fashion, packs that punch!  Clearly this is a ready-made song for radio air play, and is a true metal anthem for Ozzy fans and metal fans alike.  The drums and bass are so clear on this track you'll be pounding your head to it for days! 5/5    3. Soul Sucker - This song took me a couple listens to get into; the beginning has a sort of heavy auto-tune repeating \\"soul sucker\\" over and over.  Ozzy however, again shows very powerful vocals and it harmonizes with the heavy guitar work very well.  Another straight, heavy tune! 4/5    4. Life Won't Wait - Ozzy slows it down a bit here, for the first ballad of the album.  Again, took me a few listens to get into but overall is a very solid output.  My only complaint would be: the drum work is very solid, but once the vocals mix with them, everything seems to become jumbled together.  3.5/5    5. Digging Me Down -  There is something about this track that is very haunting.  Once youtake a listen, you can hear Ozzy seemingly questio his own beliefs, while he also seems to be coming to grips with his own mortality.  Awesome song overall.  I love the way the guitars in the begining just gel into that old-style heavy Ozzy sound we all know!  Very powerful and strong vocals by Ozzy as well.  5/5    6. Crucify - This song again, seems to follow suite from the previous track.  Starts fairly soft and seemingly haunting then blends right into Ozzy's classic vocals.  What I love about this track is the harmonizing of the guitars and piano work!  Has a prett catchy chorus as well as a very powerful guitar solo! 4/5    7. Fearless - Classic Ozzy sound here.  Very heavy, yet very melodic as well.  I love the guitars in this track as it blends over the heavy rocking chorus of Ozzy shouting!  When you think of Ozzy as a metal icon, this is a song that will come to mind!  5/5    8. Time - Again, a very haunting sound begins this track; a sort of somber note.  Overall, it took me a few listens to get into, but it is a very solid outing.  Seems to me to be another track where Ozzy is questioning his faith and his mortality.  At the same time he's telling us all to live life to the fullest.  A true metal ballad if there ever was one! 4/5    9. I Want It More - The piano work brings that haunting sound again, right into a heavy, classic Ozzy guitar sound!  I love the guitar work on this track, pure metalness!  Ozzy's voice is again top-notch as he belts out the chorus that will again have you pumping your fist for days!  A song that is heavy, but just slow enough to appreciate all the elements involved.  4.5/5    10. Latimer's Mercy - This song took me a few listens to appreciate.  I felt that the placement of this track on the album was just odd, and something just didn't fit.  Give it time though and it will grow on you.  Again, very solid and heavy guitar work here, but the bass is what brings it all together.  One weakness again is, the vocals seem to run into eachother and at times it seems there may be too much going on. 3.5/5    11. I Love You All - A very quick track just over a minute long.  Just Ozzy giving us fans an oath over soft guitar strings.  Dedicated to us all, he appears to perhaps be saying goodbye in this track,  Whether or not this is truly his last album remains to be seen.  If it is however, a truly classy way to end it from the Godfather of Metal!  5/5    There you have it, my review of \\"Scream.\\"  Definetly worth the purchase if you're an Ozzy fan or a fan of metal in general!  Truly shows that Ozzy will rock until the day he can no longer grace us all with his presence!!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I do like having the series on dvd dispite the music being missing.  That being said, does anyone know the name of the song at the end of the dye dye my darling episode that replaced the original?  I just like the song, and I've been trying to find it.
B0038BBA4I|3.0|This could of been an excellent album if only every track were more like Little Lion Man.  I cant get enough of that track, that and Winter Winds. I agree with some of the reviews stating the lyrics are somewhat sophomoric. It seems there forcing simple rhymes on a lot of their tracks, it's almost insulting to the listener.  With the fantastic vocals and arrangements on the album you forget about the short comings though. I rarely ever listen through the whole album but there are a few gems in this one.
B003J27WFW|5.0|RUSH has always been a perfectionist, tight-knit, passionate rock band that never skimps on musical or product quality. Whether you're talking about the choice of various excellent producers to convey their art throughout the many changes in their career, or the articulate well written detailed concert program guides over the years, or amount of program content and interviews in their live DVD's, the band has most always succeeded in satisfying their loyal fan base. 'Beyond The Lighted Stage' is no exception. I won't go into detail about exact content (as many reviewers before me have), but suffice it to say that there is enough content here to keep longtime (i'm 49 and first saw them on the 'Farewell To Kings' tour in the 70's!) and new fans riveted and happy. There is a lot of new archival backstage and concert footage, and even interviews with Geddy's and Alex's moms! Their comraderie, brotherhood, and humor is also evident when they get together at a hunting lodge for dinner, and the cameras are there. Neil also talks about why he is seemingly not as receptive to meeting fans like the more outgoing Alex and Geddy are. His thoughts are understandable, logical, and sensible, all things considered. These are just a few snippets of this great 'rockumentary'. A 'must purchase' for your music collection! THANK YOU RUSH!
B0039UTDA6|2.0|There is no denying that the photography is excellent; and if you are just looking for something to entertain, you will like this DVD.   However, as a classroom teacher, I would have liked more in-depth information for each topic.  They do not explain thoroughly and students will have many questions.  I also did not feel that Oprah's voice added to the overall quality of this series. Bottom line...I felt that someone had a lot of great photography left over from the making of \\"Planet Earth\\" and put it together to make \\"Life\\".  I rate it 5/10 and not worth what it cost.
B003BKF696|5.0|As a newcomer to the band having not heard any previous National releases i must say i'm absolutely thrilled to the max reagrding this - it is terrific from start to finish in a way few albums are these days - will be checking out their back catalogue and experiencing shock if this is not their best album - it is just so rare to deliver on one track to the next in this way without the need to hit the skip button. I agree with someone who said the music demonstrates how restraint can be used to keep the tension there - check out Little Faith - what an absolutely sensational track - holding things back while holding the melody and then the way the music muscles in is just killer - what can you say. Also i would consider Bloodbuzz Ohio a very special track - energy levels, tune, lyrics, drumming the lot - love the line \\"i still owe money to the money to the money i owe... \\" Another point that many have said is that this record needs a few spins - yep, took me about seven to appreciate its quality - the hooks show up in unexpected places particularly in the percussion which is stunning throughout. The singers deep mumble works really well and he has a sort of Stephin Merrit / Leonard Cohen / Nick Cave thing going too although that is a bit of a generalisation. He also instantly reminded me of mmm mm mm by crash test dummies (no idea if they are any good just remembered that song from the radio). Anyhows the words are way way above average not sure about being on the same level as the 3 aforementioned for example but yep i can see how folks obsess over these guys - i think maybe the brilliance in the lyrics is just in flashes a few times throughout each song not in the song as a whole all of the time or anything - a bit like a woody allen film dropping in one liners that really really stick with you. Also obscure lyrical (to me anyway from Scotland) references like Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks (??) leave me cold and not sure what he is getting at sometimes - suppose that ispart of the charm + repeated plays reveal blah blah blah...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great. Just plain awesome.  I couldn't stop reading it. I was immediatly hooked. I was up till midnight reading it.  Again, it was an awesome book. I got so into it that it seemed like the characters were real. Like this was all happening right in my room.  I can't wait to read the second. Wonderful job Ms. Collins!
0307341569|5.0|I have not sat down to read a good book in a long time. I took over an hour just reading reviews on different popular books, I wasn't sure what I wanted to read then I came across this book and it just jumped out at me. Once I got the book I couldn't put it down.
B000002B1M|5.0|Following up a debut album like Illmatic(Considered by many, including me, to be the best hip hop album of all time) is hard to say the least. I really liked It Was Written. It is not as good as Illmatic, but it's still a classic in my opinion.    This is probably Nas' most gangster-rap style album, with many hard hitting songs like The Message and I Gave You Power. Still, he brings great lyricism and clever wordplay to the table. The production is pretty good, with some really nice beats on The Message and Watch Dem Ni***'s.     This is probably my 4th favorite Nas album, and I consider it a classic.   My favorite tracks: 1. Watch Dem Ni***'s  2. The Message  3. I Gave You Power  4. Take It In Blood  5. If I Ruled the World.
B000R7GKQE|3.0|This is a great show, unfortunately disk one wouldn't play on either of the computers I have in my house (both Macs).  After reaching the max number of returns I decided to keep it because it would play on my DVD player, which I unfortunately won't have when I go to college in the fall. However, Amazon customer support was great through this and made a poor experience with a product a lot better. Besides the problem this season is great and the show just keeps getting better!
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|This is the best show on television.  The only qualms I had with season two were Lily's new hair color and Ted and Robin's season long relationship.  However, if you are a NPH fan like me you will be thoroughly entertained with all of Barney's awesomeness all season.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Not all of the songs went down well with the first listen.   After a week in the CD player, I think this is the best album since No More Tears.  It plays well all the way though and I am never reaching for the skip button.   Gus G is a great fit and a worthy predecessor to all the greats that have come before him.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I think anyone looking to buy this probably already knows that it's awesome... so all I have to say is \\"cheers\\" to you for putting it in your cart and go check out!  I have watched this DVD probably a hundred and one times and it gets better every time.  There isn't a sour note in the whole score and the one liners are sly and bitingly funny.  I have recommended this sing a long to everyone I know!
B001GJOL22|5.0|I just received my copy of this blu-ray disc. I was a little apprehensive buying this as there is no indication as to what audio format is used and that is VERY important to me as I do have a fairly nice theater setup. Unfortunately, little information is given neither here and on the blu-ray cover other than the cover showing the standard 5.1 surround icon and PCM stereo as well. Amazon has nothing and you guys (Amazon) should start trying to address this \\"problem\\" as some of us out here would like to know in advance what we should expect. I'm happy to report that this disc is supplied with the DTS HDMA lossless format and it sounds marvelous...... it looks great as well. For any of you who might have been holding off buying this blu-ray due to audio issues, hold off no longer. It sounds great and really exemplifies what \\"lossless\\" can do for your surround sound system.    Someone in another review stated that the bass was weak. I found that not to be the case and would suggest to the reviewer that he (or she) look into the bass management adjustments on their surround system or blu-ray player if it has the capability. I'm currently using an OPPO 83SE player and am running 7.1 analog out to my preamp. The OPPO does all the speaker management and am happy with the results which includes bass management.
156224003X|5.0|Kenny Werner's Effortless Mastery is a beautiful description of the joy of playing music from a relaxed, meditative state along with advice for achieving it. As many here have mentioned, he clearly explains the counterproductive thought processes which inundate the mind of most musicians; you'll think he's been inside your mind! I highly recommend this book to a musician of any instrument and style of music. In fact, the concepts are universal and are applicable to anything you do in life - sports, writing, etc. A MUST READ!
1594481717|3.0|my husband brought this book home for summer required reading for his job (he is an administrator in a public school district). being so hopelessly right-brained myself, i was delighted to notice it on his side of the bed ! :) don't know if i like the angle so much, which seems to be about 'getting ahead'  in the new competitive world (same old left brain movtivation), i LOVe that it encourages and values right brain activity. there's a part of me that figures whatever the motivation for developing the right brain, good (and perhaps unanticiapted) outcomes will flow, and any book that advocates art, play, empathy, story-telling and meaning- seeking, and beauty and makes it simply accessible to someone for whom these ideas are akin a foreign language, is a book i'd recommend. buy it for the left-brain thinkers in your world. for the right-brained folks, its a quick and easy, validating read.
B00335EQ0E|4.0|Comparable to the laserdisc release from several years ago, this 2-disc DVD edition of Alice has many extras and then some.  Some of the added value is hokey, but if you are looking for some insight as to Disney's love affair with Alice, look no further.  The mini-documentaries reveal Alice's creation, as far back as the silent Alice Comedies until the final product in 1951.  Mary Blair is referenced for her contributions as are other fine animators and artists.  Kathryn Beaumont is even on here revealing her history with both this picture and the the ensuing Peter Pan.<br /><br />What this film deserves is a re-mastered Blu-ray release.  It's warranted as many people enjoy this classic animated movie.  Even the historians interviewed on the supplemental material claim that this film is forever embedded in our pop culture consciousness.<br /><br />Since Snow White, Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty get the Blu-ray treatment, why not Alice?  And given Burton's success of his [[ASIN:B001HN6940 Alice in Wonderland [Blu-ray]]], I imagine a sequel is in the works, hopefully with some elements from Carroll's \\"Through The Looking Glass\\".
B001GKJ2F2|5.0|The DVD was in impeccable shape granted a little bruised on the edges but it was only 1.99! Though the shipping was 3 dollars so my total came out to around 6 dollars including tax and all. Regardless, it was a good deal and i would definitely buy again if needed.
B001HN694K|5.0|I was very impressed with this movie. Johnny Depp (terrible in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) was great. It is a little off-beat from the cartoon by Disney but I enjoyed this movie very much. I did not like the ending too much, I thought that she would meet Johnny Depp after she came back from Wonderland. I figured he would be a real person that she would fall in love with. I am a \\"Happy Ever After\\" romatic person. The story line was very good. The acting (by all participants) was very good also. This is a very good movie and well worth buying it. I am not sure about youngsters watching it. They might not understand it. It might frighten them (the monster at the end). But anyway, back to this movie, buy it by all means.
B000002I97|5.0|As I'm writing this, John Prine is on Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor. He sang \\"Hello In There\\", and I began crying again upon hearing the first few chords and lyrics, as I likely did the last time I heard this song so many years ago. How on earth did a 24-year old male write this achingly beautiful and compassionate song about aging? And there are so many other perfect songs on this classic album, with \\"Sam Stone\\" and \\"Angel from Montgomery\\" standing out most strongly. I've owned the album for 35 years, and I'm here now to buy the CD, partially for myself, but mainly so I can create copies for my 30-year old friends that may never discover this masterpiece on their own. If you have yet to delve into this gem, do yourself a favor and open yourself up to being swept away by the wit and humanity of John Prine at his best.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The DVD came as advertised. It was in great condiction and I am very happy with My purchase and I will purchase from these people again.
0571238343|5.0|I am very grateful for the infinite knowledge that gives us the mentor Richard Williams for completing its publication. Thanks ...
B003A4IFDW|5.0|Came across this CD and artist during an email from Amazon based on my previous purchases.  Love Bettye's voice and will add more of her work  to my collection. This lady has been performing for many years and I'm amazed I hadn't bought her work earlier.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|i read this book for summer reading at school. if not i wouldnt have read it. the beginning is very boring but the end picks up. but very sad.
B003405MF6|5.0|This CD is so amazing, Jeff's guitar work almost comes across as an actual voice at times.  Great CD.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|After watching \\"Kil Bill\\" pts 1 and 2, I am so in love with Uma Thurman!!<br />OK, the whole thing is a comic book, but I just love these two DVDs. I bought the DVDs thinking that my 1080p Toshiba would play them. It did not; so I bought a Sony Blu-Ray player thinking it would play on my ten year old TV. It would not. So, I bought a \\"ViewSonic\\" HDTV, all from Amazon! All is wonderful in my house now! I can't believe the detail of a Blu-Ray DVD on a HD television. You can count the pores on a girl's cheek. The movies are instant classics forever, and the only way to watch them is in Blu-Ray format on a High Definition TV. A+++!
0060245867|5.0|My 2-1/2 year old granddaughter loves this book!  There are few enough words on each page that she doesn't get eager to turn the page before you finish reading the current page.  The pictures are great and the storyline holds her attention.  It didn't take long for her to be able to tell the story herself.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|How great to have both a CD to listen to and a DVD to watch - love both the combo of CD/DVD and James Taylor/Carole King!
B002VECM6S|5.0|First of all Sandra Bullock is a great actress. The Blind Side is one of the best movies I seen.Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw play Mr. and Mrs. Tuohy who have two kids of their own when they come across a kid named Michael Oher. Michael is from the wrong side of the tracks. To get away from his home life he goes to the streets, and stays with poeple who are willing to take him in. that is how he meet the Tuohy's and they take him in to where Michael for the first time really feels save and he has a place to call home. There is a line in the movie where Sandra says \\" I dont know if I changed his, or if he's changed mine\\". This is a Must see....
B000R4SMD6|5.0|Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling were outstanding in this thriller--it was nice to see Ryan Gosling grown up and that he's a great young actor whether playing a villian or good guy.  Clever writing and a very intelligent criminal who is convinced he will get away with murder.  Loved this movie and recommend it to people who enjoy thrillers.
0316017922|4.0|Great read, will get through pretty fast. If you like this book i would also check out [[ASIN:1591842948 Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else]] very similar.
B003RO1NUC|5.0|Recovery is the best Album i have heard this year. One of the best I heard in a while. It must be good because I have not bought many complete albums in the past four five years. After hearing four/five of its tracks online, I said to myself you have buy his album. Glad i did because I am feeling most of the tracks on it.
0743455967|5.0|Entertaining... and informative I heard this as a recommendation off a popular tech podcast - I've never been a great writer, however i could always get my point across. Me personally, i'm a student of success, and who better to learn from than one of the greats?! Not a straight up, laid out, here is how i write well, try it and see what works... but it's weaved with his life story. Overall great nuggets of gold scattered throughout, and entertaining the whole way through. I would have given it 4 1/2 stars only because at some points Steven reading sounds a little bit tired (not the whole way through just little parts) but if i had to choose 4 or 5 i went with 5 stars... check it out and learn something.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is this best gay movie I have ever seen.  It touches something inside.  It shows what everyone gay or straight wants:  That is someone to love.  This is a completely believelable story of two men who happen to fall in love.  The drama. The action.  No nudity but it isn't needed. I would recommend that everyone watches this movie with their special someone as it should be shared with those you love.  It's no Brokeback, but I think that this is even better.  Trust me if you want a look into the real life of America this is it! Buy this now!!!!
0060763280|4.0|a good overall book i think it would be much better to attend one of his seminars... but if you dont have the time or the money... this is a great start. some ideas are rehash... but some are different, overall a good book, it doesn't just wet the appetite but gives some substance.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I read about this and was excited. I first heard Rush back when Grace Under Pressure came out. I remember the \\"Distant Early Warning\\" video. You know those MTV days, when Madonna was sexy, George Michaels was the man, and Prince was, well, Prince) As I got older Hemisphere, Moving Pictures, 2112, Exit Stage Left appeared in my cd collection. I'm a huge fan of documentaries, so there was no hesitation in buying this. I could not believe how much archive footage they had from their childhood. This really sucks you in and you are rooting for them the whole time. I can already see the producer's setting up the interview with Billy Corgan. I'll bet in 5 years they will rerelease this with a bonus Billy Corgan interview DVD. He always has an opinion! The bonus DVD rocked. Even if your a mediocre fan, you will really enjoy this. Geddy Lee is beyond amazing. Those bass riffs are insane, AND HE'S SINGING, AND PLAYING KEYBOARDS WITH HIS FEET!!!! They were not your typical band either. You never hear the clich&eacute; excess stories of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll with these guys. I thought it was cool to see Trent Reznor speak highly of them as well. Never saw that coming. Les Claypool gave awesome props. You just got to see this to really enjoy it. I paid a few extra bucks more and got a cool XL 1981 Moving Pictures Tour T-shirt. Really, the only downside to this dvd was that it really wasn't long enough!
0805091742|5.0|Before I ever heard of Atul Gawande or his WHO surgical checklist, I spent a decade in US Naval nuclear power. The operators there are held to excrutiatingly high standards. Every watchstation qualification requires perfect, verbatim rote memorization of all applicable emergency procedures. In addition, qualification exams always include a battery of questions about how the operator would handle various situations in which the standard procedures are untenable. Despite all this training, during every emergency, the Engineering Officer of the Watch and the Engineering Watch Supervisor (senior engineering personnel on watch), breakout the procedure and a grease pencil. They step through each required step and check it off. It was always so obvious to us that we didn't even have a name for it. That was our checklist.    In The Checklist Manifesto, Atul Gawande outlines the process by which the WHO surgical safety checklist was conceived, devised, tested, revised, and refined. Dr. Gawande demonstrates that complex scenarios breed error, and that the simple expedients of (1) running through a checklist and (2) making every team member equally responsible for the outcome, make positive outcomes far more likely. Through use of the WHO checklist, Gawande and his colleagues found that teamwork is fostered, infection rates drop, error rates drop, lives are improved, lives are saved. The cost of this incredible tool? Some paper, a pen, and ninety-seconds of questions.     The checklist is now available online at the WHO site, [...]. An Americanized version is available at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement at site [...] and some 1400 hospitals and surgical centers in the US have tried it out.     Sadly, two-thirds of the hospitals and surgical centers in the US have still NOT tried the checklist. Why? The only answer I've been able to find online is that some surgeons don't want anyone telling them how to do things in THEIR operating rooms. So, if you have surgery comingup, ask your doctor about the checklist. If he'd rather retain OR autonomy, you might want to look for a surgeon who's not quite so enamored of himself.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|It is simply too good. worth every penny you pay. Good Audio and video quality in Full HD. Very informative. David Attenborough's voice is very clear and crisp. It is one of my best collections to date. Most of the Nature stuff is normally 2.1 or simply stereo, not this one!!, this is True 5.1 Sound.
B000000OAN|5.0|Before buying this album, I had only heard Queen's greatest hits albums.  After reading some reviews, I decided to buy this album, and I'm glad I did.  It's a lot of fun to listen to!  I can easily recommend it!
0375846735|4.0|Whew! This was an exhilarating conclusion to the trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\"! Talk about action-packed. Let me preface this review by saying I liked \\"The Golden Compass\\" and \\"The Subtle Knife\\" very much (and the second book a bit more so than the first actually). In this third and final book in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, Pullman has impressed me yet again with his ability to deftly weave together so many moving parts--storylines, characters, themes/motifs (yes, including the theological ones, which are very prominent by the way)--and create a thrilling and cohesive fantasy novel. I very much enjoyed his development of all the central characters, especially Will and Lyra. The reason I cannot give this one five stars is two-fold. First, I thought the pacing or the first third or so of the book was 'off-kilter' somehow, and I didn't really get 'grabbed' by the story until about page 200 (and from then on, I could hardly put the book down!). Second (and warning: slight spoiler alert ahead if you read into it), I am just enough of a romantic that the end of the book really did bother me! But overall, I really did enjoy this novel. I would recommend it to young adults and adults who have already read and liked the first two books in the series and are yearning for more of Lyra and Will's adventures and discoveries!
B001FB55L2|4.0|Brothers was a very emotional movie but it's not so much a war movie but an intimate look at one family. Those expecting the normal blood & gore war movie may not get what they are looking for. I thought the acting was wonderful. I've never been a big fan of Tobey Maguire's but this was a side of him that I have not seen & I was happy to see him go to a character that is not the norm for him. I especially was moved by the acting of the older daughter. The emotion you see on her face for such a little girl was amazing.    I've read some of the past reviews mentioning PTSD & how this movie is unreal or anti-military. For anyone that bothered to watch the Special Features on the DVD, you will know this was originally a Danish movie that was remade in America. Second, even if you know someone who has suffered PTSD, doesn't mean you are an expert. As with any form of mental illness there are varying degrees. This wasn't some guy coming home from the war who was a little messed up in the head from watching people die. This was a man who suffered a traumatizing crash, was held as a POW, tortured, starved, etc. Every person handles these situations differently. It's also been proved that people who suffer head trauma can suffer from worse cases. Since this Marine was in a crash it could very well be he suffered a hard hit to the head. There are cases of soldiers that come home & kill loved ones. These are the extreme cases, like in this movie, the cases that are very few but can happen. This movie helps to show you more then just the blood & gore part of war, it shows what can happen to our soldiers when they come home if we don't take care of them. If we expect them to \\"be a man\\" & brush themselves off & go back to their lives as if nothing happened. The least we owe them is to make sure they are ok when they come home. Is that anti-American? I sure as hell hope not.
0307269752|2.0|I don't mind it being gruesome and violent, I just found it boring and terribly written.  It really shocks me that this is the book that has everyone talking.  There are SUCH BETTER books out there, with less transparent plots, with characters that are at least two-dimensional enough to sit on the page without looking like badly combined words.  Books that a couple of friends could actually talk about over a bottle of wine.  With this book, what could you talk about?  What could you think about?  It's just boring and lame.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because there was a fleeting part somewhere in the middle where it was intriguing enough that I wasn't forcing myself to read.
B002JCSWVG|4.0|The movie attempts to capture the essence of book and takes some poetic license for the sake of moving the story along. The portrayal of Mandela by Morgan Freeman was excellent. If you grew up drying the era when apartheid was in place in South Africa was enforced then you will relate to the events in the movie and the joy when the Boks win. The movie does a credible joy of the 747 flyby which really did occur. The movie could not do justice to the excellent book by John Carlin and the movie doesn't try, read the book iif you want to read about the actual events that led to Mandela's release and his decision to use the Rugby World Cup to unify his country.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Two suggestions, get the David Attenborough version not the Oprah version. Why they get a different narrator when they bring these BBC documentaries to America is beyond me. David is the best. Second, skip the first episode: Challenges of Life. Everything that is on that episode you will see later on in the other eight episode. Found that annoying. That said, it was a wonderful documentary. Almost as good as Planet Earth.
B00004SC3M|4.0|We watched most of this movie when it was on television and enjoyed it so much, we bought it.  It is an action movie.  Sean Connery is a master thief.  When a Rembrandt is stolen, the insurance company sends its most cunning investigator Catherine Zeta-Jones to investigate.  There is a lot of cat and mouse and different turns and a somewhat surprise ending.  It is a great movie.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I'm not sure what I can add that others have not. Probably nothing. Except to say this book is one of the best books I've ever read. The richness of the characters - the way that life flows on around them. The intriguing mystery and the absorption of Henrik in a lifelong quest for the truth. The evil that men do. And women.<br /><br />I did not find it slow at all. Many friends told me to stick with it that it does pick up. Perhaps my degree in Finance helped me here but I was never confused nor did it appear slow to me. I was utterly enthralled from page 1. I immediately downloaded the second book. In fact I'm cutting this review short to go and read. I'm positively giddy with the idea that I have 2 more Larsson books to read. I'm sure I'll cry at the end - for there are no more. adj&ouml;.
0439023483|5.0|This is a great book. I could not put it down. It is nice to use your imagination while reading for once. As a parent, I highly reccomend this book for young adults. This will make young readers think about how lucky they are to live in the US compared to what alot of other young children their age go through in different parts of the world.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|One of the best films I've seen lately. I didn't know what to expect from this movie I thought it was a horror film, but its not. Great acting and story. I rented this, but will buy once the price comes down. I'd recommend it
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Great blu-ray......but, delivery cost £7.20.....then had to pay £12.75 customs charges!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Complete rip off!!!!!!!  I've learnt my lesson not to buy from the states.
0385341008|5.0|I absolutely love this novel and am broken hearted the author cannot write more.  I have recommended it to everyone I know and all have also loved it.  What a unique story, told in a unique way.  You get into all the characters and care about them deeply.  And I learned a great deal along the way.  I finished this books months ago but still think about the characters on a regular basis- truly a special gift for anyone who reads it.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|we have bought Life for a gift a number of times and everyone has loved it.
0312370849|5.0|I will not restate so much about what the book is about as many others have already done so.  But is is a wonderful book and I loved how the story was told...it kept my interest, made me care about the characters and again learned along they way.  Another book I have recommended to many of my friends as I think it deserves all the readers it can get.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|This is a must for any music lover especially if you like a bluesy sound. This guy is great. I can almost see BB King in him! He must be an old soul in a young body.
B001TZQITM|5.0|This case is a perfect fit for a Sony HDR-CX550V camcorder with the Sony NP-FV70 (larger) battery attached. I am not sure the NP-FV100 would fit while attached as it is a nice snug fit with the  NP-FV70 battery. You could still store the larger 100 battery beneath the adjustable neoprene floor for the camcorder if need be.  I use the front pocket for the Sony travel charger model BC-TRV and a couple spare memory cards (not much room for anything else). In one of the side pockets I store my original NP-FV50 battery (will also fit the NP-FV70 battery...one battery at a time). I don't use the other side pocket but it would also hold another NP-FV70 battery if you happen to have two. FYI, the BC-TRV travel charger will not fit in either side pocket, you must use the front pocket. This bag is well made and I am quite happy with it. It arrived quickly and with no problem from Amazon. If you have the HDR-CX550V Sony camcorder you will not be disappointed in this bag. It is handsome and well built.    My HDR-CX550V is (five and five eighths inches long) 5 5/8inches long with the NP-FV70 battery attached.
B0039ZF89G|3.0|Let me start by saying that I have been a big Stones fan since the mid-1970's. I saw them live here in Chicago in 1978 and 1981 and am a die-hard as well as a semi-profesional musician. In my opinion, the last time (no pun intended) the Stones were top shelf was 1978, as \\"Tattoo You\\" was mostly 1970's outtakes. Having said that, here are my comments on the CD reissue of \\"new/old\\" tunes:    -Pass The Wine-Known as \\"Sophia Loren\\" on bootlegs. Mick Jagger stopped singing and started barking in 1976 on \\"Black And Blue\\" and this 2009 or 2010 overdubbed vocal testifies to that. This is a mediocre backing track dressed up for release. Is that overdubbed Mick Taylor and horns here? Horrible overdubbed Mick Jagger harmonica, if you can call it that! If Mick wants to discuss his vocals and harp over a Gibson's steak on his dime that would be fine with me.    -Plundered My Soul-This is easily the best cut on the \\"new/old\\" CD. The Taylor intro, whether from 1971 or 2009, is excellent. Vocal, obviously from 2009 or 2010, is quite good. The Keith Richards rhythm riffs, certainly from 1971, are exceptional in the in-the-pocket \\"Tumbling Dice\\" style. Taylor's fine lead riffs are all over the track.    -I'm Not Signifying-Very familiar from boots. Original vocal and overdubbed piano intro. Mick Taylor's blues riffs are exceptional, but the track (and riffs) is/are shortened. Interesting chord progression. Overdubbed harp is obnoxious. Horns on the outro are reminiscent of Elmo Bishop's Alligator work.     -Following The River-Nice ballad, again marred by Mick Jagger's 2009 vocals. Backup vocals and strings also sound current.    -Dancing In The Light-Having listened to this on boots for 30 years, the 2009 vocals seem curious. The lyrics, however, are interesting. Great to hear that rollicking piano again! The barking on the outro is disconcerting.    -So Divine (\\"Aladdin Story\\" to Stones heads)-Slightly reminiscent of \\"Paint It Black\\"? Another 2009 vocal. Overdubbed Mick Taylor riffs at around 2:30? Did the rest of the boys OK this release?     -Loving Cup-This is the boot version many of us know, with \\"GD drunk\\" replaced. Nice guitar interplay, which the band seemingly forgot in later years.    -Soul Survivor-This embarrassing take of Keith's drunken/stoned ramblings over the released backing track should never have seen the light of day.       -Good Time Women-Great Keith/Mick J./Mick T. intro riff familiar to us as an early version of \\"Tumbling Dice\\". Unlike \\"Tumbling Dice\\", Mick Taylor's lead and riffs are all over this track. Second best on the CD by a long shot.    -Title 5-What is this crap? My wife likes it but I am unimpressed. Why release this?    Also, the alternate version of \\"All Down The Line\\" is available on the 45 if you track it down. There are also other unreleased cuts that could have been put on this CD!
0375701427|2.0|I am wading through this book because a book group to which I belong will be discussing it. The book is overly long and tedious, but you can't skip sections because you never know when a sentence or two will come along that finally moves the story forward. When Roth gets back to the story, rather than getting bogged down in details about the decline of Newark, about manufacturing gloves, and other side issues, the story is quite gripping and very upsetting. It it based on real events, but engenders little sympathy for the participants in the riots of the 60's & 70's and their families.  I think he had enough naterial for a long short story or perhaps a novelette, but insisted on stretching it out over 423 pages.
0515141429|3.0|Killing Floor starts out strong. I like how Reacher is thrown into the middle of a murder from the get-go. Then he's sent to jail over the weekend with the guy who might have done it. The jail sequence gives us some great exposition of what a tough guy Reacher is. I love how things are unveiled piece by piece over these first 10 or so chapters.<br /><br />But in the middle there are stumbling blocks. Number One: It turns out the conspiracy that Reacher is unravelling involves LITERALLY EVERYONE in the small town of Margrave, GA...that is, everyone but the two cops (one of them home-grown) who are helping Reacher out. This alone should alert the reader that it's amateur hour.<br /><br />Number Two: When the Treasury Department finds out that two of its high-ranking agents are dead, it shouldn't take them five days to respond. (However, if they did respond as you would expect them to, the book would be shorter by half.)<br /><br />Number Three: Reacher's \\"induction\\" rivals that of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin and removes a lot of credibility from the work. For example, knowing what he knows about a man whom he met only a week earlier, Reacher is able to guess not only where the man is hiding out, but also what false name he is using. It is such a stretch that Lee Child justifies Reacher's superhuman logic through a long, belabored explanation that only makes it more absurd.<br /><br />A good book with fun characters and great pacing, but marred by the kind of fundamental flaws you would expect from a first-time published novelist.
B002OQYVJ4|5.0|This is my perpetual advice: When musicians of this caliber offer a bonus disc in a special edition with a new recording, always buy it. Especially if the additional cost is only a couple of dollars. In the case of Transatlantic, you already know that what they choose to record is going to be worthwhile, and in the case of The Whirlwind, it certainly is!<br />Fans of the supergroup have waited many years for this album. Now that its here, its time to rejoice. Most fans already know that Neal Morse and Roine Stolt are openly Christian. It is quite likely that Mike Portnoy and Pete Trewavas are as well. Despite some sniveling about Christian references by those inclined to look for them like censors parsing every phrase for any hint of what they so detest, Transatlantic manages to steer clear of any overt declarations of Christian faith. But the lyrics do reflect the moral sensibilities of the musicians who comprise the band and are both vaguely reverent and positively joyous in tone.<br />The Whirlwind is a glorious twelve-part progressive opus that is spectacular in scope and quite stupendous musically. It certainly covers a lot of musical territory in its more than an hour and a quarter in length. The more times you listen, the more you will hear something you missed the last time around. One thing you'll hear is that each musician has an equal voice in shaping the music. What each brings to Transatlantic from their \\"day jobs\\" makes this an unforgettable album and easily one of the best progressive albums of the new millenium.<br />The second disc is a treat you shouldn't miss just to save a couple of dollars. On it, Transatlantic covers four songs written by members of the group, one Genesis tune, one from Procol Harum, one from Santana, and an America/Beatles medley. Additionally, there is a short \\"secret\\" song at the end not mentioned in the package. Of these, my favorites are the covers of Procol Harum's A Salty Dog and Santana's Soul Sacrifice.<br />This satisfying package includes an attractive booklet containing the lyrics and a picture and statement from each of the group's members. More pictures and album information are included on the six-panel digipak that houses the booklet and the two discs. If you like progressive rock, this is a mandatory acquisition. Get this special edition while its still reasonable and still available.cludes an attractive booklet containing the lyrics and a picture and statement from each of the group's members.

B000K7VHH8|3.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU-RAY ISSUE ***<br /><br />I have to admit to a guilty pleasure on this one - I've always liked the wonderfully cheesy \\"Entrapment\\" - especially the slightly odd yet very convincing chemistry between the young and beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones and the old but still incredibly sexy Sean Connery. You genuinely feel that Connery fancies Jones and she likewise - and apparently that was the case. You can see that Connery actually likes and admires her and it gives the film a great dynamic - enjoying themselves rather than just grinning and bearing it.<br /><br />Which is a shame, because I was hoping that this would be a decent buy on BLU RAY, but it isn't.<br /><br />The principal reason is not the film itself (which is very entertaining), but the way it was filmed. There's a sort of filtered haze over at least 75% of the print (possibly hiding someone's age my dear?) that now looks even worse - accentuated by its transfer to the mercilessness of High Def. The picture isn't crap, but it's NOT 1080P DEFINED either - and it's absolutely NOT AN IMPROVEMENT over say a dirt-cheap DVD. \\"Entrapment\\" on BLU RAY looks murky and poorly executed most of the time - and for a film that was issued in 1999, that's just not good enough.<br /><br />The Extra Feature is a commentary by Director Jon Amiel, but that's all (no making of, no interviews). Presentation is in Letterbox 16:9 (so it fills the full screen) and languages include French, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Dutch and English For The Hard-Of-Hearing.<br /><br />I'd say hire this before you buy it. In a slew of badly transferred movies to this great, but sometimes frustrating format, this is yet another sloppy reissue.<br /><br />One to avoid I'm afraid.
B00097E4A6|5.0|OK, others provided reviews of the fun.  I want to provide additional useful information in my review.<br /><br />First, I selected the LEGO Duplo trains for our son because they are very high quality and not as expensive as other wooden push trains.  And of course, they work with everything else that is LEGO, making the value so much greater.  He can mix and match pieces from all his other LEGO Duplo stuff.<br /><br />The bridge looks impressive and it is big for a toddler toy.  Be sure you have enough track and floor space to make this work well for you.  If you only buy this bridge and a Duplo train set, you may not have enough track.<br /><br />Consider buying several boxes of  [[ASIN:B0000WS4FG LEGO Duplo 2734 straight track]] and at least one [[ASIN:B000TVBIYC LEGO Duplo 3775 switches]] and 2735 curved track to add to what you have with a Duplo train set, such as the [[ASIN:B001XUS9PO LEGO Duplo Legoville Deluxe Train Set (5609)]].<br /><br />You can also use any of the push trains (esp. Thomas and Friends series while you can find them) with this bridge, but the Duplo motorized locomotive is excellent, and is proof that toys can be designed and built to work properly and last for years.<br /><br />The bridge is designed with cogs in the 'rails' (really wheel gutters) so that the motorized Duplo engine can climb the bridge approach without slipping.<br /><br />The educational benefit for this bridge is primarily two things I've observed:<br />learning to assemble a complex structure by following the illustrations on the box, and learning about clearances for trains going under the bridge or over the bridge through the plastic girder truss structure.  And there is great potential to re-purpose the bridge components for other things with Duplo parts.  This continues almost two years after purchase, unlike almost any other toy set he has.<br /><br />The illustration on the cover shows every individual piece (separate and assembled in three configurations) so that you can encourage your young child to carefully check the picture to figure out how to assemble it.  It's not obvious, but it's not any harder than any other LEGO Duplo item.<br /><br />If you have enough track to allow the train to pass under the bridge as well as over it, then your child can learn about oversized loads on the freight cars and what will fit and what won't.  This is play, but it is educational play in my view, that makes this kind of toy worth the money.  If you can't acquire it at retail prices then you may need to pay a premium.  These are hard to find.  I got mine right here at Amazon. (I can't offer advice on the value per dollar, just on the toy itself in the context of LEGO Duplo trains.)<br /><br />Advice:  don't discard the box -- the illustration is useful for assembly.<br />Keep the pieces for this bridge segregated from the rest of the train set when put away.  I use a ziplock bag to put the small blocks in, and the large pieces go in the box.  If all the pieces get mingled with every other set, then it won't be likely that the bridge will assemble as illustrated.  Your child can always substitute different colors and shapes to get the required lift, but the blocks that come are perfect and unique for this purpose.you can encourage your young child to carefully check the picture to figure out how to assemble it.

0756655730|5.0|This book lures you in, not only with the unbeilievable photographs, but also with the vast amount of information and species richness it includes. It's worth so much more than the price on here. I highly recommend this book from the curious minds to the professional scientists!

B001HN694K|1.0|Once there lived a man named Tim Burton who created magical worlds and stories such as \\"Beetlejuice\\", \\"Batman Returns\\", \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", and \\"Charlie and Chocolate Factory.\\" These films films dropped you into a world and sucked you into the plot. You were able to connect with the characters and felt like you were inside the world of the films I listed above. When the technology of computer generated imagery alias 'CGI', come around, it changed the structure of story telling and film making...for the good? Well all I can say is I feel some directors have been abusing CGI and when I watch these over grossed CGI films I don't feel connect with the film or characters as much (I'm for CGI but only when used as a story teller (ex. \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", \\"Tin Man\\",\\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\" and \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" for a few.) Tim Burton has fallen into the technology trap that George Lucas did on the \\"Star Wars Prequels\\" and has many other film makers. Burton's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a film that could have been really good, but fails to live up to my expectations as a big lover of the original novel by Lewis Carrol.     Oh yes, speaking of the original novel \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" Burton's adaptation, if its a adaptation at all, is poorly developed. It takes what Mr. Carrol originally created as an innocent children story and distorts it into a complicated action plot with silly dialog and un-logical references to the original novel. By the way, what is up with filling wonderland with action scenes and a underground resistance? WHEN DID WONDERLAND TURN INTO NARINA???    I have heard that some people thought the film focused too much on the Mad Hatter, but in all honesty, I thought it focused too  on that god annoying Red Queen played by Helena Charter. I now she is Burton's domestic partner, but what the hell is up with him always casting her in his films? I mean good grief! Whenever Burton comes out with a film nowadays that he directed I already know who is going tobe in the film, Johnny Depp and Helena Charter, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO MICHAEL KEATON?? why did they break up after \\"Batman Returns?\\" that was great film. I didn't enjoy watching the film either, well that is too say really enjoyed the opening of the film. The scenes that took place in England (before Alice fell down the rabbit hole) was really well photographed, and the part when Alice falls down the rabbit hole was entertaining to say the least, but after she enters Wonderland it started to get ridiculous. As I watched the film I was comparing it to Burton's '80s and '90s films.     I have become spectacle of Burton. He is now only doing films for Disney and I understand he is on contract to direct of live action version of Malificent, which will be a retelling of Cinderella. Oh no, hell no. why doesn't he just retire, he hasn't really done anything really good since \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" I liked \\"Charlie the Chocolate Factory\\" but he is slipping and needs to retire for heaven's sake. To summarize this awfully long review, I will just say to skip this film and watch a older Burton film.
B000066744|5.0|Upon searching through the long and windy halls of Netflix Watch Instantly one day, I came across this film with a premise that intrigued me. Two hours and five minutes later, speechless throughout most of the movie, I decided that it was not only one of the best dramas I had ever seen, but one of the best films I'd ever seen. Truly, The Legend is a 1900 is one of the most beautiful and moving films in modern film history, an overlooked classic, and a tribute to the Piano in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon 1900 was found orphaned, most likely born to and forgotten by immigrant parents, aboard the Virginian a luxury steamliner much like the Titanic, by a steam room worker. He took in the child as his own and named him Danny Boodmann (After himself) T.D. Lemon (After the advertisement on the box he was found in) 1900 (After the year he was found in). He is a man without a birthday, he is a man without a country, he is a man born to The Virginian. 1900 proceeds to live out his childhood in the ship, learning about the world and the languages of the passengers until one day, the crew discovers he's a piano virtuoso, and soon after that, he becomes part of the ships orchestra, as word of his talent is spread by anybody that has ever heard him. Occasionally, the film also flashes forward to around 1945, where The Virginian is being prepped to be scrapped after World War 2, but with 1900 still aboard, and his friend Max's efforts to get him off.<br /><br />Being the only English-language film of the Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore, the film is incredibly beautiful to look at. The striking beauty of the ship is one of the most stunning aspects, choosing to accent backdrops and provide a unique setting for the proceedings. The cinematography of the film is so well-done, as is with the rest of the film, I'm very disappointed that this was Tornatore's only English work, since his use of the language of the film is also very well done, considering most of the crew, including the screenwriters I believe, were Italian. But not only is the film striking as a whole, there's just so many memorable scenes in here that are simply brilliant in the way they are composed and played out. And what do all but two of these 7 or 8 scenes that stick out in my mind have in common? All of them involve the piano. I'm not a big fan of classical music by any means, but the instrumental works, and the way they're shown on screen is unequivocally magnificent. Composed mostly by Ennio Morricone, this is truly one of the aspects that makes the film stand out for me.<br /><br />Tim Roth leads out the cast played by relative unknowns to my mind, and he gives the performance of a career. After watching this film, I came out with a great deal of respect for Roth as he displayed acting talent I didn't even know he was capable of. He sells every aspect of 1900 perfectly. Whether it's the humorous side of the character, the quite side, the peaceful side, the cursing side, the romantic side, or the speech-making side, Roth makes you invested in the character, as if the character development in the movie weren't enough. I don't know if Roth actually learned to play the piano for this movie, but he sold me on that too. Pruitt Taylor Vince also plays the character of Max well, and even though he isn't asked to do all that much, he did a fine job portraying his lifelong friendship with 1900.<br /><br />I don't want to use the word \\"beautiful\\" too much in this review, but it aptly describes this movie. Some have called it epic, but it's only epic in its emotions. This movie will valiantly attempt to bring tears to your eyes, laughter, and everything in between. There's a particular scene where 1900 comes to accept his fate the only way he knows how, by playing the piano. But in this scene, there is no piano to play, so he plays air piano. But instead of cheesy, it's touching. There's no words needed to tell the audience the gravity of this scene and this moment, but you feel it. And that's what a movie should do. It should make you feel. It's only a couple hours long, but those couple of hours were all that I needed to be turned into an emotional wreak.el it. And that's what a movie should do.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|this is a movie about extremely odd people who are very aware of said weirdness but do not care if people hate them, do not understand them, they are gonna be who they are and that is that. The moon boots, fanny packs,iron on t shirt decals,all reminded me of my childhood ( I had some of the clothes deb wore when I was a kid and my cousin had a fro like napoleons in the 80's and the shirts too. Come to think of it, he kind of looked like napoleon..... I am not kidding. Also if you grew up in the sticks and went to a small school ,and had really strange friends and family you will laugh your ass off. I love Napoleon's weird job with the farmer and his fake girlfriend and his fondness for tator tots. :)
0385751893|4.0|My daughter had to write a book report on this book.  She read the book first and then we watched the movie.  (She says there are many differences). I thought the movie was a child-like interpretation of WWII Germany/Poland described in an innocent enough way that it could be understood by youth.  Adults will know the underlying story is much more horrific.  It is a story of a friendship that defies boundaries at a time when boundaries were very defined-- all told with a 9 year old's viewpoint.
B003L16FAE|4.0|I bought this expecting another incredibly disappointing transfer since the DVD was absolutely horrible.  The DVD looked as though the film had been practically been recorded off a VHS tape.  This Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu-ray, however, has a crystal clear image.  For the life of me, I do not understand the people who are complaining that it is too clear.  If you're happy with grainy, prehistoric images -- watch the VHS or the original DVD release.  If you bought a Blu-ray player because you appreciate High Definition and clarity, this Blu-ray is for you.  I've been incredibly disappointed with some other Blu-ray releases of older movies, but this release of Predator is a reminder that it IS possible to do an older film justice.
B002L9N4DS|3.0|Great blu-ray transfer! One of the best Tom Hanks movie!<br /><br />Although my copy came without the slipcover :(
0375714839|2.0|The last sentence on p. 153 is \\"It would have been better to just go.\\" The author should have stopped at that point. The first part is compelling: world history from the point of view of a kid. The rest is immaturity of that child and young woman, and nothing but that. The portrayal of Austria is ridiculous. Psychological motivations: absent. Or as confused as the person depicted. The plot too complicated for a comic: nuns, and punks, French and Austrian people, 1980s culture in Europe vs. Iranian culture, etc. The story morphs more and more into a personal account of coming of age that has only incidental relation to historic events. Example: the absence of the international, specifically US, intervention in Iraq in 1991 (pp. 320-24). As for inconsistency: the parents are filthy rich, and nothing explains that in spite of the young woman's class concern? As for lack of motivation: after all that has been said, how could a young woman possibly denounce an innocent stranger (p. 285 ff.: The Makeup)!
B00382X4X2|5.0|The original Hammersmith Odeon show (which is the bonus disc here) came out in a limited edition run of 5000 copies and it sold out in TWO HOURS. It's gotten rave reviews all over the web, and has sold for lots of money since then. Happily this is another version, sonically the same, and a good remaster of the original album. But the live disc is strong, far more powerful than Live Evil (which is great, too). Dio sings the Ozzy songs SO much better here than on Live Evil, and Country Girl is WAY better than the studio version. If only they'd done \\"Southern Cross\\" at Hammersmith...
B002ZG997C|5.0|Exellent. This is a great movie,in a world almost destroyed by man, the faith of the book that Eli strives to bring west is the faith of all mankind. Little is known about the book,except that to own it(the last of it's kind)would give the bearer the knowledge of the world. I say buy this one, you wont regret it.
0517548232|2.0|This book has two major problems.    One, its title is misleading.  You think you are getting a quick, shortened version of an economics class, but what you are really getting is a conservative, free market view of the economy.  If the title had been, Reasons Why The Free Market Is Better For The Economy, I would have a lot less problem with this book.  Balanced, Hazlitt is not, and he takes a lot of potshots at Keynes with only the occasional quick nod to the problems the free market can run into.  It's not that I disagree with a lot of his arguments, it's that you don't get both sides.    Two, it's out of date.  It was written in the 1940's.  Oh, it's been updated alright.  In the 1970's.  A lot of economic events have occurred since the 1970's and the conservative view has some explaining to do.    If you really want a balanced view of the economy you can check out <50 Economic Ideas You Really Need to Know>.  It's balanced, although a bit scatter shot.  For a pretty balanced book, but with a left lean, try <Economics Explained> by Heilbroner and Thurow, it tells a more cohesive story than 50 Ideas.
B003AO1SVS|2.0|I had been wondering for a while why this album sounds completely cramped and cluttered in my living room hi-fi sound system and I found out an hour ago at the gym : this album's mix is optimized for iPods and similar devices! In my iPod equipped with standard Apple earbuds everything found its rightful place and the production worked perfectly.    Don't get me wrong : I am not complaining about the lo-fi sound. I am currently listening to Iggy & The Stooges' Raw Power (Bowie mix) in my living room and it sounds just fine in all its glorious messiness. I listen to a lot of lo-fi music and, in most cases, even badly recorded music sounds better on a high-end system.    What I am complaining about is that this album is mixed in a way that makes it sounds optimal when heard through 20$ headphones, apparently without concern for how it sounds through better equipment.     As far as I can tell, my comment applies to all Black Keys albums. At least it appears the Black Keys aren't releasing 180 grams audiophile vinyl editions of this record, like they did with their previous ones, which is an aburdity. Putting out expensive audiophile editions of this type of sound mix is a ripoff.     I understand the point of making the music sound optimal on what represents today's  most common mean of listening to music, but why don't they make two mixes : one for iTunes downloads and another one for higher-end music reproduction and posterity?    I think the music itself deserves 4 stars.
B003L16FAE|4.0|If you had the Ultimate edition on DVD, you're not missing much. The only reason why I picked it up was that I got it at Best Buy for 14.99. I can live with that...
B00110K62U|5.0|Les Miserables is one of my favorite musicals and when this first came out on VHS, I purchased it immediately.  Loved it.  When it came out on DVD (it was one DVD at the time with two sides), I bought that as well.  I loved that, mainly because the sounds was a lot better than the VHS.  The only thing I didn't really like was the fact that there were no extras on it.  I then found this version and was ecstatic because I found out that it had the \\"Stage by Stage: The Making of Les Miserables.\\"  I had never seen this before but had heard about it.  It's great and really makes this DVD worth buying.  This 2 disc DVD comes with a booklet as well (mainly containing pictures of the 10th Anniversary Concert & the summary of the show).<br /><br />I also love the fact that the entire show is on one DVD; you don't have to get up and turn the DVD over after act I is finished.  Definitely a plus for me.  And of course there's the cast.  They really chose the best people who had been in the show before to play all the roles.  Colm Wilkinson is the *best* Jean Valjean I have ever seen (and heard).  Phillip Quast is magnificent as Javert.  I remember having heard him on the complete symphonic recording.  Lea Solonga and Ruthie Henshall only made this concert even better.  Their voices are beautiful.  And of course having Michael Ball reprise his role as Marius was perfect.  I kind of wish Patti LuPone had been chosen to play Fantine, but Ruthie is excellent.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic DVD of the 10th anniversary concert.  I only wish they had done another concert for the 20th anniversary!
B002ZG97RE|5.0|This is a modern film dealing with the Iraq war, and how our people are often sent on missions that are in fact non-missions. A must see.
B002ZG99CC|2.0|This movie is a Will Smith adaptation to the old karate kid. However, here are some random thoughts:    1. I'm watching it and I see no reason why anyone in their right mind would watch it in the theater. I mean I've heard that it had some great views of China, but I don't see what they're talking about at all, there's nothing worth noting.    2. Jackie Chan....has no charisma. I'm sorry but he will never look or sound as wise as Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi. Jackie Chan also comes off as a pedophile IMO. Some scenes were a bit awkward. Something is unsettling when a grown up man is screaming at a 12 year? old boy to \\"take it off!\\", \\"put it on!\\" , \\"take it down!\\". I know I'm probably inserting a thought that wasn't really intended by the movie, but the lines don't work with the likes of Jackie Chan. Mr. Miyagi is much better in this role because he just seems like a nice grandfather like figure. Jackie Chan just doesn't suit that role. Jackie Chan's acting in this movie IMO is not that good. I find his acting to be highly unconvincing and the part where he cried in the car about his family just left me trying to keep myself from laughing instead of actually feeling bad as it did in the original.    3. I am not too fond of Will Smith's son. He just looks too much like a ghetto hoodlum with abnormally large ears. I am highly fond of the dad, I'm just having problems getting my eyes adjusted to his kid. I don't appreciate his hair style, it doesn't look good on him IMO. He doesn't look like a nice kid, he looks like a little thug wanna be, which is another reason why I find it hard to cheer him on. The scene near the end, he looks a lot like his dad!    4. Pray to god that the little girl in the movie that's attached to the main character grows up to be as hott as her mom.    5. There is no feeling of attachment to the character or the story. Because of the above thought, I find it hard to side with Smith or Chan in this movie. Chan just looks like he's trying too hard. Hewill never have the kind of charm and charisma as Pat.    6. Dre's mom is pretty hott but am I the only one that thinks the clothes she usually wears in this movie is a bit flashy? Hopefully she did not go all the way to China to become a......    7. The take-jacket-off-put-it-back-on method that Jackie Chan uses to teach Smith is too bogus. I mean it might teach him some techniques, but in order to block quick consecutive attacks, you need much more. You need actual fighting experience otherwise everyone around the world would just use that technique to teach instead....      So in general, this movie is alright but I don't appreciate this remake much. Love the dad, hopefully one day the son will be at least half as good. The do like the ending fight scenes a bit more, but there just seems to be some gaps in the plot, especially when compared side by side to the old version.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD is great! Lots of the best Beatles songs (27 I believe?), and its a really good price. Much cheaper than a store like iTunes would charge (although you can't buy the Beatles on iTunes anyway). If you like the Beatles even a little bit, you'll like this CD.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|If you liked DEVO in the 80's then you'll love this CD. Wacky lyrics and quirky music just like the old days - but better.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I agree this is wonderful but Leonard shows uncharacteristic misjudgement by introducing the band members too often after solos. It breaks the mood and trance of the songs. Otherwise this is wonderful stuff and his other live albums (from 1993 and 1979) are tremendous too (without the ad nauseum intros).  When I saw him in San Jose he had cut back on the interupting intros and let the music speak for itself. (and he added Famous Blue RainCoat/ The Partisan/ Waiting For a Miracle)--so it was pure perfection. I wish that had been the recorded concert.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|Leaving the movie description to other more able reviewers, I won't repeat anything.  Let me just say I am seeing it for about the fifth or sixth time and my eyes still well with tears of emotion when I see that troubled nation magically changing by the sheer will of the great statesman Nelson Mandela. He managed to draw all peoples together and change the flag and the nation to multi-color, and he managed to win the Springboks over before they won the 1995 World Cup. If I could be granted a wish to have been anywhere in the past 20 years, it would be attending that great game in Ellis Stadium in Johannesburg, the last bastion of Afrikanerdom, just to watch that game, the mighty Springboks versus the feared New Zealand All-Blacks (so named after the color of their uniforms). I'd see the old Boer \\"bitter-ender\\" descendants of hard-line Afrikaner voortrekkers playing rugby and fathers and sons of apartheid hugging and being hugged by peoples of all colors and persuasions during and after the game when their countrymen won the World Cup. I'd hear people of all tribes, colors, and religions cheering and shouting Mandela's name and see that game. I'd hear alack, white, and every color of men, women, and children sing \\"Nkosi Sikelele' iAfrica\\", the cherished song of black freedom. The film is true to life by director Clint Eastwood. But oh to be in old J'burg just to see the Springboks win the World Cup Rugby and the great president Mandela in his Springbok jersey and cap, smiling from ear to ear, as he presented the World Cup to the Captain of the Springboks, which by his sheer force of will he made the whole country's team, no longer exclusive to Afrikaners.      Immediately after seeing this movie I googled Francois Pienaar and got him on You-Tube talking to and about Mandela and ended up buying the book \\"Playing the Enemy\\", by John Carlin, which moved me even more. It reassured me of the authenticity of the film. The 'Boks winning that day was the crowning moment forSouth Africa not just in sporting events but the culmination and beginning of Mandela's \\"One Team, One Country\\" idea which both shocked, surprised, and pleased all citizens (mostly themselves) by their own reactions.     President Nelson Mandela is played most ably by Morgan Freeman,and in voice, accent, and and gesture--he is  authentically Mandela). Francois Pienaar, the Afrikaans Captain of the Springboks is played by Matt Damon (of Bourne fame) with a very authentic Afrikaans accent and a fierce rugby-playing skill, though only 5'11\\" not 6'4\\" is very believable and played a strong Captain. He was big in soul and a convincing Captain and you could see Damon was playing great rugby. I'am sure the real Pienaar was pleased. The first meeting between Pienaar and Mandela, like everything in the film, is based on fact. I had no inkling that these incidents had ever occurred. How I managed to miss this is beyond someone who has been following South African politics and reading all she could since the mid-sixties. But this film is about more than a game, it is the magic of Mandela and his shrewd and wise perception that sports can be a uniting force, and he played it for all it was worth, and the beginning of a great, united South Africa came to be, and at a very pivotal point in South Africa's history.     Of course there is much more than the Springboks game involved in this film. As in real life, there was more to Mandela's presidency ending apartheid, and his most herculean task was to draw all peoples together in a spirit of forgiveness, redemption, and the Afrikaner Springboks represented all Afrikaners in this effort, and that was key in succeeding.  Mandela believes that sometimes in order to create a new nation people have to work with people they don't like, or even trust!       In the film, Mandela gives a poem to the Springbok Captain. \\"Invictus\\", the famous poem by William Ernest Henley and though it's not mentioned in Mandela's own autobiography or even inthe book \\"Playing the Enemy,\\" Eastwood takes a liberty by making it Mandela's comfort and strength while in prison. It may well have been so, as it is for anyone who lives under such horrible conditions.     Please, please, if you like the film, buy the book on Amazon, as well. It is even better to read and savor.  I will be reviewing the book as well.

I ended up buying it out of excitement for life but after about twenty minutes realized i got the short end of the stick, oprah is lacking in factual information as well is a real bore. I actually bought the other version with david on amazon SO MUCH BETTER and oprahs version is collecting dust. Tried a million trillion times to get this to play with no avail.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I love the Twilight soundtrack, but I almost think that this is the best soundtrack so far. It completely captures the mood of Eclipse; it is at times hopeful, sensuous, yearning. It's definitely atmospheric. This seems to be an eclectic mix, featuring everything from synthesizers to banjos. I think it's better than the New Moon soundtrack simply because it offers more emotional range.
B000001DYY|5.0|The messy break up of Alternative British Rock duo Tears for Fears in 1991 was like a shot heard round the world, after releasing two phenomenally successful albums back to back (Songs from the Big Chair, Seeds of Love). When I first heard the single, &quot;Elemental&quot; the funky title track, then later the album-for a moment, it made me forget about the breakup-in other words, it's THAT good. By all accounts, this should have been titled, Roland Orzabal's &quot;solo album&quot; but for reasons of his own, kept the name alive, by releasing Elemental under the Tears for Fears moniker. This album is different from anything released before, with elements of Peter Gabriel-sounding synths, electronic drums, stylings of funk and soul, and edgy, subtle, appropriate atmospheric guitar courtesy of Orzabal. In fact, Orzabal performs many of the instruments and all lead and backing vocals on this album. Much of the recording and production, done at Orzabal's home, is slick, polished, surprisingly focused, and well-executed. As difficult and meticulous as Orzabal may be in terms of being hands on during recording and production according to his co-member Curt Smith's complaints, his production and songwriting skills are phenomenal throughout this album. This album was not well-received upon its original release, only going Gold instead of the mega-platinum success the band had before; thankfully, all is well between them and have rekindled their friendship and realigned their musical relationship, having toured and released several albums since. I highly recommend any TFF fan who may have originally skipped this release out of protest due to the absent Curt Smith, to give this album and another shot. In my humble opinion, it's worth checking out.
0316069906|4.0|A worthy and relatively focused examination of factory farms. Foer is, granted, sometimes a bit preachy. I agree that everyone who eats meat bears a portion of collective responsibility in supporting companies that use these vile practices. But who is more to blame - customers who eat the meat in front of them, often ignorant, or the government that enables the system as a whole? The United States has virtually ensured through its inaction that disgusting, unhealthy, and brutal practices will be the most profitable methods of producing meat. (To be sure, this is a problem that Foer addresses, but it is minimized in comparison to the far smaller-scale question of personal dietary decisions.)    The book is most valuable in laying out a survey of the unbelievably awful facts, and exploring the full range of responses to them. Personally, I found the most sympathetic figures to be the humane ranchers seeking to reverse the trend towards factory farming. If the public was more familiar with this viewpoint, I feel the drive to action would spread.     Unfortunately, the dominant opposition perspective in the public eye is that of PETA. And even in a book painting them in a very positive light, it's easy to understand why this group has failed to inspire serious action. It is not cute and it is not helpful to your cause to compare the suffering of chickens to that of slaves. It is offensive and alienating towards those you are trying to convert. There are plenty of good arguments to make against factory farming that do not rely on a false equivalence between livestock and human beings. If PETA really cares about making progress against factory farming, as opposed to reveling in self-righteousness, they should focus on them, as Foer does.    While he philosophically embraces PETA, Foer deserves credit for producing a work that is well above their standard.
0446402397|5.0|Tom Rob Smith's debut novel CHILD 44 reinvents the story of a real-life Soviet serial killer, setting the story in the USSR of the 1950s at the tale-end of the Stalinist era.<br /><br />It's a book that delivers the key elements of a page-turning thriller: Gripping plot.  A believable, well-imagined world.  Characters you care about.  And a satisfying resolution.<br /><br />Leo Demidov and his wife Raisa are memorable characters who face seemingly insurmountable challenges in their quest to bring a serial killer to justice.  The actions of the serial killer mimic those of the Stalinist regime Smith depicts - individuals are destroyed at will, and the perpetrators act with impunity.  (In CHILD 44, the state won't even acknowledge that a serial killer could possibly exist, so all the murders are being \\"solved\\" locally with no one putting all the pieces together.)  Leo's transformation from brutal state enforcer to exiled outcast to principled detective is believably shown. And his and Raisa's evolving relationship in the midst of the harshest circumstances adds another layer to the story.<br /><br />Smith's depiction of the totalitarian Soviet society may not be 100% historically accurate, but read purely as fiction this is a book that will connect with readers who enjoyed Stieg Larsson's [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]] as well as anyone who enjoys the take-no-prisoners approach of Lee Child's Jack Reacher in books such as [[ASIN:044024367X Nothing to Lose (Jack Reacher, No. 12)]].  As the first of a planned trilogy (the second installment [[ASIN:0446402419 The Secret Speech]] is already out), CHILD 44 offers a great place to start if you are looking for a new thriller writer to follow.
1402210086|4.0|This was a really fun book to read but not my favorite Georgette Heyer book.
0316098337|5.0|\\"Room\\" the new novel by Emma Donoghue, is, in a word, riveting. I've never read anything quite like it. There is a part near the middle where I absolutely COULDN'T, WOULDN'T stop reading, it was that intense.  It's a pleasure to give this unique novel a five-star rating.<br /><br />The story is told by 5 year old Jack, who is one of the most adorable, horrifying, precocious, interesting, pathetic and heartbreaking child narrators I've ever read.  To see the world, even one as skewed and unreliable as Jack's, is to have one's eyes opened in a new way.  Jacks discovery of the world awakens our own understanding.<br /><br />Jack and his \\"Ma\\" live in Room. Most of the things in the room have their noun for their names. For example, the chair is Chair and the bed is Bed. In Room there is Wardrobe where Jack sleeps when \\"Old Nick\\" visits Ma at night. I'm guessing that Donoghue got some of her ideas from several recent true abduction cases and built this fascinating and horrific scenario from them.<br /><br />The sense of dread builds exponentially as Jack reports on his daily life in Room. The reader, who is smarter than a 5 year old, begins to understand the gravity of the situation. The suspense builds beautifully and the pages keep turning. Donoghue masterfully creates a sense of horrible dread as well as any vintage Stephen King!<br /><br />She also builds a story of familial love and support that alternately both breaks and warms the reader's heart.  When the scene shifts, what happens \\"After\\" is as interesting, suspenseful and touching as what happened in Room.<br /><br />I'm intentionally leaving out as many plot points as I can because part of the enjoyment of this story is wondering what will happen next to Jack and Ma.<br /><br />I highly recommend this unique novel.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|That's if you like futuristic movies. See I do, and what I love of this movie is that you can see other planets. like the moon we look at night. and the aliens wow, it's just beautiful, taller than human, it reminded me of a topic I read of giants living once on earth, they even found the bones to prove it. I enjoy all the charactors in this movie, even the bad guy in the movie, yep, even he was great. If you like seeing space ships flying, and dragons flying too, fighting  with blue like aliens who are defending their home planet from the ever hungry, greedy for wealth humans, then this movie is for you.

B001OQCV6A|2.0|Whoever directed this should be shown the Cask of Amontillado. Oh wait! That's another story and another author. (Show it to him anyway, and use lots of cement). Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be rolling over in his grave if he knew what happened to his famous consulting detective.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays a slovenly, socially indiscreet, lazy, unkempt gentleman who seems to have demons that diminish his professional and social skills. When Doctor Watson isn't prodding him into stirring himself out of a lethargic rut, he finds it on his own in nocturnal impulses of East end bare-knuckled jousts with other Victorian low-lifes. He dresses like a slob, and wears a hat that is more befitting of the character, Slip Mahoney in \\"The Bowery Boys.\\"<br /><br />I could tell you about the plot, but I found myself forgetting it less than two days after viewing it. My mind was even wandering while I was watching it. The plot also moves very fast, which is difficult to follow especially if you are losing interest. I regret having paid for watching it through Netflix but that is offset by my gratitude that I didn't plunk down any Pound Sterling at the box office to see it there. Nevertheless, I still gave this movie the best two hours of my life!<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is admirable considering bad script and direction. Jude Law, the real Englishman, also plays a fair Dr. Watson. Neither actor seemed that capable of carrying a ridiculous plot, direction, or the remaking of Holmes into a 21st Century action hero. These two seem to have a less than amiable friendship judging by their interaction. By the end, I could care less about either one of them.<br /><br />The director, what's his name, or Who-the-hell cares, uses the ever popular video flashbacks to show the viewer how Mr. Holmes came to his famous deductive conclusions. The viewer should restrain from blinking during these snippets. I gave this two stars because I still feel that \\"I'm Gonna Get You Sucker,\\" \\"Gigli,\\" \\"Ishtar\\" and \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\" are worse.<br /><br />It's elementary dear reader. Stick with \\"The Bowery Boys\\" and Routine 11.<br /><br />Basil! Nigel! Come back!Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\" are worse.    It's elementary dear reader. Stick with \\"The Bowery Boys\\" and Routine 11.    Basil! Nigel! Come back!
B001PA0FFO|5.0|This is a very interesting story about the conflict between a tradition-bound disciplinarian, Streep, and a progressive priest played brilliantly by Hoffman.  Though it takes place in 1964, the 60s upheavals are really only beginning.  Streep wants to keep things simple and controlled, Hoffman to open the church to new ideas.  While Streep is more overtly political in the way she enlists a young nun, the wonderful Amy Adams, Hoffman is also proven extremely adept at these kinds of career maneuvering.<br /><br />The pawn in the story is a solitary young black boy, the first admitted to the Bronx catholic school.  He is deeply troubled from an abusive household, yet full of potential; his mother is on his side and hoping to advance his education with the desperation of a person who know she has only one shot.  As we all know from recent allegations, the church did not deal well with the proclivities of some of its employees.  As Hoffman has lavished attention on the black boy, he becomes suspect in this regard.  The young nun is caught in between.<br /><br />Now, on the surface, it is easy to label the characters.  Streep is vicious, resentful, and seeking power as she looks back; Hoffman is a good man, a victim, a visionary who looks forward.  But of course, things may not be that simple.  Streep may be onto something.  Hoffman may not be all that he appears.  To the great credit of the playwrite, this is never definitively resolved, but left to the viewer to reason it out.  The result is an utterly rivetting drama that can be interpreted in many different ways.  I think that there is truth to everyone's point of view in the film.<br /><br />Recommended.  The film is a window into a world, a time, and a terrible human dilemma.  The acting is absolutely first rate.
B003NHRIUW|1.0|While she may have her name above the title, calling The Last Song a Miley Cyrus movie is a bit misleading. The pop star is certainly the lead actress in the movie - and to be honest she does a good enough job in it - but the true genre of this film is a \\"Nicholas Sparks Movie.\\"    So if you go bring plenty of Kleenex to wipe the tears from your eyes, although whether they are tears of sadness or tears of boredom will depend on how easily you fall for the author's claptrap in the first place.

0823023494|3.0|To be honest, I was expecting more from this book because of the reviews I read at the time I purchased it. While all the illustrations are delightful, informative, and expressive and the quotes from other illustrators working in the industry were truly brilliant, I was generally unimpressed with how much I didn't learn. This is probably a great book for beginners, but for someone who already knows that it's a good idea to sketch different variations of a character before picking one, it's just a pretty book.     I wanted the author to get more indepth with breaking away from what an artist is used to, in terms of style. Such as more trouble-shooting, brainstorming ideas. My problem as a character designer is that I'm stuck in one style of a drawing that I'm comfortable in and just telling me to combine different shapes for the head isn't going to get me to break out of my comfort zone. I also wanted the author to discuss more about, after choosing a character, how to stay consistent drawing him/her/it. I understand drawing different expressions at different angles, but what expressions, what angles? How do I get more expression in my character when I have the problem of trying to make them all too \\"pretty\\"?
B002ZNJWI6|5.0|Quite simply brilliant. I have enjoyed every page of it. Highly recommend it to enyone who loves hard sci-fi.

B003OCWF6I|3.0|On the surface, it's just another action movie. Stuff blows up, people get shot, the bad guy is trying to destroy the world and the good guys are trying to stop him. It's the perfect popcorn movie.    But take a closer look at The Losers and you'll start to see that there's more than just mindless entertainment going on here. It's not trying to deliver a message, thank god, and it's not an action movie with pretentions of being great art. But it's smart, well written and well acted, and that separates it from the last 10 action movies you paid good money to sit in the dark and stare at.    [...]
B00028HBKM|5.0|I've seen untold numbers of movies in my lifetime, and this was by far the most harrowing to watch. I felt every blow Jesus took from the brutal Roman guards, felt like the spikes were going through MY hands. I believe this was Mel Gibson's idea: to make the viewer suffer as the Messiah suffered. He was very successful in this regard, and of extracting a masterful acting performance from Jim Caviezel. I'm a born-again Christian, and every time I see this film, I'm brought to tears by how much my Lord suffered for me.<br /><br />Gary Lombardo<br />Author: [[ASIN:1432744682 My Friend Jesus]]
B003A4IFGY|5.0|This is by far Tom's best work since Wildflowers.  Its bluesy but its still Heartbreakers all the way. The bad reviews are from people who expect these 60 year old rockers to write the same tunes they wrote 25 years ago.  The band has matured and so has the music.
081297381X|5.0|Despite my title for this review, I enjoyed the book.  In the land of Katrina, the Dustbowl, LTCM, and BP oil spills, the impact of rare events is extraordinary.  But like nearly everything I have read from people educated in business schools, the writing is breathlessly over-the-top, as though he were saying something profoundly and desperately new.  The content is not new; what is new is the author's style, which includes a large dose of funny sarcasm and irreverence toward conventional wisdom.  A corollary of the author's sarcasm is, however, that you are a pedant, philistine, or ignoramus if you do not believe as he does; that his own intelligence is a highly improbable event; or that disasters won't happen by chance.  In this respect, he is an Algernon of earnest economists and intellectuals--witty, intelligent, effete, humorous, and harmless.<br /><br />Therefore, this book is enjoyable reading, but only if you can feel a healthy skepticism about its profundity.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|A troubled young teen finds out that his mood swings and trouble at school aren't really the result of his dyslexia or ADD. He's actually a demigod, the half-blood offspring of the Greek god Poseidon and a human woman. Oh and his best friend isn't really handicapped, but walks with crutches because he's really a half man/half goat satyr who pretends to be handicapped because  he doesn't want to scare everybody with his cloven hooves.    Welcome to the wonderful world of Percy Jackson, star of a series of extremely popular books written by Rick Riordan and now his own big budget adventure movie directed by Chris Columbus. Like that other franchise Columbus helped bring to theaters -- you know, the one about a young wizard fighting a guy whose name you aren't supposed to say - Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief is an uneven blend of broad mainstream entertainment and very specific details designed to make the rabid fans of the books happy with the adaptation. As a result, the film gets a little bogged down in details along the way, and way too much of the dialogue plays like a Cliff Notes version of a high school history book, but the special effects are cool and the adventure is fun to watch.    The film stars Logan Lerm  The adults in the movie are a mixed bag, too. Steve Coogan is fantastic as Hades, God of the underworld, and it is fun to watch him go toe-to-toe with his wife Persephone as played by the always entertaining Rosario Dawson. Uma Thurman will simply haunt you as Medusa.     That's the good news.     On the other end of the spectrum, Sean Bean and Kevin McKidd are little more than cardboard cutouts as Zeus and Poseidon, immortal siblings looking to start a war, and Pierce Brosnan is downright awful as the centaur Chiron. It may be the gear he has to wear to make his horse body special effect work, but Brosnan goes through the movie looking like he's in severe pain whether the scene calls for it or not.   an as Percy and the mix of angerand acceptance he brings to the role is really interesting to watch unfold as the story goes along. As his hairy-legged sidekick, Grover the satyr, Brandon T. Jackson is a good match for Percy, combining street sense with the inside knowledge of the gods that will keep his friend alive, delivered in a sly and comical way. Unfortunately, the third member of the heroic trio, Alexandra Daddario isn't given much to do beyond stare at the camera and pose in some overly choreographed fight scenes.  [...]

B00002493G|5.0|As a Bowie collector, I could almost kick myself for not having acquired this album much sooner. Most Bowie fans know he has gotten \\"funky\\" and dance oriented on albums as early as Young Americans and then later with Let's Dance, Tonight, Never Let Me Down with a certain amount of nightclub appeal to his songs. This album seems to be his most danceable album yet, in-line with the late 80's/90's albums he has also released. Yes, it is dark, but it is also very good.     I recommend this to fans old and new, especially if you are into his dance oriented music.
B00275EHJG|4.0|I tried to convince my wife to be the one to take my kids to Toy Story 3.  My youngest son, especially, was begging to go, but while I was impressed by the first two, a long ways back, and saw them as showcases for the increasingly sophisticated animation techniques at Pixar, I didn't really love either one of them as much as [[ASIN:B00007LVCM A Bug's Life]] or [[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles]] or [[ASIN:B001EOQWEO Wall-E]] or [[ASIN:B000VBJEEG Ratatouille]].  Perhaps it's just the devoted toy concept that didn't quite move me.  I'm not quite sure why, but for whatever reason, I went into this unenthusiastic and only doing it for the kids.<br /><br />As it turns out, I really liked it.  As far as I'm concerned right now it's the best of the series - of course, now I'd actually be willing to go back and sit through the others and maybe find I liked them too.  It's clever and inventive, with sight gags and visual puns that are underplayed, almost in passing. Its big, blockbuster animation, but the humor manages to be subtle, rather than in your face like so much popular animation these days.  While, like the other films and like everything Pixar, it's not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve it's never sappy, and the storytelling earns its sentimental payoff rather than wrenching it from you.  I never felt manipulated.  The look is nothing short of astonishing.  The visuals are intricate and full of rich details, but it never feels busy or crowded.  I'd like to see it again just so now I can pay more attention to the details now I know what's happening.  The opening reminded me a bit of the surreal and (even more) hilarious stop motion toy fantasy [[ASIN:B003H0ZHGM A Town Called Panic]] (also highly recommended), but the rest fit nicely into the general pattern of the series without feeling like one of the generic and uninspiring sequels that are so common these days.<br /><br />The basic story should be familiar: Woody and Buzz and their buddies are facing a new abandonment crisis.  This time, it's because Andy is going to college, and they fear he will leave them behind in storage, or worse, throw them away.  What is surprising is how fresh they manage to make it all feel.  Nothing was predictable or generic, and I was sad to see it end.  Perhaps best of all, though, was the amazing short film \\"Night and Day\\" with which it began.  It's better not to say anything about that, since it's best just to see it unawares.  Still it's a magical film, one of the most exciting and intriguing animated shorts I'd ever seen.  A perfect beginning for an inventive and moving film.  Not to be missed.risis.

B000WTZ784|4.0|As an owner of almost all Genesis albums, this one stands out as the vocalist is not Phil Collins or Peter Gabriel, the singers on all of their other albums. However, once \\"getting over\\" this ecsentricity, the song-writing and musicianship on this album stands up as well as any of the other late-career albums from the Phil Collins era (Duke,We Can't Dance, Invisible Touch). I do not recall if any of the songs ever made it into the top 40 on this album, but several of the tunes are catchy and will stick to you after listening. Like many of their albums, there are several \\"dark\\" instrumental passages with cool guitar and keyboard solos present.       If you appreciate Phil Collins era Genesis, you will probably enjoy this album and I would recommend it to you.

B001DZDTX6|5.0|You'll have to excuse me. Right now, I am a bit overwhelmed. There is so much to do. I came here to do a brief review of Rush's Moving Pictures. I just realized, that is absolutely impossible.<br /><br />I grew up in the 1980s, I love free form, underground music. I have been called a music snob. If a lot of people who know the music I know caught me in Rush territory, I'd be blackballed.<br /><br />Well, you know what? Screw em'! I don't wanna be a music snob, I wanna be a music man--all encompassing. And when you strip away all the allegations of geekdom, all the arena rock  implications, all the 1970s critical bashes of prog and all the 1980s high school photos--basically when you take a shovel to that whole smelly pile of myth-- you wind up with  great music. If I am a music snob, that means I know great music when I heart it, and liking Rush should only increase my street cred. It's 2010. Can we get the hell out of 1985 musical 10th grade clique wars already?<br /><br />If so, there is no better departure point than Moving Pictures. This i is one of those albums that catches a band at just the right time. The magic time. Between the guitar grind of [[ASIN:B000001ESB Fly By Night]] and the synth 80sdom of [[ASIN:B000001ESV Grace Under Pressure]]. Rush placed a little of both into the test tube, and made a perfect album.<br /><br />It was not just the songs that made this so, although they didn't hurt. \\"Tom Sawyer\\"  \\"Red Barchetta\\" and \\"Limelight,\\" are perfectly sliced riff metal. \\"YYZ\\" borders on fusion.<br /><br />\\"Camera Eye,\\" with its half-step jam, could be compared to Miles Davis' \\"So What,\\" or Coltrane's \\"Impressions.\\" If you are a music snob and never saw the through line, rise and shine, little Gang Of Four  180 gram vinyl honey bear, Rush has a biiiiiiiiiig surprise for you.<br /><br />If you think you missed the selling point, relax. The music as written works, but the magic comes in how Rush made Moving Pictures. Getty Lee  finally realized he was not now or at any other time Robert Plant, and took his voice down an octave to play to the lyrics. The tracks are sharp, lean, and hit point with deep riffs and amazing playing. The synths and the guitar growl both compliment and contrast perfectly.<br /><br />I think we're past the point of proving why Moving Pictures is a great album from a great group. And we certainly should be past the point of hanging on to myths that should have been trashed with our LPs and turntables. (Well, some of us music snobs hung on to the two of those.) If rock people  can now love Sinatra and Elvis Costello  can work with  Burt Bacharach, there is a place among almost any serious music person for Moving Pictures by Rush.ook his voice down an octave to play to the lyrics.

0606087230|5.0|This book is required reading for my 12 year old granddaughter over the summer holiday!  I read the book myself.  It is very well presented.  However, if this book is aimed at pre-teens/teens, it needs to be shortened.  It is a rather scary daunting book for a kid to read about the food he/she has been eating all their lives and will continue to eat (not too much choice about EATING is there?).  I can't get her to read it = not yet, anyway but it is an interesting very well presented book but FOR ADULTS.
0618154043|5.0|After reading the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and The Silmarillion, I was looking for more tales of the first and second ages.  Bingo!  The stories in this book flesh out some of the smaller tales in the Silm and give backstory on some of the characters and adventures in the LotR and Hobbit.    As a history buff, I loved the way this book was put together - lots of footnotes and asides - but this could make it hard to read for some.  I enjoyed reading Christopher Tolkien's explanations of why certain things were chosen and his questions on the text.  The tale of Aldarion and Erendis was an interesting character study (if a touch soap-opera-ish), and the information on the Druedain made me look at Ghan-buri-Ghan in a new light.  I loved the tale of the children of Hurin for its archaism and sorrow, and the story of Tuor and his coming to Gondolin for some nice backstory on Earendil's father.    If you enjoy reading chronicle-style books, or books of short stories, and you'd like a peek into the mind of JRRT, you should enjoy this book.  If you're looking for a novel, look elsewhere.
B002RSDW80|3.0|Streep was great, and so was Tucci.  Could have done without the Julie part of the movie.  Movie was okay, but would have been better if it was all about Julia Child.  I am stunned that Meryl Streep got beat out by Sandra Bullock for the Academy Award.  It wasn't even close.  Bullock's performance was good in a standard sort of way, but unremarkable.
0316789704|4.0|This book is full of clever and fun ideas!  Instructions are simple, clear and easy to follow.    I bought this to use with my toddler and pre-schooler but I think it would be much better for a slightly more 'experienced' crafting age bracket...there are tons of neat ideas and sooooo much potential for fun :)  I will be keeping this in my library and enjoying for a loooong time to come!
1932100385|5.0|This book makes us think about our nutrition and the things that we need to know to live a happier and healthier life.  The hardest part is to put the information to action as it requires breaking long-standing habbits and traditions.  Meat is not our friend.  Milk can cause cancer.  And best of all it's all reversable if we change our diet habbits.  This is a must read for anyone who loves life and wants to love it longer.
B001FB563E|5.0|First let me say this movie is brilliant.  Fierce, moving, terrifying, and unforgettable.  The story of a father and 12 yr old son trying to survive a post-apocalyptic world is one of the most realistic and stunning stories I have seen of this kind.  \\"The Book of Eli\\" came out around the same time, and while I enjoyed that movie enormously, it was much more of a \\"Road Warrior\\" type story with lots of slam-bang action and really only touched on the darkness this tory fleshes out in detail.  \\"The Road\\" never cheats or makes things easy conveying a world which has been thrown back into an age where they have to worry about being murdered, raped, and cannibalized.  Viggo Mortensen is brilliant here, reminding us why he is one of the best actors of our time.  Kodi Smit-McPhee gives one of the best performances by a child actor in recent memory as Mortensen's son.  He is vulnerable, loving, and devoted to his father and McPhee conveys all too realistically a child who has grown up in hell's last circle.  Look at the scene where he thinks he sees another child, and he breaks down in an aching scene of just wanting another child to share the world with, play with, and feel like he's not the last of his kind.  Stunning.      Blu-ray is the only format to let this movie shine.  The pallette is bleak, grey, and desolate, and the flashbacks to the world before (we are never really told what happened, but left to infer) pop off the screen with bright greens, ambers, and warm colors.  The 1080p image is razor sharp with nary a flaw.  Blacks are inky and deep, but never crushed.  Fine detail is so strong, at times the picture looks almost 3 dimensional.  The soundtrack is both pulverzing and subtle.  Action scenes are pounding with deep bass and the ambient surrounds, wind, etc. are immersive and realistic.  The sound is a DTS HD MA mix.  This is the only way to see this film.  Highly recommended.
B002VECM6S|5.0|What a wonderful movie. I really enjoyed it! What a wonderful person this woman is, taking someone off the streets, and treating him as her own. My kind of lady!
B001PR0YGC|2.0|Personally, I found the first 2/3rds of this movie to be mind numbingly boring. It doesn't start to pick up until the last bit. Matt Damon's character is annoying as heck. You're forced to listen to his pointless thoughts which do nothing but bore you to tears. You'll be trying to follow the dialog and then he'll ramble off some useless facts that nobody cares about. I would never watch this movie again unless I was paid a nice amount of money.
B000024D4R|4.0|I always thought this was an underrated album.  I think it sounds fresher today for the simple reason FM radio didnt overplay this lp. As good as DSOTM and The Wall are, they have fallen victim to  overexposure.  Animals, on the other hand , seems to have avoided being played everyday on \\"classic rock\\" or \\"Oldies hits\\" radio. I dont know if this album was considered a disappointment when first released. It had some heavy shoes to fill after Darkside and Wish you were here, but this lp has aged well and has emerged as the Pink Floyd cd I play most often.
0307269752|4.0|The first of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy has sat on the New York Times Best Sellers Hardcover and now Paperback for months (years), and it's no wonder. The book has very good plotting (especially in the first half), fully realized characters, with a mixture of mystery, financial intrigue and thriller rolled together to satisfy a wide audience.<br /><br />The first half of the book jumps back and forth fairly rapidly, as the main characters (Mikael & Lisbeth) are developed independent of each other. The second half, when the two characters join forces, kicks the plot into overdrive. At that point, you cannot put it down. The only drawback is that oddly the book in the final chapters devolves into a rather forced  and contrived and farfetched horror scene on the one hand and a slow moving revenge plot on the other. All in all, an interesting and entertaining novel, but perhaps overtime, not a story that will draw me back to the sequels.<br /><br />Quick Tip: Be ready to convert the Swedish Krona to the US Dollar (about 1 Swedish krona = 0.1312 US dollars).
0812550757|5.0|When I first read this book I was in much younger probably in my middle teens  and I did not particularly like it. I thought it was quite a disappointment as a follow up to the brilliance of Ender's Game. After many years when I re-read it, it was an entirely different experience. The book has elements of mystery, religion/mysticism, anthropology (albeit fictional anthropology), philosophy, politics, and intrigue. But its got a very slow start, and there isn't much in the way of action - its all about two different cultures trying to understand each other. Its not a traditional sci-fi read, but for the right reader, it can be a really deep and meaningful experience.
1439586128|4.0|This book contains five J. K. Rowling tales, ostensibly composed by the fifteenth century wizard Beedle, \\"written for young wizards and witches,\\" which Rowling assures us are very popular in Hogwarts, the land of Harry Potter. Each tale is followed by a commentary by Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Dumbledore speaks his mind, offers his explanation of the tale, and occasionally reacts with anger over what he considers a stupid story or a foolish reaction to it.<br /><br /> For example, in The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, the Beedle theme is that wizards need to help humans who are in need of help. Dumbledore angrily reminds his readers how humans mistreated wizards and witches, and contends that they deserve no help at all.<br /><br /> Another example is The Fountain of Fair Fortune, which ends with a human marrying a witch. Dumbledore and others liked it, but some wizards in authority demanded that it be removed from schools because it depicts interbreeding. Dumbledore points out that: \\"There is not a witch or wizard in existence whose blood has not mingled with that of Muggles (humans), and I should therefore consider it both illogical and immoral to remove works dealing with the subject from our students' store of knowledge.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, despite Beedle's reason for writing the tales, Muggles will acquire many good lessons from these parables.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|WHY WOULD ANYONE SELL THIS CD.  BEST RAP CD I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME.
B002VLKRWM|5.0|The writer Nora Ephron wrote a clever parody of Larsson's best-selling book in the July 5, 2010 The New Yorker, which she called The Girl Who Fixed the Umlaut. Ephron humorously focused on Lisbeth Salander's unusual energetic unsocial reactions, her sometimes foul language, laptop, moods, confusions, irritability, miserable childhood, abusive father who she set on fire, tiny breasts, small height and weight, and ability with computers. Ephron also pocked fun at our American difficulty in locating the places mentioned in the Larsson novel and in handling the Swedish names, \\"people's names were so confusingly similar.\\" She mentioned Blomkvist who needed Lisbeth's help, and Plague who \\"was fat, but he would know what to do.\\" Ephron concludes her lampoon describing Lisbeth: \\"She thought about smiling, but she'd smiled three hundred pages earlier, and once was enough.\\"<br /><br />Ephron does not mention other idiosyncrasies of this extraordinary best seller that has spurred interest in other Swedish mystery novelists. Blomkvist, the investigative reporter and publisher who will reappear in Larsson's two remaining novels with Lisbeth - Larsson died in 2004 - has his own strange behaviors, including an unusual relationship with a married woman. Ephron also does not speak of Lisbeth's genius, unusual mental abilities, and odd version of morality. What also stands out in the Larsson novel is the dysfunctional Vanger family that Blomkvist was hired to investigate.<br /><br />What makes this book so successful? Its characters are different as Ephron makes clear. The drama and suspense move with accelerating pace without let up. We may not identify with the book's unusual characters, but we become interested in what they are doing. But probably most of all it seems that the joy in reading the book it is the way that Larsson tells his story, which is so different from the current conventional thrillers.
0307454541|2.0|Okay, first I'll say it's a good STORY and that's pretty much the only reason I stuck with almost 600 pages.<br /><br />It's just terrible WRITING. If you don't know already, Larsson died of a sudden heart attack at 50 and these novels were found on his computer. I really believe that, had he been alive to work with an editor, this would have ended up a MUCH better 300-page book. There's at least 200 pages of unnecessary exposition that ended up taking the story absolutely no where. I know more about what these characters like to eat than anything else.<br /><br />Oddly, one of the few times Larsson slows down enough to actually describe something, it's for a very violent and graphic rape scene that does NOTHING to further the story.<br /><br />I'm sorry Larsson died so young and didn't have a chance to make this really REALLY rough draft into something better. I simply can't understand the 600+ 5-star ratings.<br /><br />This is a rare time that I think the movie will actually be better than the book.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Enjoyed viewing this tremendously on PBS...purchased as a gift for like-minded family viewers whose Public Brocasting station did not include this in its offerings. An imaginative and well done (tongue in cheek) British yarn!
1416550550|5.0|Ms. Morton does it yet again! Weaving all the different view points was done very well. The time periods really didn't effect a whole lot for the most part but I enjoyed reliving it all. Made all the easier thanks to the little notations at the beginning of most if not all chapters. I was impressed with the range of characters presented and how you truly got to know the ins and outs of each one. Whether it was through the characters' own words or in letters/ journals etc.. Ms. Morton has a way with stories that completely captivate and envelop inside that world. The situations pertain and all is revealed. At times, I found it a little predictable but the twists that came about were still surprises for the reason behind it all.<br /><br />I loved Cassandra. She truly wanted to help her deceased grandmother. There was a whole world and a side to the story that Nell never got to discover. Cassandra decided to finish it up as she knew it was what was needed to be done. Even her past is shown in the book which I thought was so great. There was a lot of healing that needed to happen. The journey that Cassandra took was the best thing for her.<br /><br />The stories presented in the story written by the Authoress were fantastic. I could see how they could grab your attention and keep it. I loved the garden aspect and I loved how it was linked to The Secret Garden. This is one book that I didn't want to see the end of though I had figured out some of it. The story swept me away to times I have little knowledge about but couldn't get enough of. I eagerly await Ms. Morton's next novel!
B003L45JLW|4.0|If it weren't for the novelty of Blu-ray Audio, I probably would have skipped this.  That would have been a mistake.  This is a great album, first and foremost, from an artist I'd largely written off the first time I heard him (come on...a nasily sounding long-faced kid singing lyrics like \\"don't have to live like refugee\\"?) as somebody who wouldn't be around long.  Who knew.    The disc has an uncompressed PCM stereo mix and a 5.1 DTS-HD mix.  I find the surround mix to be a novelty at best.  Setting your receiver to 2.1 unfiltered audio and using the PCM track is the way to go here.    VERY impressive sound.  Everything's there.  You might want to prepare to do some tweaking of your system, but...wow.    Since most people likely do not have a Blu-ray player dedicated to their audio system (yet), there are basic visuals for the TV screen included.  Specifically, as each song starts, the album cover appears with information about the song playing, including the writers and performers.  It displays for maybe 10-20 seconds, then the video goes into 'screen saver' mode, with a small image of the album cover bouncing around the screen.    The disc comes with a code to get an uncompressed digital download, so you can still have it in iTunes and I assume make a regular CD too (haven't tried yet).    I'm now officially a proponent for the CD format ending.  It's had a good run.  Let the kids who don't care about sound quality purchase their downloads.  Let those of us who do support this format.  In the end, everybody's smiling.
0312370849|3.0|I read this book in one day and have to admit up to a certain point it was excellent.  When the story turned soley to Julia and her personal saga the book tended to drag and I somewhat lost interest.  I kept reading though as I knew eventually I'd find out the fate of Sarah.  I would have preferred more in depth on Sarah after she returned to Paris, in the same narrative from earlier in the book.  I somewhat lost interest in Julia and her philandering husband.  The historical aspect of the book was excellent and certainly opened my eyes to a little known aspect of the Holocaust.
B0037BB00I|2.0|Adele is ok but this album quickly becomes too derivative of Amy Winehouse without the strong songs and a less emotive voice and thus background music.  Both Estelle and Duffy are stronger UK imports and were both robbed the year Adele won Best New Artist Grammy over them!

B000FC0P9E|5.0|I had avoided reading any Stephen King books for a long time, until one of my cousins handed me this book and said \\" You will like this \\".  I am amazed by the power of this story. I was completely enthralled.  A simple story it seems of a young girl who gets lost while hiking the mountains in Maine.  This is a story of how she survives the experience of being completely lost....without much food or water.....the hallucinationos of dehydration creeping upon her as real as anything one could imagine.  It is a brilliant story that completely changed my mind about Stephen King.  I would love to read another of his books that has this same quality of story telling.  Having hiked the mountains of NH and Maine as a child on up into my thirties, I could completely relate.  I have been lost, with the sun setting, to find myself in a world much like what Stephen's story.  It is the best story of what that experience is truly like that I have ever read.  Kudos to King.  He really got it this time and now I am a big fan !!  Don't miss this one. The negative reviews are by people who don't understand what is happening in the book and how close to the true experience he writes in this book.  It is just plain and simply the best Novel.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Nothing explicit here, nothing violent, nothing obscene, just a straightforward story of a mostly closeted gay professor living in 1960s California, dealing with the death of his lover (we see their story in flashbacks) and with his feelings for a couple of younger men, one of which is a student in his class.  Colin Firth does a great job as the title character, with Julianne Moore in a brief but memorable role as a friend of his who is also an expat from London.      There is a great soundtrack which probably isn't necessary for all the scenes where the music is played, but it is not too obtrusive or distracting.
B002BWP4A6|1.0|Filmed as if viewed from the very early 1900s it can only be filmed in black & white - duh! -so the more natural explanation is too simple for the intellectual snob recluses that are ordained to discover the hidden film technique purposefully designed by the artist to evoke certain images, feelings or thoughts hidden in the village. This brings me to people who in their intellectual snobbery find \\"their\\" meaning in every obscure and ambiguous form of art as if they've discovered the real hidden meaning lying deep within the artists' subconscious mind waiting to be discovered. The problem is that their neighboring intellectual effete derived a different subconscious intent and the second problem is that the hidden message may never have existed in the first place despite the statistically random \\"connect-the-dots\\" events that create different interpretations depending upon which dots one selects.     I suppose if a hundred chimps at keyboards can eventually create a typed masterpiece then then too a hundred reviewers can find a Mona Lisa in every Rorschach blot. Ahhh, people with too much time on their butts.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Extended Editions of the LOTR films are the definitive editions, and if you're a fan of the films you owe it to yourself to pick them up. Not only do you get the best version of the film, you get an incredible Behind The Scenes story. Also, buy a copy of [[ASIN:1550228900 The Lord of the Films: The Guide to Tolkien's Middle-Earth on the Big Screen]] which has lots more information to truly give you the best viewing experience. These films are the Wizard of Oz of our generation and will live on forever. Be sure to see them as they were meant to be seen.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Casual fans and life long followers alike will appreciate this beautifully captured concert film of The Eagles. Pristine audio and video quality combined with the boys still in peak form combine to form a truly memorable experience.  All the hits are here, plus some new ones, including a once-again reimagined \\"Hotel California\\" that brings the house down.  Plus, the pure adulation from a crowd that includes Baby Boomers and Millenials side-by-side is breathtaking. All around, a must have for any fan of one of the greatest bands of all time.

B0000CD5FN|4.0|It's a shame that Joe passed away shortly before the release of Streetcore. In my opinion, Streetcore is the band's best album of the three they made. \\"Get Down Moses\\" is very unique and very clever, sort of funked up reggae that is semi addicting. \\"Arms Aloft\\" is extremely upbeat and positive and sounds like modern day Beatles. \\"All in a Day\\" continues with the positive and upbeat sound. I saw one person who reviewed the album couldn't get into this song because of the lyrics. Understandable, but I actually think this one is better written than \\"Coma Girl\\". \\"Coma Girl\\" is disappointing because it has good music and Joe's voice sounds good, but the lyrics from one of the best songwriters of all time don't match up to the rest of the track. Too bad. \\"Burning Streets\\" is slower but also a very solid song.   The acoustic tracks, \\"Long Shadow\\" and \\"Redemption Song\\",  are both good songs in my opinion. I'm not sure if either of them would have appeared on \\"Streetcore\\" if Joe had been alive to finish the album properly. While they may seem a bit out of place, at least they are good efforts.   Steetcore is a fine album and clearly shows that Joe and his band were making steady progress over time. It's a shame that they didn't get to finish what they started.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|After the breakup and so much time apart in New Moon, it is endearing to see Edward back at Bella's side where he belongs.  Bella seems much more relaxed this time, Charlie does a great job playing the dad who doesn't quite like his daughter's choice of a boyfriend, and there is a nice scene from Florida with Bella and her mom.      The entire Cullen clan get more screen time, and although I love each and every one of them, I have to say Rosalie was especially striking this time, and Jasper was absolutely perfect in his role, with his slight southern accent, and exceptional fighting abilities.  They also take us back in time detailing how these two became vampires.     If Jacob is the one you love then you will feel a little sorry for him, as he is having a tough time both mentally and physically, but the rest of the wolf pack are in good shape and ready for the big fight. They also include a really interesting scene of the Quileute history.       Most everything from the book that should have been included, has been, including the very important tent scene, which is my personal favorite ( I just love the conversation between Edward and Jacob.)  Then finally we get to the action with the Cullen's and Quileutes coming together to take care of Victoria and those nasty newborn's.      I can't think of a thing I didn't like in this film, and I will definitely be buying the DVD when it is available.
B00000K0E5|3.0|Goldeneye is a fun bond film and a good starter for Pirce Brosnan. It was ashame that Dalton left as he is IMO the third best bond followed by Daniel Crig and Sean. But Pirce is a good replacement.     The Good:  The relationship between Bond (Brosnan) and Trevelyan (Sean Bean) was well written.  The action was good.  The relationship between Bond and the russian girl (name escapes me, not Onatopp) was well done.  Judie Dench makes a strong presence as M and is the best M IMO.  The action was pretty good    The Bad:  Xenia Onatopp is one of the worst bond girls ever (I have a hard time taking serious a woman who is that driven for pleasure and that blunt about it. It would have been better if she was more subtle about it)  The opening scene is overrated and Lame (the whole sky diving into a plane was dumb and the fight when Bond thinks he has killed Trevelyn was dissapointing. The opening for Licence to Kill was ten times better as well as a much better film)  The CGI staellites were really bad (The minuture staellites in You only live twice, Moonraker and Diamonds are forever are much more realistic looking and do not look like CGI cartoons)    Not as good as The Living Daylights or Liecence to Kill but a good movie none the less.

I'm pleased to know she passed it on to MY granddaughter.    It's movies like this, which give one a little \\"rush\\" of enthusiasm that, yeah, maybe God IS in God's Heaven and all's right with us human beings.

Cheaper , and less storage space taken, makes these collections a must have for those building a library of dvd's , and this particular collection of films is an amazing bargain !
B001GCUO5M|5.0|This is a great movie!Keeps your attention through the whole movie.The acting is great and the movie is well written with lots of twist and turns. Leonardo at his best!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I thought this was a pretty good album. Some of my favorites are Talkin' to myself, Not Afraid, 25 To Life, and Love the way you lie.     For the record though, I've been a fan of Eminem since he came out. I have all his albums, and I admit Encore wasn't really his best work, but I didn't think Relapse was that bad. I admit that accent got old, but it was better than alot of the other \\"rap\\" they play on the radio now.      But that's just me.
078322611X|5.0|I first watched this movie when it came out and enjoyed it from the beginning. Recently, we purchased the DVD and I watched it with my 13 year old daughter who is no fan of baseball. She sat enthralled with the movie which really surprised me.  Yes, maybe it is not the most believable story line, but I believe that is what makes this movie so interesting.  I am not a Kevin Costner fan, but he did a great job portraying himself as an average guy living in Iowa. The acting overall is great and I loved how the story flowed!  Overall, I like that the movie did not spell out for you what happened, particularly the end. It was for each individual in the audience to speculate as to how to story continued.  Classic film!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|We enjoyed this movie. And upon watching it we didn't find the plot shallow as some critic's suggested. In fact I think it should have won the Best Picture Award for 09. However the Oscars has a long tradition of often awarding things in their own way or honoring something else entirely by giving out their Best Picture. So not to say Foot Locker didn't deserve consideration but I for one do not approve of war movies for money during time of war. So no matter how well done it was it didn't have my vote for Best Picture. And no I didn't see it...that would make me a hypocrite. Maybe in 20 years I'll be able to bring myself to see it...then perhaps not....it took me more than 20 years to be able to watch the Mash series via DVD<br />release even. Kudo's to Avatar.......a lovely fantasy land well done. I hope there can be sequels that out do the original.
0061777250|5.0|Glorious! This book is the quintessential treatise on NDE!  As an NDEr (expereincer), scientist, and psychiatric clinician, I am quite familiar with all the literature.  Dr. van Lommel has magnificently stated all that we know and need to know.  This is the perfect, comprehensively written, scientific approach to understanding not only the NDE, but the implications for all humanity.  I loudly applaud his challenge to science to reconsider the premise of existing theory on consciousness and reality based on these profound findings.

B003E8P9G0|5.0|I must say that after hearing so many positive reviews of Rick Riordan, I was somewhat excited to read this new release. Wow was all I could say after only a few pages of this amazing book. I enjoyed the characters, the plot, and everything else.<br /><br />After reading this book, I am now determined to read the Percy Jackson series. I enjoyed the Harry Potter series. I didnt really like the Twilight series. So I am hoping great things from the Percy Jackson series.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I've listened to Marshall's music for over 10 years now and have to say this is his most important release.  For those who spun the album once and didn't feel like it was very catchy: spin it again, but this time pull out the lyrics, pour yourself a drink, and really \\"listen\\". The other reviewers have done a great job explaining the album, but I want to put out two of my favorite aspects.    First, and foremost, the rhymes on this album are off the chain. But we know that; that's what Marshall's know for.  The difference in this album doesn't just rhyme cleverly, but also manages to juxtapose ideas and metaphors AND rhyme multiple times all in a few sentences. Alright, here's a great example form arguably the weakest track on the album:                                         \\"And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater                                        I'll rip a tree out the ground                                        And flip it upside down                                       'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown\\"    Just in these four lines he begins by using a slang term for a garment to spring into a killer comparison of flipping a tree rather than just \\"a new leaf\\" (as the famous saying goes), while managing to rhyme five times.    Secondly, the content of this album is much more mature, honest, and for the first time useful than any of his previous releases. Songs like \\"Going through Changes\\" and \\"Talkin' 2 Myself\\" depict drug addiction and fame in a very real and haunting way, giving the subject the seriousness it deserves and showing how he has matured. The honesty comes in throughout the album in the form of humility, constantly painting embarrassing and depressing pictures of himself, and admitting his last album was trash:                                         \\"Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was \\"ehhhh\\"                                        Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground                                        Relax, I ain't going back to that now                                        All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW                                        Cause I ain't playin' around\\"    Overall: The best album Eminem/Marshall/Slim has ever done. Pick it up now.
B002VPE1XY|3.0|I have a [[ASIN:B002HEWA28 Fujifilm Finepix F70EXR 10MP Super CCD Digital Camera with 10x Optical Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD]] which for me anyway is a very small digital camera, condering my main camera is a [[ASIN:B000HGIWN4 Nikon D80 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera Kit with 18-135mm AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens]] which I knew would never fit in this case. What I didn't expect was that my Fuji would barely squeeze into it, and that it would be so tightly packed that the magnetic snap ( a very nice feature) would not engage.    So basically I was left with two options. The first one, buying an even smaller point and shoot seemed a bit extreme. The second option, going around with the cover open, was more appealing, but it sort of missed the point of a camera case, to protect the camera. So for the moment, until I actually get a new miniature P&S, I am using this case part time.    In spite of all of this, this is a very nice case. The snap feature, as I have intimated, is a great idea, but the belt loop seems to have been inspired by people who used to design pocket protectors and cell phone holsters. Please, who is going to walk around with a digital camera strapped to their pants? You push them into the pockets of even the tightest jeans like civilized people everywhere.     The solution for the camera strap, an elongated slit in the closing flap is also odd. think about it. You put the camera into the case and thread the wrist strap out through the slit. Okay, that works. However when you want to take an actual picture you must reverse the process unless of course you want to dangle the case as you shoot. Not a good design choice.    Now the case is exceptional. The leather is soft and supple, and it is well stitched, able to withstand all sort of stretching to close the snap flap on a too big camera. Amazon puts its name on this case, but it should have specified something that would fit slightly larger cameras.
0143034901|5.0|I can't really add much more than others have said. I will just say that it quickly drew me in to the wonderfully exciting world of Franco-era Barcelona.  I love the city and that may have added something to the experience.  A complete delight to read.
0891419063|5.0|A first hand account of the Marine life of E.B. Sledge. So descriptive I felt I was in action. Deglorifies war yet makes you understand the deep emotions of the ordinary soldier. If you are a history buff like me this is a must read account of the invasion of Peleliu and Okinawa. You'll be as shell shocked as I was after Sledge's accurate depiction of war. It will give you insight even into today's soldiers. 5 stars!!!
1840225572|5.0|Shakespeare requires no introduction -- he is \\"the Bard,\\" the most imposing playwright and storyteller in the English language. And \\"The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works\\" brings together every one of his 39 plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.<br /><br />The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.<br /><br />And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.<br /><br />But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.<br /><br />For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.<br /><br />There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").<br /><br />And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.<br /><br />Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest.e page.

0691142165|2.0|The research is prodigious, as one other reviewer put it, and it's great to have so much of it in one book.  But the dry, academic style defends itself against being read. (Read the sample pages here on Amazon and you'll see right away).  I am disappointed in this because this is a financial history lesson that needs to be learned.  Meanwhile, this subject has been covered in a lot more accessible way in books such as \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\" and \\"The Internet Bubble.\\"
B003E48AYC|5.0|This classic film is awesome in blu Ray. The colors are sooo bright. The girl who played Alice is kinda lame and boring but otherwise a visually stimulating phenomenon.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I never watched the show when it aired, but the reruns caught my attention years ago. I enjoyed the episodes, and they were compelling. Recently, I decided to pick up the DVDs of Season One, and I've enjoyed the show once again. Again, the acting is impressive given what they had to work with. It's much better than anything that's on television the past decade. I wanted to make a commentary of some of the episodes. First thing I noticed is how many characters appear in one episode and then be never seen again. Having said that, notice how Brandon Walsh averages a woman per show. He is also a cheat, liar, racist, and drunk driver who could have killed somebody. He is easily pissed off and starts taking somebody's head out if slightly provoked. He acts like a saint with a conscience yet he is the biggest hypocrite I've seen on the show. At this point, I have a hard time debating who is worse: him or Brenda. She seems to have the flair of being so melodramatic, no matter the situation. She tries to take advantage of every opportunity to make the parents to feel worse by creating useless spats. I actually feel sorry for the parents, and I question their ever flowing leniency. On the other hand, I liked the rest of the characters, and they seem to be fine to me, even if they have innocuous glaring faults except for Steve Sanders. One episode \\"One on One,\\" Brandon makes the basketball team yet we never see him playing basketball ever again in the rest of the season. Another episode where Brandon discovers how lowly paid the third world workers are, and he decides to write a report on the owner of the caf&eacute;. So what happened? Really...I am still amazed how the other characters suddenly get dropped out like flies after showing up for one episode. I was thinking also where were the friends of Kelly, Donna, Andrea, Steve because it's impossible that, given their popularity in school, they were friendless before the Walshes moved in Beverly Hills. Meanwhile, I liked the issues such as AIDS, breast cancer, alcoholism, patricide, and homosexuality were brought up in 90210, and they speak for the show's integrity. I know there is a lot of morality problem with the show while the characters delve themselves in the immoralities of life and still think they lead a life of morals. It's a tricky thing; however, the show is watchable regardless. That's why I enjoy it. For the DVD, it has been good, and letting you know, the pilot episodes are actually contained in the Season One package. That means you don't need to buy a separate DVD of the pilot show.such as AIDS, breast cancer, alcoholism, patricide, and homosexuality were brought up in 90210, and they speak for the show's integrity.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Those who have read the first two books of the trilogy would agree that Salander is a riveting character.  The second book was by far the best, as she was the star.  This time she spends most of the book in the hospital, choosing not to communicate with anyone, so the reader is left missing the star character.  The first third of the book reads more like any spy novel, punctuated by a confusing array of Swedish surnames and locations and lots of coffee consumption.  In fact, I put the book down for awhile, which I didn't do with Larsson's other two novels, which I couldn't put down. The final third of the book is the payoff when events dovetail to a masterful ending.  Larsson's intention was that there be several additional novels, and I understand that there are some unedited manuscripts and outlines.  If those don't come to fruition, the end of Hornet's Nest stands as a satisfying ending.

B003QCNFN8|4.0|Ozzy has done it again. He continues to build on his legacy and his impact on rock music. True to form, Ozzy proves once more with this new offering that he hasn't lost his edge and yet can still throw out a ballad or two to satisfy his wide range of fans. Personally, I'm looking forward to many hours of listening pleasure on this one.
0060254920|5.0|Ho sad that this classic combination of words and illustrations has fallen flat on the silver screen.  Like most adaptations, Maurice Sendak's remarkable literary achievement is best suited to the vivid world of our own imagination rather than the feeble Hollywooding of yet another great work.<br /><br />\\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" is a romp through a wonderland, a run through a scary forest and a complete captivation of the mind and all it can conjure.  Whether this book is read aloud (and that should always be the first introduction) or re-read by the young person (or later \\"young\\" person)the world of unknown is brought to life in these pages.  We find monsters of all kinds of shapes and sizes and colors.  Some of them are new and some seem to be from the hidden places in our own minds.  All of them, we discover, may not be as terrible as first imagined.<br /><br />Grab a copy of this book.  It is far too good to be borrowed.  Like all good books, it must be owned and treasured.
B001HN6940|5.0|I received my Alice In Wonderland Blu-Ray right away. It was in perfect condition as if I had picked it up straight from the store. I am very pleased with Amazon.com. They never disappoint. And the movie was great. I love Tim Burton & Johnny Depp. I have watched it at least a dozen times since I got it. Thank you!

B001AQT0RC|5.0|As others have stated, it would have been nice to have this in 16:9 widescreen format. But that is minor and does not decrease my rating of this Bluray release of Contact at all. This is by far the best this film has ever looked. A masterful transfer by Warner Brothers and another quality release that deserves to be in your movie library. 5 solid stars.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|V For Vendetta is Awesome and loosely(adapted for the big screen),about a Man who had to fight Tyranny(Anti-Catholic Protestant Anglican *not catholic in my view* England). the true story is alot more interesting, and the movie is very interesting itself and 1984esque, I enjoyed it!
B003L16FAE|4.0|Lets get a few issues out of the way - 1.) Yes, the new transfer has some instances of over DNR treatment.  2.) Yes, these scenes gloss over some detail.  However, it's no where near as bad as many of the newer reviews make it out to be.  I have seen this Blu-Ray twice now (willing to bet most of the whiners here giving the Blu a one have not) and it IS an improvement over the old version.  I will trade the mild over DNR of this disc for the scratchy, dirty, antiquated MPEG-2 transfer of the original Blu Ray.  Much of the grain in the old version was NOT from the film print.  It was from the horrible print they mastered from, as well as the MPEG-2 transfer.  The original Blu Ray was not much of an upgrade from watching an up-scaled DVD. The color and lighting of this new transfer are very nicely done - much better than the dull, wash-out look of the original Blu.  I also say these scenes show more detail than the original Blu Ray version due to the improved colors and lighting.  Would I have preferred a complete remaster?  Hell yes.  Do I wish the few scenes that are over-DNR'ed looked better?  Yes, as well.  Would I chose the old Blu Ray over this one?  Not a chance.  This is still the best video presentation this film has ever received.  That may not be good enough for some, but it is for me.  But, unlike many of the complainers here, I realize that all this is just my opinion.  So, don't turn into a parrot, judge the Blu for yourself and make up your own mind.  If nothing else, buy this one for the free ticket and keep it as the \\"bonus features\\" disc for the old release if you still dislike the print.  Either way, enjoy this great movie.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|My husband and I recently bought both season 1 and 2 of Breaking Bad.  This is a great show and we're so excited for season 3 to come out on DVD!
B000NOQDOA|3.0|Works great and fit my DVD player better than I thought it would. My only complaint is that the plastic hooks could be a little stronger but overall I am satisfied.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|The actors, acting and acts are wonderful in this enchanting surreal romantic Sparkling Gem. \\"The Lake House\\" is very surreal like good fantasy -- but also very real like good sci-fi. Beware of general spoilers following below.<br /><br />The time-warp entanglement is developed in a well-done balance supporting the developing romance and being supported by this romance. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves build their on-screen romance in a fine but passionate dance of feelings -- helping greatly to re-enforce the whole movie. But all the actors and acting are in sync with this. The mood of the changing [and unchanging] settings is also in good sync with the flow of the story. In particular I like the usage of several aspects of time-linkage to provide looser to closer connectivity -- the dog, the house and the mailbox are all involved in this cross-time connectivity -- as well as Alex and Kate linking-up via those elements and more direct ones such as shared inner voices, nearly shared presences and total shared presence -- in the same place-and-time at last. All these cross-time-linkage aspects are juggled spot-on to build this fine romance. The story is kept moving at good speed but is still easy to follow -- and the details do clue-in the development without total certainty. So all can enjoy this Science Fantasy Romance -- as some good old ones were actually called -- as this one IS -- like \\"Somewhere in Time\\" [another such Sparkling Gem] +++
1416594787|5.0|This book completely destroys the idea of \\"an intelligent designer\\". It details how the the evidence for evolution can be found by examining the ways that various parts of the human body have changed with the passage of time and why those parts that are no longer of use are still retained in the body.
1400052173|5.0|I just finished listening (BOCD) to this fascinating and well-researched story. I commend the author for her tenacity and compassion. Not only is it the story of Henrietta and her cells, but of a family and society. I would recommend listening to the story, rather than reading it. The narrators provide a vivid experience for the listener, and make the poor black dialogue easier to understand. This was a random pick off a library shelf. I'm so glad I selected this title!

B000W9DSVW|5.0|No unneeded fluff, just three great discs in a single case. Second movie may be the best, but they're all good.
B0039NJTLQ|4.0|This movie was incredible, and it's now on my list of A++ movies. I watched it solely based on reviews and now I understand why it got such a high rating.      Tobey Maquire, Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman, Sam Shepard  ...  the list would be to long to name all of the actors that outdid themselves with solid and convincing performances.    It's a serious and heartwrenching story that (thankfully) sheds light on the trauma that so many soldiers endure while defending their country. I've heard firsthand accounts from veterans describing their experiences, and this film brings home the fact that war is a devastating, life-altering event for both the victims and the participants.
0441172717|4.0|I watched the original Dune movie (you know...with Sting hah) not too long ago and became enthralled with the idea of reading the book. I really wanted to understand some of the things in the book that didn't get across in the movie. While Dune was a bit too political for me at times overall it was a surprisingly steady and understanding read.
B002ZG9846|1.0|Here's the deal... if you enjoyed this movie there is a pertty good chance you're in teen's up to your thirties... still living with your parents and collecting comic books. If you find it cool that a 12 year old girl gets beeaten up, you should get your head examined. Here's the thing, most successful comic book writers are successful because they use violence and controversy to promote their works. They can only generate one form genre for their work and therefor is limited to what they can achieve. For example, Frank Miller, a 'successful' comic book writer/artist, did a couple of movies with hardcore violence... where is he now? He can't generate any new ideas outside the violent frame-work and therefor, it's safe to say, his career in the film industry is exhausted. Same thing goes for Mark Millar, the comic book writer for Kick-Ass, can't write for his life outside the comic book industry. A perfect example of this is that even the flm script had to be written by someone else. Sure he won some award for comic book writer or whatever, but those awards are equivalent to a farmer getting a 'best tomato grower' award at a carnival. As to this 'Millar World' created a few years back, promising new and exciting things... I'm still waiting. (I found this site on the net, very interesting superhero-by-[...])

B000SQJ27I|2.0|I am a big fan of Manu Chao - not a blind fan. This album has maybe three good songs on it that are then shamelessly recycled twenty times or more. Really! I mean come on - if you just don't have enough material for a complete album, then wait until you do. Don't give me the same cheap drum machine beats with the same rhythms and the same vocal phrasings over and over. It's an insult to a global fan base that would gladly wait a little longer for him to get more inspiration to write a complete album.    I know he tends to re-use ideas on the same album, but this is too much - he just didn't care enough to deliver the goods this time.

GRACE is the artist...but an artist needs an editor, at least in the periodical genre. and i think they both 'get' each other's jobs; appreciate each other.    and  in this brief slice of their lives, anna, the editor, all said and done, came around to seeing the beauty/continuity  in grace's work, and to me that shows a humility and a bottom-line objectivity  (genius?) that i wish i possessed. thing is, both anna and grace recognize(d) the brilliance in each other's work:    grace did so when she acknowledged, reluctantly, that 'fashion looks forward' and championed anna for introducing to  vogue (years hence)  something that had never been done before--placing a celebrity on the cover to not only spawn common folk's aspirations, but to feed the featured celebrities' need to be right with fashion--- to be the 'it' girls. suddenly, the celebrity had to be, not only conscientious of who they were, but WHO they were WEARING, and all of us 'little people' took note and voted... with (our)  dollars.    so although i agree (with many)  that this movie doesn't clip away at a frenetic pace, it didn't bother me a wit.  i came away informed, sympathetic and in admiration of anna.    i loved this movie and fwiw, i'm a hyperactive \\"man's  man\\" to boot!   go figure...    oh, and btw, great music throughout. i'd buy the soundtrack if it was available.

B002VECLVO|5.0|Adapted from a novel by Christopher Isherwood, A SINGLE MAN is an engrossing, bittersweet, often humorous, tale of loss, isolation and the discovery of what is important in life.  The fact that it deals with a gay man, in the days before people came \\"out of the closet,\\" has nothing to do with the film's basic message.  This story would have been just as viable had the protagonist been a heterosexual.<br /><br />George Falconer (Firth), as he goes through what he has determined will be his final day, not only recalls the loving relationship he had with his late partner (Matthew Goode), but he also begins to notice little things about his world and the people who inhabit it.  He, for example, compliments a secretary in the college's administration office on her pretty smile, and he takes some extra time to get to know his neighbor's bratty kids.<br /><br />Charley (Julianne Moore), his closest friend and long ago lover, is fighting her own sense of loss; her husband has left her and her son is grown and out of the house.  She would, desperately, like to woo George back to her, but it is a hopeless cause.<br /><br />It is only Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), a young student trying to come to terms with his own true nature, who might dissuade George from his fatal course of action.<br /><br />The film has an ending that is quite unexpected.<br /><br />Firth, Oscar-nominated for this picture, delivers a magnificently low-key performance.  He has no loud, emotionally charged scenes, yet he commands the screen with his eyes and subtle facial language.<br /><br />Ms. Moore is also very affecting in the role of George's hard-drinking friend, as are Goode and Hoult in their supporting assignments.<br /><br />A SINGLE MAN is a totally involving, positive look at the human condition and the importance of the seemingly mundane moments of life.<br /><br />© Michael B.

0679731725|5.0|For readers who prefer fast-paced thrillers or the light beach-read, \\"The Remains of the Day\\" may be just the book to pull you into serious, contemplative literature.  The story is presented in the form of a butler's diary, and the time alternates between his years of service to Lord Darlington (leading up to WWII) and the \\"present\\" day, in which Lord Darlington has died and Stevens is adjusting to both his new employer and his own advancing age.  Deciding to seek out a former associate who now lives in Cornwall, Stevens borrows his new employer's car and takes a \\"motoring trip\\" across the English countryside, all the while contemplating his past thirty years of service and their greater significance.<br /><br />Ishiguro is truly a master of the form.  I've seldom read a book by an author who seems to understand, without reservation, what good fiction does and how it is written.  There are no car chases, no shouting matches, no fistfights or dead bodies.  But if you let Ishiguro work his magic, he will take hold of you swiftly and see you to the conclusion of this beautiful work.<br /><br />As for character portraits, the butler Stevens is perhaps one of the most compelling characters I have ever met in a novel.  Many times I felt myself thinking of Stevens not as an interesting (or even life-like) character or as an ideological construct but as a real person with feelings, desires and passions.  As you read the book, there are quiet moments that are utterly heartbreaking.  Most of this is due to understatement or implication, and being able to sense the meanings behind Stevens' actions--and especially his non-actions.  The Remains of the Day presents these repressed moments of sorrow with a precision I'm not sure I've found elsewhere--even in the works of the masters.  I'm anxiously awaiting my next Ishiguro novel.

0307454541|5.0|This book introduced me to Stieg Larsson and his compelling characters, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander.  Once I finished with Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I couldn't wait to read the second and third book in the Millenium trilogy.<br /><br />The story line for this book caught me with the first chapter and had me hooked.  I didn't recognize the villian early on, nor did I figure out the twist in the story.  The writing drew me in and entertained and informed me.<br /><br />The book, while translated from Swedish, seemed complete and without holes, so I assume the translator did an excellent job. The story line entranced me so much that I have ordered the Swedish movie with English subtitles on DVD - and I can't wait to watch it - it should be in next week.<br /><br />This year has been a pretty lackluster year as far as some of my favorite author's go (can I mention that I hated Janet Evanovich's Sizzling Sixteen); so finding a new Author's series was exciting - too bad it ends with 3 books for now since the author is deceased and there is a bit of wrangling about the intellectual rights to the storyline.<br /><br />This book and the third in the series are by far the best, however even the second book is worthy of an honorable mention.

B003ICWTR4|5.0|I'll keep this relatively short and sweet because there's no lengthy thesis needed.  Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band are the greatest live performers in the history of rock 'n roll, and this DVD shows why.  The sweat, passion, sincerity and unbelievable energy these guys put out in every performance is captured in all its majestic glory with this DVD, as well as showing a Bruce concert in its entirety for the first time in a commercial release.  When you see one of their shows, you are drained of every human emotion by the time it ends.  And in a wonderful way.  Thank you, guys, for putting this out.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|Okay.  Don't need to say much here because everyone has already said it for me.  I just want to say that my daughter screamed at our television set the entire time we were watching this pathetic movie because absolutely none of it was even remotely close to the book.  Someone sold out BIG TIME here.  Don't waste your time - it was really boring. No St. Louis Arch scene, no tunnel of love, too much sexual tension between Percy & Annabeth (who are supposed to be 12), horny black ghetto Grover, No Aries, No Seaweed Brain said by Annabeth, Poisidon (sp?) wasn't wearing his beach bum shirt!

B0027ZEHGO|4.0|I had to review this movie for an ethics assignment. It was my second time seeing it and I enjoyed it very much. Keep in mind, it is Michael Moore's perspective and although some people think it is propaganda, I think he did a fine job at getting his point across.
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|This book was a true betrayal.     If you look at the average star rating for Gardens of the Moon - you would think \\"Hey, 200+ people can't be wrong, right?\\"     In a word - yes.     But first I'll explain how I came to write this review. My fantasy background consists of primarily Tolkien and then more recently George Martin and his Song of Ice and Fire series.  I tend to research authors heavily before I take a chance with their material for the first time.  Outside of the traditional fantasy realm I enjoyed Stephen Kings' The Dark Tower series, anything from Dan Simmons (particularly his Hyperion and Endymion novels) and more recently also Peter Hamilton for his Commonwealth series (Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained).     When looking for the next fantasy series to attempt I was looking for one that was complete. As much as I love finding a new author to enjoy - I hate the dreaded WAIT for them to finish their work. And so, I became interested when I read that Steven Erikson was finishing this Malazan series with the last book (the tenth) being released this year. The entire Malazan Book of the Fallen series rates highly on Amazon and most review sites.    Based on the comparisons to Tolkien and George RR Martin in many reviews of Eriksons works I took the plunge and Gardens of the Moon (the first book of the ten book series) was downloaded to my Kindle...    After reaching 28% complete - I stopped. Did I have the right book? Yes. Was this a Kindle malfunction? No.     Where in the world did all of these glowing reviews come from?! I mean, I know the guy clearly tried hard to start this series - but come on. I feel like either other reviews were from people completely unfamiliar with good writing or they were grossly mislead by sympathy based on the apparent effort by Steven Erikson to create a complex fantasy world. Seriously. This is hack, amateur stuff.     Maybe I'm just looking at this all wrong. It certainly has the ingredients of a good story but it's missing: substance. Sure, Erikson is \\"world-building\\" but that's a lame reason to give someone a decent review. Once the author constructs the framework for the world - they should, I dunno, CREATE AN INTRIGUING PLOT AND COMPELLING CHARACTERS.     Some say that the books get better as the series progresses. With as many choices from authors both old and new in the fantasy genre (and beyond!) it seems ridiculous to force oneself to read this pretentious me-too \\"epic\\" fantasy in the hopes it \\"gets better\\".
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Haneke's grueling and ambitious ten year project finally manifests itself to the screen here.  The results are completely stunning and provocative.  Many of the director's past films have centered around violence or have used the threat of violence as a focal point.  But The White Ribbon resonates much deeper with its broad, powerful implications geared toward authority.  Although it has some harsh content and moments of sexuality, the violent acts seem to just be a by-product of a much more disturbing element.  Haneke's complex objectives are left somewhat of a mystery, although he does admit that this story is about \\"the origin of every type of terrorism, be it of political or religious nature\\".<br /><br />This story will be easy for several people to relate to in many various aspects.  At it's core essence, it really is just about normal people rebelling against injustice.  The abuse of power has a demoralizing effect on everyone it affects.  Sooner or later there are always repurcussions.<br /><br />Just before the start of WWI, some strange accidents occur in a small German village.  These are mysterious types of sabotage or blatant disobedience, all geared toward three powerful community figures.  All three of these leaders are guilty of exploiting those at their service.<br /><br />THE PASTOR--he decides to tie white ribbons to his children for trivial offenses.  Each ribbon is supposed to be a reminder of their innocence and purity.  Each child can't help but feel humiliated as this draws unwanted attention.<br />THE DOCTOR--this man sexually humiliates his housekeeper, as well as forcing himself upon his teenage daughter.<br />THE BARON--he is the lord of the manor, and uses his power to devastating effect on the villagers.<br /><br />The running time is 144 minutes.  This doesn't have a great deal of action but it inevitably invades your mind with its penetrating subject matter.  Shot in glorious black and white, this film was nominated for Best Cinematography as well as Best Foreign Language film.  Brilliantly acted with such rich character development, The White Ribbon is an amazingly poignant and rare accomplishment in cinema.  Highly recommended to all serious film fans.ilm.

1416550550|5.0|The Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton, is an amazing story. I came upon this book by accident, but was so taken with the story from the very first pages that I could not put it down. The book is approx. 600 pages, but you get lost inside the story and are sorry when it ends. It is truly engaging.    The book is broken down into 3 parts. The first storyline is about a child who is left hiding on a ship heading for Australia. A woman traveling with her tells the girl not to tell anyone her name and to remain hiding until she returns. The woman never returns and the girl is left on the boat to travel alone. A man who works on the docks in Australia discovers the girl, and after realizing that she is alone, takes her home and raises the girl as her own. The girl is so young that she blocks out this part of her life and believes that the man and woman raising her are her birth parents. On her 21st birthday she is told how she was discovered, and this changes everything for her. However, it is not until the girl's adoptive father passes away that she is given any clues of her past.    The second storyline is about this same girl who is now in her 60(s) who is trying to find out about her past.    The third storyline is about the girl's granddaughter who takes up the search upon her grandmother's passing.    Who is this mystery woman who left a child to travel alone on a ship to Australia? Despite promising the child, why did she not return? You will enjoy learning the answers to these questions.     There are other very interesting stories as well that are woven together to make for an intriguing read.     The only negatives that I have about this book is that it is very long and there are many characters. Also, the chapters flip to different time periods so sometimes it is hard to keep track of which character's voice is speaking. It is well worth the effort to overcome these minor flaws.    Don't miss reading this book. It is a story with substance and characters that youwant to learn more about.

I am looking forward to seeing it! ***<br /><br />I was a fan of Emma Donoghue since reading Slammerkin many years ago.<br /><br />I started this book this morning and just put it down. I was glad it was a holiday and I had nowhere to go! I just couldn't stop going back to it until it was finished.<br /><br />I was hooked upon reading the first paragraph, 'Today I'm five. I was four last night going to sleep in Wardrobe, but when I wake up in Bed in the dark I'm changed to five, abracadabra. Before that I was three, then two, then one, then zero. &quot;Was I minus numbers?&quot;'<br /><br />And the story of Jack and Ma begins. The entire story is told from the perspective of Jack, a just-turned five-year-old who is living in Room with his Ma. The only thing Jack has known is Ma and Room. His day is spent utilizing the few things they have, the songs and stories his Ma remembers and the five picture books he's had read to him over and over.<br /><br />Imagine being a parent living in an 10 x 10 foot room for years, trying to survive while keeping your baby growing, safe and entertained. Imagine Jack, a child who has only ever known Ma (and the late night visits from 'Old Nick' who he only sees from his vantage point in a wardrobe). Life is good for him since he knows nothing else. Empty egg shells become a snake when threaded together, empty toilet rolls become a maze when taped together, Phys Ed is sometimes Track which goes around Bed from Wardrobe to Lamp.<br /><br />For Jack, his days were filled with 'thousands of things to do'; for his mom, her days were filled with the knowledge of what was outside of Room before her captivity.<br /><br />Two different perspectives, two ways of looking at life.<br /><br />Donoghue has done an amazing job of letting us think like a isolated, innocent boy whose life is turned upside down when he learns that Outside of Room is a big world. Up until his 5th birthday, his world was balanced, controlled and he missed nothing since he didn't know of anything else. Everything beyond the room was Outer Space. Once he was told that the there was so much more out there, fear of the unknown crept into his world.<br /><br />What a wonderful job of creating their little world, of letting us into how Ma's imagination taught Jack, kept him safe, and kept him entertained. If you have children and have ever had to wait in a doctor's office or somewhere else for a few hours, it is sometimes an exhausting job of coming up with games to play to pass the time. Imagine that feat everyday, all day for years.<br /><br />I had such respect for Ma as she taught Jack about so many things in a world he didn't know. Her imagination for passing the time with games using so few resources was incredible. Her love of Jack so deep and primal it made me hug my kids many more times today than usual.<br /><br />And just when you think that escaping is the best thing for them, imagine what it feels like to a boy who has only known Room.<br /><br />This was a fantastic story, imaginative, creative, unique and beautifully written. I never tired of reading from Jack's perspective.<br />I was reminded of what the world could look like from the perspective of a small child. It makes a parent want to be more kind with their words, more respectful of what their child's needs are, and more understanding when things seem confusing.<br /><br />And if you think this is really contrived and just not possible, just google the name Josef Fritzl - a real life horror far greater than Room.<br /><br />A wonderful book from an already favorite author.nothing since he didn't know of anything else.

B000FC1RCI|4.0|Didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Like most teens, I'm not really a fan of 'old' books. But, I've gotten more of a fan of mystery novels in the past year because of some mystery freebies from the Kindle store, so that helped.<br /><br />For the first twenty pages or so, when they were introducing ALL ten main characters, I have to admit  nearly put the book down. But glad I didn't, as as soon as the introductions were through, it sped up pretty quickly.<br /><br />I predicted the ending, but then again, I often do. Overall wonderful book, and I'm glad it was on my summer reading list. (Will be a freshman in high school in the fall.)
014241543X|2.0|I thought that the story was good but unbelievable.  To have someone walking around in a state of limbo (waiting to die or live) was preposterous.  I thought that the whole sequence before finding out her brother had died was ridiculous.  The first thing you would want to find out was who is dead.  It took so long for her to even address that her little brother was dead.    There were silly parts where I lost interest, where the author was dealing with mundane details when you wanted to assess the damage of the auto accident.    Sorry, I lost interest during these parts of the story.

0307269981|5.0|I took some time between reading \\"TGWTDT\\" several years ago and \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" which I just completed.  Larsson's second book in the trilogy does not disappoint and in my estimation even one-ups the first book.  Again, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomquist are the central characters, althoug this time Salander becomes the hunted vs. the hunter.<br /><br />Larsson once again does a great job building the arc of the story over the first 100 or so pages rather than jumping in right from page one.  Lisbeth is traveling the world for 18 months on the hacked money and Blomquist and \\"Millenium\\" are working with a couple who are writing a novel and dissertation respectively on corruption and Eastern European prostitution ring in Sweden.  However, before it is published, both are murdered and Lisbeth winds up being a prime suspect for coincedental evidence found at the crime scene.<br /><br />It is amazing that Larsson can sustain the pace and plot twists over the course of nearly 600 pages.  In my mind, he crafts an even more engaging rollercoaster ride this go round.  Part of the reason is that Larsson begins to unravel the enigma and mystery that is Lisbeth by revealing the circumstances of her troubled youth.  While \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" gave us a glimpse into the master canvas he was painting, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" enabled us to see the master brush strokes and the vivid detail this great artist could achieve at the peak of his artistry.<br /><br />The only disappointment I had was that once I finished \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\", I only had the the final novel in the trilogy to look forward to.  Having crafted two mesmerizingly entertaining books with the unlikeliest heroine, and knowing that he planned to write not 3 but 10 books in the series before his untimely death, one only wished that Larsson had lived to further entertain and surprise us.

0743454537|2.0|An interesting concept where a child conceived to provide bone marrow for her sister with leukemia, employs a lawyer to protect her rights and prevent her parents from further exploiting her.  In the mix are unintentionally abusive and neglectful parents and a ridiculous story line with a lawyer.  The end of the story is pure daytime soap opera and not worthy of discussion,but I must take issue with Ms. Picoult's creation of a lawyer with epilepsy which is so poorly controlled he needs a support dog, yet continues to drive a car.  Ridiculous, the man's a lawyer, for heaven's sakes, he may be stupid but he is bound by a code of behavior.  Also, he is ashamed and secretive about his condition.  Why?  This is not explained and in 2010 this is ridiculous.    These things spoiled the book for me.  Picoult does this sort of thing in many of her books, it's like she can only do so much research and then lets things slip for the sake of the plot.  shabby.
0807014273|5.0|Excluding scientific achievements and their documentation, no other short book presents the gifts of the twentieth century as perfectly as Frankl's work.<br /><br />Man's Search for Meaning, or ISM for the modern substitution of \\"An Individual's\\" for \\"Man's,\\" gives the extreme twisted side of human organization with its autobiography of a holocaust survivor, but balances it with the strongest statement possible not against the horror, but against determinism: humans always have the freedom to choose their response.  Furthermore, the text is written with the direct, yet respectful words, for the twisted, but not fixed, timber of human life exemplified in the intelligent style of Freud, Jung, and Adler - a mid-century style not commonly written anymore, a style that assumes that a reader not only has worked to develop a humane education, but is also willing to work to improve it.<br /><br />The main thrust of Frankl is that humans strive to make meaning of their lives first and foremost.  This updates Freud's statements that humans seek pleasure primarily or Adler's statements that people seek power. The job of a psychoanalyst (a quaint word today) is to use logotherapy (a set of approaches initiated by Frankl) to help patients solve their problems, internally and externally, by finding their meaning.  Obviously Frankl fits within the resolving existentialism tide of the twentieth century.  He complements the texts of Isaiah Berlin which also focus on the meaning of freedom within the constraints of humans as they are and the societies in which they live.<br /><br />If only considered responses to Frankl by stoics such as Seneca and Aurelius were possible.  A dialogue across time - which a reader can form - places many of the travails of history as being those of humans within history resolving their search for meaning, a seeking also inherent within most readers. This segues into seeing history not just through the lens of great events and powers, but through the experiences of everyone, not just elites.ot just elites.

I was able to call again, and she said that she would try to hurry thing along a bit.<br /><br />Finally, she sent a message saying that it was clear that there was a problem. (Ya think?)<br />They thought it might be a hardware problem with my particular unit, and said that they would replace it. This was a good idea, I thought. They very pretty good about it, even paying for me to ship it back to them.<br /><br />The new unit arrived. The results from this one wasn't as green; rather, more blue. Still NO WHERE NEAR ACCURATE.<br /><br />I sent them the profiles again. The 'color scientist' looked at them again.<br /><br />About ten days later, she asked me to try CHANGING ONE THING. Well, guess what: It made NO DIFFERENCE.<br /><br />Since they were still giving me nothing (literally, no contact at all), I tried calling again. I got ahold of the woman who was supposedly helping me, and she had me try changing a few values. The result was darker (what we expected) but it was STILL BLUE.<br /><br />A while later, with NO MORE PROGRESS AT ALL, I had had enough. I reminded them that I had been working on this for a long time (at this point, it had been 86 DAYS). I said that I unless we had made some significant progress in fixing these problems within two weeks, I would be asking them for an RMA to return the product.<br /><br />She responded relatively promptly and said that she would re-forward all of the data to the color scientist (admitting that he HADN'T EVEN LOOKED AT IT YET), and said that she would do all she could to expedite the process of finding a fix.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY NOTHING happened between the time she sent that email and the time when I had said that I would ask for an RMA.<br /><br />I asked for an RMA.<br /><br />She said, \\"I am sorry to hear that you were not able to get the ColorMunki to work for you.\\" That was more than a little annoying. Here came the next problem. Since this was a gift given to me by someone, and it was purchased here on Amazon, ColorMunki/X-Rite (CM's parent company) couldn't help me. I would have to go through Amazon.<br />Well, that wasn't ideal (Amazon didn't what had happened), but I was willing to try it. My mistake.<br /><br />I asked for a return from Amazon.<br /><br />*IT HAD NOW BEEN 97 DAYS since I first tried the product.*<br />This is considerably longer than the 30 days from purchase during which Amazon accepts returns for this product.<br /><br />We called Amazon and got a sales rep whom we persuaded to give us a refund. Great!<br /><br />Once the refund had been processed and I got the invoice for it, I noticed a problem. Since the item had been returned outside of the 30-day window, I had been charged a $69 RESTOCKING FEE. That wasn't okay. The reason that it had been returned so late was that I had been so patient and tried to make a good-faith effort to fix the problems, working with the manufacturer.<br /><br />I told this to Amazon. They said that I would have to work things out with ColorMunki. I agreed with them.<br /><br />I told this to ColorMunki. They said that I would have to work things out with Amazon. I did not agree with them.<br /><br />I told ColorMunki what Amazon had said, as well as my story (which they already knew), and why I felt that they should refund my money.<br /><br />They gave me the address of someone at what I believe to be X-Rite's parent company (the MAC Group US).<br /><br />I sent him an e-mail, to which I RECEIVED NO RESPONSE.<br /><br />I sent him ANOTHER EMAIL, which HE ALSO IGNORED (stop me if any of this sounds familiar).<br /><br />Finally, I got a curt message from him saying that the fee had been charged by Amazon, and they had nothing to do with Amazon's policies. In other words, he wouldn't help me.<br /><br />I told the woman whom I was working with originally (again) why I believed that they owed me the $70.<br /><br />By way of response, she sent an email to another guy at the MAC Group and CC'd me.<br /><br />A few days later, I received a nice email from the new guy (who turned out to be really helpful) saying that he was sure he could help me, and to give him the order number and receipt.<br />I verified the information with him.<br /><br />After a while, having heard nothing, I sent him an email asking the status of the refund.<br />He verified which fee I was talking about, and asked for my address to send a check!<br />He said that he would send me a check and then he would deal with Amazon, so I wouldn't have to wait.

B003A4IFDW|5.0|The key to appreciating this wonderful CD is to understand the title. This is not a covers album. If you are expecting or hoping for recognizable versions of these popular songs you will be disappointed. After my first two listens I was unhappy with my purchase for that reason. I am SO glad I gave this CD another chance before I sent it to a used CD bin. Trust me. This is one of the very best releases of 2010. Bettye, you go girl!

B000FJGWBM|5.0|I'll admit it, it took me nine years to get to this film. It couldn't possibly exceed the hype. There was just so much critical love for this film that it couldn't possibly deserve it. Yet, after the movie had ended for my first viewing, I was left with the words, \\"Holy crap, that was pretty good.\\" My mind was blown at the ending, and after this mind-frak of a film, I left to meditate on it. Then I watched it again after a month, and I stuck with my original opinion that this is in fact, a really good and original thriller. Is it perfect? No, but it's still quite the classic and a must-see for everybody, at least once.<br /><br />If there's one reason to watch this movie, it's in the way it's presented. It starts at the end, starts at the beginning, and alternates between the two until they meet in the middle, to which the movie is wrapped up. It works for the story, and keeps the viewers on their toes in keeping track of everything. Let me illustrate to you the brilliance in this presentation. There's a scene where Carrie-Ann Moss comes up to Guy Pearce in her house, bleeding and bruised. She tells Guy Pearce that it was her boyfriend did it to her and that Guy needs to get rid of one of his associates. Seems harmless enough, right? Right, but you just watched the scene without context. Then it moves to the scene that led up to the previous scene. Carrie-Ann Moss comes into a room, Carrie-Ann Moss tells Guy that she's going to use him & proceeds to go on a obscenity-laced tirade directed towards Guy. Only problem is that Guy will never remember this conversation in a minute because he can't write down that Carrie-Ann Moss is actually bad. Guy then hits her, causing her to bleed, so Carrie-Ann Moss walks out the door. She sits in her car for a minute, and then Guy forgets everything that just happened to him, and Carrie-Ann Moss walks through the door as seen in the scene previously, or afterwords. It's more or less brilliant and Nolan uses it to his advantage to spice up an already great story.<br /><br />If there's on fact the movie wants to get across to you, it's that this short-term memory loss makes your life a living hell. The movie goes deep into the detail of how somebody with this condition would live. What are the downsides, what is their life like? Does the ending take things a little bit too far, in basically revealing that half of what the movie told you was a basically a lie? Yeah, maybe a little bit. But hey, the reveal speech by Joe Pantoliano and Guy Pearce is great. And again, it's a 'Holy Crap' moment that will leave you satisfied on your first viewing. Did I get the same feeling the second time around? No. Since I was diverted thinking about the mystery of it all, I started thinking about the more logical points of the movies and the detail. In this sense, the movie didn't hold up for me the second time around. Plus, I must ask, is Carrie-Ann Moss' character really necessary? I mean, besides the scenes that I mentioned above, was she really essential to the movie, or was she just a diversion, or just another person to manipulate Guy Pearce after Joe Pantoliano is gone?<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend seeing Memento once. Any more than that is risky. Sure, it's brilliant, but some of the magic from the first viewing was lost on the second, as least for me. Still a classic, I really hope I never get that short-term memory loss.n already great story.

0891419063|5.0|Well written. I found myself feeling as if I were actually present. What men these were. I don't know how they endured the things that they did. I can only imagine what it must have been like.
0307592839|4.0|I wavered a lot about whether this is a novel or a short story collection, but my reactions to the different stories made me fall on the side of a collection.  On the high end, there's \\"Ask Me If I Care\\", which I originally read in The New Yorker, a breathless teenage narration that perfectly captures the dizzy line between adolescence and adulthood, and \\"X's and O's\\", which many other reviewers have referenced, which solidifies one of the collection's major themes - how do any of us get from A to B?  \\"...we were both a couple of asswipes and now only I'm an asswipe; why?\\"  Egan is such an excellent writer that even the overtired 2nd person narration of \\"Out of Body\\" feels natural.    On the weaker side are the more experimental pieces, requiring a patience for aggressive metafiction and postmodernism that I just don't have - the circuitous footnoting of \\"Forty Minute Lunch\\", the PowerPoint presentation of \\"Great Rock and Roll Pauses\\", and even the exhausting text-speak of \\"Pure Language\\".  Yes, all of these contribute to the greater themes, but they lack the deceptively simple, rich detail and characterization of Egan's more accessible work.    It's dizzying keeping track of all the lesser characters who populate the stories (I found the enormous cast of \\"Safari\\" particularly exhausting), and you can't let any one of them slip by, because odds are they will pop up, at one level or another, in later stories.  The effort, however, is worth it, as the pleasure of running into someone who seemed only tertiary but turns out to be desperately important makes clear how very talented Egan is.    The fact, however, that you can skim over pieces without having it ruin your understanding and enjoyment of the larger work is ultimately why I'd call these short stories rather than chapters, but it reads smoothly enough to recommend it as a novel to your anti-short story friends and neighbors.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I enjoy fantasy books. They deal with things outside this world, i.e. elves and dwarves. This book had me hooked from the start, but there was not an elf in sight. Larsson crafted a fantastic story that I couldn't put down. Well worth reading.
0307594777|5.0|Perhaps its my Swedish heritage (there is even a Nordman character in one of these books) , and my predilection to mystery novels - but I really liked these books. Good thing Canada Day was cloudy - I burnt through these guys over a three day period.  You need to read them in sequence and read all of them- it is a well planned out trilogy.  The most modern heroine, Lisbeth Salander  - is the  antithesis of a cuddly girl - which makes for lots of steamy plotlines and twists. The hero Mikael Blomkvist, sleeps his way through his relationships as he plies his unique method of investigative journalism. Most of the locations are in Sweden, and I recognized a few from when I was there. The reflections on Swedish culture - which has been called very liberal are quite interesting. It does make North Americans look quite uptight all the time! Too bad the author passed away after writing these, they do make you want for more.  Each book will keep you going on a four hour plane ride! Plus this should make for good movies.
0312360258|1.0|This book is not worth it. Maybe if you are an 11 yo girl you may find it interesting. Dialogues and plot are not well constructed. Narritive is boring. To be skipped. It is definitely not an adult material.
B0029RQE84|3.0|The biggest issue with Get Lucky is that MK's past two albums (Shangri la and Kill to Get Crimson) were so, so wonderful, that they set the bar for him extremely high.      Get Lucky does not have that kind of flow, or those fantastic songs that make you hit the rewind button over and over again.  There ARE some gems (Border Reiver, Monteleone, Before Gas and TV and the best IMHO, Piper To The End, but most of the album seems mediocre.      So Far From The Clyde, while a great tune and on paper and awesome storyline just did not do it for me...and nor did Cleaning My Gun or The Car Was The One.      Something is missing here, and I cant really put my finger on it.  I was disappointed.

B000JLSM00|5.0|The impact of \\"The Searchers\\" and its influence is undisputed all you have to do is watch any of Sergio Leone's westerns or even \\"Silverado\\" (a love letter to Ford and Hawks' westerns). I'll admit I wasn't much of a John Wayne fan growing up but he gives a marvelous performance here as the hardened soldier Ethan who returns to his brother's Texas home after serving in the Civil War. When his neices Debbie & Lucy are kidnapped by the Commanche and the rest of his brother's family brutally murdered, Ethan with Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) who he rescued as a boy and Lucy's boyfriend Brad take off in pursuit in hopes of saving the girls and taking revenge.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Vera Miles (\\"Psycho\\"), Natalie Wood and Ward Bond.<br /><br />Beautifully shot in Monument Valley (among other places), Ford's film looks marvelous in this digital restoration. Shot in the Vista Vision process, the print they've used here looks clean with colors that pop.<br /><br />Extras include a commentary by director/writer/Ford biographer Peter Bogdonvich, as 1998 documentary on the production of the film narrated by John Millius, a new featurette on the film, an introduction by actor Patrick Wayne (who appears in the film)and vintage footage from the Warner \\"Behind the Cameras\\" TV series. We also get the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />\\"The Searchers\\" is a product of its time (including the acting)so keep that in mind if you are coming to this after watching films made in the late 20th century or early 21st. It's a marvelous film, beautifully shot.

B000YJ54DU|2.0|I discovered the Jack Reacher series late, sometime around this past April, and I've been reading nothing but Lee Child's books since.  There have been some some jarring changes throughout the series (first person, third person, etc.), but the tone has been consistent throughout.  However, this is the first book in the series that seems like it was written by someone else.  I'm not talking about the politics, I'm talking about the story.    The set up at the beginning promises regular old Reacher: it's a little bit Rambo with enough curiosity about a funky town to carry the story along.  Where this novel misses the beat is that there isn't any point at all where Reacher as a character would care.  His past excursions always draw him in reluctantly because of his past, or because of a slight, or because someone is in trouble.  None of that is included here.  The more he finds out about the town the odder it becomes, but that's the only thing driving the story.  There are wronged women and dead men, but there aren't any reasons Reacher, as a loner, should care about any of them.    I'll be honest, this whole thing reads like Child wrote the beginning of a book years ago, stopped, and then slapped the second half on recently.  The bad guy is cartoonish and he's only truly bad for what he might do in the future, not what he is doing now.  Reacher novels usually work because the bad guy is actively doing something bad, but Thurman is mostly PLANNING.  Planning isn't exciting.  What the bad guy is planning also seems out of the scope of Reacher - he works best with smaller, realistic problems, not nation-crisis problems that Reacher would call in the Feds for because he's smart enough to do that.  We saw him plan for that in 'Bad Luck and Trouble'.  No such planning here.    It was a disappointment.  There was no readily-identifiable victim Reacher was helping, the story was nonsense, and it didn't carry well at all.  This wasn't a page turner.  This was work.  That the end seemed tacked-on and short wasn't surprising.  I hope for better in the next book.    And for the people complaining about the politics:  that's not the problem with this book.  This book barely qualifies as a Jack Reacher novel, and I think that's what you all don't like about it.  It's certainly what I didn't like about it.

B0015DROBO|5.0|This book is excellent.  Yes, you really need to pay attention to the many characters, and the plot is complex, but it is certainly well developed and gripping.  This is the introduction to the second two books in the series.  All are well worth reading, but start here.

0060832819|5.0|It is not often that I am left at a loss for what to say about a book.  The Zahir has that quality that it impacts your soul without being able to describe the method.  Coelho speaks of love, the freedom of love, commitment, relationships and obsession.  In this way it is like many of his other works. Yet, the Zahir is different.<br /><br />Not all love stories are the same.  Love and relationships are not like a railway track - a set of standardized sizes, headed in one direction, unchanging, without the possibility of turning.  Love is everything and nothing.  It is like the wind - powerful, everywhere and nowhere.  Through his autobiographical novel, Coelho takes the reader to the depths of their soul to reveal the nature of love.  It cannot be possessed, clung to or consigned to a personal history.  It must be lived and experienced in the now. It must be freely given and received. If read with the heart opened, the book will touch you.<br /><br />Few books have the capacity to change a perception of such a fundamental element of life - and this one did it for me.
B001FB5634|5.0|I'll not go into the details that other reviewers on this site have written about this film. \\"The Road\\" is an emotional cinematic masterpiece. As far as a film adaptation of a powerful book, it is equaled only by John Boorman's 1972 classic \\"Deliverance\\". When my wife and I finished watching this wrenching movie we tearfully called up our 26 year old daughter, who lives on her own , and asked her over to our house so that we could put our arms around her, kiss her, and tell her that we love her. Why this film was not nominated for an Academy Award as \\"Best Picture\\" is a total mystery to me.
1416550534|5.0|I'm probably the last reader on the planet to pick up [[ASIN:B0012U7QTU The House at Riverton]], and I don't know why I denied myself the pleasure for so long.  This debut novel by Australian Kate Morton was released first in Australia and was already a #1 seller and award-winner in the U.K. before its 2008 release in the U.S. It's a big modern Gothic, ranging over more than eight decades but cleverly contained within the story structure of a first-person narrative.<br /><br />Grace Bradley, 98 years old and residing in a nursing home, is contacted by a young film-maker producing a film about the 1924 suicide of a young poet. The poet took his life at Riverton, the country manor where Grace was a ladies' maid, and since Grace is the only living person to have known the poet and the family at Riverton, the film-maker wants to interview her.<br /><br />So begins a retrospective view of Grace's life at Riverton, where she went into service in 1914 at the age of fourteen. The elderly Grace is in the process of recording the details of her life at Riverton for her grandson, a novelist. The book moves back and forth between Grace's first-person accounts and her life in the nursing home as the movie progresses.<br /><br />The author deftly handles the First World War combat of the poet and his friend, a young man from the Riverton house; she presents as vivid a picture as I've seen in a novel of the fear and isolation in the trenches and the war-torn French countryside. Out of this experience flows the \\"shell shock\\" of the young poet, making the wartime scenes a contributing cause of his death. However, there were secrets, and it's clear throughout the book that Grace knows them--Grace alone, now, after all these years.<br /><br />Fortunately, the book doesn't rest entirely on the secrets of Riverton, because in the end they're not so surprising. But the marvelous \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" feel of the book is pure delight, and the fact that it's framed with a modern story adds to the feeling that we're looking into a stereoscope at old photos. When the film-maker takes Grace to visit the site of Riverton, where it all happened so long ago, the veil between past and present shifts for her as the old secrets want to be told.<br /><br />Kate Morton's second novel, [[ASIN:1416550550 The Forgotten Garden: A Novel]], was just as beautifully crafted as this debut; and we eagerly await her next offering. If you haven't read \\"Riverton\\" and \\"The Forgotten Garden,\\" it's never too late; they are timeless.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010ooking into a stereoscope at old photos.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This wonderful film is appropriate for people between the ages of 15 and 115. I strongly recommend that schools buy copies of it (1) for teachers to show in social studies classes and (2) for students to check out from their school libraries.<br /><br />This film's true story is a great one about a young woman with \\"different\\" abilities, who earns a Ph.D. and succeeds in a world-class way in a so-called \\"man's world.\\" The acting in TEMPLE GRANDIN is uniformly excellent, with Claire Danes as a shining stand-out. Along the way, most viewers will find they are learning a lot about what it means to be a \\"human being\\" and what the phrase \\"humane treatment\\" really means. And many viewers will frequently find they are very deeply touched--and even getting misty-eyed.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen this bio-pic will have an array of favorite scenes she or he would like to discuss with others (on HBO, I've viewed it start-to-finish 3 times and have watched parts of it at other times). Two of my own favorite scenes are Temple Grandin discussing her \\"squeeze machine\\" with her new blind roommate, and Temple Grandin getting press credentials that allow her access to places she was forbidden to enter. I could easily list two dozen more. And who can forget the film's wise message that \\"different\\" doesn't automatically mean \\"less\\"?<br /><br />I hope that many high school libraries and public libraries will buy DVD copies of TEMPLE GRANDIN--if yours do not, you might urge them to do so--or you might donate a copy to them. Speaking as a retired teacher, I strongly recommend that public schools buy copies for classroom viewing, so that young students can have a chance to watch and discuss this truly great film.<br /><br />CAUTION: because of the intensity of some stockyard scenes, some people under the ages of 13 or 14 might not be mature enough yet to view them.
B002WY65W4|2.0|The zombie scenes were very short and far between until the very end of movie. It more tried to be a romance and buddy movie which I was not interested in. I wanted a funny zombie movie like Fido or Shaun of the Living Dead. It was disappointing. It more focused on the love story between boy and girl. The few zombie scenes in the first two-thirds of movie were extremely short. We kept wondering when they were going to run into zombies, they went long stretches without any and then they would give us a two minute zombie scene. It had a few funny parts but it felt like they made a romance-buddy film and to add a new dimension, they threw in some zombies. So disappointing, I really wanted another Fido or the like. Now that was hilarious. I am trading in my copy it was so bad.

0802473156|5.0|This is a simple concept, easy read, that absolutely makes sense in all you relationships. A must read for you and anyone who loves you. I've never posted a review on anything ever, but this book was worth telling people about. My girlfriend discuss the book a lot and we implement it's recommendations regularly. It has definitely helped us to understand each others needs, and she's worth it.
B000V86OKG|4.0|*NOTE - THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS *<br /><br />Just when all seemed calm for Dexter after the eventual disposal of the Ice Truck Killer in the Season 1 finale, his past crimes come back to haunt him as some scuba divers accidentally stumble upon the underwater graveyard of his victims.<br /><br />Season 2 finds Dexter under scrutiny when the FBI is called in to help Miami Metro deal with the capture of \\"The Bay Harbor Butcher\\". What better way to explain his odd behavior to co-workers and to Rita than pretending to be a recovering drug addict.<br /><br />Of course, this predictably puts a strain on his relationship with Rita, especially after she discovers his \\"sponsor\\" is the sympathetic, oddly attractive and enigmatic British lass, Lila.<br /><br />Dexter eventually enters into a sexual relationship with Lila, which he soon regrets when she begins displaying psychopathic behavior and a flair for pyrotechnics.<br /><br />We also see Dexter and Doakes playing cat-and-mouse games with each other, with each having the upper hand at various points during the course of the season.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Deb works out her Daddy issues with FBI Special Agent Lundy, all the while unaware that step-brother Dex is the Bay Harbor Butcher everyone is scrambling to locate and apprehend.<br /><br />While Angel and Masuka provide some of the comic relief, Lt. Laguerta continues to be more than just a thorn in  Deb's side. We are shocked to learn what lengths Laguerta will go to in order to get her job back and are touched by her loyalty to Doakes when he comes under suspicion.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't find Season 2 as riveting as Season 1, but I still enjoyed every minute of it. The acting continues to be superb, though I wish Rita wasn't always coming off as such a wet noodle. Michael C. Hall is amazing to watch, especially during the scenes when he feels as though his world is spiralling out of control.<br /><br />I am eager to see what the producers have in store for Dexter in the third season.Dexter in the third season.
B001DF68MA|4.0|Overall this is a pretty good seat. The installation isn't very hard, maybe takes a few minutes to adjust to your bike. **MAKE SURE YOU CONTINUALLY CHECK & TIGHTEN THE LARGE HAND SCREW THAT CONNECTS THE CHILD SEAT TO YOUR BIKE, IT WILL LOOSEN, ESPECIALLY THE 1ST FEW TIMES YOU USE IT**  Our daughter loves the seat, she likes being able to feel the wind in her hair and be close to her daddy! =)
B003CN5SAY|4.0|I LIKED THIS SHOW OVER THE SIX SEASONS. THIS WASN'T IT'S BEST SEASON BUT A MUST HAVE TO COMPLETE YOUR SERIES COLLECTION.
B003OAHE3O|5.0|In my opinion this is their best record since \\"Dig Your Own Hole\\", and yes that does mean I hink this is better than \\"Surrender.\\" This decade the Chems have released the prety great \\"Come With Us\\" album, the good \\"Push the Buttons\\", and the sub-par \\"We Are the Night\\", but this album is a return to the highs they showed in their late 90s heyday. Tracks Escape Velocity and Swoon are epic, beautiful psychadelic explosions for your brain, and all of these tracks have an epic intensity that makes this in my opinion their second best album. Brilliant!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|Hachi was a great movie, and based on a true story.  Surprisingly, a film that was not properly or adequately promoted.  It is one of the few movies that is suitable for the entire family of ages from six to 96.  Be prepared to shed some tears.
0783225849|5.0|Now playing on cable TV, this 1960 thriller is one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films of all time.  I saw it in a theater when it was first released and I will never forget its impact.  And seeing it again, 50 years later, it is still just as mesmerizing, even though, this time round, I was well aware of the plot.  It's rare a film can still be called a masterpiece after so many years.<br /><br />Janet Leigh sure was beautiful.  And we first meet her wearing a bra and half-slip in a motel with her lover, played by John Gavin.  They can't marry because he still has to pay alimony to his former wife.  This is an obstacle that seems impossible to bridge.  However, all of a sudden she's thrust into a situation where she has a chance to steal $40,000 from her employer and flee to her lover across the state line.  She's paranoid about the police and even trades her car in for another model at a used car dealer.  The audience identifies with her.  We expect her to be in the film all the way through.  But that is not the case after she meets Anthony Perkins at the Bates Motel.<br /><br />He's cast as an awkward young man who tries to please.  But there's something weird about him and his relationship with his mother.  And soon there is a unexpected murder that will be etched in the minds of moviegoers forever.<br /><br />Now the mystery really begins as Janet Leigh's sister, Vera Miles, starts to search for her with the help of a private investigator played by Martin Balsam..  The plot thickens.  So does the mystery of Norman Bates' mother.  There is not a wasted word in the dialogue.  And, even though I knew the ending, I was at the edge of my seat admiring the skill of all those who put this film together.<br /><br />With the exception of a over-explanation by a psychiatrist at the end of the film, this is an outstanding and disturbing work of art.  Don't miss it!
B003EYVY0E|5.0|Hi Harry Potter people!  I wanted to say that I have the first two Harry Potter Ultimate Editions on blu ray, and they are very high quality.  They have wizard cards, digital copies, and the makings of the films.  They also have these hardcover picture books with Harry Potter stuff in them.  The best part of them is the extended edition option, which includes more scenes that are in the book.  I was very impressed with the extra footage in the Chamber of Secrets additional scenes.  Anyway,one of my Harry Potter sources online has November 25th as the release date for #3 and #4, and I think it is accurate as the first part of #7 comes out a week earlier.  I knew it would come out around that time.  When it comes to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the movie was very well done.  Every one of the films is given first class treatment and they are all worth the purchase, including the 4th one which left a ton out of the book.  My dad never read Harry Potter, but he loved the time turner thing with Hermoine in this movie.  I love this movie.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, and read many of the negative and positive reviews. Initially, I was tempted to offer only 4 stars. However, after reading the negative reviews, I realized how truly thought provoking this movie really is. The movie is based upon truth, not fiction. We can simply examine what was happening in Iraq at the time, and the controversy over both the WMD issue and the shape of postwar Iraq to realize that we really only need to change some of the names in the movie to make it almost completely factual.    Matt Damon does a great job in portraying the frustrations surrounding the civilian/military partnership in postwar Iraq, and what actually occurred. The disinformation campaign both prior to the war, and even today, specifically about the WMD in Iraq is mind-boggling. It's why so many Americans have so little trust in their own government.     Even today, some people still believe that Iraq had something to do with 9/11 and that the Iraqi WMD was somehow transferred to Syria. Incredible. Try the Freedom Fries and some Kool-aid.    In short, this movie is thought provoking. It's not an action film, in my opinion, but an interesting political thriller in the same vein as Edge of Darkness.     People who reviewed this negatively for political reasons need to do a little more research. If you question the premise for the Iraq War, it doesn't mean you're not patriotic. Quite the contrary.
B00198X0WW|5.0|This has always been my favorite movie, especially the music score.  I also found the documentary about the village which provided the indian actors, very interesting.  The movie is based on a true story which full of hope, forgiveness and rebirth will, in the end, bring the viewer back to the harsh political and economic realities of the European/Western world which has come to dominate our lives and values.    I have recently purchased the Blu-ray release and would like to share my experience. The video is very good.  The audio can be a problem for those of us who have small living rooms and no theater sound system.  The dynamic range of the sound in the DVD version has been compressed so that people, such as myself, can watch the whole movie without having to adjust the volume up and down.  The blu-ray has uncompressed analog sound.  Because the sound is analog rather than digital, the compression feature on my blu-ray player was not available - and, I found myself continually having to adjusting the volume. In a big room with a surround sound system, the audio would probably be impressive.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|i really enjoyed this series had heard about it and was very glad to get it and view it i'm sure i will watch it more than once
B00005JMFQ|5.0|The best movie for the holidays if you love Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Keira Knightly, all in one movie!
B0009DBXXG|5.0|Watching this DVD was like seeing a  (re) creation of West Side Story .....you get a glimpse of Bernstein's genius at work in the moment of performing  with the singers and orchestra.  An inside and  insightful tour of music being \\"made\\" as it's being \\"made\\"........and the viewer feels very much a part of the process along with the singers, composer/conductor.  The comments provided by the singers and by Bernstein himself, and  being \\"Invited\\" into the process of rehearsing, animated discussions,  and performing  give the viewer fresh views into a classic and inspired work that has its place in music history as well as, I think, social history.
114382475X|5.0|Of course this is one of the landmark books in history.  Completely turned biological science on its head and spawned science vs. religion debates that continue to this day.  I love the one star reviews.  This is one of the towering books in history, it's not meant to be entertainment.  How about at least a 2nd star for its historical importance?
0316113506|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It's important that people understand the exercise is not just a tool for weight loss, but a critical component of a well-functioning brain and body.  If you want to enjoy optimal health, and that includes mental happiness, then you need to exercise. Not just to lose weight, but because so many aspects of our health, longevity, and happiness are tied to the biological responses to exercise and movement.
B00009P1O0|4.0|On The Beach was not available on CD for many years, when it came out it was worth the wait due to crystal clear reproduction of the original recording.  The title track is a total standout and not as depressing as some fans have hinted.  The rest is also more accessiable than I expected, for example See The Sky About To Rain, Motion Pictures and Ambulance Blues.  The cover must be one of the best ever, so if you like After The Goldrush and Harvest, this is your next stop.
B00006GA4C|5.0|This is it. There is nothing like this album. I first got turned onto this album in 1970 by my older brother. \\"Winter In My Soul,\\" \\"Paranoid,\\" and \\"Inside Looking Out,\\" the original side two of this album were/are the clinching songs for me.    I went on to get 'Closer To Home' and 'Grand Funk Live Album' and sometime around the fall of 1971 I was turned onto to Neil Young, Buffalo Springfield, and CSNY(with 'Four Way Street'). At that time my musical tastes took a 90 degree turn. I compared GFRR to CSNY and thought, whoa...why am I listening to GFRR?!?!    So I buried my past and became an avid Buffalo Springfield, Neil Young, CSNY fan and an GFRR apostate. That is, until 2007 and the remaster of this album came out.  Once I bought this baby and actually re-listened to it after a literally 36 year absence my mind was blown away.    And in some weird way this album as a guitar album sonically reminds me of Neil Young's 'Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.' Mark Farner's guitar has a raw, fuzzed out guitar sound. The production work is primitive as is the songwriting. It has a unity to it where each song bleeds into the next one.     So, yes, I had to re-buy 'Closer To Home' and 'Grand Funk Live Album.' Even picked up the grossly underrated 'On Time.' My GFRR apostate days are over!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I bought this cd because my fiance dedicated the song Love Story to us so I bought the cd. I listen to it all the time..And the shipping you can't beat it. It arrived within days of being ordered..
B0001CCY7E|5.0|John Barry is such a master - and this is one of his best performances.
0312427999|1.0|As most others giving one star have noted, this author clearly knows very little about Milton Friedman and free market capitalism.  It's obvious she has her own agenda and cares little for facts.  Save your money.  This book is an absolute joke.
0671015206|5.0|I picked up my copy from a yard sale.  The previous owners didn't get around to reading it, I think.  I liked it so well I bought copies for my kids from Amazon.
0761158464|5.0|I love this book. Received it for Fathers day and it is a must have for any fan.
1423113497|5.0|I bought this Percy Jackson 3 book set for my 12 year old grandson. He had already read the first one during the school year and loved it. I wanted to buy him more books for the Summer, but I couldn't beat the price to buy the 3 volume set.
0307474712|4.0|I read this when it first came out in the UK and loved it then. Reading it again to review for Amazon Vine, I remembered how much I loved Nicholls' clean writing full of humor. Briefly, One Day is about how Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley spend every July 15th between their early twenties until their early forties. Their earlier days brought back great memories of college and life after college. That sense of infinite possibility, indestructible youth. Nicholls captures those moments so precisely. He shows how each character struggles and changes through the years.    Without giving away the plot too much, I'll just say that if you loved the movie When Harry Met Sally, then this novel is for you. Except that this novel is so much better than any Hollywood romantic comedy.
B00005JLYW|5.0|This DVD purchase was a gift and the recipient was not only surprised but very pleased. Service was quick and easy with the product arriving in record time. DVD arrived as stated (new and factory sealed) at a terrific price.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Surprisingly well done. Interesting take on narration and exposition. The main character is the boy even though others get more screen time. There's some good humor in the beginning that nicely contrasts British Aristocracy with the rough and tumble types in Oz. MY GRADE: A minus (almost five stars but not quite).
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this as a gift and the recipient was thrilled.  It was shipped on time with no problems.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Well done but not quite as A quality as the first one. Most of the living cast is back as well as an old Mickey Rourke as the villain and someone named Scarlet Johansen or however you spell it. :) MY GRADE: B plus.
B0000714BP|5.0|i love this movie its hilarious and they sent it to me right after i purchased it and i got it in 2-3 days
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Good fun and some really nice dialogue scenes. Brad Pitt is memorable in actions and mannerisms and there's enough gore and shock value typical of a Tarantino film. That said, while I liked it I didn't really like it or love it. MY GRADE: B
B000H5U832|5.0|Wonderful, fun movie appropriate for the whole family.  I was impressed with the moral stance of this video.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Based on a true story. The touching tale of a well to do Southern Family that takes an impoverished black teenager into their house and give him a long lost feeling of home. Sandra Bullock does an exceptional job as a fiery southern belle with a mind of her own and it was a pleasure to see the magnificent Kathy Bates in a supporting role. Michael Oher, the teenager, goes on to eventually play for the NFL. See the pictures at the end if you want to see what everyone really looked like. Bullock was nominated by the AA for best actress and won best actress through the Golden Globes.  MY GRADE: B plus to A minus
B0036SUQWA|2.0|I never thought I'd dislike a movie as much as I disliked this one, and, in watching this movie, wish I had not wasted two hours of my life that I'll never get back.  The cast is great, and the acting is fantastic; unfortunately, the wandering plot and unreality of some of the scenes left my analytical mind thirsty for something to hang onto.  May I have my two hours back?
0783226837|3.0|A fun \\"B\\" movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Dated in special effects but the characters and story make it worth a look. Also, see Kevin Bacon play a hick. What a deal. MY GRADE: B minus.
B0000Z0HMQ|4.0|I didn't see that in the initial page- wouldn't want anyone else to miss it and buy a dvd that is useless. My computers won't play it either.<br />I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't want to change the majority view- since I haven't seen it.
B0014YVC6W|3.0|I'll save any potential blu-ray customers the hassle and tell you right now that if you already have the special edition of Short Circuit on dvd, you might as well keep it, because this blu-ray isn't much of an upgrade at all. But for those who still haven't bought the movie, is this version worth buying on the superior format? Again, no. In fact, if you just plain want the movie and don't have to have all your movies on blu-ray, I recommend going with the dvd instead.    For those who didn't see it in the 80s, Short Circuit was a pretty big movie for its time. It's the story of Number Five, aka Johnny Five, a robot who was originally part of a line of military weapons, meant to turn the tide of war in our favor. But he was struck by lightning one day, and as a result, began to think for himself rather than follow orders to kill and destroy. He eventually meets a woman named Stephanie who helps Number Five develop a personality and shows him how people live. Number Five just wants input (any information available, be it in a book, on tv, etc.) and to live his life, but the military wants him back, as do his developers.    There isn't a whole lot to the movie itself, especially when you watch it now and don't let nostalgia blind you. While it is a pretty fun and cute comedy, it's hard to look past some things as being lame or borderline offensive. Fisher Stevens caked on the brown makeup and plays an Indian man here, and eventhough he did go to a dialect coach to learn how to 'speak Indian', I can see his role irking a lot of people. I thought he was funny as a kid, but now, why didn't they just go with a real Indian guy? And sadly, most of the scenes that don't have Number 5 are fairly boring. But when he's on-screen, it's impressive to see how much work was put into him, and seeing all the parts in his face and arms move, seeing that each item has a function. The message of the movie still holds up, like trying to teach a robot about life and death, and why thingsin the world are the way they are, even if there's no set reason for it. There's not much more to say about the movie other than if you've never seen it, and don't like movies from the 80s, you should pass. But for people looking to enjoy a robot comedy movie or are just nostalgic, give Short Circuit a shot, and definitely check out the sequel, since it did everything better.    Now here's the problem- the visual quality on the blu-ray is a mixed bag. Certain scenes look great while others are a mess. Just when a scene would look beautiful, everything would suddenly become grainy and dull, almost like it was taken from the vhs version. Don't expect much from the transfer here, and you should be fine. The audio though, is much better thanks to the DTS HD Master Audio 5.1. It's nothing that'll show off your home entertainment system, since the movie doesn't have a whole lot of explosions or gunfire, save for a few scenes, but it got much better treatment than the picture quality did.    Special features are fortunately back, after mysteriously vanishing from the second dvd release. The commentary track with the director and writers is here, and the guys do a good job of using their time to talk about technical details and fun stories on how they got the actors for their roles and why they went with some things, like having Stevens play an Indian man. They also talk about the trouble working with Number Five and the budget problems too. 'good commentary track here. Next is nearly an hour's worth of interviews with the cast and crew, though most of the time is spent talking about Number Five's development. Oddly enough, there's a featurette dedicated to the creation of Number 5 that runs under 10 minutes, and is hilarious to watch if only because of how 80s it is. An isolated music/sound effects track is on here as well, though I don't know why. This isn't exactly a movie that's known for either the music or sound effects, but I guess someone out there's been waiting for this. Finally are the Behind the Scenes (very short footage of people on the set/behind the cameras) and the press kit, which is just the trailer, photo gallery and bios and production notes. Overall the extras are good, but only for the die-hard fans of Short Circuit.    Once more, if you already have the special edition dvd, there's no reason to get Short Circuit on blu-ray unless you absolutely need all your movies on the format, or if you don't already have it and for some reason don't want the dvd. It's worth watching once if you haven't seen it, but the people who'll get the most out of it are those who still get something out of the more fun, zany movies from the 80s. You could do a lot worse than Short Circuit, that's for sure.
0307454541|5.0|OMG, where should I begin? I first heard about this book, and the sequels in the trilogy, during coffee hour in the parish hall in my church. I swore that I would not get hooked. I then bumped up against it on a blog whose writer I greatly admire and he had good things to say about it. I linked to Amazon and placed the order. I am now on book three. These are the kinds of books that cause one to stay up into the night turning pages as fast as it is possible to read until your eyesight finally gets so blurred that it becomes impossible to continue.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist and Lisabeth Salander are a rather unlikely pair of protagonists. He is a left-leaning journalist and she is withdrawn, socially inept, and mistrustful of almost everyone, but not without good reason. Officially, she is considered mentally unable to handle her own affairs and has a court appointed guardian. She is also a computer genius with a photographic memory and a researcher without equal who meets Blomkvist when she is hired by him, through a friend with a security agency, to do some very special research.<br /><br />The plot lines, and there are many, were artfully intertwined by Stieg Larsson in this tale. These books are not for the squeamish or faint of heart. There is quite a lot of violence, blood and gore in abundance, and even sado-masochism.<br /><br />One gets the sense that Blomkvist is the alter ego of Larsson who was himself a leftist journalist in his native Sweden. It was said that these books were written by Larsson as a way to unwind and relax from his journalistic pursuits. It is a sad fact that Larsson died of a massive heart attack before these books were released; so, for those of us who are now hopelessly addicted to Blomkvist and Salander, the third book in the series will be our last fix.
B00012BSHG|2.0|This is our second inflatable kiddie pool. Our first (different product) lasted 3 years and rather than patch it, we bought this item to replace it -- BIG MISTAKE. The new pool is easier to inflate than our last one, because all of the rings inflate though a single valve, and it's attractive and a good size, but that's where my praise stops. The single-valve advantage also has a down-side: if there is a leak in any of the side rings, the entire pool deflates. Ours held air for about 2 hours, then got soft - but still held water enough for my 1 and 4 year old to play in. After 4 hours it was unusable. We've now patched the valve for the sides and found at least two other seam leaks and we've only had the thing out of the box for less than a week. We're experienced kiddie pool owners, so I'm confident this isn't a over-inflated pool, nor is it resting on an unsuitable surface, it's just a cruddy product. I'd return it if I still had the packaging. I regret this purchase and will now spend the time to patch my first pool, if that doesn't work, I'll replace it with its identical product.
0307474712|3.0|I want to love this...and I can't.  It feels like a do-over.  Think Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn from 1978's SAME TIME NEXT YEAR meet Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan in WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and you have ONE DAY.  Alas, I'd rather re-visit the originals.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Listening and viewing the Carole King/James Taylor's performance recorded here on Live at The Troubadour, is a case of revisiting their concert as seen here in Australia at the Hope Estate Vineyard in the Pokolbin, Hunter Valley New South Wales.  I loved every minute of it, and was so impressed with the talent of all the group.  Carole King must be one of the most prolific song writers of the age.  So many of Carole and Jame's songs have become the music of our time.  And the best part is I can see/listen to Live At The troubadour many times again.
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|This album stands the test of time as one of the greatest ever made and I have probably listened to it more than any other album in my collection. A timeless classic that always sounds great. This deluxe edition was extremely well done and long overdue (I have them all and I highly recommend you buy every deluxe edition, especially if you are a Cure fan). It sounds so much better than the original CD and the extra rarities and concert tracks are amazing. Check out the song \\"Pirate Ships\\" on the rarities CD.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|CASTLE IS JUST A FUN SHOW. EVERYONE IN THE SHOW JUST GETS BETTER WITH EVERY EPISODE.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Thrilling, scary and a twist at the end made this one of the best movies I've seen in years! DiCaprio's acting was over the top.
B002ZG997C|5.0|DENZEL WASHINGTON is a lone survivor, after America is attacked by nuclear warfare. The visuals are monochromatic which gives the feeling of \\"being there after a tragedy.\\" It is a deep movie and the viewer must pay attention. Not to give away the movie, but if America would covet THE BOOK now instead of letting Satan run the country, apocalypse can be avoided. I SEEN THIS MOVIE THROUGH AMAZON VIDEO ON DEMAND.
B003B13QQU|4.0|Certainly it's different from previous works with it's c.1983 concept, but this is a great album that further showcases Goldfrapp's flexibility and attention to detail.  From the swirling synths, to the breathy 80's romanticism, the album does a fine job of being both an excellent imitation of what would be a blast from the past and an unmitigated blast.  Lots of meticulously crafted beats & sound-scapes, and a great deal of colorful fun to boot.
0061537969|5.0|I read this on an airplane flight and I experienced everything from laughter to tears.  It was a great book even if you don't have a dog.  But the ending made the whole read so mearningful.
B0038QMREA|4.0|Boy - where to start? I'm all over anything \\"Bob Dylan,\\" so it is odd to recommend Wild Hunt by The Tallest Man On Earth (27-year-old Kristian Matsson from Sweden), which has absolutely nothing to do with Dylan other than the fact that this guy sounds like him - circa 1966. Yes, but can he write a song? Indeed, he can and once you get past the novelty thing, the songs really do seem to stand on their own. Time will tell, but I'm having fun with this one, and sometimes that's enough...for now.     GENRES: Contemporary Folk, Americana.    BUY IF YOU LIKE: Bob Dylan, Bob Dylan or Bob Dylan.    MUST HEAR TRACKS: \\"The Wild Hunt,\\" \\"Burden of Tomorrow,\\" \\"Troubles Will Be Gone,\\" \\"Love Is All.\\"
B001P9KR8U|1.0|I'm not as much shocked by the Slumdog's thin/predictable story line, bad acting and cardboard cut-out characters, as much as I am with the success it did achieve. Good for the filmmakers..., but hey, you don't have to  waste your time watching it.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Great Fantasy. The first 4 episodes are awesome. Then some are boring. Nevertheless the actors are so good and sexy that you always enjoy the show. Once you start, you can not stop until you finish the whole set. I already ordered season 2.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I have generally been very pleased with the quality and service from those companies that work with Amazon in providing previously-cared-for DVDs and CDs. And that is the case with this company. Quick, courteous, and the DVD was an original (not a bootleg, which has happened with other companies). I am VERY pleased.
B001TD1XWG|1.0|this is has got to be the worst album ever made in music history this is not even close to being a rock album this album is the most horrid album ever made
B00005JKEZ|5.0|An old movie favorite of mine w/Errol Flynn+ Olivia deHavilland that was black + white (back then)an now color. Great old time action and romance.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|This movie is friggin cool, and the \\"deluxe edition\\" ... well I don't really know yet.
1602830452|5.0|Finally got my hands on this set! A wonderful companion to the classic Granada TV series. Reminds me of the Brian Sibley radio play of \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Clive Merrison is a Holmes to rival Brett. Michael Williams is an intelligent, edgy, humane Watson. Supporting roles all well played, music & production top notch. This is definitely an investment, but worth it for Holmes fans!
142313494X|5.0|First I should state - I have no children but have followed most of the popular series since I moved into adulthood about 30 years ago - I think that a good childrens' series helps keep us fresh and youthful and okay I admit my friends' children think it is neat that I can discuss them but anyway I just watched the movie of Percy Jackson on Saturday night I really enjoyed the movie so I went out and bought the book series - and I haven't been able to put it down I am done with Book one and moved on to the second. I love Greek Mythology always have and I think the premise of the series is spellbinding from page 1 - Different than the mega popular Harry - yes and also similar - yes but Every book about a quest will have similarities - A gathering of friends and allies - a gathering of villains and obstacles in the way of the hero - This is why we enjoy books like this - I think we would all give our eye teeth to be able to go on a heroic journey or quest and explore uncharted lands and places. SO having said that and bucking the trend in the reviews of this series it isn't a copy of Harry Potter no more than Harry is a copy of the Canterbury Tales (quest/journey) or deeds (The Odyssey) Enjoy all of the various series on their own merit and you might be surprised how much you will enjoy them - and who knew Olympus was in NYC ! And to tell ya the truth I think that Percy has more character and backbone than Harry and I do think Annabeth and Hermione could rule the world (with their brains) and besides how cool is that to be able to breathe underwater for long periods of time !

B001HN694K|4.0|I like Tim Burton and I liked this movie. Johnny Dep is always great but if you are looking for the traditional \\"Alice\\" story you will find this confusing...creative but confusing.
B002ZG97RY|4.0|\\"The Green Zone\\"  takes place shortly after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when the priority for the American military was locating weapons of mass destruction.  Chief Warrant Officer Miller (Matt Damon) has just secured the third location supposed to contain these weapons and come up empty yet again.  He is convinced the intelligence he's receiving is faulty, and his investigation leads him on an unauthorized attempt to assemble pieces of a puzzle that, by themselves, don't make sense.      Director Paul Greengrass, who directed the second and third Bourne films with Damon, incorporates the quick editing, chases, and nonstop energy that characterized these movies, but never gives viewers adequate time to digest the ramifications of what Miller is encountering.  Of course, we have the benefit of hindsight, while Miller is first wandering through a maze of inconsistencies, politics, clandestine agendas, and red herrings.    Damon's Miller is appropriately courageous, high-minded, patriotic, and intelligent, so we're in his corner.  The script by Brian Helgeland, however, is like a burst piñata, with a shower of subplots, characters, and themes.  The movie eventually settles into a competent action picture rather than a methodical look at the waste the war has caused in lives, money, and political capital.  It also touches on journalistic complacency, one of the reasons many Americans initially accepted going to war with Iraq.       \\"The Green Zone\\" attempts to tackle the bad politics that got us into war but defeats its own purpose by putting too many ingredients in the blender.  There's enough here for a couple of movies, and the issues are merely skimmed so that action can dominate the screen.    The two-disc Blu-ray edition contains a Digital Copy of the film and several bonus extras, including deleted scenes, the featurette \\"Inside the Green Zone,\\" a Matt Damon profile, and feature commentary with director Greengrass and Matt Damon.  The movie is also available in a single-disc DVD edition.

1597801577|3.0|So, I usually give any book 100 pgs to decide should I continue reading or not.  This one I can't. So this I guess is less of a review, more of a personal opinion.  First the goods. I like the concept, the world, The mix of foreign words. The characters I like, sort of. They aren't well liked people. Aren't the archetypical heroes. They are normal people doing what they have to, in the bleak future. I really wish I could finish the book. Or rather, I wish I could convince myself to care enough to continue through the next 250 or so pages. But I can't.  Maybe it's me, maybe its the genre. But the way the book is written, I can't get past. It is all written in present tense. Exp: \\"The guard comes closer.\\" \\" Jaidee shakes his head\\" \\"The Doors open\\" \\" The man seems to falter\\"    For me it is very hard to get into the story, really into the story with it written this way. Maybe for others this is no problem, for me it never grabs my interest.    There is many many characters, and hardly anyway to care for them. I like the characters, like I said, but if more depth was added. It feels similar to watching a news report, or drama. The character does this, says that. But, like in the shows their is no depth. Once in a while it states what they think. But then just as quickly, will jump to one of any dozen of characters and continue with their thread. In exactly the same way. The only person I really enjoyed reading about was Emiko, and that is most likely cause she isn't human.    Also, it seems there is, or HAS to be a story before this. Alot has happened. that the author doesn't talk about. or hint at, in any depth. Only in a matter of fact way. Which may work for some.   I am aware, that there is a collection of his short stories, that some of these short stories, takes place in same world. Which might help. normally, I would rush out to buy the book, to find out more. But, it is just discouraging because of the writing style.     So thats my thoughts.

0446563048|5.0|From the very beginning, I felt as though I was sitting across the table from the author listening to him tell his stories like a new friend.  He starts with the simple & funny and comes through the full range of emotions & experiences as an entrepreneur, friend, thinker, team player, & social adventurer.    The frequent excerpts from his emails, friends, and Zappos employees really helped to round out the story.  I found myself wishing that I lived in Vegas or Kentucky so that I could be a part of this great company and its long term relationships with customers & employees.. but I guess I'll settle for enjoying just half the experience (I'm already a happy Zappos.com customer).      There are a lot of people out there telling their stories to anyone who will listen.  Hsieh's true-story-telling not only had me reading -Delivering Happiness- over and over again, but also made me want to jump in and be a part of the ongoing story.      I would recommend this book for anyone who has ever loved, hated, or just tolerated their job.
0451197968|1.0|So this would have been the first Stephen King book I read cover to cover. I was REALLY excited with the story line and could not wait to start reading it. The mistake I made and am warning you about is that during the introduction \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" King gives away the ending!!! Not just a \\"Oh, and then something negative happens\\" but \\"Blah, blah, and then he blah blah\\" specifically. If you want to enjoy the book (as I am CERTAIN I would have) DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION!!!!    Who does that?? Yes, I get it, it has been republished so you want to add a note, but for those who would have picked up the book for the first time (never had seen the movie either so I don't know if it tells the true ending) the book has been ruined!!!. . . I always pictured Stephen King as a smart man. . . WRONG!    So please! Add a HUGE SPOILER warning before you give the ending of a book before the story even starts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|After years of hearing about it, I finally watched the whole series of Firefly online. Quite frankly, I can't believe I went so long without seeing it. Although it can be rather cheesy at times, Firefly is a wonderful sci-fi series with amazing characters and an interesting world. While the series as a whole is fantastic, the pilot, \\"Serenity,\\" and the final episode of the series, \\"Objects in Space,\\" are some of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. The ensemble cast is terrific, and I'm disappointed that the series had such a limited run.    However, I have a few qualms with the DVD itself, which I received as a gift. Fairly often, the video appears quite low quality and grainy. Although this isn't a total deal-breaker, it's very distracting at times. The same goes for the audio, since once or twice I had a bit of trouble hearing what the actors were saying. While the sometimes less than stellar quality of the footage isn't EXTREMELY irksome, it would've been nice if a little more care went into making the product. Then again, if Fox actually cared about this series, it would still be on the air.
0425180638|4.0|Cornwell uses death as the theme throughout her mystery. She does this through her main character, who is a medical examiner. Dealing with death on a dally basis in her work does not prepare her for her own loses.<br />She shows that the manner in which people handle the loss of a human life whether a friend, enemy or family member can vary radically from person to the next, but that in the end it is still death and the last precinct. A tightly knit and well developed story...a good entertaining read.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Julie Powell (Amy Adams), young and still in love with her husband Eric (Chris Messina) move to Queens, New York and take up residence in a small apartment over a pizzeria. Julie yearns to be a writer and is despondent over the time she spent writing a novel that didn't get finished or find a publisher. She is a functionary in a government office and wants to do something with her life, make something of herself.<br /><br /> She decides to teach herself how to cook really well and launches herself on preparing each of the 524 recipes in Julia Child's famous book on French cooking in exactly one year. At her husband's urging, she'll record the effort in a blog.<br /><br /> Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) take up residence in Paris in 1946. Julia too is looking for a way to fulfill herself and she attends the world famous Cordon Bleu cooking school and embarks, with friends, on writing a book on French cooking for American wives who don't have cooks.<br /><br /> The parallel stories work like magic: Julia as she indulges her love of cooking over the near decade it took to write her book - and Julie as she goes through the ups and downs of emulating Julia and dealing with being a \\"nobody\\".<br /><br /> `The movie is perfectly cast, Meryl Streep is Julia Child, though you never forget that she is also Meryl Streep. Stanley Tucci is marvelous as the supportive husband. Amy Adams is a perkish Julie Powell and her performance is engaging as she works day by day through the formidable task she has set for herself. Chris Messina, unfortunately, is metrosexualized or something and his performance while good, is left behind by the others.<br /><br /> The storytelling is what made movies great. You feel for the people you're presented with on the screen: Julia, Julie, Paul and even Eric. You laugh a lot, get teary eyed once in a while, feel their sadness.<br /><br /> All in all, \\"Julia and Julie\\" is a marvelous piece of moviemaking which I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />Jerry
0385504225|4.0|Again we are taken on an exciting journey into Professor Lander's world of symbolism.  It is enlightening to have the setting of this book in our own Washington DC, a little American history lesson from a different point of view. He is quite clear the way he shows the influence that the Masons had over the development  of this country.<br />The research that went into this writing was applaudable, yet Brown was careful not to impose his ultimate conclusions on his reader but instead encouraged them to reach their own. Although a bit wordy, an intriguing read.

0380002930|4.0|This is a lengthy but charming book about a troupe of rabbits who leave their warren with its oppressive social structure to make a better life.  The rabbits are anthropomorphized about half of the time.  The rest of the time they are portrayed realistically with the behaviors, enemies, foods, and type of homes that characterize wild rabbits in Britain.    The realistic part was my favorite aspect of the book.  Adams is thoroughly knowledgeable about the lives and habits of rabbits, and it was fascinating to learn about them in so much detail.    The anthropomorphic aspect was also interesting, though.  It is political allegory, social commentary, and a moving story about fictional characters.  We see four different types of political structure in the various warrens:  an priviledged aristocracy (in this case, entitlement is conferred not through bloodlines but according to superior size and strength); a society that is accepts the periodic sacrifice of some of its members in order that the survivors may enjoy a life of pampered luxury; a totalitarian society that values safety over freedom; and a democracy in which everyone makes decisions together.    Because this is a plot-driven novel without a great deal of character development, it has the feel of a fairy tale or allegory (although with much more detail.)  This makes it less emotionally intense than it might have been, but I think that Adams made the right choice in writing the book in such a way.  He struck a balance between the portraying the rabbits as natural and as anthropomorphized.  To develop their characters and personalities more deeply would have been to humanize them, to take away their \\"rabbitness\\".      I didn't like the made-up rabbit language, though.  I realize the purpose of it - to impart a sense of foreignness - but it isn't successful.  The made-up words are substituted too randomly and arbitrarily, when an ordinary English word would have worked just as well (better, actually.)  The invented language ends up just being irritating, to have to keep flipping to the back of the book to look up words in the glossary.  (Doing that on a Kindle makes it even more annoying.)  Even the author seem to get tired of it - I noticed that except for frequently-used words that one soon learns, he uses the \\"Lapine\\" language less and less as the book progresses.    Watership Down is a well-written and very unique book that can be enjoyed equally by both adults and older children.  No wonder it is a classic!    (429 pages)      Quotes from Watership Down:    \\"I'd have him love the thing that was       Before the world was made.\\"     - W.B. Yeats, quoted in Watership Down    \\"To come to the end of a time of anxiety and fear!  To feel the cloud that hung over us lift and disperse - the cloud that dulled the heart and made happiness no more than a memory!  This at least is one joy that must have been known by almost every living creature.\\"

B00001OH7U|5.0|Station to Station is, in my humble opinion, Bowie's third best album, slightly ahead of Hunky Dory. The reason it is so good is because of its consistency. Six songs, four of them are great and two of them are good. If Ziggy Stardust was his revolutionary album and Low was his best album, then Station to Station was his transitional/quintessential album since it finds him bridging the gap between guitar-based rock and synth-based rock. It is this reason that I would tell anybody who isn't too familiar with Bowie to start with Station to Station because of the way he displays different facets of his musical sensibilities on it. At the time of its recording, Bowie was heavily addicted to cocaine and he doesn't even remember making the album. What is amazing is that the music did not suffer in any way because of all the great session players that surrounded him. Bowie's vocals are at their very best on Station to Station, with the ballads \\"Word on a Wing\\" and \\"Wild is the Wind\\" in particular ranking with some of Bowie's most emotional and heartfelt work. \\"Station to Station\\" is perhaps Bowie's most experimental song he ever recorded. It's ten minutes long, with parts that are slow, medium, and fast (but not necessarily in that order). What's amazing about the song is that despite its length, it never gets boring. \\"Golden Years\\" is the next song and was the album's hit. It's catchy, but it sounds like the total opposite of the previous song: whereas \\"Station to Station\\" was art, \\"Golden Years\\" is completely pop. Station to Station isn't a cohesive album, in fact, it's downright messy and the reason is probably because Bowie didn't really care about such a thing at the time because of his cocaine addiction. Having said that though, out of all the \\"messy\\" albums made during the 70's, Station to Station might be the best. The album has a spacey tone to it and it's more noticeable than on any of his other albums. The spacey tone adds to the music though and the album is probably Bowie's best-produced album besides Low. Not only is it spacey, but it also feels loose. Bowie's cocaine addiction probably gave him a go-for-broke attitude and if that is the case, it definitely shows in the music. Oh, and by the way, \\"Stay\\" and \\"TVC15\\" are fantastic: upbeat and melodic songs that grab your attention and won't let go. It's a great album but you don't have to take my word for it. Brian Eno called it one of the greatest albums of all time. You can take his word for it instead.obably Bowie's best-produced album besides Low. Not only is it spacey, but it also feels loose.

630463949X|1.0|When I received my DVD in the mail and opened it up, the round middle thing that the DVD snaps onto was broken...I didn't think too much of it since everything else looked okay.  I played the DVD that very night, and about 25 minutes into it, the picture became extremely grainy, then it would clear up, then back to grainy, then it finally went completely black.  It was almost as if it was a bootleg copy!  I tried to fast forward to see what would happen, and it still continued to be black....no sound or anything.  Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed.  I had already thrown the shipping slip away, so I couldn't return it...dumb move on my part!  The Fleetwood Mac DVD itself is an excellent DVD..too back the product itself didn't work correctly.      So, overall, I will never order any DVD's from Amazon again.
0061537969|5.0|I finished this book in two nights.  For the negative reviewers out there, so what if it's a philosophical dog, it's a book of fiction!!!  And for those who think the storyline was predictable, maybe but it was a touching ending and it had me choked up.    I found it a very enjoyable read, and it is definitely for anyone who has shared or shares their life with a canine.  It does make you look at your dog differently and wonder, I wonder if he does know what I'm saying.    Very enjoyable and I highly recommend it.  It will be interesting to see if the movie to be released in 2012 lives up to the book.

006145205X|4.0|I appreciate this book for its relentless positiveness. Everything will be better in the future, says Ridley, because, in the past, everything has become better in the future. Through free trade and the exchange of ideas, humans have bettered themselves in ways no other creature on Earth can even begin to imagine. The central precept of the book, free and open trade resulting in prosperity, is reiterated over an over again. The one caveat I had, in fact, was that it was repeated so often, and then later becomes the typical free market dogmatism espousing everyone shutting up and letting business do its thing, because the market is always right. In the long run, sure, it probably is, but to invoke a famous economist, \\"In the long run, we're all dead.\\"    There are excellent rehashes of \\"the good old days\\" (hint, they weren't that good), and ample evidence that life is, in fact, better than ever. We spend less time and less money for more stuff, allowing energy to pick up the slack (mostly oil for now). I applaud the view that everything will be better, and hope that he's right, and it will.

092389165X|4.0|Hard not to feel nostalgic for days when war was waged by warriors. A certain civility in that. Rules of engagement. Codes of honor. You think of Greeks, and Samurai, and \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade;\\" of French and German soldiers who meet in No Man's Land to share Christmas treats then return to opposing trenches.<br /><br />But then here comes Nanking, Stalingrad, London, Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki. Total war, as the phrase goes. A reversion to tribal days, perhaps, when warring foes fell men, women, and children alike, to void vengeance. A weapon now to instill dread, to sap the will, to raise the costs of conflict.<br /><br />Hiroshima: August 6, 1945, 8:15 a.m. That's when John Hersey`s story begins, with \\"a noiseless flash.\\" It begins not in the White House, nor in the Imperial Palace or the B-29 that dropped the bomb. But in the personnel department of the East Asia Tin Works, where Toshiko has just turned to speak to a co-worker. In the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital, where Dr. Sasaki walks down the corridor, a blood specimen in hand. In the minds of six who survived, at a half dozen points across the city, at the instant the atomic bomb exploded.<br /><br />Here Hersey does not pontificate, excuse, blame, or rage. He reports. With meticulous detail, in short, clear, declarative sentences, with controlled understatement. To describe a human experience so beyond words and thought that it can be grasped only through the senses.<br /><br />So, through the eyes and ears of these six hibakusha, literally, \\"explosion-affected persons,\\" we see the scarred multitudes fleeing the fires, hear the shocked silence of the radiated dying, feel the flames, and smell the putrefying flesh. Working like a novelist, Hersey puts us there, scene upon scene, with dialogue and pertinent detail, to show the reality on a human scale. Not commenting, but showing:<br /><br />\\"The hurt ones were quiet; no one wept, much less screamed in pain; no one complained; none of the many who died did so noisily; not even the children cried; very few people even spoke.\\"<br /><br />And:<br /><br />\\"Mr. Tanimoto found about twenty men and women on the sandspit. He drove the boat onto the bank and urged them to get aboard. They did not move and he realized they were too weak to lift themselves. He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge, glovelike pieces.\\"<br /><br />Or:<br /><br />\\"He saw a uniform. Thinking there was just one soldier, he approached with the water. When he had penetrated the bushes he saw there were about twenty men, and they were all in exactly the same nightmarish state: their faces were wholly burned, their eyesockets were hollow, the fluid from their melted eyes had run down their cheeks.\\"<br /><br />And:<br /><br />\\"She kept the small corpse in her arms for four days, even though it started smelling bad on the second day.\\"<br /><br />Though a Yale and Cambridge educated journalist, novelist, and Pulitzer Prize winner, Hersey uses simple words, simple sentences, and a direct, conversational tone to tell a story that would dwarf any language. He gives the numbers: 6,000 degrees centigrade; 70,000 of 90,000 buildings destroyed; 100,000 killed, another 100,000 hurt in a city of 245,000. But cold facts, Hersey realizes, cannot encompass the horror. Only by reliving the day and its aftermath through the eyes, ears, and words of those who experienced it can we approach it. Simply and hauntingly, Hersey places us at ground zero, with austere language that vibrates with intensity:<br /><br />\\"They told her that her mother, father, and baby brother...had all been given up as certainly dead...Her friends then left her to think that piece of news over. Later, some men picked her up by the arms and legs and carried her quite a distance to a truck. For about an hour, the truck moved over a bumpy road, and Miss Sasaki, who had become convinced that she was dulled to pain, discovered that she was not.\\"<br /><br />A year later, the August 31, 1946 edition of The New Yorker devoted all its space to Hersey's Hiroshima. Newspapers worldwide reprinted it; it was read aloud over radio. Since then it has, for good reason, become a classic of American nonfiction.<br /><br />In its final chapter, Hersey quotes a Hiroshima priest who had been away from his mission house the morning of the attack:<br /><br />\\"It seems logical that he who supports total war in principle cannot complain of a war against civilians. The crux of the matter is whether total war in its present form is justifiable, even when it serves a just purpose. Does it not have material and spiritual evil as its consequences which far exceed whatever good might result? When will our moralists give us a clear answer to this question?\\"<br /><br />Some 65 years later, while some still await an answer, Hersey's Hiroshima still breathes a clear reply.ewspapers worldwide reprinted it; it was read aloud over radio.

B003BKF696|4.0|The nays accuse The National of sounding like A Band of Horses album and some of those who rave about this album seem to like Band of Horses.  My brain doesn't get it.  The field of psychoacoustics tells us that people have preferences for different characteristics of sound and this is what determines the music they like.  I'll buy that.  No matter what \\"artist\\" I name on Pandora, i get the same groups...and i like them, namely: Howe Gelb, Silver Jews, Clem Snide, Bill Callahan, Leonard Cohen,..., Carlos do Carmo. Band of Horses has never turned up and neither has The National.  I dislike Band of Horses intensely and enjoy almost everything by The National with the same intensity.    There are only three directions for a band to go, musically: up, down and sideways.  It's the same thing with the money.  Often the two are not correlated.  In my opinion, this album represents a sideways move, musically, from a very high point.  I love the Ohio song, and also Sorrow, Little Faith and Lemon World.  And they sound like every other song by The National that I like equally intensely.  If they continue to make records like this one, I'll be very happy.      It's hard to keep going up and up, unless you break up or someone dies at the peak of their career.  How much should we expect?  Well, for one thing: not the first song, Terrible Love.  Was it meant to sound Terrible?    I just got back from Roskilde Festival last night and, live, they were fabulous, again.  I have seen them, now, 4 times, once in DC; the rest here in DK.    But back to the subject.  Who do the National sound like to you?  And does that help you to understand why you like or hate them?
B003QP4BJM|5.0|This is a little embarrassing, but right now, right in front of you, millions of ideas are having sex. They might be having it right inside this Amazon review page. I know, freaky, right? According to author Matt Ridley, the secret of humans' success is exchange, and while trade in physical objects is a big part of that, the exchange of ideas is really the thing that has kept this whole civilization thing moving forward for the last 10,000 years or so, and especially in the last 200 years. And when it comes to ideas having sex, the Internet is the ultimate \\"swingers' club.\\"<br /><br />Ridley's book \\"The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves\\" is quite a bit more serious than that first paragraph makes it sound, but it does describe a key point. He says, \\"Without trade, innovation just does not happen. Exchange is to technology as sex is to evolution. It stimulates novelty.\\" Another key thing that exchange and trade allow is specialization. Self-sufficiency sounds good in theory (and in practice if you are in a basic survival situation), but when it comes to growth, prosperity, and happiness (all closely linked), specialization means more of everything for everybody. If multiple people in a community have different skills and products, and if exchange is allowed, everyone has the potential to benefit from the knowledge and output of everyone else. Ideas are especially valuable in part because sharing an idea is like lighting a candle for someone else - now you both have a lighted candle (or an idea of how to do something better). When knowledge is shared in a community, it becomes something like a \\"collective brain.\\" And when the community expands to include the entire world, interconnected by vast transportation networks and with the Internet as its central nervous system, you can have the wild orgy of exchange of ideas, goods, and services that we call the modern world.<br /><br />Ridley spends most of the book in a chronological journey through the development of civilization, from the first inklings of exchange and specialization some 200,000 years ago (when we really diverged from other species including our close cousins the apes), through expanded barter systems, to the development of agriculture some 10,000 years ago. Of course climate stability had a lot to do with that as well, but an interesting point is that trade is what really made agriculture interesting and worthwhile. There was also the development of energy sources, from human power (including slavery, unfortunately), to animal power, to various forms of \\"current solar\\" energy (water power, wind power, burning wood, etc.), to various forms of \\"stored solar\\" (coal, oil, natural gas). There are more steps, but it's clear that the modern world is based to a great extent on exchange and specialization, including free trade and the free exchange of ideas. These have in turn produced a wide range of innovations in social systems and technology and led to the astounding prosperity that most (but of course not all) people in the world enjoy today. Ridley points out that while Louis XIV used some 498 servants to prepare his meals, a modern person of average means has many more people working for him or her (mostly indirectly and on a shared basis) to make easily available food, clothing, medicines, transportation, entertainment, and everything else that we take for granted in modern life. In this sense the average person today is richer than a king in the seventeenth century.<br /><br />But if things are so great and getting better all the time, why are so many people so pessimistic about the present and the future? Ridley doesn't have a good explanation for this, though he knows he's fighting from a minority position (optimists must be naive!), and he shows that it has always been so. People were fretting over \\"peak coal\\" in 1830, and convinced that things had improved so much in the previous half century that there could be no place to go but down. But of course the rest of the nineteenth century was in fact a golden age of technological and social development. Things like slavery and child labor declined not so much because people became nicer, but because energy sources and manufacturing methods made them less necessary (or you could say affordable).<br /><br />The Rational Optimist is not really an ideological work. While there is a strong sense that Ridley believes that markets generally work better than governments (especially corrupt governments like many in Africa), he's not saying that governments are not necessary. He's certainly a strong proponent for free trade and individual rights, which are strongly correlated with a sense of well-being or \\"happiness.\\" He also believes that things will continue to get better, even for Africa, as long as we keep moving forward in terms of trade and openness. Although anything can happen including terrorism, crazy governments, natural disasters, etc., his optimism is based on considerations of history and of how things really work, not on wishful thinking or on some belief that prosperity is humanity's right or destiny. It's more or less what we do.<br /><br />I personally tend toward optimism myself, and this book has given me a lot to think about including many reasons for optimism that I hadn't thought about before. I highly recommend this book.h century was in fact a golden age of technological and social development.

1597801585|3.0|Dirigibles. I knew we were in trouble as soon as the story introduced dirigibles. They've become a sort of billboard for an entire class of bloated speculative fiction, an all-too literal metaphor for lardy, lumbering stories flogging thinly-veiled allegories of modern ills--Goodyear blimps for the beard-and-ponytail set. My advice to authors is, you see a zeppelin lumbering into the airspace over one of your stories, show no mercy--shoot that sucker down. Kill your darlings, as Faulkner said. You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />Mr Bacigalupi's novel has rightly won praise and awards for its original blend of futurism and steampunk, a kind of retro-future that preys on modern fears, but the whole structure is a bit like a dirigible itself--the impressive-looking frame mostly just holds a tub of gas.<br /><br />\\"The Windup Girl\\" is set in Thailand, in a near-future where pretty much every bad thing you're worried about happening, happened. It's a kind of scrapbook of apocalyptic newspaper headlines. Oil and gas have run out, leaving civilization dependent on muscle power and a bit of coal (peak oil fears, check!). Airplanes and cars have gone the way of dinosaurs and mammoths, which is ironic, since thanks to genetic engineering, mammoths (\\"megadonts\\", sorry) are back in fashion as a source of muscle. Oh yeah, zeppelins are back in too. Sigh.<br /><br />Speaking of genetic engineering, geneticists at a \\"calorie companies\\", a bunch of evil corporations located in Des Moines for some strange reason, have deliberately created super-parasites and crop blights, to wipe out the world's food sources and make everyone dependent on their genetically-modified (GM) products (GM food fears, check! Large, faceless company fears, check! Fears of Midwestern states, che--wait, what?!).<br /><br />Genetic engineering ain't all bad though, since it's allowed the Japanese to neatly solve their problem of a declining population without having to rely on any foul-smelling foreigners. They've created \\"windups\\", tailor-made test-tube people, smarter, faster and stronger than ordinary folk, but with deliberate built-in weaknesses to stop them taking over the planet, such as the stuttering motion that gives them their nickname.<br /><br />Emiko is the \\"Windup Girl\\" of the title, bred to be a businessman's ideal personal secretary--sexy, multilingual, obedient, and when you're done with her, pop her in the recycling bin. Her last boss didn't want to keep her but didn't have the stomach to mulch her, so she has been abandoned in Bangkok, forced to work in a nightclub where she is continually humiliated as subhuman.<br /><br />There she meets Anderson Lake, whose name sounds like it should be the title of an accounting firm, ostensibly the owner of a factory manufacturing coiled springs, but actually an agent of the \\"calorie companies\\", searching for Thailand's secret source of new foodstuffs. His mission is complicated by his scheming factory foreman, Hock Seng, an ethnic Chinese from Malaysia who barely escaped an Islamic-inspired pogrom against his people (Fears of fundamental Islam, check!).<br /><br />Mr Bacigalupi's Thailand is filled with bowing and corruption, ladyboys and royalist-popularist tensions, a weird mish-mash that feels cribbed from the introduction to a Lonely Planet guide and the \\"Asia\\" section of the Economist magazine. This is symptomatic of the wider problem with the book--once you get past some rather neat ideas that went into building this world, there's not much to keep you there.<br /><br />The setting is relentlessly grim, and other than Emiko none of the characters is even remotely sympathetic. I enjoyed the book, I'll admit, but I don't think I smiled once the whole time I was reading it. It feels downbeat and didactic, more like a Greenpeace manifesto than a work of fiction. I wonder if Mr Bacigalupi isn't preaching to the converted here, though. I imagine plenty of speculative fiction readers are already composting and bicycling to work and eating locally-grown organic vegetables, or at least wish they did.<br /><br />The plot, too, feels as thin as a zeppelin's skin, with events floating from point to point without any particular thrust or trajectory. The climax in particular feels just plain false, involving a sudden and near-psychotic change of heart on the part of one character, while the epilogue's note of hope jars against the crushing despair of the rest of the book.<br /><br />In short, I feel Mr Bacigalupi's imagination and talent for twisting modern fears into future fables is not matched by his skills as a storyteller. I've already noted the lack of humor, or even humanity in his characters. At times, he slides into clich&eacute;--just once, I'd like to read about a band of evil misfits and rebels brought to heel by a benevolent faceless corporation, just for the heck of it. I'd read that.<br /><br />Just so long as you promise not to put any dirigibles in it.at least wish they did.

B00319ECGU|5.0|Brings back great memories to see these films on my big screen after seeing the originals so long ago!
B002SJIO4A|4.0|\\"District 9\\" is a potentially great film that, unfortunately,  left its brains on the cutting room floor. A massive alien spacecraft is parked, incongruously, above Johannesburg, South Africa. After a suitable period of distant study, the government invades and discovers that the craft is filled with sickly aliens. These are promptly removed to a squalid shanty town, District 9, directly below the ship. There, the aliens prove to be ill-tempered, violence-prone neighbors for the local humans, who agitate to move them out of the city. The film follows a group of government clerks and police who seek to evict the aliens.<br /><br />The first half of the movie was filled with originality and promise. The city-sized, haze-shrouded spacecraft itself was spectacular, and CGI used to render the wasp-waisted, humanoid aliens was near perfect. Watching the South Africans attack the ship using comparatively tiny helicopters went against most films in the aliens genre, which are either filled with peace-loving kewpie dolls or invulnerable mega-warriors. The irony of watching civil servants try to extract signatures from the clicking, grunting, ever-menacing  aliens was delicious and even funny. Wikus Van De Merwe, the civil servant who led the evictions (acted by a suitably sniveling Sharlto Copley) was a narcissistic figure full of his own self-importance who was barely more tolerated by his own people than by the aliens. And the willingness of government officials to inflict torture on their own citizens  in order to procure a desired technological advantage, while undeveloped, was all too believable.<br /><br />The second half of the movie devolved into a sequence of hoary Hollywood clich&eacute;s. There was the unlikely buddy clich&eacute;, on the order of \\"The Defiant Ones,\\" in which a human and an alien must work together to save themselves. An interminable chase ensues, including a session in which bad guys talk endlessly about how they will hurt our heroes. There are cute kids in danger and unrelenting hunters, etc., etc. In spite of obvious parallels between apartheid-era South Africa's brutal dislocation of blacks and the treatment of the aliens, there was surprisingly little political meat to the movie. Why a film set up this elaborate allegory of man's mistreatment of man, then chose not to pull the trigger, is a mystery that robs the film of its potential for greatness.<br /><br />Watch District 9 for the masterful acting, cool-ish weapons, writing, use of CGI and a few tantalizing good ideas. But alas, don't watch it for anything deeper.enting hunters, etc., etc. In spite of obvious parallels between apartheid-era South Africa's brutal dislocation of blacks and the treatment of the aliens, there was surprisingly little political meat to the movie.

The action is the greatest,   It's great to see that Bella and Edward finally get married but theirs only one problem Bella gets pregnant and now she will have to make a life decision of what shes going to do because she has a lot to go through, Will she die or will she stay alive. This is the best movie from the twilight saga and it deserves five star's. I can't wait for Part 2 which will be coming out next November, But for now this is the best movie so far in the twilight saga =)
0393072231|5.0|Crooks, Liars, Thieves and Fools<br /><br />I don't think I have ever enjoyed a book that I understood so little. \\"The Big Short\\" tells the story of the near meltdown of the US bond market in 2007. Based on super-shaky sub-prime mortgages, financial instruments like credit debt obligations were crafted by investors to bundle a variety of iffy loans into sellable package. A very few savvy investors began to see the instability of these instruments, suspected that giving huge mortgages to penniless homebuyers would prompt defaults at high-than-usual rates. These investors started betting that the instruments would fail and waited to cash in. When the big brokerage firms caught on to the big profits to be made by betting against the market, the stage was set for the house of cards to fall.<br /><br />I followed Michael Lewis's descriptions of the complex financial instruments for the first 25 pages or so. After that, I just gave up. But the story of how a very few, very bright investors (including one whose undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome helped him see patterns that eluded others) was fascinating. Michael Lewis is at his best, doing a decent job of almost making sense of the inscrutable complexities of the market, while exposing the fact that even the big investors don't really know what they are doing. Lewis is particularly damning of the rating industry, which stupidly allowed bundles of near-worthless loans to be rated as excellent risks. Just as damning is Lewis's indictment of the brokers who sold these risky instruments to normal investors as safe bets. And the mortgage industry, which gave enormous loans to near penniless home buyers, is criticized as well. An industry whose success is built on the bankruptcy and homelessness of ordinary citizens cannot be allowed to be the basis for a world economy.<br /><br />\\"The Big Short\\" is required reading for all who seek to understand what happened in 2007, and have an interest in devising a system of investment that spurs growth without defrauding investors and threatening global economic stability.auding investors and threatening global economic stability.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|Winter's Bone is a powerful, raw, cold journey and a true excercise in filmmaking and film watching. Set in the desolute Ozark Mountains of Missouri, the story is focused in a small, extremely poor, rural town. 17 year old Ree Dolly (amazingly played by Jennifer Lawrence) is the head of her household and caretaker of her young brother and sister. Their mother has become handicapped and mute after years of methamphetamine abuse. Their father is released from jail and puts their house and property up for his bail hearing. The problem is that he disappears. This sends Ree on a search of the town for him, because without him, they will lose what little they have. Ree tries tracking him throuhg friends, and his drug buddies, a mistress and his own brothers. She knows what is at steak and feels the responsibility of her familys world on her very young shoulders.<br /><br />This is truly one of the best film's of 2010. Touching for the passion this girl has inside of her to save what family she has, and heartbreaking at the gravity of the situation and the lifestyle that these people live, you can't helped but feel a range of emotions while watching this film. From start to finish youre hands will be clenched to the seat as you wonder just how our \\"hero\\" will save her family from the impending reality that is quickly closing upon them. You forget that you're watching a film as the acting is beautifully portrayed. You could see any of these people in any unnamed, poor mid-western town.<br /><br />The cinematography is nothing short of absolutely breathtaking. Never sunny but always with a gloomy haze, the weather and landscapes reflect the desperation and depression lurking just underneath the eyes of Ree. The acting is top notch. In fact, you forget you're watching actors portraying characters.<br /><br />This is a movie that won't make for a great pick you up - but it's not meant to. It's meant to tell a story and that's exactly what it does. This is powerful film making. You want to make sure you check this film out. Be prepared to be reminded what film making is all about.<br /><br />From PopCultureWhore d0t c0myou check this film out. Be prepared to be reminded what film making is all about.

B0026FCNK2|1.0|I only watched one hour of this movie.  After an hour, I stopped it and tossed it into the garbage.  It was long enough for me to realize that I just didn't care about the story; I didn't care about the characters; I hated the background music (it was annoying, repetitive--I'm sure there was an artsy reason for making it this way); there was not one scene, not one thread in the film that made me want to know what was going to happen.  I didn't even think the acting was all that good.  I wanted to like this film, but it was just a waste of time.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|This is a true classic movie.The character acting is top rate.I  doubt there will ever be a version to top this one.

However, methinks that BBC had intended this for a longer run, and had it cut short, so then had to squash it into 3 hours, thereby losing a lot of connections and references. It would behoove the powers to be to put the entirety together properly inserted deleted scenes, and then the whole would make more sense. Well, cheerio, lads; the fox is calling.

B002ZG9846|5.0|Kiss-ass isnt perfect and it isnt for everyone.  It's rated R for good reason.  That being said it pushes escapism to new levels and renders a comic book as close to the source material as u may ever see.  The movie, like most based on comic books is a story of good versus evil.  Evil here in the form of mob boss Frank D'Amico, played well by Mark Strong who seems to have claimed the niche Gary Oldman once held as bad guy of choice.  The good rests in two camps. Dave, a hapless teen who becomes Kick-ass because he believes in a world where super heroes help people, and a pair of vigilantes named Big Daddy and Hit-girl.  Dave, whose efforts to help usually end up in him getting beat up and the vigilante paths cross while Dave is doing a favor for the girl of his dreams.    The movie features the usual funny school friends and the heroes quest for the love of a girl that he cant have.  What makes this movie special is its hero.  Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are well trained and well armed killing machines.  Big Daddy is so bent on vengeance he has stolen her childhood of his daughter and turned her into a tiny terminator.  They  have the power, the resources and the skill.  Dave has nothing like that.  Dave cares.  Dave tries and fails and keeps trying.  He isnt a comic book hero like the other two.  Dave's a real hero like a soldier or a cop on the street.  He helps despite his lack of power because its the right thing to do.    Aaron Johnson is perfect as Dave and eleven year old Chloe Moretz (Hit-Girl)is headed for long, star studded career.  If u want to appreciate how good the young girl is turn the sound off and just watch her.  Her facial expressions, the way  she carries herself convey her character as well as her lines do.  The score perfectly mirrors the action as if the actors had performed to the music.
B002ZG997C|4.0|Enjoyable, thought-provoking alternative to the typical \\"The Road\\" type post-apocolyptic film.  Book of Eli takes a new twist, and the acting of Mila Kunis was suprisingly impressive.  She can act.  Jennifer Beals was very good and so was Gary Oldman. The shaking attribute of cannibals was a cool twist, but the star of the show is Eli's faith and the book.

This book is a wonderful beach read/pool read/ plane read/rainy day read/ ANY DAY READ!!!
B001FB5634|3.0|Mortenson's acting was superb, but you can only do so much with a faulty screenplay. Key plot events needed to make the movie moving and memorable were either entirely missing or glossed over so much they might have well been left out. The film just plodded along and the little memorable highlights from the book weren't there to enrich the sad, dark tale.  The son was ANNOYING as heck, give him a slap.

B003E48AYC|5.0|I went to see this in the theater in 3D and it was so much better then i ever thought it could be. I was very unsure if it would be worth the money. It is a type of sequel if you will. Alice thinks she is dreaming and that she will wake up anytime. She learns her has a destiny in Wonderland. As the movie goes she relizes that she had been in Wonderland as a child and she is not dreaming. does she follow her destiny and help her friends or does she let them down?

You really get it when you see them live and can expect the spiritual experience only us fans truly know or understand. You'll love it...I do wish I had gotten the set with the bonus DVD though...will probably end up purchasing that too, so spring for the few extra bucks the first time around.

Amazing how he did things and it made me wish it had been longer. i know his kids miss him but i hope that have comfort that they aren't alone and he is watching over them...

B001ECQ4AS|4.0|This collection contains 22 episodes of the series Supernatural.  The show is one that gets progressively better and is mostly(sans about 3-5) self contained episodes.  These self contained episodes are for the most part decent.  There are 2 that are outright terrible.  Other than that though, there are about eight that are outright phenomenal.  and the other 12 are as I said decent to good.<br />The acting in the show for the most part is rather rough.  It gets better as the series goes but it is watchable.  The direction on most of the episodes only serves to hide the low budget, but they do a good enough job to create what is the best horror television series on air.  The writing except for the two terrible episodes is fairly strong.<br />The box set looks spectacular.  filling most of the black levels so that they are no longer grainy as they were in their standard def counterpart.  The visual is the reason to upgrade from the DVD.  The extras are about an 8/10 on both and this set only contains one new feature that isn't really that amazing.  But overall the features here are stronger than some of the future sets.<br />I'd recommend this set for fans of Blu Ray, fans of Horror television, and fans of entertaining mythologies.<br />By the way Jeffery Dean Morgan is as per usual amazing in this movie.<br />I urge you to check it out.
B002ZG98J6|3.0|Well, I so wanted this movie to be great. I did enjoy the books to an extent, though not Potter-worthy to me. Still, this movie had such potential. Overall, it was watchable, but not great. I don't believe the actors were at fault though. It seemed, to me, that the dialogue was the weak point. Some of Grover's dialogue was certainly \\"cringe-worthy\\". With better screen writing, this could've been a lot better. I don't even think many oscar award winning actors could've done much better with the script. The flow also seemed very rushed and it sort of jumped around a bit too fast. There is a lot to the story that I know they wouldn't have been able to incorporate with their budget or time constraints, but I believe the story could've been adapted better for the screen. Also, a little more time with the CGI would've paid off. As I said, it is watchable, but rent-it, do not buy it.
B000ID1J0E|4.0|I'm gonna call this abstract art.  The acting was great and you will see some familiar faces throughout the movie.  These were some wild characters and they portrayed the psychotic and psychadelic the way I would imagine.

630460288X|4.0|In the far-away future of 1996, Los Angeles has been turned into a demilitarized zone, and one-man-army cop John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), nicknamed \\"Demolition Man\\" because massive property damage seems to accompany him wherever he goes, is out to capture crime lord Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) after he has kidnapped a bus filled with passengers. Spartan infiltrates Phoenix's hideout and captures him, but Phoenix has rigged the building to explode, and both cop and criminal barely make it out alive. However, it appears that the bus passengers have died in the explosion. Charged with involuntary manslaughter, Spartan is sentenced to 70 years frozen in stasis in a \\"cryoprison.\\"    Fast forward to the year 2032, where Los Angeles is now the utopian San Angeles. Unhealthy behavior and profanity have been outlawed, violent behavior has become a thing of the past, and not a single person has died of unnatural causes in nearly 20 years. Thus, the San Angeles Police Department has been reduced to glorified meter maids. Amid the boring peace she lives in, Officer Lenina Huxley (a young, and very cute Sandra Bullock) opines, \\"What I would give for some action!\\" Be careful what you wish for, Lenina.    Phoenix, who has also been frozen in stasis in the cryoprison, is given a parole hearing. But Phoenix escapes and kills everyone in his path, and is now capable of deadly martial arts and possess knowledge of the futuristic technology he has never even encountered before, a fact that even puzzles himself. Now Phoenix is deadlier than ever, and the SAPD are completely unprepared to deal with the threat. Believing that \\"you need an old-fashioned cop to catch an old-fashioned criminal\\", they thaw out John Spartan and reinstate him in the SAPD to hunt Phoenix. In a future world they are unfamiliar with, the two foes clash once again.    Though Demolition Man comes in a wrapper of a cliched action film, it is comparatively deeper than your typical action vehicle. Unlike other films set in the future like Escape from New York which seem to take their inspiration from dystopian literature like George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, which imagine a future where morality and order is forced upon its citizens through totalitarian rule, Demolition Man pays homage to Aldous Huxley's A Brave New World by envisioning a world where people have willingly and happily sacrificed their freedoms in exchange for peace and safety. Several characters in the film are homages to the novel, as Lenina Huxley gets her name from the the book's author and one of its main characters, and John Spartan was inspired by another \\"fish out of water\\" character from the book, John the Savage, and other characters also refer to Spartan as a savage. Simon Phoenix even references the book's title during a fight scene with Spartan.    The film also addresses issues like ethics and morality, and touches on the issue of manipulating bahavior, a subject that another futuristic work, A Clockwork Orange, delves into. Demolition Man also seems to reference H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, where society is mainly divided between two classes, the leisured, frivolous citizens living above ground and the savage \\"Morlocks\\" (they are referred to as \\"Scraps\\" in Demolition Man) who live underground.    As for the performances, Stallone plays Spartan as a foulmouthed, frustrated outsider, bewildered by the changes the world has gone through. Sandra Bullock's Lenina Huxley is exuberant, naive, and perky. And Snipe's Simon Phoenix may be one of the scariest, most fun villains ever committed to celluloid. It's strangely enjoyable to watch Phoenix toy with his opponents like a cat with a wounded mouse, as Snipes seems to be having the most fun with the role. Other notable performances include Benjamin Bratt, who plays his role as a fellow SAPD officer with schoolboy earnestness, Nigel Hawthorne as the arrogant patriarch of San Angeles, Raymond Cocteau, and Denis Leary as fast-talking leader of a rebel group that is quite literally underground.    Filled with action, humor, and social commentary, Demolition Man is one of those rare films that excedes beyond a genre that is overwrought with cliches and conventions.

0449000729|5.0|Takes reader from prehistoric days and ends in WW II. Interlinks characters to their decendants using various traits and physical features. Certain parts it seems a chore at times to follow, but seems to pick up as you read on and get into the flow of the book.     The main gist of the continuing story is the building of the \\"Cathedral\\". Might not sound that fascinating, but it is. Rutherfurd gives accurate historical facts while intermixing fictional characters with actual events in England.     My only complaint is Rutherfurd did seem to rush a little at the very  end when book got to the 20th century. Perhaps he was afraid the book would be too long to sell commercially.   I highly recommend this author and his other books.
B001C5LLOQ|4.0|I found this movie to be quite entertaining because of the acting and interaction between the stars, Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, of whom I am a big fan and have collected all his films.      This movie has its twists and turns to keep you interested and therefore I recommend this movie to everyone.
0812550706|5.0|The book was required reading for my 15 year old daughter.  She hated it.  While discussing the necessity of completing the required reading whether she liked it or not (I discussed loudly, she whined loudly) I picked it up and was fascinated with it from the beginning and was totally blown away with the ending. For a sci-fi and abstract reading junkie it's a gold mine. For a concrete thinker like my daughter it's a nightmare.  One of the issues is that if someone is not a sci-fi or abstract reader they view the dialog as tortured and the plot as shallow because they can't get through the fiction to the \\"real\\" story that is abundant throughout the book. If someone can accept the fictional setting without trying to analyze it then they start to see the story within the story and that is where this writer excels.
B002SQ364Q|5.0|I like the movie, it has for sure a good direction, good cast and wonderful setting. But I had a feeling that some side of the story was only hinted and purposedly downplayed. Like, I really had the impression that something between Elliot and Michael was let to imagination, like Elliot wanted to suggest something but being both of them real life characters, he hasn't the courage to say it aloud. Then Elliot's story with Paul, it was nice, and good romance material, but then we realize something really happened, and we weren't allowed to know until the end... it was frustrating, we witnessed to all the teasing and neither a bit to the main plate. Finally a very big compliment to Vilma's character, it is probably the best of all the movie. I really wouldn't mind to see a story all about her... him.
0307408833|5.0|I'm allergic to eggs and dairy, so essentially need to eat vegan when it comes to desserts.    I've tried substituting things for eggs and milk or butter, but the desserts always end up dry and crumbly.    I had read great reviews of the bakery in NYC, so I thought I'd try the cookbook. Things turn out moist and full of great flavor. I've made things for friends who don't eat vegan, and they love the things I make that come from this cookbook. They're always surprised that they like them as well as non-vegan desserts.    I understand people being frustrated that not all of the recipes are gluten-free, but if you don't need to avoid gluten, but do eat vegan, I'd recommend this book highly. You can be vegan and have great tasting dessert.

B000VSAEYI|5.0|This pool is very large for a kids play pool. There is room to \\"swim\\" around, but it's still shallow enough for me to feel safe having my little kids in it. The slide is fun if you keep it wet. We rarely use the built in sprinklers around the sides, because my girls don't care for water in their face, but when we do use it, it takes very little water to keep it going. We have horrible water pressure, and it's more than enough to keep them shooting high. We have left our pool inflated for over a month and we have only had to blow in a little extra air twice. We drain the pool and leave it sit in the driveway until we are ready to fill it up again. The toys it comes with are fun and I just can't say enough about the pool as a whole. It's well worth the money. I also LOVE the little section in front of the slide. You can make it really deep (if you plug the drain hole that's in it) or you can make it more shallow than the rest of the pool for an infant. It also protects them from getting splashed so much. One thing though, since it's a more shallow pool, you really need to have it on a level surface to use the entire pool...and I mean level. We used it on uneven ground when we first got it, and it kept part of the pool from having any water in it. I would recommend this to a friend, and I would certainly buy another if anything happened to this one!
0393312836|5.0|I bought this book a few years ago and started.. and quickly stopped reading it, probably around 4 or 5 or maybe 6 times. I would read the first two chapters...and then decline by frusturation. and I felt that way because it was sooo discouraging to start reading and be completely confused on what exactly was being said! Last night I got a little down and wanted to escape...so I went to my bookcase and couldn't find anything quite right to read, everything was too...nice...so then i saw \\"A Clockwork Orange\\"...I was so depressed, bored, and down, i didn't give up on the book because i was honestly so annoyed with my current predicaments that i didn't really care just wanted to get my mind off things, ya know? so i began reading...and reading...and reading some more...i passed that line i never got over...and let me tell you, though the book is hard to understand at first, the book really is a little brilliance of a thing. some people write for the sake of their own imagination, some people write to let out their feelings, some people write because they WANT to be brilliant, but he wrote something intricate and with purpose and he also wrote something that really tricked you into thinking about..things. he is brilliant because he was so clear in purpose and pure. it was very natural. and i ended up loving nadsat (the lang. that confused me at first) my bit of advice in capital letters in case no one wants to read this...PUSH YOURSELF THRU THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS, AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY AND JOYFUL. :)
B002WY65VU|2.0|The definition of a young loser is a mid-twenties virgin, unemployed, not very intelligent, unmotivated male who still lives at home with his parents and plays video games all day. Columbus is this and more. He admits he is afraid of everything and rarely leaves his parent's home. He also admits his parents are just as weird as he is and are afraid of their own shadows also. Columbus repeatedly interrupts the movie to narrate some stupid unfunny comments. The tv show, Scrubs, has a narrator but he is funny and makes a point. This narrator is pointless.    The definition of an old loser is a mid-forties male who looks closer to his mid to late fifties, is balding and tries to cover his baldness with a lame cowboy hat, and who still heavily drinks and smokes pot and wonders why he doesn't have a pot to piss into. Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee is this and more. This type of aging loser would hang around with teens and much younger men even without zombies.     The two weird girls are so incredibly asinine. They were worthless low life thieves BEFORE the zombie outbreak. The youngest is ugly as sin. Her squealing is just as fake in Zombieland as it was as when she played the homely awful young actress in Signs which was a good film and would have been better without her. Her looks and acting ability did NOT improve with age. I'm surprised they didn't incorporate glasses of water in Zombieland because they got the steel bat in. After the zombie outbreak, the girls steal Columbus and Tallahassee (the guys) transportation TWICE - a Cadillac and later their Hummer -leaving the guys both times unarmed and defenseless after they stopped to give the girls help. The definition of stupid is these two moron girls taking the stolen Hummer to an amusement park and turning on all the lights and rides and sounds which attracts every zombie for miles around. The girls get stuck on a amusement ride that magically started itself since they were both on the ride and no one alive was around. These two loser girls then have the gall to seem \\"surprised\\" when zombies come.     Worse, the two morons guys hot wire yet a 3rd vehicle, after the girls steal their 2nd vehicle and \\"magically\\" just happen to drive in the same direction the girls went and again \\"magically\\" just happen to see the girls from the highway far away stuck on an an elevated amusement ride. These 2 loser guys see the 2 loser girls who tried to kill them TWICE and decided to risk their lives to save them AGAIN. \\"Kick me once, shame on you. Kick me TWICE, shame on me.\\" These guys go back for a THIRD kicking. Stupidity doesn't rise any higher. Woody rides a roller coaster alone that \\"magically\\" starts and stops itself.     All 4 losers trash stores and shoot up homes when there is no need. The jokes are childish like \\"manwich\\". Bill Murray (who made really funny movies in the past) makes an cameo appearance where he was not only not funny but just as stupid as the other 4. Murray wonders why he gets shot and killed by Columbus after goofing around/jumping out at him dressed like a zombie. Then the 4 losers waste more ammo on a gun salute funeral (noise attracts zombies) to a man they just met (and who they don't even bury) and whose own stupidity caused his death.     These people waste ammo and never run out of it. They drive for miles in a big Cadillac and a Hummer and never run out of gas. They head for cities and towns full of zombies instead of out of town in less populated areas. Woody as Tallahassee, throws away a steel baseball bat when he has one gun and just a little ammo.     This movie is boring as hell. It doesn't even rise to the level of Earnest Goes To Camp campy because it wasn't funny.     What is sadder than this film is that these 4 losers are the survivors. Hopefully the zombies will eat them before these 4 reproduce.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I liked very much Hedwig, but it was one of that movie you need to see more than one time to understand. Shortbus, it could be strange, is more simple: it shows various relationships and way of loving (one of my favorite character is the stalker). Obviously my heart goes to James, even if I don't think Jamie is the right man for him... but sometime being loved is enough. Wonderful titles (I don't know the term in English, it's the opening scene, when the cast and crew are listed).
B003FMTZOM|2.0|Christina Aguilera has a voice, but on \\"Bionic\\" the emotions never reach the surface. The album is also too long, with the vocals overprocessed in the mix.<br /><br />Aguilera told producers she wanted a \\"futuristic\\" sound, but this collection of songs hardly sounds ready for George Jetson's iPod. What it is ready for is the bargain bin.<br /><br />All who heard Aguilera perform Leon Russell's graceful, elegant \\"A Song For You\\" on the 2006 Grammy Awards and have worthwhile ears are aware that she can be a maddening pain to listen to. If a song is a delicate piece of crystal stemware, she too often takes it and smashes it to pieces, hammering the lyrics home by shouting and howling like a cat in heat.<br /><br />Lead single \\"Not Myself Tonight\\" got the album off to a poor start for a simple reason - it was painfully clear to listeners that its suggestive theme and lyrics were contrived for shock value. A song that tries to be sexy or edgy cannot be sexy or edgy. The album is full of such hollow moments.<br /><br />She undersells the breezy soft core porn songs such as \\"Sex for Breakfast\\" with tired, listless vocals. Listening to them is like sitting in the back of a theater and not being able to hear the actors on stage - you get restless and your mind wanders. She also thunderstorms her way through the few big ballads without an emotion in sight.<br /><br />One exception is third single, \\"You Lost Me,\\" which, despite Aguilera's invested, heartfelt vocal, is poorly constructed. Where she summons up the right mood to carry the song home, it falls apart in her hands because the melody is anonymous and boring. The song only lights up halfway through its playing time.<br /><br />\\"Vanity\\" distills all the ugly truths about the generation that spawned \\"The Hills\\" into one (tuneless) pop song. It has to set a record of some sort. The Guiness people should look into it.<br /><br />The title track best demonstrates why the album is a creative misfire. Aguilera's voice is buried heavily in a mix of swirling, angry, un-danceable beats and ridiculous lyrics. This CD is about heavy-handed production and texture, not about melodies, hooks, rhythm or even singing. Even the better tunes like \\"Elastic Love\\" and the Spanglish \\"Desnudate\\" drift by in any icy, chilly wash of sound. The hooks are barely there, so the songs rarely catch hold.<br /><br />\\"Bionic\\" is musical Starbucks. It is packaged very well and looks great from the outside looking in. Then when you take a sip you realize there is nothing unique or personal to be found, and the stimulation comes and goes quickly. It is also too expensive for what you're getting.<br /><br />Aguilera comes off as pretentious and out of her league here. She either wanders disinterestedly or howls with the cloying abandon of a fading burlesque star. Where she should sound confident and in control she sounds tentative and unsure, resulting in an album that tries very hard but seldom delivers.ridiculous lyrics.

B001DHIYBQ|5.0|A lot of old thrash bands never got the recognition they deserved, Forbidden, Exodus, and Heathen to mention a few, pretty sad I must say, because all 3 bands (and more) had their own style, and were really original, if I were to pick the 'Big 4' I would replace Heathen with Metallica, not because of what Metallica did later in their career, that has nothing to do with it, but Heathen were clearly the better band, don't get me wrong, I love old Metallica, but this band and this album put anything they put out to shame.    The first thing you notice right from the first song 'Death by Hanging' and that this band is tight, awesome fast but catchy riffing, great vocals by David White (Godfrey), and technicality unmatched, now granted they aren't as technical here as on their excellent followup to this album 'Victims of Deception' we can see the motive of the band is to be technical, but keeping it from getting boring and plodding, which they pull off with ease.    This album is great from start to finish, even the Sweet cover 'Set me Free' is awesome, without a doubt, one of the greatest metal debuts, from one of metals greatest and underrated bands!
B003O9XWRM|4.0|I watched the film earlier this year and am both touched and driven into anger.  Religions, or rather, organized religions, are a source of violence and tragedy, sometimes even more than a relief to human kind.  It is sometimes even worse than purely political violence as all religious fanatics believe God to be on their side and hence have a free license to destroy everything which is \\"impure\\".      Agora depicted a time when the old religions were swept aside in self-righteousness during the early rise of Christianity.  In the centureis to follow, matters would grow worse, culmulating in the horrifying Inquisition.      It is a good film, though short of making \\"great\\".  The director is in sympathy of the oppressed, both for the ones with alternative beliefs and the female gender.  It is a shame that one of the greatest female minds in history met such a sorrowful end.  The lesson should never be forgotten, though, sadly, it is repeatedly pushed aside admist the heat of religious hot-heads.
0743455967|4.0|I expected this to be a dry discourse on how to write.  On the contrary, it's quite engaging as well as informative.  The book starts off with a lot of autobiographical history--humorous bits of his life story.  I really enjoyed it and it shows what it took to get his first books published.  He followed his dream and wouldnt take no for an answer.  Now he's passing the torch to those who will grab it.  Good reference material for the serious writer.  Now, if I can just write something...
B0012GMUI6|1.0|The first of 3 post pink floyd albums. Of all of them, this has to be the crappiest. I guess since he knew it wouldn't sell well because he couldn't put Pink Floyd on the cover, he put a half naked chick on the cover. Nice. Roger must have had something on Eric Clapton to make him play on this album. Even with him on this album, it still sucked. I have to say his other albums were at least decent this is just not worth listening to.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|This album is absolutley amazing- hands down. This girl eats, breathes, and lives creativity. The composition of the album along with the delivery and lyrics is something to be marveled. The album is almost like an intriguing book or movie. Each song flows smoothly into the next yet each song is strikingly different. Monae tinkers with every genre imaginable: pop, hip-hop, r&b, jazz, alternative, funk, soul, rock,classical.... this album is all of that and more. I also like the fact that in her album insert, she includes a brief story that provides the back drop from whence the album came. She notes where the motivation/inspiration behind each song derives. It's hard to pick my favorite songs but if I had to it would be \\"Mushrooms and Roses\\", \\"Dance or Die\\", and \\"Neon Valley Street\\". Buy this album. Do not bootleg or pick and choose which tracks you want to download. I must say, there are a couple of songs that I don't particularly care for but I still listen to them because musically and creatively those songs fit with the story line. This album is a story. Please support this girl and buy the album. She has renewed my belief that creative, consicous, intellectual artist exist. Get the album. You won't regret it!

But, this is quite possibly as good as the book and by far the best movie of the saga (thus far!). It would totally be worth the money...esp if you wait a bit and buy it used! Woot Woot!

1594202559|3.0|Between 2003 - 2006, money in the top 100 hedge funds doubled to $1 trillion; by mid-2007 it was $2 trillion. Mallaby reviews the approaches taken by former hedge-fund managers, some a bit shady (inside information, dishonest mortgage marketing), but all with lots of leverage and shorting. A number crashed, most famously LTCM. His main point is that hedge funds have not required a bailout, and should be viewed as more benign than big banks. Nonetheless, it seems more than a bit sinful that in 2009 the top 25 hedge fund managers earned a total of $25.3 billion, more than ever. Especially the fact that they get special tax breaks. J.P. Morgan died in 1914 with the equivalent today of only $1.4 billion.<br /><br />Mallory's second major point is that the efficient-market hypothesis does not hold water - something Buffett proved long ago. He neglects, however, to examine the implications of admiring this new casino capitalism in an age of globalism where millions of Americans have lost their jobs, and many others have lower pay, less security, and weaker benefits.

Long before the National Treasure series, Nicholas Cage was \\"sticking it to the man\\" by growing out his hair and proudly displaying his mullet.

030726999X|4.0|\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is the third and final installment in Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy. The book picks up right where \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" left off. Our unusual heroine, Lisbeth Salander, is fighting for her life and her freedom as she attempts to heal from critical woulds inflicted at the hands of her father, the evil and mysterious Alexander Zalachenko, who happens to be at the center of a huge illegal and corrupt scandal that can be traced all the way to the high government level. With the help of her loyal friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, Lisbeth must get to the bottom of the mystery to clear her name and make sure the criminals are brought to justice.<br /><br />The second and third books in this series are still not as good as \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" but they are still pretty phenomenal, and I had a hard time putting this book down until I was finished. Despite the fact that Larsson got a bit narrative-happy at times (too many additional characters and super detailed police investigation stuff, etc.), I still really enjoyed this book. Both Lisbeth and Mikael are incredible characters, and I never get tired of them. I was pleased with the way this story ended, but I am sad that Larsson died before he was able to continue this series, which I believe was his intention. Still, even on their own, these three novels have a place of honor among other mysteries/thrillers of our generation, and I urge everyone to check them out (before Hollywood undoubtedly butchers the impending Americanized movie versions).
B002TXOHIW|4.0|I just finished watching what could be considered the futuristic British equivalent of America's Independence Day. This may be the wrong take on the story but here's what I got from a first viewing.<br /><br />In V FOR VENDETTA (USA/UK/Germany-2005), a mysterious man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, black hat and cape plans to implode Westminster Palace as a way of getting out the truth to people being oppressed and controlled through a state-run TV network. At the end of a long, trying story on the stroke of midnight on November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day), a series of spectacular explosions fells the entire building along with Big Ben, while the coda of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture plays and a beautiful fireworks display lights up the night sky.<br /><br />And to think I saw this movie totally by accident during the overnight after July 4th, not knowing at all what would happen. (Another TWILIGHT ZONE moment).
144185097X|2.0|No complaints as to the story. The whole listening experience was very frustrating though. First, I will NEVER buy from [...] again!- it was almost impossible to download to either Windows Media Player or iTunes, slow streaming etc - I spent lots of time trying to get it burnt to CDs or get it to play where we had stopped. Secondly, the narration. Yes,both narrators are professional actors but the girl character has the most irritating screeching voice unbearable at times (Brit teen on meth imitation?) and the boy character sounds like a white suburban teen from New Jersey which he is not (sorry, Kevin R) Can a miracle happen and they will change narrators for the following books? I pray to Osiris.

Anyone with the slightest interest in military history should read this one. Sledge pulls no punches regarding the grim reality of his experiences while still avoiding a completely cynical attitude and retains his pride in a job well done.

Obviously, this Smith kid is great for running and jumping fences, but       wasn't that the flavour of the entire McCoy era?

B003HTPHSQ|1.0|I have always loved Cyndi Lauper but this disc is an unusual misstep in her career.  This is the kind of chunk a chunk a chunk blues that all sounds the same and none of it is the least bit interesting.  Some people like this stuff.  Count me out!  This is really tedious.  I feel compelled to point out that Lauper's voice is really ill-suited for some of this material.  A word of advice to Cyndi:  go back to your rock roots!

You'll need to own it because you will want to watch it again and again and again!  Audrey Hepburn is absolutely fantastic as Eliza Doolittle, and Rex Harrison shines as Professor Higgins, an expert linguist who transforms Eliza from an ordinary \\"flower girl\\" into a stunningly beautiful \\"Duchess.\\"  The relationship that exists between Higgins and Doolittle is disgraceful, overbearing and romantic all at the same time.  This is a requirement for all movie libraries.  They don't make movies like this anymore...Now, where the devil are my slippers?    ---Damon Medic
B003ICWTR4|5.0|I mean, sure everyone wants their favorite Springsteen show ever to be the one that gets made into a DVD.  I am not sure I understand why they didnt do the last show at Giants Stadium or the Spectrum, but I am sure they have good reasons.  It was a really solid performance.  If you want your favorite show, go find it on youtube or buy a bootleg or something.
B003MWHVLY|3.0|This album's sound is not at all like her previous offerings.  Saccharine atmospheres/beats along with hooks seemingly geared towards appealing to the lowest common denominator dominate throughout this album.  On the one hand, I would rather have Sia - a very talented artist who has both vocal chops and artistic credibility - to be singing the requisite new dance tunes which always crop up around summer.  However, I was hoping she could bring a bit more to the table. If you listen carefully her lyrics are still clever and interesting, if somewhat obscured by the halogen synths and disco beats.  Coming off of her hyper-produced last album, We Are Born's sound is just as produced, but in a more dance-pop fashion.  You're not going to find Breathe Me Part 2 on this record nor anything that touches her earlier collaborations with Zero 7, so be forewarned.  That said, if you're interested in dance-pop that has a bit more depth than most of the stuff out there, then give We Are Born a shot.  I'll still be listening to Colour the Small One and Lady Croissant.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|Ozzy makes an awesome CD.  I was skeptical being a long time fan that he could produce an awesome CD at his age, but he did it!  The guitars are awesome. His voice and lyrics are strong.  This is worth the cash.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Taken is a really good movie, it is fast paced but you are able to understand exactly what is going on and why the events are happening. Liam Neeson delivers a fantastic performance yet again. I have never seen Neeson deliver a bad performance even if the movie is a bad one (I have only seen two that I could say were bad movies) in both of those movies what made them bad wasn't Neeson's acting but how slowly the movie moved or the movie just wasn't keeping me engaged.    I would highly recommend Taken to anyone not only because it makes you aware that the slave trade is still in full force (just not legally) but is also just a good overall movie
B00005N6KG|5.0|The package arrived sooner than expected in a very good shape. These earphones are so light and comfortable that you don't even feel them. Quality of sound is very good compared with the price. They are ideal for running and outdoor exercises.     All previous reviews say that they break after an average use of around 1 year. I had the same problem in the past. That's why I bought 2 this time. I'd say this is a great buy! I hope you keep the price steady...
0618526412|5.0|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter and The Mortgaged Heart.      I am reviewing these two books together not only because I read them sequentially, but because the two works, in spite of their being her first and last published works, compliment each other so very tightly.  Although I had read a couple of her books soon after my college years, I'm so glad that the reading of these two came after decades of life's searching and adapting as well as reading far and wide:  I don't think I was ready until now to discover and grasp McCullers' uncanny insight and empathy.    The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is - on the surface - about five misfits of society:  a deaf mute, a twelve year old girl, an old, broken doctor who is black, a dipsomaniac labor organizer, and finally, an introverted restaurant and bar owner - characters that live, think and feel, trying to make the best of their respective situations in a southern town in the late years of the Great Depression, striving to find an identity from their islands of loneliness.    The Mortgaged Heart is an anthology of early and late stories, essays and poetry collected by her sister and published after the author's death at age fifty in 1967 after a long illness.   When I finished Lonely Hunter and my jaw was still dragging on the ground, so to speak, in amazement, I wanted to try her earliest stories to see where and when she matured into a talent with such age-old wisdom.  She was a Mozart right from her teenage start!   This volume contains a twenty-seven page outline called The Mute she prepared for the Lonely Hunter.  Step by step she set down characters and sub-characters of her novel to come.  And she was what - barely twenty years old!    The character Mick, a twelve year old girl, independent and full of life, is enthralled with music at a time when having a radio was a rarity, loving it all, but especially classical, one night she listens hidden in bushes a couple of streets over outside an open living room window to the third symphony of Beethoven and is so excited she can't sleep that night.  \\"Wonderful music like this was the worst hurt there could be.  The whole world was this symphony, and there was not enough of her to listen.\\"     The mute, Mr. Singer, caring, dignified, always pleasant but always silent becomes through no effort of his own, the center for the other four main characters, each individually, almost without being aware of the others.   His warm smile gives them the ear - albeit unhearing -  that they each so sorely need for their passionate frustrations, or in Mick's case, just a place to hang and listen to the radio, which had ironically been a gift to the mute.    That McCullers had a savvy mind and felt deeply about social issues is evident from reading her.  But one might miss the depth of her feelings if just focused on the story line.  Dr. Copland, sick and nearly used up, talks to Jake Blount the argumentative labor organizer who is drinking and listening to him and who in turn answers the doctor about class struggle and the stranglehold of money and power, each barely hearing the other until finally they recognize, so slowly, that they are agreeing.  What ideas swim about them calling in the philosophies of Buddha, Christ, Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. - expressions for a mass march on Washington by blacks - decades before the world has heard of MLK or before such a march actually happened.    But as the title implies, this book is about more than economic systems and social justice; it radiates about each individual's struggle to relate and understand humanity.    As I have thought about Lonely Hunter and Mortgaged Heart my eyes have returned again and again to the picture of Carson McCullers on the dustcover of the latter:  a dainty person with a round innocent face barely older than a child; someone we can readily imagine being tucked in bed every night with dolls and kittens.  Is it some sort of chauvinism that makes me wonder how such a private southern-bell child could arrange words and thoughts with such wallop that more than once, in a single sentence, over years and across generations, I have been reduced to tears?    Many of the stories (other than The Mute, already discussed) could well have been chapters in Lonely Hunter; a few others are about the restlessness of the gathering storm in Europe, plus some tantalizing essays on writers and writing.  Nearly two years before the United States entered the war as a result of Pearl Harbor, Carson talks about the profound sadness of a young man and his girlfriend as they pack his books - books now of a generation gone by:  Hemingway, Cummings, Joyce - into boxes placed against the wall of the bare room - sad, but having prevailed from the agony of reconciling their Peace protests - their seeing the coming mayhem as clearly as Winston Churchill - the agony being their final choice:  War - or Fascism?  In the end, the only choice - war - packing their books away to enlist and suffer what must be done.     If any book ever deserved winning the Pulitzer Prize it should have been The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, this, one of the great works of American literature.  It received widespread enthusiastic acclaim.  The fact that the Pulitzer Committee chose to withhold any award for fiction in 1941 suggests to me a hung jury, and although I can find no information specifically relating to their \\"no award\\" decision, I surmise that some on the committee may have felt she was too young or that the previous year's award to John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath was enough pandering to progressive views.    The Grapes of Wrath better documents the hardships of the Great Depression, but Carson McCullers tells more than a historical event, more than a voice of a generation, more than the heart throb of a region or agonizing young country, but the soul in that young woman's body which I can easily believe had seen eons of reincarnation and which speaks to me like no other author, articulates with precision, penetration and passion as well as something more - the insight of a prognosticator.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!!  I've been listening to it on repeat, I can't seem to get enough.  I especially love Only The Ocean (my favorite song on this album) - it's such an amazing song, anyone who lives by the beach can definitely relate with this song.  No Good With Faces, At Or With Me, From The Clouds, Anything But The Truth... All excellent songs!!!

From there they can be saved, edited, forwarded, etc....    I particularly like the SD card reader device, in which you simply load your camera's SD card and the entire card-contents are displayed on your iPad. From there you can import all the photos on the card, or any subset you choose (e.g., the newest photos). Extremely fast, easy, effortless. Typical Apple.
1439153663|2.0|I was so disappointed in this novel.  The story thread was so predictable, boring, and couldn't ever relate to any of the characters.    would read the reviews more carefully next time I purchase a novel by this author.
1401923119|4.0|What is new to me is the biological information from his research.  It reinforces that we live in a community and need the help and support of that community to become the best we can be.      Lipton's writing is clear and interesting.  His personal story is motivating.  Sometimes I had to reread some of the technical material, it was clear buy my mind had to take time to grasp the real meaning.  I like that.  Its nice to have the biological support what what I have know and taught for a long time.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|The worst thing about this musical is that it is far too short. It is well composed, the actors all do fantastic jobs, and the concept is a fresh feeling one. The piece is overall much darker than it seems it will be from the beginning. The most striking thing about it to me is the timing, the pace. It flows perfectly... I just wish there was more of it.
0786838655|5.0|I am a middle school teacher and I usually get a few recommendations on what to read each year, especially during library day.  A student told me about this series and I decided to take him up on his offer to read them.  I am so glad I listened.  Since then, I have read each of them in the series, but this was the first.      This was a very interesting way to look at mythology. It turned mythology into something more enjoyable and memorable for younger people.  I saw this up close as I asked my own students that read it certain mythological facts and Who's Who after reading.  They were able to more accurately tell these facts after reading than when simply told using the usual methods.      With that said, this book started a craze on Greek mythology.  It humorously delves into the god's lives and puts their realm in the United States, with Mount Olympus being at the Empire State Building and the Underworld being in California.  You get to meet many different demons and monsters, like Medusa and the Minotaur, and they are creatively linked to their attributes.  Being a teacher, I thought it funny that one of Percy's teachers ended up being a demon as well.  Riordan uses suspense extremely well and the action never stops.      I'm thinking about reading this book with all my students next year, and hoping to get them to finish the series on their own.  They won't regret it.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Humble beginnings, strong friendships, and a work ethic beyond \\"dedicated\\" turned Rush into the true \\"Rock Supergroup\\". Straddling the line between \\"progressive\\" and \\"rock\\", they've taken us on a journey over 30 years in the making, and show no signs of slowing down.<br /><br />I won't rehash what has been written here, but---you simply have to see this documentary if you're a fan of ANY kind of music. Young, old, musician, non-musican, aspiring musician---all will be awed and impressed by both the humility and the skill of these three men and their no-compromise approach and willingness to let down their guards (at least Ged and Lexrst, anyways---the Professor, well, will always be \\"guarded\\", and that'll never change). Following them through their lives with input from their parents and seeing how they developed is inspiring.<br /><br />Just get it. You'll not be disappointed.
0316017922|5.0|This is a very interesting book, well worth the little time it takes to read it.  I think reviewers who disparage it wish they had been able to write it.  (It doesn't claim to solve all the world's problems).
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I first quickly breezed through this album last year on their myspace page and decided that the songs didn't sound catchy enough for me. I was hoping for another Riot-like album, which this isn't. For example, there aren't any songs like \\"Crushcrushcrush,\\" \\"misery business\\" or \\"That's what you get\\" on this.    It reminds me more of All We Know is Falling, but it mostly carries with it a new vibe altogether. After listening to \\"The Only Exception\\" on youtube and loving it, I decided to re-listen to the album, and I realized that I'm glad that it doesn't sound like Riot, it's fresh. Zac has some pretty awesome drumming on this, and Hayley's voice sounds a little more mature and natural sounding, not so piercing and digitally altered like some of the tracks from their previous works.    Just keep in mind, most of the songs on this are not as radio-welcome as riot; the songs are not as simplistic, or poppy. So the average radio-listener might not enjoy it. They are a little more raw than that and require that you listen to them a few times through before you really can appreciate the mixing/songwriting/musicality.       Overall, this is the perfect next installment to the Paramore collection. It's got a new feel, but it still has that Paramore sound to it.    If you like Paramore, definitely buy this album, and if you've never heard of them, give it a try. If you like alternative rock, you'll more than likely enjoy this band.
0385523386|5.0|What a fabulous book!  I could not put it down.  I do not typically choose to read stories like this in my spare time.  I chose this book based on an NPR review and the uncanny likeness of Ms. Kerman's experience to a friend of mine who got caught up at a very vulnerable time accepting a package containing drugs for a friend.   Luckily, my friend was never charged and did not have to experience the fate Ms. Kerman had to endure.  I have a great deal of respect and admiration for Ms. Kerman who bravely faced her sentence and weathered the storm with dignity and courage.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase this book.

B00337KM2S|4.0|1.  I'm neutral on George Clooney and definitely on the romantic comedy genre and thus wasn't expecting much from this movie.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.  However it's advertised as, this movie really defies categorization: it's very intelligently made, excellent writing, excellent acting, it's about relationships but not really a romantic comedy, but it's not an overtly deep and philosophical movie as well... It's really a movie about life.<br /><br />2.  Thank goodness there are folks out there who still make movies the old fashion way--> good writing + good acting.  Well done and highly recommended.
B0029LX2LC|3.0|This album isn't bad, but it's not great either.  The Roots have always had some pretty smooth beats, and this album might have the smoothest as well as some of the jazziest.  However, in the past they've contrasted that with a more pointed and sharper lyrical style which is missing on this album.  On the whole, it just fails to impress.
B000002UTY|3.0|It's a decent album but not what I expected. There are other CD's I could have purchased. It isn't bad maybe it'll grow on me

0393078299|5.0|A masterful balance of theory and history, Quantum is an engaging dip into one of the most fascinating streams of modern scientific discovery.  The book includes simple, carefully calibrated explanations of the most important theories but does not get bogged down by them.  The real story here is the colorful pioneers who explore the mind-boggling terrain that is the quantum world.  The author fills his account with insightful portraits, revealing encounters, and one or two hilarious anecdotes which both humanize the major players and illuminate their astonishing genius.  His style is accessible but never fritters.  In fact, I think this material could be adapted for a marvelous course by \\"The Teaching Company.\\"  I think I'll tell them about it.

006145205X|5.0|The Rational Optimist is an inspired polemic, grand in conception and sweeping in its historical depth. It divides into two basic sections: First, why did humans, among all species, develop \\"progress\\"? Secondly, given our propensity to raise our standard of living and innovate, is there any basis for the popular pessimism that claims we are at a turning point?<br /><br />First progress. The basic idea is that, given a critical mass of population, our collective brains will be able to work in a way that an individual cannot. The collective whole is greater than the sum of the thinking parts. Specialization and an increased standard of living will result - provided they are not stifled. Ridley traces the history of this concept from the stone age to the development of agriculture, cities, the industrial revolution and to the present. He also demonstrates his point by way of counter example: what can go wrong? Depopulation and isolation, as in the case of the Tasmanian aborigines, led to a loss of technology - regression. Repressive government led to stagnation in the case of the Ming dynasty. But the central point is optimism: the more you prosper the more you can prosper. The potential for generating ideas is infinte.<br /><br />The second part addresses the issue of pessimism. Ridley shows that pessimism is not new. In the 19th century, for example, \\"peak coal\\" was a concern just as peak oil is now. Coal would run out in ten years, it was thought in 1865. Sound familiar? More recently acid rain was a source of alarm, followed by a hole in the ozone layer, followed by globalization. Then came Y2K. One by one alarm was quelled only to be replaced by another. The current cause is global warming. Ridley skillfully avoids getting drawn into the debate. He uses the confess and avoid tactic. His claim is that, even if the worst case scenario of the IPCC were to occur, the outcome would unlikely be catastrophic. Humans have the power to adapt.<br /><br />Ridley is a fine writer. His prose is cogent, terse and intelligible. He does not get lost in vapid speculation or idle digression. No doubt the book's contentious nature will provoke hostile reaction. Those who are convinced that we are heading for the abyss will not be mollified with Ridley's reason. For those who suspect that the world isn't such a bad place, this book will reinforce your optimism.t, terse and intelligible. He does not get lost in vapid speculation or idle digression.

630463949X|3.0|I've had this concert on VHS and now DVD over the last 10 years or so. I'd have to say this is one of the worst DVD Videos on the market as far as video quality is concerned. The fuzzy imagery, with absolute lack of clarity and sharpness is among the worst I've ever seen. Whether watching in standard or upconverted mode, this video quality is horrendous. It needs to be remastered in the worst way. No Blu Ray edition as of right now, so this is all you're left with for options.<br />With that said, if you can get past the video quality, the Dolby Digital audio track is done pretty well. There is a good mix of old and new material, mostly old, that the band performs exceptionally well. Lindsay Buckinghams solo performance mid-way through the set is incredible, and really highlights his guitar playing ability. He carries the band through a good portion of the concert. The overall vocal ability of the band has diminished slightly by this time, but not in a way that should discourage fans from appreciating this reunion show.<br />It's a concert that can be watched from beginning to end with no obvious weak points in the set.<br />I can not reiterate enough how crappy the video quality is in this standard DVD transfer, but if that's a minor point in your viewing experience when watching concerts, then by all means purchase this DVD. Otherwise, wait for a remastered/Blu Ray edition.

B00003CX7L|5.0|Well, we had to get it before toy story 3 came out!  (my son is 5)  And we loved it!
B0021L8UPS|5.0|I had absolutely no intention of ever seeing this movie when I saw the previews last year - that little girl looked too creepy, and thanks to my love of supernatural books and movies (I'm looking at you, Stephen King), I find it hard to sleep without a light on (I know, I know - during the daylight everything is perfectly rational, but come nighttime, things start to get a little hazy, like anything could happen.)  Anyway, now that I am older (blah) and smarter (I think), I try to avoid this type of movie (except for anything by Mr. King - I'm still a fool for you, S.K.).  But last week, I had the opportunity to see this DVD and imagine my surprise when I found myself actually LIKING it very much!  I think it has to do with the fact that this is NOT a supernatural blood-fest and they took time to create a sympathetic family who wants to adopt a child after they lose an unborn, very-much-wanted child.  Also, the little girl, who is played to perfection by Isabelle Fuhrman, does not look creepy like she does on the poster or DVD cover.  Oh, you just know there's a story about those velvet ribbons around her neck and wrists, and it reminds you of that old scary joke we used to tell as kids-the one where the woman takes off the ribbons and her head falls off.  Well, here, that's not it at all, but the gimmick does create suspense and curiosity.  This kid is such a good actress, I ended up liking her despite what she ends up doing.     Now, I'm not much of a talk-back-to-the-characters kind of gal, but I found myself doing it here (in the privacy of my own home) and it was fun. I'm sorry, but if your wife - the woman you love and have known for a long time - and your children - those little folks you love and have known since they were born - tell you that something is wrong with Esther and they are all afraid of her, wouldn't you - the stupid husband and father - wouldn't you, oh, I don't know, BELIEVE THEM? Well, not if you're this guy (Peter Sarsgaard).  And if you are the woman (Vera Farmiga) who knows something bad is going on and your dumb husband won't listen, why don't you just take your kids and go?  But that's the fun of movies like this.  And when you learn why Esther does what she does and who she is, it makes the pay-off at the end that much better.  In all, a good, enjoyable suspense film that will not keep you up at night.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|I saw \\"Eclipse\\" on Saturday afternoon.  It's simply brilliant!  I absolutely LOVED it!  \\"Eclipse\\" had everything.  Action, humour and, of course, wonderful romance!  The scriptwriter did a brilliant job of translating the book to the screen.    Bryce Dallas Howard did a great job as Victoria.  Who would have thought that nice Richie Cunningham (i.e. Ron Howard) from \\"Happy Days\\" would sire such a stunningly beautiful daughter!   And yes, I do know that I'm showing my age............    I loved the `Magic Triangle' scenes between Bella, Edward and Jacob.  The chemistry between Kristen, Robert and Taylor is fantastic!  Up until \\"Eclipse\\", I have always thought that Taylor Lautner was the best actor out of the three of them.  However after watching this movie, I've changed my mind.  Don't get me wrong.  Taylor is a fine young actor.  He's smart, talented and will clearly go a long way in this industry.    However, I have to disagree with Robert Pattinson when he said that the yellow contact lenses interfered with his acting and didn't allow him to show the kind of emotion through his eyes that he wanted to portray.  I think that he showed plenty of emotion through his eyes.  I honestly think that Robert is going to be a very good actor and one to watch in the future.    I hope that everyone enjoys watching \\"Eclipse\\" as much as I did.  I CAN\\"T WAIT until the DVD comes out so that I can watch it over and over again!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Okay, I understand the copyright  problem and them not being able to use the music that was used during the MTV run.   The only time I really missed the music was in \\"Road Worriors\\" at the point where they are stuck in traffic mimicing the REM music video to  \\"Everyone Hurts\\".      It was also disappointing that the theme song wasn't played before every episode.  I can kind of understand some theme songs becoming a drag in the complete series or seasons of a show but Daria's theme song is one of the very few I don't get tired of hearing.      The Last disappointment was the ending to \\"Is it College Yet\\"  Where it told you what happened to each Character.  They showed the pictures and ran the credits underneath cutting off the rest of the pictures.       Other than those 3 problems THIS is a must have for people who are looking for smart dialogue and wit most shows now at days is deeply missing.       After watching  the disks it really made  me wonder what happened to MTV.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|Avatar is a GREAT film!  It is a visual masterpiece and the special effects are stunning beyond belief. I think the movie's message is that we could all stand to learn something from a peaceful, nature-loving alien population. There are strong environmental and pro-peace themes. I definitely recommend this movie!!

B000H0MKOC|4.0|Structurally, I thought the movie was perfect. The pacing was flawless and it held my interest all the way through.     The acting was pretty good and it was funny. I watched the movie when I was dead tired at 1:30 a.m., dosing off. When I was finished the movie, I was wide awake.
081297381X|2.0|I'm tiring of this book quickly. Simple ideas are expanded into entire sections that add no illumination that a simple paragraph could convey. Nassim is obsessed with using large words when a simpler, clearer word would do twice as well. Many sentences should have been cut out. For example:    \\"I said that I will get into a more thorough examination in Part Three, so let us focus on epistemology for now and see how the distinction affects our knowledge.\\"    What the hell is that? That offers absolutely no new information and doesn't clarify anything.    Nassim also loves using the same, pointless cliché sentence structures over and over. For instance, this cliché is used at least three times in the first 38 pages:    \\"X implies Y or maybe X doesn't imply Y!\\"    Wow, Nassim. Golf clap for you. \\"Maybe Fruit Loops are delicious. Or maybe they aren't! SO AMAZING AND CONFOUNDING.\\"    What a piece of junk. I hate you, Nassim. I paid money for this over-wrought slab of ego tripping.
1439190275|5.0|If you have ever been curious about this diet this is the book to read. It is the latest in this evolving weight loss method and it is full of interesting information. If you need to loose weight and improve your health, read this. After years on low fat diets and having no success, I have finally lost weight and got all my numbers to show huge improvements on this diet. I continually see reviews from people who obviously have not read the book or tried the diet and I have one thing to say. Read it, really read it and make up your own mind. I have found that so much of what we have been taught about diet in recent years is flawed. Our grandmothers and great grandmothers were closer to right when they said \\"Stay away from the starchy stuff and the sweets.\\" Turns out this is still great advise if you want to loose weight. These days it is just a bit trickier with the variety of processed foods and additives in so much of our food supply. This Atkins book can help you find your way.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I previously owned BoB on DVD. Over Memorial Day weekend (US) the series was being shown on TV in HD. After watching a couple of episodes the amount of commercials started to get old. I decided to put in my DVD copy. The picture quality of the DVD was horrible when compared to what Direct TV was showing. I decided to look for the Blu-Ray version. Amazon (US) was selling it for $57. To my surprise Amazon (UK) was selling it for $28 shipped to the US. I was able to sell my DVD copies on ebay for $40. I ended up making a profit by upgrading to Blu-Ray. The sound and picture quality is second to none.

B001QOGYBI|5.0|I just watched \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" last night for the first time and was extremely impressed.  It seems Wes Anderson and his team thought pretty hard about the subtle humor of this movie, adding in small comic details, subtle references (or not so subtle, like the homage to Sergio Leone in the showdown between Mr. Fox and the farmers), witty turns of phrase and making the characters not completely anthropomorphic (i.e. Mr. Fox and Mr. Badger's snarl-off in Badger's office, Mr. Fox carrying a dead squab in his mouth instead of in his hands, Mrs. Fox licking the mud off Ash's face, etc.).  Anderson really wants you to think of his characters as animals, albeit more urbane.    A lot of negative reviews state that they found this movie to be overly silly, but I would beg to disagree.  It's good-natured fun, animated fantasy.  The film stays relatively lighthearted (there are points where the movie even slightly breaks the fourth wall), and in the end, everyone is happy, and Mr. Fox still finds that he can \\"stick it to the man.\\"  For those of you who are more inclined toward literary-criticism, \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" is ultimately a bildungsroman about recognizing one's true identity and abilities for what they are and accepting them (Mr. Fox comes to terms with his rakish nature).      The film does, as has been stated by other reviewers, cater to older audiences, as the humor is a bit more adult/adolescent.  However, that doesn't detract from the fun.    The only really odd (or should I say, surreal) part of the film as I saw it was \\"Petey's Song,\\" where Petey (a possible reference to Pete Seeger?  Note his banjo's skin), Mr. Bean's farm-overseer, leads the other farmhands in a song about the fox while Mr. Fox et al. raid the farms for food.  The song sort of comes out of nowhere and you're not exactly sure what to make of it, but it resolves itself in dry humor when Mr. Bean stops him midsong and asks him what he's doing.  Petey replies that he's singing a song and making it up as he's going along.  Bean replies in an ascerbic tone, \\"That's bad songwriting, Petey.  You wrote a bad song,\\" and stalks off into the night, leaving Petey and the others bewildered.    I give this film two enthusiastic thumbs up.  In the relatively small world of stop-motion feature-length films, I'd say this ranks with \\"The Tale of the Fox\\" (which inspired a great number of the characters in \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\") and Cosgrove Hall's \\"The Wind in the Willows.\\"  I have a feeling that you'll enjoy it.
0312330855|5.0|I devoured the James Herriot bokks as a teen and am enjoying them again as an adult. What a bunch of quirky and extremely lovable characters! These books are quick reads but that most certainly does not mean they have no depth.  The dry wit and very droll humour never gets old.  Some of the events and the style of story telling could become repetitive and read as slapstick if written by a less accomplished author but James Herriot's voice is so very authentic and genuine.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Had I seen the beginning, I'm not sure I would have watched the series as it is rough to watch. However, I stared during Season 3, bought Season 2 so wanted to catch up from beginning. Now waiting for 3 to see all episodes. It is good. I learned about the drug world which was my reason to watch in the first place. Money is the reason for everything for the makers and dealers. Not a world I would want to live in but needed to know about.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|This little pouch will provide a nice layer of protective padding to any small electronics that you might want to put into it. It's big enough to comfortably hold a Blackberry or other PDA or Smartphone (or any cellphone, for that matter), and the drawstring closure makes it secure enough to hold just about any small electronics, cords, cameras, or accessories that you might have floating around loose in your laptop case, purse, messenger bag, or briefcase.<br /><br />Unlike some other cases or protective pouches that I've come across, this one doesn't shirk on the protective padding that you're undoubtedly looking for, and the clip that's sewn onto it will make it easy to attach it to just about any loop you might want to hook it on to. It's sporty looking, so it'll coordinate well with your workout or hiking gear, as well as regular casual outfits.<br /><br />These pouches are affordably priced, nicely made, and a versatile enough size to easily hold your GPS unit, camera, PDA, computer cords, or any other smaller items that you might want to toss into them. Heck, you could just use it as a pouch to hold your ID, cash, and cards, hook it onto your belt loop, and go on a hike or a bike ride with it.<br /><br />Versatile, well-padded, and sturdy - three features that many of us are looking for when it comes to camera cases and pouches to hold our delicate, small electronics. This quilted case has all three.
B002ZG9788|1.0|I love Greek Mythology.  One encounters so much,  when reading Shakespeare or Marlowe.  This movie however, has no interest in the mythological story as written (or verbally handed down through the ages).  Not that the story actually happened, but  astonishing how much distain this film displays for the source material.      Horrible this.  I much prefer the 1981 Ray Harryhausen version.

B000001DV2|2.0|Adrenalize is Def Leppard's worst album in their catalogue for sure. There isnt anything more i can add that hasnt been said already i dont think there is any doubt that White Lightning is the best song on the album. The other decent song is called Tonight it looks to me like Def Leppard tried to make an album so similar to Hysteria except for the fact that this album is weak Steve Clarke passed away in early jan,1991 and what a huge loss he was such a great guitarist. This album lacks power, passion and its way to ballad heavy too poppy. Lets Get Rocked has to be the worst song in Def Leppard's catalogue i know its nice to gave guilty pleasure songs but that song is just god awful. Go back and listen to High N Dry, Pyromania and Hysteria to hear good Def Leppard but please avoid this crap.
0385523386|5.0|Mary Karr was lucky; she never got busted for her youthful drug dealing adventures.  But luckily for us readers Piper Kerman did and can write just as well as Ms. Karr.  If anything Piper pulls her punches about how bad it is in the Federal prison system.  And the reason it is so bad is the people who run it would be under qualified to flip burgers at a McDonalds.  The Federal system exists for one reason only; it is source of political pork to supply jobs to the otherwise unemployable.  Don't give me any of that poor little rich girl criticism of Ms. Kerman; you go do some easy Federal time and you'll change your tune.  Read the book.  It's all true, only much worse.  Good job, Pipes!

0307454541|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was very entertaining.  While I thought (based on the description) that all the stories were somehow intertwined, it was actually sort of a \\"series\\" of events.  What happens in the first part of the book...doesn't get resolved until the end...and the 'meat' of the events occur in between.  But again, it was quite entertaining.<br /><br />The story has some \\"dull\\" areas, however, that slows down the pace of the action/storytelling.  I\\"m not sure whether this is due to the fact that the author died after submitting the manuscript, and he was not able to edit, or if it's something in the translation to English.<br /><br />Although it seems like a series of disjointed stories...I'm not sure if it will all somehow knit itself together in the other two books in the trilogy.  I just started to read \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" and if the quality holds...then I'll definitely finish up the final book, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" to see how it all ends...

B000A6EXNO|3.0|Turns out that you need the metal insert (with screw threads) from the original eyepiece in order to attach the Dk-19 to the camera. For the price,you should not need to take parts off of another eyepiece to make this one usable.     Had it out most of the day yesterday.  I noticed that on a couple of occasions when I raised the F5, the DK-19 was coming off of the metal insert. This is due to the back of the camera body (and eyepiece) rubbing against my body as I carried it around. I will keep this on because it is comfortable and helps prevent me from pushing my nose against the camera back. However,knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it.

006176759X|3.0|Let's get this straight. I did not read this for Lauren Conrad, I read this because of Lauren Conrad. I was intrigued. I despise reality TV, and I thought Lauren Conrad was a thoughtless bimbo, so I wanted to see how this all transferred to bookform.<br /><br />This novel, the first in a trilogy, is centered around Plain Jane, and her bestie, Scarlett, who move to LA to start their new lives. Soon afterward they meet a TV produer, who wants them to star in what he calls \\"a reality version of Sex and the City\\". They accept, and the rest of the book is how they handle the immediate fame, and all the drama that goes with it.<br /><br />Jane isn't written to have a vibrant personality, but is written to be \\"relatable\\", the same reason given to her being cast on the show. Jane is almost a little too naive in some parts. And while Jane may be the main character of the series, there are plenty of chapters that give us a reprieve from her, as they center on other characters. I like Jane's best friend Scarlett a whole lot more. Scarlett is a beauty with brains. If one looked at her sexual escapades alone, they might call her a slut, but somehow her intelligence makes it all okay. She also naturally clashes with the Hollywood lifestyle in general, and resists the show's demanding producers the most. Another girl cast in the show is the spoiled bitch, Madison, who is used to getting whatever she wants, even if she has to go through other people (mostly Jane) to get it. My favorite scene with her is when she intially decides not to immediately publish the incriminating photos of Jane. I thought this was a nice attempt at depth. The fourth and final girl is Gaby, who doesn't have much of role in the novel except to play the token airhead. This girl is at the intellectual level of Jane's goldfish. Throw in a manipluative producer, a playboy, a gay friend, a cute crush, a boss to rival Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada, and a hardcore editor, and that pretty much sums up the cast of L.A. Candy (the book, not the show). All of them are shallow and cliched, but ain't that reality TV? The plot was typical too.<br /><br />Despite myself, I enjoyed it, but this is the closest I ever want to get to Hollywood. This writing is nothing spectacular but better than I was expecting from Lauren Conrad, assuming she actually wrote it. Overall, not bad for a guilty, light beach read.ndy (the book, not the show).

B0013N3DSE|5.0|There are a lot of movies out there made about our beloved, Robin Hood.  However, none that I've seen so far has been as close to the old original book as this one is.  Now, don't think this is a slow, old fashioned, boring movie compared to the more recent action packed ones out there.  The color is bright and right on.  The actors are entertaining and the action is fun.  The only thing lacking is the sordid and graphic scenes that now pervade our newer, more modern movies.  These newer movies seem to always have scenes that are not at all entertaining for me and my family.  We don't like to see movies that we have to close your eyes or ears to get through.  Enjoy this one.  You won't regret it.

B002YMWPUA|5.0|HUNGER is a work of art - in more ways than one. It resembles to power of the majestic murals and altarpieces created for the medieval cathedrals, art that depicted worldly suffering and bitter realities that eventually promised something better in the future - after death. The film, based on a true event in Ireland of 1981 - the hunger strike and subsequent death of Bobby Sands who believed the only way to make the British government understand the political commitment of the IRA - and it is painted by British artist/writer/director Steve McQueen as a vast triptych.  The first 'panel' depicts the incarceration in the filth of the H-Block in the Maze prison in Belfast: the silent 'narrator' is prison guard Raymond Lohan (Stuart Graham) who we meet as he dresses for work, bathing his knuckles bruised by the beatings of the prisoners he controls. A new character is introduced into the painting as recently arrested IRA member Davey Gillen (Brian Mulligan) who in keeping with the philosophy of his fellow prisoners refuses the prison uniform, opting to be naked and is through into a fecal smeared cell with Gerry Campbell (Liam McMahon).  We follow these two as they breakdown after protesting the living conditions and the beatings of the guards, and a plan for revenge is made. In a poignant scene we see Lohan visiting his demented mother in a nursing home and during Lohan's attempts to share love with his mother an iRA hitman enters and murders him.  The fuse for the repercussions is set.<br /><br />The middle panel of this triptych is where we meet Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender), shorn of his hair and brutally beaten, in conversation with an old friend, Father Dominic Moran, who came form the same background as Bobby but has been summoned for reasons not immediately explained. This middle panel of the triptych is static in that it is restricted to the two men at a table in the prison, smoking, and interchanging memories and conversation.  In this dialogue we learn the reasons for the long lasting political animosity within Ireland - better than any movie so far - as it is at this point that Bobby informs Father Moran that he will be the first of 75 prisoners to go on a hunger strike.  Despite Father Moran's attempts to show Bobby how futile his concept is, Bobby believes so firmly in his issues that he refuses to abandon his plan, knowing that he will die if the government doesn't respond to the prisoners' demands. (This portion of the screenplay was written by the playwright Edna Walsh and it is brilliantly terse, compact, and emotionally devastating.)<br /><br />The final panel of the triptych is the gradual, almost silent deterioration of Bobby Sands as he spends the last 66 days of his life refusing all food, growing nearly flaccid from his loss of boy mass, covered with decubitus ulcers, and finally dying. It is a tragic third of the film and one that is so compelling that the viewer almost forgets to breathe.  The manner in which the body of Bobby Sands is cared for is not unlike the tomb of Gesthemane, agonizingly quiet, gentle, and finally ending with a view of the Ireland outside the prison walls with birds flying off in the distance.<br /><br />Throughout this intense drama there are moments supplied by Director McQueen that share the human side of both ends of the political/prisoner spectrum: during one of the most brutal beating scenes while the guards are in riot gear flailing the prisoners with clubs, we see in a hidden corner one of the prison guards hiding from the melee, crying. And there are moments of conversation between some of the prisoners and their families that are deeply touching.  Michael Fassbinder gives an extraordinary performance as Bobby Sands: to make his hunger strike credible the actor lost weight  to the point of emaciation, and yet this physical portion of his role, appalling though it is, does not compare to the nonverbal language of his face while he ends his life.  This is a magnificent piece of filmmaking  and one that should be shared by everyone who wonders about the history of modern politics in Ireland.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Oh man, this CPU cooler is GIGANTIC!  It has less than 1cm of clearance in my Cooler Master case.  However, that means it still fits, so it's okay!  Just make sure that this cooler will fit before you decide to buy it; the measurements I found online were correct.    Installation was annoying, because I was replacing an old cooler and this CPU cooler requires you to remove your motherboard.  Which in turn means removing mostly everything from your case!  However, this gave me a reason to rearrange and reroute my wires better, improving airflow.  If you are going to build a new computer, installation will be easier due to fact that the the motherboard won't already be in place.    This CPU cooler is one of the quietest I've heard.  The 120mm fan almost guarantees it.  It also gives you an option to add a second 120mm fan to the other side, but I don't know why you would need to.  I'm currently getting 35-40C idle and around 55C under load (I've got an Intel Core i5 750).  I can't even feel any heat on the heatsink with the CPU idle and touching it with my bare hands.  I fully recommend this CPU cooler!
0316098337|5.0|I began reading this book with a slight bit of trepidation due to the subject matter.  But within a few chapters, I felt as if I'd fallen into a luminous world--the magical world of Room, as told by five year old Jack.  Ms. Donoghue has the power to draw the reader into one single, small room and keep us there for half a book, intrigued by the world which she's created so prosaically for Ma and her five year old son, Jack.  It's a masterpiece illuminating the strength and beauty of a Mother's love and determination and of a woman's will to survive against all odds.  Ms. Donoghue has a beautiful imagination.  I read this book in two sittings and was sad when it ended.  I've enjoyed all of Ms. Donoghue's books and highly recommend them.

I feel that I need them after checking out this book at my public library.<br /><br />When I saw \\"Ford County\\" sitting there on the shelf, I couldn't pick it up fast enough. I have loved your legal thrillers, set with a pace so fast, the pages practically crackle. Your characters have been memorable, heroes you love to love and villains you love to hate. You gave me one of my favorite characters in the world of fiction: Reggie Love. I was enthusiastic when you branched out with novellas like \\"Skipping Christmas\\" and \\"Playing for Pizza\\" -- I gave you great reviews on both of those books right here on Amazon. \\"A Painted House,\\" crafted in the fine old Southern tradition, just took my breath, it was so good. It was one of those books that I finished....and then opened it right back up to the first page and read it again.<br /><br />So why, knowing your talent for crisp plots, action and suspense, gentle humor and well-drawn characters, have you foisted this collection of depressing stories on your public? I kept reading, thinking that surely I'd find something worth my time, but all I got was a headache and a deflated feeling and a desire -- heaven help me -- to flee to the gooey-sweetest, happily-ever-after bit of brainless chick-lit I could find as an antidote to this mess.<br /><br />John, you can be such an entertaining writer. You have the ability to write a redemption story like few others. Your novels have pride of place on so many bookshelves around the world. You don't have to write this depressing, nihilistic crap wherein the characters are either the same losers they were at the story's beginning, or sunk even farther into loserdom, or dead. I'm not saying that unicorns and fairy dust have to fall out of the pages of whatever book you write next, but COME ON. This is lazy writing, negative and just....lacking.

B000IOM0WY|2.0|Ever since I bought the DVD several years ago it has been in my personal rotation (playing on average twice a month). After getting my Blu-ray player I knew I had to have this film. The video transfer is barely better than the DVD and lacks a lossless soundtrack. It doesn't even have the DTS soundtrack advertised on the cover. This is an utter disappointment for an otherwise great movie. There were rumors that Paramount was going to re-release the Blu-ray with remastered video and a lossless audio track(the original soundtrack was excellent). But it has yet to surface(and probably never will). This was not worth the purchase and I would have been better served just enjoying my DVD version.

They should really look into remastering their products before releasing them to the public(Especially at the prices of Blu-rays).

B000NVIGC0|1.0|From a band that I used to consider my favorite current artists, this is about as dull as they get!  \\"Being There\\", \\"Summerteeth\\"(especially), and \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" are 3 of my all time favorite albums.  The cream of the crop!  But this album puts me to sleep and not in a good way like the Velvet Underground's 3rd album or Big Star's \\"Sister Lovers\\", but in a \\"Why did I waste my money on this!\\" sort of way.      I chalk it up to the sacking of Jay Bennett.  The tension between Bennett and leader Jeff Tweedy worked in a way like Lennon balancing McCartney or David Gilmore and Roger Waters created tension in each other's lives to help them create wonderful works of art.  Before Bennett, Wilco was mildly interesting, then with Bennett, one of the greatest bands, and now without him, Wilco is duller than ever.  No one, prior to this album, regardless of personal opinion of Wilco, would have called this band dull, EVER!  But that is exactly the case here.     The noisy outros of white noise, the swirling keyboard arrangements, and the ultra catchiness with extremely dark lyrics of the songs from the previous trilogy are all missing here.  Everything that made them Wilco in my eyes is gone.Evolving is one thing, going from being the most extraordinarily innovative band to this snoozefest is another story ...Oh well.  At least they made 3 of my favorite albums, that is more than most bands will ever have achieved!  Please buy THOSE 3, you will be challenged with every listen, this one should be skipped over.    Buy those three albums and skip this one!!!

B002SQ364Q|4.0|Ang Lee's lovely evocation of the before-the-concert history. Woodstock was a one off but so many did not know the historical, personal and emotional pre-story. History was made at Woodstock and this film will bring you into the beginnings of that moment in time.
0307460444|5.0|Best cupcake book I have ever bought. No alterations needed on any recipes that I have baked yet (made over 15 recipes). Frostings are rich and not too sweet. Cake  is light and not too dense.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This album came out on 9/11/2001, the day of the World Trade Center disaster.      I remember purchasing this on a midnight release that day.  I listened to this a lot that day, and it was probably the only good thing about the day.  This is, in my opinion the best album Nickelback ever released by FAR.  It had some radio friendly songs on it, yet it had teeth, unlike the generic mush this band releases now 9 years later.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|\\"Live In London\\" is AWESOME! Leonard Cohen's voice is now basso and has become even more delicious with age! Of course, his lyrics and melodies cannot be beat and he has a wonderful group of back-up singers and musicians to give them full measure! This man knows about love!
B003UAKE9Y|4.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.<br /><br />Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of \\"Coraline,\\" brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed \\"other mother\\" (Teri Hatcher) and matching \\"other father,\\" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's book \\"Coraline\\" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.<br /><br />Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.<br /><br />The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.<br /><br />Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.<br /><br />The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures -- definitely for fans of Gaiman, dark fantasy and really creepy stuff.The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon).

B001FB5634|3.0|Other reviewers have covered the theme of this movie, so I won't go over it again. I normally don't have any trouble watching a whole movie, unless it's some grade-Z snorefest. I don't turn stuff off if it's too gory, or not family-friendly, or anything like that.    But I got 40 minutes into The Road and I simply could not go any further. There were good points: in a landscape where every single thing was more or less the same color, somehow the cinematography was incredible. Charlize Theron was great in her flashback appearances.     And Viggo Mortenson--well, I think he was the problem. I kept asking myself, who would want to live in a world like this? But Viggo's character definitely did want to live, or at least survive. Even in the non-dialogue scenes, it was written all over him. Even when he was giving matter-of-fact suicide instructions to his son, I could still see how much he wanted himself and his son to live.    That's why, after a particularly grim scene, I had to turn it off. It wasn't the horror of the grim stuff that made me reach for the off button--it was The Man's fierce and terrible love for his son, brought to life by Viggo Mortenson's acting. It was too heartbreaking. I looked at some spoiler reviews after that and saw that things didn't get much better. So I didn't start it up again.    I think The Road might have been better if I'd read the book first. So I think I'll do that, and maybe--maybe--I'll try the movie again.
B001HN694K|5.0|The movie was \\"wonderful\\".  The story came to life in this movie. The images created were so imaginative and creative.  This was a required reading book was when I was 10.  I did not like it, but I loved this movie.
B001LXIDVS|4.0|The last installment is the worst but that's not to say it's not a fun movie,This one has the western spin to it, But it just doesn't work with Back to The Future. Part II was good,and Part 1 even better. All 3 movies together are great. Michael J Fox and Christopher still Rock!
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|The review by amazon is incorrect. This movie, although good, is not based of the original works of the author of the Oz books, L. Frank Baum. This movie is an odd mixing of the two books, the Land of Oz, and Ozma of Oz. Please do not think that this story is actually from the original author. Read the books for a full look at Oz as it was meant to be.     The original Wizard of Oz movie was horrible. It is very loosely based on the original Wonderful Wizard of Oz book. A new movie series should be made.
B00006AUIG|4.0|Eerie,Creepy and not what I expected,A good thriller despite the ending or expected twist if your smart.

B00003CXC7|4.0|This isn't as tense and scary as a lot of Hitchcock films.  It's much more main-stream, American, 50's era, middle of the road.  That's not entirely bad.  The cast is great.  James Stewart is charming and likable as usual, Grace Kelly is exquisite, as usual in her gorgeous Edith Head created wardrobe, Thelma Ritter is endearingly wise-cracking as usual.      The story is clever enough featuring a photographer who approaches life through the safe distance of a lens.  I didn't see a lot of chemistry between Kelly and Stewart; he seemed much older than she was, which strained the credibility of her adoration and patience.  There were other things that didn't really make sense, but overall the film pulls you along pleasantly.      Hitchcock fans will go gaga over it, uncritically, because it is, after all, Hitchcock.  But if you just want to enjoy a movie on its own merits, this is fun, but a little dated.
B00004BZ16|4.0|Why is this album better in some ways than any other Clash album? For me, with albums like London Calling and Combat Rock there is this issue: with London Calling, there is the famous title track...which I can understand why fans and critics love it, but it's not the kind of song I would want to listen to on high rotation. For Combat Rock, it has \\"Rock the Casbah\\", which at one time was an all time favourite song of mine. In the past few years I've just cooled to that song...won't make a point of listening to it if it comes on the radio. As for Sandanista!, there is no such baggage...no songs which have reputations which precede them, or hit songs which maybe dim over time. Anyway, Sandanista! is an album of mellow, mid-tempo groove...a little experimental at times, yet entirely listenable, despite being contained on two chock-a-block full cds. If you enjoyed London Calling and Combat Rock, I'm sure you'll like this album too. If you like reggae Clash, there's more of that on this album too. First cd runs to 70:49 minutes in length. Second cd runs to 73:56.        The best songs on the album:        One more time - has an interesting drum element to it and a good texture to that sound. Pleasant and catchy song...repetition to it but not in a bad way.    Up in Heaven (not only here) - poppy keyboard, the other guy sings this song. Not bad and has a familiar melody, possibly...just can't place it.    Corner soul - pleasant song with female backing vocals. Features the piano accordion. Has the phrase \\"river of blood\\"...hmm.    If music could talk - pleasant track featuring bass, sax and piano. Dual vocals...not sure if it's all Joe though.    The sound of sinners - pop-rock track married to a Harlem choir type arrangement. Not sure if an instrument like a washboard features.     Lose this skin - catchy track...catchy violins. Track is jaunty. Female singer features...maybe someone with a punk background...hmm, just looked up the album on Wikipedia...seems that the singer is a man! (Tymon Dogg). Bass is cool on this song. Bagpipes bob up later.          The best songs on the album (which stood out more on second listen):          The call up - has a nice groove to it. Nice glassy percussion too. Repetitive lyrics. Brass instruments feature as well, I think...or maybe a xylophone type instrument...nice melody by it in any case.    Living in fame - features a reggae sounding guy singing again (see notes for Crooked Beat). Not bad. Outro has bookend various from the previous track on the album - Version City. Bass is nice here. Think a sax also features. Bongoes appear at times too.        Other songs of interest:        The magnificent seven - a disco type of song! Medium-slow tempo, very bassy groove. Smooth sounds.    Ivan meets G.I. Joe - flute playing \\"Oranges and lemons\\" in intro. Space Invader type sounds. Brass features.    Silicone on sapphire - futuristic keyboard sounds and filtered vocals. Computer noises and references in song. Glockenspiel or some such instrument features.    Mensforth Hill - an experimental track featuring backwards music and vocals etc.    Look here - jazzy track. A cappella intro then turns jazzy...maybe an upright bass features. Jazzy sounding piano. Harmonica, and maybe an instrument like a glockenspiel or something.     Broadway - jazzy vibe with percussion (cymbals etc.). Gets jammy later. Piano features. Cute outro featuring a young girl singing \\"Guns of Brixton\\". Also check out the similarly cute \\"Career opportunities\\" where some young boys sing the song, late on in the album.    Version City - jazzy piano and bass sounds. Track bookended by presumably fake radio show banter. Bluesy harmonica. Clangy drums one time.    The crooked beat - bassy track, with reggae type vocals. Guest vocalist perhaps on this track. Organ features.    The street parade - Caribbean flavour with steel pan drums or whatever they are called.    Kingston slip - rock song....stronger sounding pop-rock song. Melody is familiar...can't quite place it...maybe from a church song? Bassy, some open rock riffs and tougher drumming. Glassy percussion at times.    The leader - a country boogie type rock song. Touch of Stray Cats to it (as too for the song \\"Midnight log\\"). Note picking on lead guitar.    Hitsville U.K. - Hammond type organ features. Bass seems to recall \\"Your love keeps lifting me higher\\". Female choir, more or less.    Charlie don't surf - noteworthy bass playing/melody in this song. Poppy track in a 1950s style. Repetitive lyrics. Features the line \\"Everybody wants to rule the world\\". Organ and piano feature as well as an interesting instrumental effect.        That's just a taster...36 songs on the entire album, and some more examples of the songs above feature.         Recommendations:        The Clash - London calling; Combat rock.   More listenable post-punk songs by the boys.    The Clash - The Clash. Their best pure punk album. Their last pure punk album was their second...and that was really mediocre...one to avoid.    Wire - Pink flag; Chairs missing.  Art punk.    Wire - 154. Post punk album from the band...their best effort from their first three albums, but all good.
B003HGKJQ4|4.0|This version of Asia's \\"Asia\\" is musically my favorite but sonically it wasn't as much and the recent \\"remastered\\" renditions (I own 2) were much worst. This 24kt remastered version provides a clean and fully dynamic recording that it is extremely enjoyable with multiple details I did not notice before.
192076920X|5.0|This book started out slow enough that I laid it down and didn't pick it up again until over a year later. I actually got it by not responding to a book club mailing in time to prevent the book from being sent to me.<br /> I wonder at the comments of others who critique this book...'tedious' sounds like the person reading it expected certain things 'right now' as most of our Western culture demand of almost everything. We need to step back and watch, listen and learn about this information even though proffered in novel form. I don't care who wrote it or who printed it. I don't care about the entire 'Indian cinema' criticism of people who seem to miss the point. This book is about much more. What Westerner knew or even cared about the details of life in Bombay before reading this book? If we just read this book without stopping to write down details that 'don't fit' our personal idea of how things should be, then we will find ourselves enlightened and pleased with the time we took to read it. In my life I have read many, many books. This is my favorite.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Now I always loved Alcia Keys as an  artist, butu really I never cared for her albums. With the exception of the album \\"As I am.\\" The first single she had out, \\" Doesn't mean anything,\\" I didn't care too much for either. But when I got the CD I could not stop listening to it. I seriously would listen to the whole CD over the course of the day everyday for three months.    My top five: This was a hard list to compose, because the CD was just overall great     1. Unthinkable: This without a doubt is the best song on the cd. It has a very low key meadow and the lyrics are like poetry. Just beatiful and it was written by Drake which makes it even better.    2. Sleeping with a Broken Heart: Also another great song on the album. It has a fast beat althogh the song is very sorrowful. I love the lyrics and the vocals are great.     3. That's how strong my love is: This song is a very pretty song. I love the lyrics expecially and I can greatly relate to this song so it makes me love it moreso.    4. Wait til they see my Smile. I do really love this song. The message that it sends is a great one. I listen to this song after a bad day and it does really help. A great motivation song.    5. This Bed. I love this song it has a fast beat and it is very catchy. I also think that this song is very cute.     Other favorites:    Distance and Time: Great lyrics and awesome vocals.    How it feels to fly: It took me a while to really like this song, but eventually it became very catchy to me and I love it.    Love is my disease: Had a hard time liking this song at first also.    Put it in a Love Song: Beyonce and Alicia Keys did a great job with this song. Very fastbeat and cathcy and very true.     Empire State of mind part II: I loved part one with Jay-Z but part two was better in my opinion. The vocals were great. The lyrics once again like poetry.    Love is like the sea: Very beautiful song    Songs that were ok:    Love is Blind: Kind of repeative bt other than that its ok.    Doesn't mean anything: Its a pretty song, but its too slow.    If you haven't listened to the CD yet then you are definetley missing out and need to get it right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|Bruce Willis is known for two types of movies.  The first type are the shoot-em up action flicks as typified by his Die Hard franchise.  The second type are the thinking movies, the ones that mark him as a good actor who knows how to pick original roles.  Examples of the latter include The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and now this 2009 film that slipped under most people's radar; Surrogates.  The movie's premise is simple enough, in the near future, much of mankind live their daily lives thru human-like robots known as surrogates.  The main plot of the movie revolves around a series of murders, the politics behind them, and the attempts to solve them by the cop played by Willis.  And like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, the movie's climax involves some surprising twists.  Hence the movie is a mystery-suspense thriller with some action scenes behind it.  The movie is futuristic, but not really in the science fiction genre as the technology displayed in the film is probably achievable within a decade or so.    The only drawback to the movie is its main subplot, which revolves around the failing marriage between the characters played by Willis and actress Rosamund Pike.  It seems many of Willis's serious movies features a subplot of marital distress.  This was present in the Die Hard movies, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Armageddon, and now this film.  This subplot has been repeated too many times, and could have been done better for this film.  Outside of this critique, this was a good film that moved quickly and did not drag.
0439882826|5.0|This book was in excellent condition and my grandson loved it, since he is a major Star Wars fan.  The pop-ups are fantastic.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|9 year old against 52 year old, makes a very fun game. Enough intricacies to keep it interesting, but very easy to master. Rolling the dice adds chance elements, controlling your pieces on the board encourages planning and strategy. Very fun, the pace is controlled by the players. Purchased for home, liked it... so purchased another as a gift. The only criticism I see, the board is a puzzle-like card field. Awesome because you can change the playing field from game to game! But I suspect those cardboard connections will weaken with time. We simply take care when putting the game away to keep it 'new'.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />The movie just ends out of nowhere. The credits started to roll and I had to check and see if I had a bad disc that skipped to the end or something. Half of the movie was decent. Laying down clues for you to attempt to figure out what was happening. But it just ends out of nowhere with no solid crux to it.<br /><br />Hollywood just loves to make the movies about mental wards. Why do they always show the scene with a patient raking the lawn. It's always the same scenes in these movies; tunnels, mazes, lighthouses, barred prison cells. Hurricanes, knocking out the power. On and on.<br /><br />The cinematography was well done, except for some gore.<br /><br />This movie was predictable after halfway through I was acting out the lines before they happened! Although I have yet to read the book it appears as if it is an adaptation the couldn't recreate all the book wanted to tell.<br /><br />3 Stars
1433514818|3.0|This is not so much a large print Bible as it is a larger version of an existing Bible.  They've taken the ESV Study Bible -- a great resource, to be sure -- and re-issued it as a bigger book.  Whereas it was 6.9\\" by 9.5\\", it is now a 7.75\\" by 10.875\\" volume.  Consequently, the print is indeed larger.  But a side-by-side comparison shows that no pages have been at all reformatted; page 996 in the original is the same as page 996 in this re-issue.      So, it's still a great Bible, but not truly a large-print version.  Not for nothing was the ESVSB named the 2009 Book of the Year by World Magazine.  But I still need my reading glasses to see the commentary.  The only reason I'm keeping it is that I had already bought a larger carrying case, into which this Bible fits better.  At least I'll get some weight training carrying it around.
0374531943|3.0|The reason I don't like this book is because of Mr Collins self serving remarks about he has had it with being asked what it was like in outer space.He makes the stupid remark about punching somebody in the gut for smoking a cigar.Maybe he shouldn't have signed up for the program if he doesn't want to talk about the experience that most people will never have.Also I don't like him saying that People who want autographs deserve a special place in hell.
1594488843|5.0|I found this book both very insightful as to what motivates the kind of people who will shape the 21st century and an extremely useful \\"how to\\" manual for those who would be change agents and thought leaders.  It was so stimulating and helpful that I immediately bought several copies that I sent or gave to friends, colleagues and our five adult children! Then I devoured its predecessor: \\"A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the World,\\" which provides the intellectual grounding and context for the more practical \\"Drive.\\"
1439190275|4.0|I love this new book, but consider it an additional reading to the original book, \\"Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution.\\"  I felt the original book was much more comprehensive in explaining the issues for using a low carb diet.  I have embraced the low carb life style so completely, and it has changed my life for the better in so many ways: Losing weight, although I only had a small amount to lose; maintaining my weight and being able to eat so much better and even more; and more importantly, making me feel so much better and eliminating some health issues.  I attribute this to reading the original book, and how it was fully explained and developed.  As I said, this 2nd book is very good, but I see this as a supplement, with updated findings surrounding this fabulous \\"ultimate diet!\\"  I was disappointed in the recipes in this book.  They were all sauces, salad dressings, marinades and broths (approximately 40 pages).  While those are great ideas, I would rather have had some recipes for meals. I am always anxious to read more about the low card way of eating, as it continues to support and encourage me; and reminds me why I am feeling so much better!  This new book was a reinforcement for me emotionally and mentally, and feel overall it is excellent.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I ALWAYS LOVE THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIES - IT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT FUNKY AND FAR DIFFERENT THAN MOST OTHER MAINSTREAM SOUNDTRACKS

B000001DYJ|5.0|Back in the early  90's I was very glad to get this one. I had a number of kiss bootlegs and they prove that live kiss sounds exactly like kiss alive 1-3!<br />that's how good kiss is live after all.  This cd also had a japanese bonus track version but don't despair you can buy the kiss live boxset and get that version of alive 3 on it. Still this version is worth owning if you don't want to buy that boxset.  I ended up buying three of these back then, and it didn't dissapoint me at all. It was kiss at that time playing alot of later songs and that's ok because that's where they were at right then. Just like today I want them to play a few tracks off \\"sonic boom\\" when they tour in 2009-? ,  They had just released the great cd revenge and you get the live version of the hit: \\"god gave rock and roll to you 2\\"  here and other tracks that they were proud to be pounding out live at the time. Throughout the 80's- Fans always wanted a new live cd and this was going to be a double cd at first, but instead we got this single disc. Perhaps someday if there are other tracks from this period they will be put on another comprehensive live disc of unreleased tracks.  The boys sound great here, with great melodic rock that is well played and performed. Overall it's a fine entry in the kiss catalog and as this band is one of the most fun and good melodic metal bands ever that's a good thing.  And lets not forget bruce kulick who proved what a good guitarist he was here. He's now in grand funk these days and when I saw them live a few years back people were stunned about how good that guitarist was!. Of course I told the folks around me that he was once the lead guitarist for non other than kiss!
B0029NY9YO|1.0|Rubbish. Trite. Alan Moore's genius laid to pathetic money grubbing attempts at entertainment. Is there no shame? I sit here and wish ill will to the creators of this film. Download the itunes motion comic book version if you haven't already. I am going to watch parts of it now to wash my soul of this supposed film. Ugh.
B00005LAGO|5.0|Pixies' debut Come on Pilgrim is one of my favorite CDs of all time, and of course Surfer Rosa is excellent as well. This disc, which includes both albums in full, is the perfect way to become familiar with one of the greatest alternative bands of all time. Since both are worth owning, this is definitely the most inexpensive way to get them. Highly recommended.
0525423842|5.0|This may be a young readers book but it was such an enjoyable read for me.  What a wonderful tale of mystery it wove.  I look forward to more from Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer.  I plan on sharing this with my grandsons.  I know they too will enjoy it.

0375842209|4.0|I couldn't put this book down, not only because I wanted to see if it was appropriate for an early teen,  but because I got swept up in it.  It is a story of long ago, the early stages of WWII,  but historically accurate and from a different point of view:  the narrator is death.  Death follows the war and the concentration camps in Germany as the German citizens try to make sense of the sudden and vitriolic resentment in their communities against their Jewish friends.  Death almost takes the Book Thief early in her life but she escapes until she is old and has survived the war, starvation and the loss of many loved ones, both old and young. She and death have become old acquaintances during the years; she has faced him many times but he has always turned his gaze away from her and on to someone else.<br /><br />  I believe the author was only thirty years when he wrote the book and his personal knowledge of death, is of course, limited.  I think his relative youth allows the reader to more easily identify with the Book Thief as a child.  The story does not detail her later life after the war as the author, I believe, is smart enough to know he can not ultimately appreciate her life from the perspective of age for a good many years.<br /><br />  The writer has a very different way of expressing himself.  He uses \\"metaphor\\" liberally and his language is filled with figurative phrases, often a little more than I like, but always appropriate to his content.<br /><br />  The title comes from the protagonist's first theft,  The Gravedigger's Handbook,  at the gravesite of her younger brother.  The book she steals becomes a tool for teaching as she learns to read from it with the help of her foster father during the early morning hours with the aid of a candle.  Throughout the war years as she gradually accumulates a wide assortment of books, she also collects a motley gang of friends, all of whom are trying to survive the barren landscape of air-raids and food rations, and some who exhibit extraordinary courage risking their own lives by rescuing Jewish friends from the Nazis  (one of the young Jews she and her foster German family hides in the cellar for months,  is reunited with her after the end of the war).<br /><br />  Read The Book Thief.

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is my granddaughter's favorite book, so she encouraged me to read it. While doing so, my cocker spaniel, Levy, decided that he wanted to \\"read\\" it, also. I quickly ordered this replacement, which was truly like new and all was well.
0307592839|5.0|The first three chapters of this novel were short stories published in the New Yorker. Rather than excerpts from a novel-in-progress, it seems they are previously written stories inserted into a new novel. By the time we're at Chapter 3 on an African safari we're miles and decades away from the protagonist, Sasha, in the first story/chapter, and she doesn't return for the next 100 pages. This is one of the problems with \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\".  The novel's point of view is not impressionistic so much as all over the place: authorial, first person, many third persons, second person, in and out, kaleidoscopic.  This style could be viewed as edgy... or poorly constructed.  Since a novel is shaped differently than a short story, inserting stories into the longer prose narrative doesn't work. It reads like a cascade of characters and odd behaviors.  The lack of continuity is tiresome and all Egan's brilliant cynicism and social satire and emotional damage are sometimes simply painful.  A central theme in the book is lack of impulse control, from which many of the characters suffer, some with ruinous results.  But why or how is never developed.  Sudden redemptions seem contrived and sentimental.  The result is an absence---of deepening feeling for any character, and an absence of a protagonist or story arc whose development might move us.  Even so the book is sometimes compelling because of the unique characters and their oddities and Egan's savvy, digital-age perspective on behavior and culture.  And there are encapsulated moments of story which draw one in.  But as a novel, it doesn't build or hold up as a whole experience.  Too fragmented.    For the first 175 pages, that is---it reads like a failed novel.  Then it bursts into a new form that is exciting.  The encapsulated moments of story are told in Power Point form, complete with bullets and arrows and shaded text boxes.  It works!  And is surprisingly affecting.  This new format captures the changing, chaotic feelings of the four characters in this section in the way that the linear cascade of characters in the preceding prose did not.  It's significant, though, that this Power Point part of the story is told from one character's point of view which solidifies and builds the emotional content.  Finally the novel becomes a linear story with an arc; that is, the content is finally told from a consistent point of view and builds in a traditional novelistic fashion, even though the text on the page has visually become digital-age scattershot.  It feels affecting and brilliant.  Also this last third of the book takes place in the future which gives added weight to the Power Point style, making it seem more probable than gimmicky in a \\"the medium is the message\\" way.  Where it fails is in descriptive passages; the text box approach totally lacks the lyricism necessary for affecting natural description.  Actual photos would have been more appropriate to complete the Power Point style and to deepen the content.  If the whole novel had been told in Power Point without photos it might have read like one of those teenage cell phone novels.  Perhaps all the preceding chapters of \\"old-fashioned\\" prose created a foundation for the Power Point section to work as well as it did.    The biggest problem with the book is the insertion of Chapters 2 and 3, Egan's formerly published short stories, which seem to serve only the purpose of padding the length.  Chapter 3 was totally irrelevant to the story.    Also, there is an irony in the old-fashioned elements in Egan's experimentation.  A 1960s Marshall McCluhan concept is central to Egan's 2010 style in the Power Point section.  And overall, this is a \\"novel of ideas\\", a 19th century type of book, complete with an underlying morality and a tidying of loose ends.  And it is sometimes dry and contrived as such novels are.  On the positive side, however, Egan may be a visionary and Power Point and Cell Phone novels will be the future of theform.  Just as it's impossibly boring to read Flaubert's three-page description of a ball gown in \\"A Sentimental Education\\" now that TV has made the image familiar in a nanosecond to all social classes; reading a 20th century novel may be impossibly boring to the internet-bred generations growing up now.  Egan addresses this with skill and imagination in her last futuristic chapters.      Despite and because of its problems, Egan's experiment is an exceptional read.
0767827902|5.0|This is a story about the death of a small country town. It has happend/is happening all over the world.  A town that only has a picture theatre for the kids, no other entertainment. Then the theatre closes and the kids have nothing.  Even though this about a Texas town I have seen the same thing in Australia in too many towns.    Very moving.

B002QAQ9V6|2.0|I just don't get this. If you can listen to small 30 sections you can get some really great grooves and ideas, plus about one hundred 1980's cliches. Collectively these tracks don't gel - there's no cohesive them in each track. It's like these guys put together a million ideas in a hat and pasted them together at the mixing desk. I'll try and listen through a bit more in the hope that there's something hiding in this album.
1600240917|3.0|You can scrap most of the reviews based on a reading of the unabridged text version of the book. Listening is not the same as reading, Abridged is not the same as Unabridged.  I assume the reader of the review is familiar with audio books and familiar with the generic differences between the Abridged and Unabridged versions.   The first two-thirds of the book moves well as a story and is performed well by the reader. Editing of the text provides sufficient substance to provide life to the character and clarity to the story. At about the two-thirds mark, one of the basic flaws of abridgment takes hold as the story line includes too many characters too rapidly passed over and too many plot complications fully to grasp. The reader himself tends increasingly to go over to a more inflated tone rather than the good acting that preceded this part. The drama of the wham-bang conclusion is diluted although still reasonably effective. This listener had too many things to process to participate satisfactory in that ending.  All in all, at the price,I believe that it will make good listening on-the-go, less satisfactory when sitting comfortably at home. Of course, it is impossible for me to judge the virtues and defects of the written text or of an unabridged audio version.
0446563048|4.0|This is a truly inspiring story of success that any one in business should read.  By creating happiness among employees, Tony has proven that this will lead to a profitable company.  I can say for a fact that this works since one of the best jobs I ever had used these same principles and the company was quite profitable as well as the happy employees.  I really enjoyed this one both as a memoir and business read.

B002BSHXJA|4.0|The Beatles 09 Remastered Mono Audio Set has really made a difference in the way we listen to them. The Beatles were the biggest thing since Elvis Presley, you have to be a complete idiot not to love them. There are many things that make the remastered mono set a collectable. One being the music itself, another is the way is was designed, it made me feel like I was really in the 60's. Finally the sound. Hearing the sound of th remastered Beatle albums really makes you feel like your in the studio with the band, it's just indescibable. The only thing that made me upset was the price, I mean come The Beatles are suppose to be for everyone. I highly recomend this to any Beatle maniac!

B003JYOFIW|4.0|This is a great CD. Even if you never heard of Devo, I think most people would enjoy it. This album has all of today's modern electronic instruments available to them but they have kept their early 80's song writing skills. The intros of  'What We Do' and the intro to 'Mind Games' are great quirky electronic noodlings showing that these veteran musicians can knob tweak with the best of them.     Aside from this album being synth heaven, pretty much all of the songs are great to dance to. You will find yourself nodding your head uncontrollably the beat when listening to this CD. All of the songs are hits, with the exception of one. I personally don't care for 'No Place Like Home', but other than that you will not be disappointed if you buy this CD.    Interestingly, it looks like Amazon has a track from their MP3 Download that is not on the CD. The song is 'watch us work it' and 'signal ready', but these appears to be extra tracks if you purchase it from iTunes. Instead 'Cameo' and 'No Place Like Home' are not available from the mp3 download. Just be mindful of what songs you get with whatever format you purchase.
1847245455|2.0|Sorry, folks, but this book is WAY overrated. My opinion is that half of this book's popularity is due to it's enticing title. The first 250 pages are absolutely boring. Nothing happens, then there are suddenly a few chapters in which the entire story plays out, and finally the the part that could actually be interesting is rushed through in about 30-50 pages of past-tense expository with essentially no dialogue. Sort of like I was telling you what happened to me last weekend: \\"I went to the store, then I bought some groceries, then I went home. At home I started the oven. I cooked a steak. I ate the steak with a bottle of wine. It was a nice evening\\". The book is just really poorly written (although that may be the translation). For example in one section, with no explanation whatsoever, we go from boring expository to several pages that try to tell the story through e-mails from one character to another. Then this method simply stops. It is baffling why this series is so popular. Stay away.
0385340990|5.0|This is a wonderful book!  At first it seemed a little strange to be reading a story in the format of personal letters rather than prose, but I quickly adjusted.  I was unaware of the German occupation of the Channel Islands during WWII, so the book was historically informative and so well written that I was quickly caught up in the lives of the characters.  Very touching!
0739404636|5.0|The Observer of May 30, 1926, said,<br />No one is more adroit than Miss Christie in the manipulation of false clues and irrelevances and red herrings; and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd makes breathless reading from first to the unexpected last. It is unfortunate that in two important points -- the nature of the solution and the use of the telephone -- Miss Christie has been anticipated by another recent novel: the truth is that this particular field is getting so well ploughed that it is hard to find a virgin patch anywhere. But Miss Christie's story is distinguished from most of its class by its coherence, its reasonableness, and the fact that the characters live and move and have their being: the gossip-loving Caroline would be an acquisition to any novel
0123694965|5.0|This is the must-have book for anyone in game design. For me personally, the book highlighted many fundamental aspects of game design I didn't realize I didn't know, even though I consider myself a fairly experienced game designer.    The book is fun to read. The author has a very engaging writing style, and interesting and relevant examples makes the subject matter of each chapter very easy to relate to.    The book is well designed to bring even a novice very quickly up to speed, yet it's also a fantastic resource for experienced game designers, covering just about everything that matters in modern game design.    The idea of lenses as game design tools really resonated with me. The book contains 100 lenses that are different angles or aspects of how you can view your game, posing poignant questions that help to easily cut to the essence of the decisions you've made or will be making in designing your game.     If you ever buy a book on game design, make it this one. You won't regret it.

B000PTYP7U|5.0|Okay number one I'm 21yrs old and I love Paramore. All those haters that are giving Paramore bad reviews are old people(50+) who think that the Beatles are still alive or think that Prince is a good artist(Prince totally sucks).  This is now, stop trying to compare old farts who can't sing anymore if their lives depended on it(such as the Eagles who are nowhere near as good as they used to be)     Okay the Eagles were only good thirty years ago. As for one of those people that think that I'd be ashamed to say I listen to Paramore ten years from now, I will never be ashamed, I'd be more ashamed if I never even heard of the powerhouse known as Paramore. Sex Pistols, okay if they really were that great, they would still be a band, or at least would have more than a few albums(I do like them though).     If you want to know a really time tested band listen to R.E.M. they are definitely one of the best bands in this century. Anyway, I can't tell you how many times I've loved listening to Paramore at the end of my shift at work, just listening to their upbeat jams and powerful songs helps keep me awake and always puts a BIG smile on my face. Okay they don't have the best lyrics in the world but who cares, they FRIGGIN ROCK. When was the last time a band with a female lead singer rocked this hard?     Avril Lavigne doesn't count, she's a solo artist. Flyleaf is the only band I know of apart from Paramore with a pint sized female powerhouse. There really are not a whole lot of bands like Paramore, I don't get where those old people think that they've heard this kind of music before. You just can't put Paramore in the same group as Fall Out Boy, MCR, and Evanescence. Paramore is very unique, and if there is one amazing thing about them, it's their music videos! In a time when music videos lately are among the most horrid P.O.S.(due to the stupid rap videos on MTV that only feature half naked women and neon lights) Paramore comes through with some really amazing music videos(Or at least their producers).    Brick by Boring Brick is one of the best music videos I've ever seen, it sticks very close to the meaning of the song and adds a nice Alice in Wonderland kind of touch to the music world that you just do not see these days.

B00003CX9W|5.0|It is not a movie but several mini series that are delightfully animated to instrumental classical music.  It has some information provided by a conductor in the beginning before each mini musical treat.  The pictures/animation roll from one object or character into the next. It definetely sparks the senses.  My 5 year old wants to watch it often.  I bought it because we are going to Disney World soon and we wanted to be able to associate with the Socerer's Apprentice (a mini animated treat with Mickey mouse) since he is themed in Disney at the All Star Movies Hotel and during Fantasmic Show in the Park!
B003JZT2AW|5.0|most fans are going to have most or all of the music on the two discs already but the videos and live cd are well worth the price.    great having all the videos in one place, plus the commentary on the all the singles videos.  I would have also liked commentary on the \\"non-single\\" videos like Champagne Supernova but that is a minor quibble.  also a few odd choices on the additional videos, like the odd one with impersonators and Gas Panic which appears to be from \\"Familiar to Millions.\\" would have been nicer to have a clip from one of the other shows that aren't available for purchase elsewhere.    The live disc is also worth the price, though Liam inexplicably stops singing in several songs, the overall sound quaility is great.    on the videos, it's still amazing as an american how bad so many of the britpop bands videos (esp the early ones) were compared to those in the US at the time...it's a shame because back then those were how people were exposed to bands and britpop bands were far better musically than a lot of american groups at the time.  it's superficial but probably part of the reason bands like blur, oasis pulp etc didn't catch on the way they deserved to.

0307454541|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book and thought it would be different in many respects. Although a good read, it wasn't anything spectacular. neither the writing nor the story. As a murder mystery, there were only so many suspects and not any of them would have come as a surprise. the gory and gruesome details were quite sickening..to think such people can possibly exist..<br /><br />anyway, i am not going to bother with the other two..i got a taste.
B001GCUO5W|1.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and I have to say it was bad.  I like Leonardo DiCaprio and was looking forward to seeing this.

B001HN694K|5.0|I've seen almost all the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" movies made, and in my opinion this version is by far the best. This version may be enjoyed by children and adults as well. All the \\"Alice\\" movies I've seen were so fairytale-ish they seemed rather stupid to me as an adult. However, Burton's version gives more depth to the characters and gives adults something to relate to. Of course, I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp, and his portrayal of The Mad Hatter was brilliant. And I cannot leave out Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, also amazing.    This version will be added to my collection and I can't imagine I'll ever tire of watching it.

0385340540|2.0|Alas, Grisham just isn't even trying here. I found it pleasant enough to keep me turning pages until the end, but, even though I wasn't expecting much, I felt cheated.    It is one of those irritating books where it is all too evident that the author wanted to take an expensive vacation and justified it by saying \\"I'll get a book out of it.\\"    EVERY thread of the plot is left dangling. At one point, the Bad Guys need to steal a \\"blue Silvio bag\\" that the protagonist never lets out of his sight. One of the bad guys goes \\"shopping for an identical blue Silvio bag.\\" We never hear any more about it. The bad guys steal his bag, but the theft is managed without benefit of any mistaken bag identity.     Grisham gives us an unreasonable amount of detail on the protagonist's struggle to learn Italian. The length of the book is extended by page after page of dialog consisting of una frase italiana e la relativa traduzione in inglese, an Italian phrase and its English translation. There is a fair amount of dull Bologna tourist-guide stuff. One of his cicerones makes a big deal of saying that he must never order cappuccino after ten-thirty in the morning, or it will mark him as a tourist; but later on, one of his presumed native Italian tutors orders one at two p.m. We never learn the significance; has his tutor revealed herself as a phony? I don't expect to learn much useful information from a book like this, but now I don't even know when it's OK to order cappuccino.    At the end of the book, we are left unsure how many national intelligence agencies and hired killers are still pursuing him; why he believes that the seemingly shallow attachment between him and his female Italian tutor is strong enough to warrant his returning to Bologna; or why we should even care.

B003CR9BYE|4.0|I love this CD. I've listened to it maybe twenty times in the past couple weeks. I love both Sinatra and Jobim. My sense from listening may be mistaken, but I imagine Sinatra not being well-acquainted with some of these songs. With the older swing tunes, he is perfectly at ease, but with a lot of the bossa nova pieces, I imagined him reading the music as he sang. He hits the notes and the sound is beautiful, but he doesn't really make the songs his own. That's why I've given this 4 stars. By contrast, there's a YouTube clip of Sinatra and Jobim on stage where Sinatra is perfectly comfortable with everything they sing and performs it flawlessly and with great flair. (It's interesting to see him lighting up a cigarette and smoking during the medley--how times change.) I with Sinatra sounded as comfortable with the songs here. I suppose that by the time he sang them on TV, he'd become a lot more familiar with them.
B002ZG997C|1.0|This is Hollywood at its absolute worst: a violent disgusting movie that only caters to the lowest human instincts, i.e. just perfect for bible-carrying gun-loving fundamentalist zealots in the pre-apocalypse.<br /><br />The story can be written on the back of a stamp but that doesn't make it more believable: Lone heavily armed hero on a mission from God leaves a trail of bodies behind on his 30 year trek from east to west coast of former USA through the usual stereotypical post-apocalyptic landscape; you know, bleak colours, radioactive decay, strong sun, nasty people.<br /><br />You just have to love the Christian dead cult for giving us this wonderful world view: When society collapses everybody reverts to creatures worse than animals. Murder, rape, exploitation and cannibalism are the favoured human interactions. Yeah, right.<br /><br />But with God in your ark, you'll be good? Eh, no, our hero is the worst killer of them all.<br /><br />The violence is nasty and explicit. The hero literally dismembers and murders anyone who lays a hand on him. This may work in a video game, but this friggen a is supposed to be a role model on a mission from god to protect the last remaining bible in the world. He even knows it by heart - but it sure as hell hasn't touched his.<br /><br />So why this movie? A statement that it is ok to kill to for your religion?

B002BWP4A6|5.0|Written and directed by Michael Haneke ('Funny Games', `The Piano Teacher'), `The White Ribbon' takes place in a small northern Germany village in the year before Austria-Hungary declare war on Serbia provoking World War I.  Haneke's direction is magically bleak, shot in a rich black and white with an eerie and powerful feel.  (Christian Berger is the cinematographer).<br /><br />Narrated by the schoolteacher (as an older man recalling the story as in a fable) the film begins with an innocent look at the village people and its structure, notably the feared Baron who provides most of the work for the villagers, the omnipotent town doctor and the self-righteous town's pastor.  All three come to represent a respected but feared presence from all, especially the children.  A series of cruel and horrifically mean-spirited offenses occur over the year, beginning with the doctor and his horse as they catch a hidden wire while riding and are thrown to the ground.  Speculation rises as the villagers try to unearth the culprit.  More unthinkable and strange happenings occur, some involving children, sending the village into a sinister atmosphere of distrust and accusation.  The pastor tries to remedy his children's behavior by forcing them to wear white ribbons on their arms - a false sign of purity and innocence.  At the same time, the pastor is relentless in caning his children behind closed doors.  That's one of the marvels of the film, in that, other than the initial horse tragedy, none of the atrocities are directly shown on screen.  Both adults and children fall prey to some of these cruel and horrific events. Allegedly, adults towards children and children towards adults.<br /><br />The cinematography is remarkable as high contrast gives the film a ghostly, foreboding feel and look. Haneke never comes straight forward with answers, but insinuates most of the events, giving the story an almost Hitchcockian feel.

030726999X|4.0|The book picks up where the 2nd ended and takes the story line to a logical conclusion. The ending is a bit Hollywood for my taste, but it makes sense. I read books 1 and 3 and listened to 2 in an unbridged audio version. Either format would work well for this book, its that good a story. There is also enough background story in the book that someone who skipped the first two would still be able to understand the plot and story line, although you would miss some crucial insights into character development and a couple main background story lines. Larsson certainly seemed to know the pulse and character of Sweden and his loss makes me wonder what the next installment of the franchise would have tackled in terms of social commentary. The narrative is a bit procedural at times but the description of how the Swedish legal system works is quite interesting; especially compared to our own. The main characters are very compelling, although the plot gets a bit predictable about 1/2 way through the book. Still, very, very well done and I recommend it. Swedish film available for book 1; Hollywood rendition also in works. Can't wait to see both treatments. Lisbeth Salander is one of the most interesting anti-heroins out there.
0307474712|4.0|The structure of this book is very clever. But a clever gimmick will only get you so far. Thankfully the author uses the idea of charting one specific day each year in the lives of two people over twenty years to full effect. Emma and Dexter are two very fully realized characters full of flaws and thoughts and conflicting emotions that felt real - sometimes uncomfortably so. I liked that the book didn't hold your hand and expected you to keep up with the changes in the characters lives from year to year. Although some were introduced more subtly than others it's not like you could ever miss the big changes. This desire to see how the character's lives would change really provided the book with a compelling narrative thrust that lead me to read the book in the space of a couple of days.<br /><br />The book isn't perfect. Like so many protagonists in books people end up with jobs in the media and writing books and going off to Paris for the summer which undercuts the realism a bit. And the big event that so many have alluded to... well, things get a bit melodramatic from there on out and I cringe a bit to think of how Hollywood will handle it in the adaptation (currently in production). However, much of this melodrama is balanced out by the wit and humor of the rest of the book which helps even the scales as I think of the book as a whole. Tthe ending does seem to take a while to wrap-up, and I'm afraid I rushed through the final pages a bit just to see where this was all headed. That being said, I really came to care for these characters and enjoyed this book immensely.

B001DPC52C|5.0|This is every garage bands dream. The choir, the orchestra, the lighting, the sound, the crowd, the band (WT), and Sharon at her best. I watch it over and over again and recommend it very highly: six stars. It also makes a wonderful gift to people who are new to symphonic metal.
B003N7GATM|4.0|At the start of the year Trent Reznor promised fans via Nine Inch Nails official website that although NIN was done touring for the time being, he would be back soon, with new music from NIN as well as some other projects. Over the first several months of 2010 fans were teased by pictures and videos over at the NIN official website--pictures and video clips of Trent and his wife Mariqueen Maandig working on something. Then, this past spring the project was finally revealed to be a new band, How to Destroy Angels, named after a Coil EP, featuring Reznor, Maandig and NIN programmer Atticus Ross.  A full length video for the song \\"A Drowning\\" was soon released and shortly thereafter an entire EP was available for free online.<br /><br />Rather than sounding just like Nine Inch Nails but with a woman singing, HTDA is an altogether different entity.  How to Destroy Angels has Reznor's signature written all over it, yet it sounds distinct from Nine Inch Nails. While NIN could be loosely described as \\"industrial rock\\" (although that description is woefully superficial and inadequate) How to Destroy Angels is less rocking, more laid back, more danceable. In short, the music on this EP lends itself more to a spin at a club as opposed to a rock concert. This is not at all a bad thing, as it only goes to show how versatile of an artist Reznor really is. Maandig, formerly of the band West Indian Girl,  proves to be a fine singer. Her voice doesn't have much inflection, yet it doesn't sound exactly monotone either, and lends itself to the Massive Attack/ Portishead styling of the music nicely.<br /><br />The EP starts out with \\"The Space in Between,\\" a rather downbeat, catchy, spacey opening that's quite captivating. The offbeat \\"Parasite,\\" with its white noise and effects sounds a bit like \\"Year Zero\\" era (2007) NIN. The very danceable,\\" almost Luscious Jackson sounding  \\"Fur Lined\\" is probably the catchiest song on the EP and could easily be successful on an alternative rock station or make it as a cross-over hit.  The hypnotic \\"BBB\\" (Big Black Boots) is really offbeat, and like \\"Parasite\\" sounds a bit like \\"Year Zero\\" NIN. This one took me a few listens to really appreciate, but it's definitely a grower. \\"The Believers\\" is the hardest song on the EP to describe. Listing to it, I feel as though I am taking a journey though an Amazonian forest. Like some of the other songs there are traces of \\"Year Zero\\" here as well as World-Beats. The EP's finale, \\"A Drowning\\" is excellent. It's a melancholy, epic closer in the vein of \\"Hurt,\\" \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" and \\"Zero-Sum.\\"<br /><br />Is Trent Reznor capable of making bad music? 20 years of great album after album seems to suggest that the answer is a definitive no. If this EP is just a taste of what HTDA has in store for their full length album, it will definitely be something to look forward to next year.ke it as a cross-over hit.

1401323820|4.0|Heat Wave is a quick fun read!  Richard Castle has hit another home run with his \\"new\\" character Nicki Heat. :)  The book feels and sounds a lot like the show.  It was really enjoyable and the only disappointment was how soon the book ended.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I can't believe so many years went by since her leaving! That was kind of shocking. I can't stand Tate. I have a terrible feeling he's eventually going to come between Bones and Cat.  I would have given this book all 5 stars if only Bones and Cat had had more page time together.
031606792X|4.0|Ok, so these are not the vampires that have been depicted for years and years.  It's not the scary Bram Stoker's Dracula and it's not Anne Rice's eternal beings.  It is fluffy light entertainment for teenagers.  If you looking for something more, you're in the wrong section of the bookstore.  I'll admit that Ms. Meyers took some liberties that ultimately required me to suspend so much of my mental reason that I almost lost my place a few times.  And I was amazed at how so many things appear so simply woven into what could be a complex plot.  But, really, if a teenager can fall in love with anyone after only half a date and you guys fall for the reality of that, you just gotta be a little more forgiving with this conclusion.  It's exciting and dramatic and fun.  Loosen up, it's pulp fiction for goodness/badness sakes...
030745455X|5.0|Oh my. Could not put it down. Immediately ordered the next two installments and the DVD. Stieg Larson will be missed. I understand \\"they\\" are trying to make a Hollywood version of these books too. Who could play the leads?
B002QEXN2K|4.0|I have really liked all of John Mayer's other CD's but this one pretty much has the same tempo throughout everyone of the songs. I had thought since it had been some while since he had put out a new CD this one would have been better than what it turned out to be. Maybe the more I listen to it the more it will grow on me. So far I could go to sleep to it real well.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|Kylie Minogue, the woman whose looks or music never seems to age, is back yet again with another fantastic dance-infused album that is an excellent followup to her last masterpiece \\"X\\".  I don't think it's *quite* as good as [[ASIN:B0015I0HMC X]] (that album was perfection) but it's darn close, and there's simply no way Kylie fans will be disappointed.<br /><br />Standout tracks include the great first single \\"All the Lovers\\" and the second single \\"Get Out of My Way\\" both electric and feel-good.  Other excellent tracks include \\"Aphrodite\\" \\"Cupid Boy\\" and \\"Closer\\".  To be honest, though, I like all the songs.  There are the obvious standouts, but for the most part the entire album is very listenable.  Listening to the whole thing, I never feel the urge to skip any of the tracks.<br /><br />With that being said, I gave it four stars because it isn't perfect.  I love that Kylie is sticking with dance music (not a ballad in sight) but some of the songs sounded like reject tracks from Madonna [[ASIN:B000B8QEZG Confessions on a Dance Floor]].  I think they used the same producers on both albums so that could be why.  Even if they are rejects though, a reject from Confessions is going to be a better song than anything else top 40 radio can throw out, so don't think they sound Bad.  So far Aphrodite is on my list of best albums of the year thus far, though it did leave just a little bit to be desired.
6305308659|4.0|Pleasantville (New Line Platinum Series) (1998) was very different and a very well done film which I rate at four stars.  I don't understand what all the controversy is about with this film.  People are writing in to express their feelings on every topic ranging from the sexual revolution of the 60's to special effects.<br /><br />This was an excellent film with something for everyone and a message for anyone wishing to see it.  The film producers have done a terrific job of blending medium with message and used intensive special effects to do so. On every level this movie delivered and entertained. If you don't wish to disect this film it can be as simple as BACK TO THE FUTURE and as complex and as symbolic as 2001. It ultimately was one very entertaining and well done movie.

He was thrilled and so was I!
B0036TGSR6|1.0|WARNING: SPOILERS<br /><br />The best part is when the writer discovers the professor is in the CIA.  How? Google search! First page of the results! Remarkable.  The first ghost writer apparently didn't have a computer or I would think he would have left that clue rather than the photos.  \\"He was in the CIA! TPlus he gets in the BMW and the nav system is still pointed at the CIA dude's house who, even though he is a CIA dude, hasn't got a convincing cover story for an operation he's been running and gets all blustery with McGregor immediately.  Also, the \\"code\\" is awesome, it's the first word of each chapter! Just like an Encyclopedia Brown mystery! Or maybe the Hardy Boys. How does Brosnan's enemy have time to pursue him in the UK and show up in Massachusetts to help McGregor?  The twist is? 'he's not in the CIA', 'she is!'.  Dumb.  I love that the damned paper manuscript is the key to the whole thing, he's just towing the thing around for ages.<br /><br />I'm floored at the reviews.  There was maybe 60 minutes of movie here, plus 30 minutes of the 'thrilling' trip on the ferry and back.  I give four stars to Pierce Brosnan overacting.  The sex scene is inexplicable and once you know the ending, all of her behavior and motivation is equally so.  Atmosphere might be a plus if it wasn't so busy telegraphing the nefariousness of it all.<br /><br />BTW the notion that a functioning UK government would ever hand up a former PM to a war crimes tribunal is nonsensical even in a dumb thriller.  Or that it's on the news ALL THE TIME IN THE US.  Polanski's been hiding out so long he doesn't remember we don't have international news on the TV EVER, we're too dumb and isolated.<br /><br />At no point was this ever not a cartoon.  They never cleared out the old ghost writers stuff? Never cleared the nav system? The CIA managed to run a UK PM  for 30 years with no hiccup and then were found out in two days by a biographer? With one photo and a single Google search? Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.<br /><br />On an unrelated note, I generally feel nothing for Catrall, but she looked really good in this flick....

B0039UTDFG|5.0|Oprah does fine narrating this excellent documentary.  I can finally understand clearly, as she speaks louder than the music (this is not the case with the British guy - his voice is too soft and is overpowered by the music for much of the documentary)  Don't get me wrong, the British guy is ok, but Oprah, in my opinion, does a better job.  The documentary itself, is outstanding.  It's just a matter of who you want to listen to, the British, soft spoken guy, or Oprah.  I choose Oprah, hands down...sorry Brits!
B002WY65VU|5.0|To explain the awesomeness of Zombieland, let me explain to you this one scene. Woody Harrelson locks himself in a booth, and cages himself in. A horde of zombies is circling around this booth. Zombies are climbing on the cages, trying to come through the back door and the roof. Woody Harrelson graps two pistols, and starts blasting them away. When he runs out of that round, in slow motion, he spins around, puts the clips in the pistols and starts again in his seemingly futile effort. In any other movie, he would have died. But this isn't any other movie. This is Zombieland, and it's awesome. When Woody Harrelson emmerges victorious from his caged booth, a whole pile of dead zombies in his wake, you cheer, and you get exited, because you just got a crapton of awesome dumped on you. That's Zombieland, and it does what it does VERY well.<br /><br />What is does suprising well is its characters. Usually the characters are disposable like a blonde having sex in a horror film, but not here. It's still a Zombie movie, but by the end of the film, I felt an emotional attachment to all the characters. I can relate to Columbus. Talahassee, as mentioned before, is awesome. Little Rock is cute. And I'm always a sucker for Emma Stone acting like Emma Stone. Plus, the character interactions are just a joy to watch.<br /><br />The film also works on a story level. Sure, it's simple and basic, but it's well-told and it gets the job done and the characters where they need to go. The action doesn't dissapoint either, whether it's the \\"action setpieces,\\" or whether it's the simple things of opening to car door while the car is moving to knock the crap out of a Zombie. As the movie says, enjoy the little things. And that's another thing! The rules and their layout in the movie is just so original, and again, fun. I like how it floats next to characters on screen. It's just a great way to present the movie. Did I also mention that it's funny? The often-talked about cameo completely lives up to the hype, and the movie presents comedy gold spliced in-between everything else to.<br /><br />Overall, if you like Zombies, go watch this movie. If you hate Zombies, and want to kill them, go watch this movie. There's certainly a good time to be had by all. I just didn't expect I'd have that fun of a time. But boy, did I ever. So nut up, shut up, and get this movie!, and the movie presents comedy gold spliced in-between everything else to.    Overall, if you like Zombies, go watch this movie.

B0037BB00I|5.0|Hi,  I discovered Adele by listening to my local public radio online, KCRW, which streams Eclectic 24, a remarkable radio station giving the public a rare opportunity to hear artists & music we may never be exposed to.    I am blown away with Adele, her emotion, vocal control, flawless enunciation, and raw feelings which come across strongly on most of this CD.    I haven't researched her much yet, but have to believe she does at least some of her own writing & composing.  Several songs have only one or two instruments, but is works so well, her voice is so powerful, but almost delicate at the same time.    She carries the melody effortlessly, with sensitivity & character, I feel she's lived what she sings about.    The words strike that rare balance between a powerful, expressive message, with a straight forward delivery, true poetry.    From the soft & tender Melt My Heart to Stone, to the kickass beat of Right as Rain, (I can't sit still during this tune), to the amazing Daydreamer, which pulls hard at my heart.    Adele has definitely become one of my all time favorite artists.    ss
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I rated this 5 stars, and I say it's almost as good as Planet Earth. Nothing can match the bar that Planet Earth has set, but this comes as close as any BBC documentary. The visuals are stunning and David Attenborough is a masterful narrator, as he has been in all his previous works. What's cool about this documentary is when they show the crew on location and all the efforts they put into recording, risking life and limb. This documentary is a must for your blu-ray collection.
B000V63BN6|1.0|People complain about the selection of songs, but that's debatable.  It has a lot of Stevie's best songs on it.  The big problem is that we all know what these songs are supposed to sound like and its not how they are on the album.  The recording is terrible.  I am not very picky about these things.  I often don't even notice the things that cause others to complain about sound quality, but it's glaring throughout this album.  Just awful and frustrating.   I'd avoid this album.

B001LRJH0U|5.0|Ed Harris does excellent work behind and in front of the camera in \\"Appaloosa\\", a film that is comfortably old-fashioned, but also deliberately not like most of the Westerns of the past.  As a viewer I was much obliged that Mr. Harris also does not make the film anything like most of the movies of today.<br /><br />The story is decidedly nothing new: a pair of mercenary lawmen have been summoned to the frontier town of Appaloosa.  Harris plays Virgil Cole, who even villains know is both deadly with a gun and a man of his word.  Viggo Mortensen plays Virgil's partner of a dozen years, Everette Fitch, not as famous as Cole, but never without his 8-gauge shotgun.<br /><br />Virgil and Everette are not men of words, and one of the strengths of this film is the ability of the actors to show you what these powerful men are feeling without resorting to vocabulary that neither possesses.  (One of the running jokes of the film is that Virgil WANTS to use \\"big words\\", but in almost every scene he comes to a sentence where he wants to use a word that he can't quite find.)<br /><br />Appaloosa is being menaced by Rancher Randall Bragg, played by Jeremy Irons.  Mr. Bragg is the kind of man who employs a gang of roughnecks to threaten the town and enforce his will.  Bragg's men harass women, kill men, steal and plunder, then celebrate with too much whiskey down at the saloon.<br /><br />Enter Virgil and Everette.<br /><br />Complicating things are the mysterious Mrs. French, a fetching widow played by Renee Zellweger.  Mrs. French has a thing for alpha males, and when he's around, Virgil Cole is always top dog.<br /><br />The movie has a few tricks and surprises up its sleeve, but it also stays squarely in the lines of the most classic of westerns.  I believe the Duke would have approved.

B00005N6KG|4.0|I've used these headphones for about 10 years (many pairs).  Whether they work for you depends on your intended use.  These I've used for exercise, while I have a different, nicer pair, that I use for everything else.  They are perfect for running, or any other exercise you can imagine.  Cheap enough to take out into the elements or into the sauna.   They aren't going to win any sound awards, but they sound way above average for a $10 set.  Very lightweight and won't fall out of your ears like earbuds.   The con is that they last as long as a $10 set.  Depending on use they seem to last about a year.  One of the two earphones will go out first, followed by the other. Not sure if this is a flaw or merely because of the sweat that gets into them and the general rough treatment I give them. Would recommend as good exercise headphones.

1439153663|5.0|It's amazing to find such beauty in such a painful subject, but that is what happens in The Kitchen House. When a seven year old Irish  orphan is taken to a southern plantation, she lives with the slaves in the kitchen house. As her adopted family, these loving people care for Lavinia as if she is one of her own, even though she is a little white skinned redhead. One of the slaves in the kitchen house is Belle, the illegitimate daughter of the plantation owner, and this book is narrated by both Belle and Lavinia. As Lavinia grows older, she is taken into the big house, where she tends to the plantation mistress, a mentally disturbed opium addict. Eventually, Lavinia's circumstances lead her into the white world, and she has to leave the people whom she loves and who love her, the slaves in the kitchen house. This book is such a sad tale of the appalling ways in which slaves were treated by their owners, but also a beautiful tale of love and kindness that was able to transcend color and circumstance.

B000ZELISO|3.0|For a book as detailed as HBP, putting it into a 2 hour and 30 minute movie did not do it justice.   I would have preferred it to be split into two movies without loss of the storyline rather than cramming it into one movie.  Although I did enjoy the movie, mainly because I read the book, those who've only seen the previous movies without reading the book will be totally lost.  The first time I saw HBP was in a hotel and closed-captioning was not available.  I barely understood the dialogue and had a hard time seeing what was going on due to the darkness of this movie.  Of course it's much more enjoyable on Blu-ray but I'm hoping the final movies won't have this issue.  For true Potter fans, two movies will be worth watching because it will stay true to the book.

B001AP11L6|4.0|Hard, dark takes on early 1960s music, with direct references to Stones, Pete Townsend, Burt Bacharach (!).  This blues-based music is uncomplicated and uncompromising.  Instrumentation changes from track to track.  Noir music is created by recycling retro music through filters that remove 1960s innocence, thickening and toughening the music, stripping passion to leave a matter-of-fact hard, rough metallic surface.  Stand outs:  tr 6--I want to be the boy to warm his mother's heart.  Quiet, earnest country blues that Pete Townshend could have written.  Great slide guitar bridge.  Tr 13--Girl, you have no faith in medicine.  This head banging garage-rock, punk rave up contrasts a dirt-simple musical setting with a meth-spun vocal.

I think it will be the rare person who having read thid book doesn't finish the trilogy. I'm sad that Stieg died not knowing the fame his trilogy would bring. I wish his family and girlfriend could get together to let the 4th book be finished. I'm sure Stieg would have wanted it.
0316069906|5.0|I am a newly converted vegetarian who, after already giving up meat, decided to read this book. I was not prepared for the horrors and atrocities expressed through this book. It was said that this book is heavily dependent upon research but, at least to me, that was what made it so compelling. He gives us cold hard facts in his attempt to convey the terrible nature of factory farming. I wanted to force every meat eater I knew to read this book. I could never go back to eating meat but this book is still a wonderful read even for people who don't want to give up meat. It is informative and at times even funny. Foer does an awesome job with this book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
B001NLKT60|5.0|When I reviewed \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" I said it was the best mystery I had ever read. That was true at the time but in my opinion this book out does the first(which I find unusual in trilogies). Other reviews cover the plot so I'll just tell you I could not put the book down. It is that gripping. If a book can get it's hook into you this one will get multiple hooks into you.
