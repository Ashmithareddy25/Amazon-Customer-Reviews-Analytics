B009O07NBQ|5.0|Just as advertised. Arrived quickly and the soundtrack is fantastic! The sound quality is wonderful and if you are a Hobbit fan you will play this over and over again.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Made to mount a light to your wall where it's easy to find and use. While I've seen people use both clamps for one light, I use the brackets individually to mount lights in convenient places around my house in case power goes out. Two small screw holes in the wall and simply clip the light into the bracket. I live in snow country and we lose power a few times in the winter. Walking down the basement stairs there's one mounted on the opposite side of the light switch just for that reason. I can grab the light from an extremely easy place and head downstairs to the wood burner. Great little affordable product that makes life easier. Before I bought these a blackout involved fumbling around a drawer or a closet looking for a flashlight in the dark so i could walk into the dark and get heat on. That problem being solved is well worth a couple bucks
B000CDO330|5.0|Seriously these are awesome. The quality is so amazing. So glad i did not buy the cheapos at the zoo!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Excellent job of porting this game over to the mobile market. Enough unlockable content to keep you swiping and tapping long into the night.great graphics great sound and fun to play. Maybe a bit too easy starting out but not a deal breaker.  Try it. You will not be disappointed.
B004GXJBWA|4.0|Would have given it five stars, but this guy is tiny. Perhaps i ordered the baby by accident? Anyhow, great quality.
B00BAXFACO|4.0|One of the villains confesses and more at the end of the book. Just like in the ancient Parry Mason movies.<br /><br />I have all Connelly's stories on my Kindle and I like the author. This story does not have too many corpses and seems quite plausible to me. As 99.99% of the population, I never had anything to do with our system of justice so I cannot really be sure about anything from my personal experience.<br /><br />Reasonable treatment of gay issues, present but not essential to the story.<br /><br />Did Connelly borrowed from Grisham the idea of using gold instead of $$? Perhaps. It never occurred to me to 'invest' in gold - there seem to be some practical problems in selling a pound or kilogram of gold according to Grisham but not Connelly. Just a minor stuff.<br /><br />A true 2013 crime novel from my neighborhood. Is there similar stuff from the East Coast?<br /><br />Recommended to Connelly's fans and others.
B005VOXPUC|5.0|Pay attention that this is baby size! Thought i was ordering the big elephant. However i will still order another big one because these are such great quality.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is how my wife spends her Sunday nights.  She cant wait till the next season.  I find it entertaining to.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so addicted to this game! to bad you didn't get more lives! Can't put it down! download download!
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|ever since the first time i opened this blaster when it first came out a few christmases ago, i've loved it. straight out of the box, it was powerful. most likely hitting around 50+ on a slight angle. the front gun attachment was revolutionary at the time it came out, and i had absolutely no problems with the jamming. (i think the problem most people run into with the jamming is the dart condition. if the arts aren't kept in a well kept environment / room temperature and without being sat on or anything, they'll fire just fine. but when you modify them wrong, you run into problems).<br /><br /> the only disappointment about this blaster was that i was disappointed at how far the front gun fired… while the main gun fire 50+, the front gun was more of a frontman's gun hitting around 20+ ft. i sort of knew it wasn't going to be as good, but it was fun to have around :D<br /><br />it started me out as a modder. ever since then, i've collected a ton of nerf blasters over the years. Now, i'm making my own nerf blasters that fire up to 300+ feet! back tun, it was like, $50…. why on earth is it over $200 now?! i'd love to get my hands on another one, but the price is just way too high!!!!
1476727651|4.0|It is not The Shining...  but the author lets constant reader know that in his remarks.  Stephen changed over time and so has his writing.  I was very impressed by the way this book reflects King's inner truth.  Stephen King spills more than ink into this manuscript.  His own 'steam' is released into the story and given as an offering to the reader.  Good job!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|fun game with decent graphics. just wish i didn't have limited turns based upon time. would be more fun without the wait.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Game is easy and entertaining but it requires u to have friends that also play the game for items that you need to continue building or questing. Which sucks since of my thousand plus Facebook friends not a single on plays thus game.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this app it is a fighting game that's based on reel steel. It's continuing to blow my mind over and over. And when I'm stuck on a robot I can always do some free sparing. Basically it blows my mind!
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Masterful...exactly what a good mystery should be. Camille is the perfect detective in Brigade Criminelle, equivalent to a Major Case Homicide Inspector. I loved the characters, the slog of real detective work. So refreshing after the assault of the typical TV fare where detectives expend more rounds of ammunition than a front line soldier.<br />This well paced mystery shows the thin line between victim and perpetrator in a story with many twists and turns. Hard to put down. Easy to visualize as a well acted and directed PBS production, as it is based on character development, motivation and an unstinting honesty in regards to justice. I look forward to my next encounter with Camille Verhoeven.
0553296981|5.0|A very detailed account of how living under Hitler coming from the perpective of a average young girl. I picture this whole case scenerio as I'm reading. Reading this book ought to make one very thankful for the freedoms we still enjoy in America.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great Book, much better then I ever expected. Its not a typical story for me to read but the intensity truly had me hanging on to the next word... I can relate in soo many ways.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The app store is not working at all and the games is not download app store and  games and I need to pay BillS and address.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG!! Wonderful book!! Definitely a must read..I absolutely love how the first book led right into the 2nd and never skipped a beat!! This is one of the best trilogies I have ever bought!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got this for my grandson to play and found it fascinating myself. Lots of action and you get caught up in it very quickly!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Such a wonderful book to tie up all the lose strings of the series!! This is a MUST READ!! All my questions were answered!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Told from the perspective of &#34;Death&#34; it tells the tale of a year or so of a young girl's life near Munich during WWII. You feel her hunger, her passion, her joys and her pains. A must read!
B0053F042G|5.0|I rented this movie several years ago and had no idea of what it was really about when I selected it.  The concept of the movie is really amazing.  I don't think the setting was as great as it could be, yet the underlying theme was not lost.  There is a good bit of suspense and drama with some surprises.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything for you.  Even talking about &#34;if you liked movie_x, you'll like this&#34; could really ruin what this movie has in store for you.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy.
B001R10BEG|4.0|Great movie...always loved this film and glad to switch it over to Blu-ray. No noticeable difference in video or audio quality from the standard DVD though.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little, relatively inexpensive, gadget is very simple to set up and work really well.  You just need an HDMI port, electricity, and wifi.  Once you plug it in, the directions appear on the screen.<br /><br />After you set it up on wifi and the upgrades are complete, you download the Google Chromecast extension to your Chrome browser.  Then you can &#34;cast&#34; any tab in your Chrome browser to the TV.  Certain apps like Netflix, YouTube and Hulu Plus are already compatible with this device, so you're streaming directly from your wifi and your computer or smart phone are just used to control what you're streaming.<br /><br />This makes it so much easier to stream because your computer or smart phone have a keyboard and you don't have to use the user-unfriendly interface many of these products provide for searching if you have a wifi TV or wifi DVR that supports streaming.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Really pretty! Fund to play and easier with the hints available. It's lovely. I have reset the game and plan to play it again!
1452110581|5.0|I got two of my friends this book for their birthdays.  We've all laughed and laughed.  The 'cat' who wrote this book understands them very well.  Very funny.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Zusak's novel brings the concept of death closer and more personal to me than I've ever experienced. His ability to weave joy and tragedy, goodness and evil, and the resilience of decent humanity is a treasure. I am haunted by \\"The Book Thief.\\"
B005MMY9A8|5.0|good message being explained in movie, particularly for kids but may have to explain it to them, action and dialog
B007W8S2MG|5.0|One of my favorite games of all time.  Played the PS2 version and was absolutely blown away.  Unbelievably engrossing story and characters, and addictive school and social aspects breathe new life into this genre.  An absolute must play for any JRPG fan and worth getting a Vita for.
B009CVRQLY|4.0|Celine, Such a pretty, pretty and nice woman! Her Loved Me Back to Life, is pretty good! Loved me Back to Life song is my favorite on this music CD. Some songs however, are not real happy but they do tell a story about of course love!!! I do recommend this music CD if you have liked her other music CDs over the years!<br />DEB
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|A moment in time....in spite of their differences these guys sing together like no other band ever...period.  Don't miss it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is sooooooooo fun. I always enjoy this game, but it can get very hard.  I hate when I run out of lives too.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great Movie. Don't miss first 5 minutes. Based on a real commercial Aviation accident. Yet in real life they did not make it.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I don't like this game very much. It is very boring. Save yourself the time. Go get a fun game.
1433502410|3.0|Some of the commentary at the end of this particular volume, especially with regard to certain Christian or quasi-Christian sects, is very slanted and not at all generous.<br /><br />The maps, diagrams, and commentary throughout the Scriptures are incredibly helpful
B0086700CM|3.0|It is fun at first but when you keep doing the same thing it gets annoying. I haven't played this game in a while though.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book made me more understanding of my two dogs and just a couple of weeks after I read it I had to have one of them put to sleep.  It made the process much more bearable.  Everyone in my book club enjoyed it, even the ones who didn't have pets.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think this game is very fun. I get addicted to it sometimes :)  it is a great way to kill some time.
B00GQ8LUEA|3.0|Worst ending ever.  Shame to the writers.  There was already enough drama and tension through the season and no need to throw some last minute twists that make no sense whatsoever.  After spending the whole season demonstrating how Dexter is on the path to redemption, then at the last minute it all disappears!  Just a lame attempt to build a climatic end.  Not to mention the side stories that add no value to the main storyline (e.g. Quinn's Sgt exam - what happen to the chick who got the job by the way?; Jamie's romance with Quinn).  Finally, the brain surgeon is barely believable next to Trinity, and does not even create any stress compare to when Sgt Doaxe was about to uncover Dexter.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great game for kids, my little cousin loves it. It can be addictive. Even I like it:)
B00CRS5HII|5.0|My man Darius Rucker is doing his thing. For someone who just started listening to country, he is a great artist. I remember him from Hootie and the Blowfish, and he has always made great music.
B000FC130E|4.0|Underground London. I liked the premise...a kind of Alice through the Looking Glass quality...quite a bit of plot twisting and turning...and...whoops...almost gave away the most critical plot twist. Yes, I think you might enjoy this.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Love this movie and got a really good deal.  Glad it was on sale for Christmas. Thanks for the movie.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|So, I am in this book club and we have to read this, and I downloaded a kindle edition, and you have no IDEA how long this freaking thing is in a Kindle edition until you realize you are reading and reading and reading and not making a dent on that little scroll bar that indicates how far you've come, so I take a look online at the paperback edition and  it is 775 Pages!!!!! 775 pages  of Alcoholism and Drug Addiction, and self-absorption, and some unrealistic bits...and.... I kinda hate the main character.<br /><br />Not a place I thought I wanted to go, and often I wanted out. Slogging through mountains of text about teenage castaways...I was hoping it would say; \\"then they all blew up-the end\\".<br /><br />But, no such luck. I kept going, because I am not a quitter, then, suddenly, in one chapter, we fast forward and they are in their 20's.  I realize that if I think of Boris as Eugene Hutz from Gogol Bordello....then it becomes positively cinematic and fun.<br /><br />So, I got to a place where it was worth hanging out with the Royal Tenenbaums in their fishbowl (that family with the matriarch), and Eugene Hutz (and the Gogol Bordello creww) and being in Central Park and with the Addams Family in their antiques shop house and then, Amsterdam and Vegas in retrospect, even. It became more fun connecting characters from other things I have enjoyed with these characters. I turned the dad into Ryan ONeil and that also helped. Also I have a little dog that snores and sleeps with all four feet in the air on her back...and that helped weverything.<br /><br />There were some good bits of writing. There were some \\"meh\\" ideas...nothing actually new, but that's allright. There were waaaaay more drug scenes than I ever wanted or ever needed....but I think, on the whole, the book  will work for you if you find a way to make it fun. Ya gotta work hard for it, though. WARNING!
1419705644|5.0|Really neat, well written and entertaining book, the illustration style is gorgeous and it'll keep you reading it if you're either a fan or a new comer to the Adventure Time tv series, very recommended.
B0064W67IM|3.0|S'allright. It seems terribly dated now, and the artwork is uneven...but fine for it's day. Since you invest little time, I say, if this is your happy place, go for it!
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|My husband did not like this one, said it was weak, and disappointing. He said they promised  lot but, delivered very little.<br />Smiths, son was not able to carry the movie.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|okay- I'm embarrassed to admit this... I was one of those \\"weird\\" guys sitting in the airport laughing out loud with headphones on!<br />found myself in the slc airport with a delayed flight due to snow- had a couple hours to kill so I watched this movie-<br />and it was a super gem!<br />funny as hell- I'm still laughing thinking about some of these scenes. the hillbillies were awesome and hilarious!<br />this was a great dark comedy and it has lots of \\"laugh out loud\\" scenes. This movie is the reason why I became an amazon prime member; to find the 1 out of 50 gems hiding in the sea of crappy movies.<br />if you're a fan of silly \\"slapstick\\" dark comedy, then you're gonna love this flick!<br /><br />***EDIT***<br />almost 2 days later and I'm still LMFAO thinking about some of these scenes! I gotta watch it again :)
B008JFUQZ2|3.0|My husband said this one ws just okay, no big thing, they promised much delivered very little. This one he could have<br />waited, o see on TV.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|A dictionary at the click of a button. Very convenient, very quick, and saves me a trip to the Chiropractor from lifting a heavy book!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great Movie, very few movies, go back and show how the characters started out, and do it so very well as this one.<br />If you buy this movie you'll be very pleased.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|I love this movie! If you like gritty cop/action movies, man this is the movie for you! This movies is as bad@$$ as can be.<br /><br />Watch it and then find their Facebook and tell them you want a sequel... because you will!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked it a lot just she could of at least let Gale stay in Finnick still be alive, just a little more happy.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|It would be a fun game IF one could just pay a upfront cost. But I hate games that try to entice one to play for \\"free\\". but require multiple cash payments in order to \\"really\\" play.  In app sales are ridiculous.  I found that in order to go further and meet one's objectives of the game, the first step is to obtain a \\"Tier 13\\" weapon.  But to get that weapon, you have to buy it.  There is no way to get a Tier 13 weapon otherwise in my experience.  As you progress in levels, one must continue to buy weapons that are not available without paying.  It's too greedy and a potential high cost to the consumer.  Of course, one can spend money like crazy to obtain additional benefits that are constantly being advertised to the player.  Gameloft---you can take your greed and........Game deleted and I will boycott  in-apps games like this in the future.  it is a shame.  I had second thoughts and this is my new info.<br /><br />Update<br />Okay-- I thought maybe I should try again and spend what I was willing to for this game.  I brought $19.99 worth of diamonds and was able to purchase the level 13 and level 25 weapons.  To get the next levels of (I think) it was level 37 and 40 something weapons I would have had to spend even more than what I did the first time.  Then the whole character and my levels, etc. disappeared when I clicked for the game to open today.  The game opened at the very beginning and level 1. Everything gone including what I had actually purchased.  i know this was a bug.  Now I feel like my $19.99 was stolen.  No change in the rating.  I would give the game a 4 if it was reasonably priced and without all the bugs.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|this is a must read for all Marines that have served our country. This hero was gifted with incredible eyesight and was born to shoot a weapon.
1594202273|4.0|An excellent and well-researched history of the many accidents and problems with the US nuclear weapons arsenal during the Cold War.  Focusing on one particular accident in great detail was an excellent choice on his part, because it helped provide action and served to hold together what was otherwise a very technical history.  The ending, as you might expect in this somewhat open-ended history, was slightly inconclusive - but the entire book serves as a warning for weapons engineers and policy-makers, as well as an education for the general public.  I lived through the end of this era, and I had no idea how bad things were!
0307951154|2.0|Poor Harry. In earlier books he was loaded with flaws but remained a likable character despite them. He had character. This book differs markedly from the earlier works. Harry's flaws become so pronounced that he ceases to be someone you like despite them. And the overall theme of the book is depressing, and boringly so. Page after page is devoted to rampant drug traffic and horrifically lost people of all ages. Harry's relationship with Rakel and Oleg becomes so fraught with introspection and analysis that I nearly put the book down.<br />The redeeming quality of the book is its backdrop for the book that follows, POLICE, which is a very good mystery full of surprises and suspense. Harry is more believable here and the relationships less suffocating. That, however, is for some other review.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|wonderful.  the book was better than the movie but the movie was great  I recommend both.  this writer brought tears to my eyes
B007VUCAVO|4.0|It does what it should.  Clear and easy to understand nraphics and easy to use, for a freebie it is a bargain.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|He just keeps making them better.  And you hear something new with each listen. Includes a surprise (to me) cover of Wagon Wheel and a duet with Sheryl Crow.
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|I totally prefer the Robert Redford version! The musical numbers were 'odd'. Wished that the movie kept true to the novel. Leonardo was exceptional.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I have an issue I bought my first addiction to the game yesterday's special but never received any of it I have a receipt but no white chocolate tree no dollars to finish my cake machine what to do HELP
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Not too bad of a game, pretty decent way to kill a few minutes here and there. Just a little warning it's gonna take a while to build your base unless you want to spend some money.
B00BJS7LHC|3.0|Would have rated it higher but was unable to hear parts of it because the audio was intermittent. Amazon needs to work on audio for HD movies.

B0000CF35G|5.0|This album was stolen from my collection over 20 years ago. I am so happy that it is part of my vinyl collection again. Back in Black is one of the best albums of all time & I can't wait to listen to it over and over again. Thank you Amazon for always having what I'm looking for.

B005LAIII0|1.0|They abused the animals to film this. Look it up. What good is being entertained by 'magical' scenes that really worked poor animals like slaves against their will The tiger almost drowned. And why? So you could sit on your large butts stuffing your faces with popcorn and be 'entertained.' Movies with animals are slave labor. Low grade entertainment for idiots with low consciousness. No different than dressing up a monkey in a suit. Blech. Boycott such films.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Unlike many hidden picture type games, this one has a few twists and turns that make for a much more enjoyable experience. I find as much time as possible to enjoy this rather unique and challenging game.  It would appear that with its many levels, I won't suffer with boredom anytime soon!
B001EC2ISA|4.0|Michael Keaton had the funniest turn of his career in Tim Burton's &#34;Beetlejuice.&#34; This 1980s cult classic predates Keaton's subsequent career folly in letting himself be co-opted for those silly Batman films. Director Burton's disciples, and they are many, love &#34;Beetlejuice.&#34; But not everyone gets it. Or him. Burton's life view is … different. May he never change.<br />– Al Hooper  (E-HOOPER.COM)

B000WJSCZE|5.0|It is a very intriguing book. It allows you think outside of the box. If you have felt stuck with a lack of response from your audience while presenting using a presenting tool such as power points and so on, this is the book for you. Make peace with your technical difficulties and let your creative juices flow!
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Challenging and fun.  Win some, restart, try again.  Compete against yourself.  No problems with app.  Work to increase stats.  Worth small price.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was directed toward the Divergent series by a friend who had claimed it was better than &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;.  Alas, it is not.  I had high hopes for the series until it became abundantly clear in the second book that Tris has a Messiah complex, and not in the honest and humble way that Harry Potter does in his series.  Tris's decision of self-sacrifice is hidden, poorly, under the guise that this is how she will show her love for Caleb best.  That this is how she will immortalize her parents' choices to save her and to save the cause.  No.  She even admits to herself, when she seemed to have overcome the guilt of their sacrifice for her, that living is the best way to honor their memory and to honor what they believed in.  So then she does the exact opposite in a completely uncharacteristically ill-planned manner?  No.<br /><br />Instead, we see Tris somehow not put together a better plan than Nita.  Really?  She watched Nita and her crew - heavily armored - try to get into the Weapons Lab before it became a possibility in her mind.  Why would she go in unarmored?  She has worn a bulletproof vest before, knows where they are, and has a vague understanding of how they work (given the other things she has managed to logic out, it is not a stretch for her to have figured this out) - so why would she send anyone towards the Weapons Lab, or go there herself, without this key piece of equipment?  Matthew, given his experience in the compound, would also have known about them so that's two smart people, one considerably more educated, that managed to overlook this detail. She could have hidden it under baggy clothes as she has so many other things.  Especially knowing that the memory serum was about to be deployed in the cities and that the Weapons Lab is the *only* place they keep it, it is completely out of character not to have planned for the contingency of armed interception.  And really, the man in the wheelchair - who is still loopy from pain meds and justnow learning how to get around in a wheelchair - is going to make it downstairs and to the room in time to catch her before she's released the virus?  Please.  I could have accepted a reasonable and necessary death, but this was unnecessary.  Key pieces were left unaddressed and the author's flippant responses in everything I've seen to date regarding her death only make it more unnecessary.  At some point, as a writer, you have to let the characters live on their own.  The way that Tris was written up to this point was that she wanted to live, but for the author's own self-serving purposes, Tris did not.<br /><br />As I have experienced other readers expressing - you have left us a dystopian future without hope.  Tobias is completely broken, with the only person who can put him back together again dead.  What kind of world is that?  In the end, all I wish is that they had never left the city, that they had never shown the Edith Prior video.  That the dysfunctional Truman Show-esque city had continued undisturbed and that they had survived whatever came together rather than wandering through the aftermath apart.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this book to others and will not be seeing any of the movies based upon it.

B00AATV046|5.0|The only way to improve upon this movie is to colorize it.  The Bishop's home is amazing and I'd love to see the stained glass in color.  Who better to play an angel than Cary?  This is my favorite Cary Grant movie.  I've loved him since childhood.

B00FGWTOBI|5.0|Movie was awesome and I love the soundtrack. It has all the songs that were sung in the movie and the scores played throughout the movie totaling to 32 songs
B002YMWPUA|3.0|Provocative on some level, however slow moving and suffering from lack of dialogue and background. Very good acting. Many scenes depicted will make the viewer uncomfortable, presumably by design.
B001974DG0|5.0|I am a voracious reader and have never written a review. Watchers was so mind blowing good that I had to write a review, if for no other reason than to share my thrill of having read the best book ever. Dean Koontz reaches down deep and writes a tale that touches on all aspects and emotions of humanity. I laughed, cried and was in awe of Einstein, Travis and Nora. These characters were so well developed that there where times I forgot this was a tale and not reality. As silly as it sounds, I sincerely hope that Einstein is real, living with a couple like Travis and Nora surrounded by golden retrievers like Einstein. I will never meet a golden retriever that I won't look for extreme intelligence and think of Einstein. You have outdone yourself, Dean Koontz.
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|it was very riveting and exceeded my expectations. i would very highly recommend this product to anyone who reads this.

B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids are addicted to this game. It's one of their top two favorite games (the other being Monster Hunter). I don't know any kids who don't love playing Minecraft. When they're not playing it, they're talking about it or watching videos of other people playing it. They have nothing bad to report about this game.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|execellent game fun to play good story line.  free version is to short and the full version price is to much.  would recommend this game..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the best escape game I've played. My kids and I have tried many of the others, and they all pale in comparison. My 11 year old daughter was able to finish all the levels on her own, with a little help on level 7. The game is just the right amount of challenge, without being too frustrating, but enough to make you work for it. I wish this company would make another version, because all the other ones out there aren't as good.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Lowry brilliantly challenges Sameness and a human tendency to overly protect people from risk and pain, from feeling different or outcast...in the end this leads to a bland life hardly worth living.  Risk, live and love fully and deeply!
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Very interesting. I'm not far into the game but I am intrigued.  I have encountered mini-games like these but these have a different twist. The story line at this point is a little freaky and getting freakier. I love the mystery behind freaky. Back to the game
B008JFUPOY|5.0|My daughters are huge disney fans and this movie is ranking up there with them.  They can watch it over and over again and not get tired.  In fact, my whole family liked this movie, nice story of their beginning.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is sooo addictive.... love this game and its so cute... just love the minions... just like temple run but for kids or grownups...

B007T8BYWE|5.0|Good puzzles, but way too short.  Some of the others by this company, were a better length.  But for the price it is okay.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|Great movie for all.  Very impressed on the movie being centered around our envirnoment and getting out the message.  My family loved this movie and would highly recommed it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book!  I cried so much.  It was very touching and hard to put down.  A different view.
B0041D843M|5.0|First, this book is an EASY read.  This is NOT a technical book that will be over your head and have you all confused.  It's written in 8th grade English, so don't be afraid of it one bit.<br /><br />Second... The knowledge contained inside is used as the scientific basis for several famous doctor's work. Like Dr. Joel Fuhrman who works with the morbidly obese, taking huge amounts of weight off them quickly, safely and permanently.  (He also has a great book out called &#34;Eat to Live&#34;.)<br /><br />Third...  Check out Chapter 3, called &#34;Turning Off Cancer&#34; !!  It's amazingly important information.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|I highly recommend this album for the calm, but fun sound. Love the attitude she brings out in her lyrics. An admirable new artist!
0307951529|4.0|I agree with so many others.  The book is a good book to dream on.  An encourager.  I actually got one thing out of it which may be key: Don't let your fears hold you back.  But there is a huge piece missing.  As I kept reading, I hungered for something that wasn't there.  More details.  I realize you have to make your own details, but a little more of a nudge on 'how to' and maybe a check list of ideas to discover your gifts and talents would have been a great help.  I have lots of them but would they be enough to make a business flourish?  Some people have creativity but no administrative abilities.  And what if your audience is tiny?  How do you cope with that kind of thing?
B004GHNIRK|4.0|A fascinating story as is well known. A little too much detail for me personally but I guess I will know more about Parisian sewers than most.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I initially wasn't too interested in even reading this book!! Once I started it, I totally couldn't put it down. I read it in three days and now I can't wait to start the next one!! Now I HAVE to see the movie. So glad my husband recommended I read it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't generally like science fiction of the geeky tech kind but once I started this book I couldn't<br />Put it down. I grew up in the 1980's so I loved all the era references as well. Very exciting read and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves adventure!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even though I just saw the movie I wanted to read the book to catch the details that weren't mentioned in the movie
B00BV1P8NG|4.0|I got this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He loves MLP, so I wanted to help start his collection with his favorite character. The shipping was fast, I got this two days before the estimated date. If my boyfriends wants more; I'll happily buy from them again.
B003B02OOG|5.0|A perfect mixture of seriousness and comedy.  Describes small town court houses and lawyers just like they are.  If you ever wonder what happens at the court clerk's office when the jury isn't around, just read Grisham.  No unique stories, just comfortable tales about people you might recognize.
B004UID2LC|4.0|The only reason for the 4 stars is because it doesnt let you chose the folder to download to. Other than that its fantastic and does what its supposed to do.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I thought my title was fitting. It didn't end the way I wanted it to and it left me sad. I went through all that sadness and killing with these characters, just to feel sad at the end. Call me crazy but I would rather read a story that ends with two people finally reaping the reward together. Whatever
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|This is a great book. I haven't read Mr. King in over a decade; I'm glad I gave this a try. He is truly a master storyteller who knows how to keep a story flowing. Amazing! Once you get going on this story, you won't want to stop.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />This book falls way short of the series. Divergent was compelling and fast paced and I loved the momentum. Insurgent, in my opinion, was not as good as the first. I felt like I was stuck with 500 pages of being in Tris' emotional, and nervous, breakdown. It was not as fast paced as the first. Unfortunately, the this book does little to mitigate the second book slump of Insurgent. In fact, Roth never should have written this.<br /><br />First there is the differing POVs.  We constantly switch between Tris' and Tobias' viewpoint. I hate books with differing POV. I won't read them. I only read Allegient because I wanted to know how the series would end. Unfortunately, I had to keep going back to the chapter beginning to find out whose head I was in.  Also, the sudden change to differing viewpoints disrupts the continuity of the first two books, which were told from Tris' POV.<br /><br />Also, Tris just doesn't seem to be as strong of a character in this book. I miss her strength and defiance from the first. She also has the annoying habit of always being right. She tells Tobias to stay away from Nita because Nita is using. Of course, Tobias doesn't listen to Tris and decides to trust someone he doesn't know, which made little sense, and then apologizes to Tris later saying that he should have listened to her.  And then there is the fact that Tobias is a weak willed pansy. In Divergent h had a strength that help Tris and fueled her own admirable qualities. But by book three I felt he was nothing but a mopey whiner.<br /><br />None of the characters really followed the traits Roth set them up with in the first two books.  And the resolution made no sense.  Evelyn is a mass murdering little B***.  As she plans to destroy the factions and seize control of Chicago, Tobias decides to have a talk with her. After pages of boring conversation Evelyn decides not to kill people and to become a good person.  The same with Marcus.  In the first two books, Marcus is a prick.  He wants to take over the world, or at least the city of Chicago. However, Johanna talks him out of it with pages of boring conversation.  She says, you shouldn't. It wouldn't be right.\\"  And Marcus basically goes, \\"Okay.\\"  And that's the end of that. Seriously?  Such actions don't follow the character's personalities and made for a lackluster ending.<br /><br />Then there is Tris' death. I am normally okay with the main character dying as long as it is done right. Their death has to make sense and Tris' didn't, nor was it necessary.  Since Evelyn and Marcus decided not to kill people, why did Tris have to die? She goes into the weapons lab, ingest the death serum, which doesn't kill her because she is somehow immune to it, but that's okay because a bullet finished the job.  The only reason Tris went into the weapons lab was to save Caleb, and to stop the U.S. government from using the death serum to kill innocent people, even though she had no proof that such a thing would ever happen.<br /><br />Rothalso finally explains why Chicago is split into factions and which lies outside, but none of it made much sense. Apparently, the U.S. government decide to mess with genetics to make people a certain way, but it didn't go right. So they wanted to get genetically pure people, by setting up an experiment in Chicago.  And for a few generations, Chicago lives in their own little world while everything they do is filmed by secret cameras and watched by people on the outside.  So, yeah, when the mass murder in Divergent happens, apparently people outside the city were watching it and eating popcorn.  The majority of the book was spent with people talking about genetically inferior people and genetically pure people. It dragged.  In fact, I started skipping pages. I also felt that the explanation of the Tris' world was not well thought out and just thrown in there.<br /><br />Then there is Caleb.  He betrays Tris in book two and remains the coward in this one. He should hve either died with Tris, or at least been with her when she died. Instead, she sacrifices herself for him, something she would do, and he runs away without even trying to stop her.<br /><br />I also had a problem with Peter and Marcus taking the memory serum. They get to forget everything they had done and live a better life elsewhere.  Where's the justice?<br /><br />And lastly, the writing quality.  Roth's writing skills are by no means stellar. I'm not trying to insult her, it's just her writing reminds me too much of the papers I wrote while in high school. A lot of pople write with the same level of skill she does.  Proper writing is not taught in school.  That being said, I was able to ignore the writing style in Divergent because the book moved, and I found myself wrapped up in Tris' world. But in Insurgent, the book moved more slowly and I could not ignore the writing style. The same for Allegiant. This book is not fast paced. the middle is boring. It felt like she only stuck in an action scene so she could kill off a character. Because of this, I could not ignore the average writing style and I stopped caring about the characters.  What made me love the characters in Divergent did not exist in Allegiant.<br /><br />This book was just a huge disappointment. I was hoping for a better ending, especially one that made sense. I felt like she threw the ending together while at the same time trying to see how many pages she could write.  Another case of a story that had promise, but the author screwed it up in the end.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|took a little to get used to and learn how to use haven't done much with it yet so not sure
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love having the ability to play friends or strangers. It makes the game more interesting and challenging. The twist and turns keep the game exciting. I recommend this to everyone. Love it.

B00A757EFW|5.0|This is awesome! Use your finger or stylus to play. Just like the arcade game. Fun to play while you have time to wait.
B000A7DVRC|4.0|It was a good, but not great movie. If you have nothing to do and want to burn up two precious hours of your life, then watch this movie.

1401938906|1.0|It was an absolute waste of time reading this book.. There is nothing new in this book. I have read The Secret, The Power, The Magic, Abraham and Hicks books, and many other books on the law of attraction. It is amazing to me why this book has such a high rating. This is the first book that I have ever given a one star review.

B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|Boston's first album, and this one, I will still be listening to, 35 years from now. How many albums can you honestly say this about? Very few albums, have as many listenable songs as this one does, which means, I'm listening to it, alot.<br /><br />I'm 50; grew up on Boston (as well as Pink Floyd, Cars, Rush, ZEP, REO, Styx, Asia, etc...), and at first, I was leary about buying this album, wondering how Boston would sound, with a new Lead Singer. In addition, how would my taste, now, align with who Boston is, today. I'm amazed that I would doubt, Scholz's genius at putting something together, that has so many layers of music; and a fresh sound.<br /><br />Hats off to the Singers, a variety on this album, being that it was worked on for 10 years. You will hear Boston, in old and new ways, but always, in the way, the song, demands.<br /><br />This album does it for me. If you expect a Boston album like the first, you'll be disappointed; if you are looking for a Boston, that has evolved, yet remains faithful to Scholz's vision, buy this. 12 of 12 songs worth listening to, is a great buy, and like the first Boston album, you too, will be listening to it, 35 years from now, with themes, and sounds, very relevant, to your life.

B008I34Z8E|5.0|Wow! the 2012 remastering is OUTSTANDING in this version of Waka / Jawaka...i mean the bottom end is formidable, and there is an obvious stereo clean up (and no reverb anymore, as Zappa added to the Ryko cd versions). Honestly, it was almost as if listening to entirely new recording of the same music i know so well. Great job whoever remastered it!!

B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This was a fabulous movie. A great family movie. I love that the Dad is always concerned about keeping his family safe. I also loved the little jokes in it as well. My kids also loved it, we watched it for a family movie night and they asked to watch it the next day too.

B00000ITOY|5.0|Just received this and opened box to confirm contents. Board is smaller than expected (7&#34;x7&#34;) . Holes on shapes are generous relative to the peg so a child won't have to exactly line them up on the peg. That will be helpful. Very happy with the product. My 15 month old will love it.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I'm a student and I find this app very useful.  I can upload my papers to Google Docs and work on them form my Kindle anywhere on campus.<br /><br />I don't understand the issues other people are having with the fonts.  The app comes with a bunch of the common ones like Times New Roman and Ariel.  I suggest uploading your work to an actual computer before you print it to make sure the formatting it the way you want it.  If you want a different font, you can change it then.<br /><br />I only paid 99¢ for this app and it was definitely worth it.  However if it's not on sale, don't buy it.  It was definitely worth what I paid for it, but $15 is a little pricey for an app.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|it slowed down my kindle fire waaaay down. had to delete it to get it running at normal speed again.
B00FF9SKSK|5.0|I have avoided this series since it originally began because I felt like it would be to macho and oversexed as I refuse to live a life as society tells me as a man to be. Of course a friend finally challenged me to the series so I bought the fast and the furious and enjoyed it so much that I ended up buying the first five movies as it's more about &#34;family&#34; as a team then anything else which drawn my attention completely. It was so different then what was out there and Paul Walker always shined from being a FBI Agent to a criminal as he fell in love with the street racing and his new family. I have not seen the sixth one as I wanted to wait until it came out on DVD but with the death of Paul Walker I honestly had to think quite a few times if I would end up watching and knowing he will never be with us again. I was devastated to learn the news and when a celebrity passes on I typically never watch their projects again as it only reminds me of their passing but after sometime thinking it would be best if I and the rest that knew or loved Paul that we continue to remember him through his life work of charity and politeness to his artistic acting abilities such as his fast and the furious projects. So I will watch this film and remember who Paul was as an actor and as a person. HIs talents will never be forgotten and it's fast and the furious that will keep him alive for me. I love you Paul Walker and never forget you!
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|If you are tired of an artist sounding the same on every song, this one is for you.  What a great variety!

B00EDDUKGY|5.0|I purchased this as a &#34;holiday&#34; movie for Christmas. It really isn't a Christmas movie per say, but it is still really good. My kids have been asking to watch it every night since we got it. I enjoyed the movie also. So much better than a lot of recent family movies I have watched.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good read.  This book was almost impossible for me to set down.  What a great story by a wonderful author.  I can't wait to read the rest of trilogy.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I started reading this series because of all the hype around it. I didn't know anything about it when I started reading. I didn't know what type of book it was or anything. I like romance novels....but I didn't like this series....<br /><br />First of all, all the S&M stuff, does NOTHING for me. If it weren't for all the sex, I might have enjoyed the book a lot more. Don't get me wrong, I like steamy scenes.....but these were not my type of steamy scenes. I got to where I was skipping over those pages to get to the story line.<br /><br />I finished the first book and decided to continue on to the second, purely to see if they would stick together. Don't ask me why I even bothered with the 3rd book. I couldn't finish the 3rd book either. I was stuck for MONTHS on the 3rd before I gave up. I can finish a 300 page book in two days, if it is good.....and this wasn't good.

I can finish a 300 page book in two days, if it is good.....and this wasn't good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addictive puzzle app.  I have got several people hooked on this app.  Great challenge for people of all ages.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I think this game is awesome, but I'm giving it 3 stars because I had a really good account logged in to facebook, and now it's just gone. Please help me
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have used this app on several different cell phones and a couple different Kindles.  Its very handy with easy backup and restore functions which allow for quick transfer of notes between devices.  I like the fact that you can password protect individual notes.  Being able to customize note colors is kinda nice as well for quick ID.  I highly recommend this for a really nice android notepad.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game is somewhat bejeweled game and that's why I am enjoying it so much. It is very addictive to. I haven't had any problems at all.
B00FN3HRFA|5.0|A delightful array of great songs and the best vocalist to interpret the songs.  Barbra, at 71 sounds and looks like she is 50.<br />skilled, and clear and hits every note with perfection.  I LOVE HER
B00G922EA2|4.0|Took a long time to download and there were a couple of glitches, but I did enjoy the storyline, the excellent graphics and the fun puzzles/mini games.
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|an amazing Cd with the best songs from a legend with the best voice in this century,  and what original interpretations.
B00009YUPY|4.0|I am used to use Lenovo mouse. so I order the mouse. when i received the passel, i feel  a litter pitty, that I choose the big one instead of small.
B00E6D4HHO|5.0|I absolutely loved the X-Men growing up.  I still remember reading the comics, collecting the cards and watching the Saturday Morning cartoons in pure joy.  When the X-Men came out in theaters in 2000 I was ecstatic.  And since then the love has not changed.  So when the Adamantium Collection came out I had to have it.  And it is worth every penny to me (my opinion).  Anyone who loves the X-Men and Wolverine as much as I do, this Collection is for you.  It has every X-Men movie and Wolverine movie, as well as an open spot for X-Men Days of Future Past.  Must buy for Huge X-Men fans!
0780747550|5.0|I saw the movie years ago and found it to be out of print and very expensive to purchase now. I decided to buy the book instead and WOW the book is even better than the movie. Irish family leaves New York and goes back to Ireland during the depression. Some of the writing is difficult to decipher due to regional dialect and writing style of the author but well work working through it.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This was my favorite Reacher novel yet. Couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed the incorporation of his army buddies in this book!
B00536OCZA|5.0|Do I really need to say anything? It's Dark Side of the Moon, one of the best albums ever. The sound quality is great on this.
0385537131|5.0|This was a great book.  It kept me in suspense until the end.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the writing of John Grisham.
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|Fantastic book. Harrowing, but has many perspective viewpoints from several different angles and cultures. Raises a lot of questions worthy of debate and inspires the reader to follow up the issues raised with further research. This book is very well written, carefully constructed and a fine piece of literary work.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I hate this game but can't stop playing. damn you candy crush. I need a candy crush intervention. I know I'm not the only one!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this book! I love the throw back references to the shining and how it answers your questions about what ever happened to the little boy from the shining!!!! Imaginative, gripping<br />g, and suspenseful!!!!!
B008BM0IUG|5.0|This book has a lot of anecdotes of the history of the Higgs mechanism development. And I enjoyed those stories.
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|I played the first Halo games religiously when I was younger.  I was skeptical about this movie since from my experiences with games made into movies has been more than a let down.  This movie blew me away however and I hope to see more.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is the best way to play your favorite tunes with or without WiFi. You buy your music (the prices are very reasonable- to cheap) you download IF you want it on your device for anytime, anyplace listening. Or you can leave your tunes safe in the cloud so it does not take up any storage, you start the wireless and listen that way. Either way, the selection is nearly infinite. All the old classics to the newest hits....And best of all; NO Commercials!  And you don't have to listen to anything except what you want to hear. For listening on your phone or tablet, this is the real deal. No hidden fees. No upgrades. Just straight out jamming Your Way!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We love our chromecast. We use it to watch Netflix and YouTube. One of the issues we have sometimes is we will be loading a movie or tv show on Netflix and the screen will freeze on the logo. Normally, to fix the issue we start a YouTube video and it unlocks itself.<br /><br />We have also used it to watch web content by downloading Chrome on our computer and casting it up. It worked really well however, it doesn't work the same as it does when you cast up NetFlix. The show still plays on the computer and if you close the computer and it goes to sleep you can disrupt the feed. To use it with Chrome you cast up a particular tab. I like the way it functions better with NetFlix and YouTube because I can close the apps, turn off my phone or shut down my ipad without disrupting the feed.<br /><br />Other than that it works like a charm and is much better then my old sony blue ray which has issues with varying singles and will drop the whole program on us. I can't wait till there are more apps.
B00DDU1T5E|1.0|Seems to work, until you try to play a video.  Problem is, it only translates 1 track on a DVD or .iso video file, usually the preview track, and it usually botches that, getting the track time totally wrong, with attempts to watch what got translated ending in a crash.  It simply does not work with these multi track video files.  Single track videos like .mp4 files do get properly streamed, but the player is very primitive with no ability to move the play pointer back or forward (there is a play position bar, but moving it gets the position lost, or causes a crash), so for single track files, you would be better off getting a more polished player/streamer app like the Archos Video app, which streams without needing to install a helper app in your PC, and has a much more polished player interface.<br /><br />Also I feel a bit ripped off because I installed the free version, as they advised, and it appeared to translate my .iso files, but said you need to buy the full version to run them - and then after paying for the full version (non refundable) I found out it didn't actually work. So I ended up deleting it from my Kindle.<br /><br />If they ever get the ability to stream DVDs and .iso files, and maybe work on the video player interface, it could become a useful app. May be worth a look after a few months and a version update or two. If that happens, I'll post an update (since I've already paid for the currently useless app), and let you know that they got it working.  For now, though, save your money.  There is no joy here.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|Slides not held tightly and therfeore then sometimes image out of focus.<br />The full resolution of the device is not as good as the slides them selves and therefore lost quality
B000SEIKIW|4.0|This book presents some of the more complex aspects of relativity theory in a way that can be understood by people who don't have Ph.D. degrees in physics or mathematics.  However, it doesn't get into the really important questions of what time really is, how it began and will end, and how the universe itself arose.  To say that this is a &#34;history of time&#34; implies that the author would have said something about how time came to be in the first place.  This criticism is not just to this book but to the field of cosmology in general.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I like neon so it's nice to see a game that uses neon graphics. As the levels get more challenging, the game gets more fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A downer when I am stuck on a level. I space out imaging getting a sugar rush. I spend too much time playing this!
B00BEIYH6U|3.0|I'm re-titling this Kick-Ass 2: In Search of Rational Characters. It's exciting. There's a real sense of danger, mostly because the filmmakers ignore genre conventions. But this is very much a plot-driven exercise held up almost entirely by one actress.<br /><br />Since the first Kick-Ass, the eponymous superhero has hung up his cape. For about ten seconds. Then he joins a superhero crew, eventually facing off with a foaming and frothing Christopher Mintz-Plasse who took the death of his father from the first film rather personally. In between, Chloe Moretz alternates between killing people and attempting to be normal.<br /><br />This isn't a bad film. It's just not exceptional like the first one. Everything from the music to the camerawork is a little less inspired. In Moretz's first appearance three years ago, there was a frenetic, childish background number that elevated the WTF-factor to eleven. Here, it's mostly just generic score, a sort of indifference that mutes the action scenes. The two most compelling (including a Matrix-style highway melee) still trump the outlandish CGI carnage from most movies with 'legitimate' superheros, but there's nothing here with the emotional impact of Nic Cage's video ransacking, Moretz's night-vision rescue, or the combination of Elvis and a minigun.<br /><br />Partly to blame is the lack of an emotional core and a strong villain. Cage anchored the first film. All the violence was in service to his injustice. There's no equivalent here; Jim Carrey isn't onscreen long enough to play the role, and no one else has a compelling motivation. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is only back to crime-fighting because he's bored, and his adversary isn't a black belt mob boss with a business to run, but a decidedly unserious teenager in BDSM gear. All the minor characters are caricatures; the major ones are internally inconsistent. Why would a guy call the murderer of his relative 'dude' and then start lecturing him about 'real life'? Why would a girl who thinks nothing of amputating limbs be hurt by the rejection of someone she doesn't respect?<br /><br />Wild tonal shifts swirl into that morass. Very few people actually died in the first Kick-Ass that weren't generic baddies. In this one, the script indiscriminately offs cops and sympathetic secondary characters. Then we get jokes about impotence and dead sharks. Explicit violence lends verisimilitude to some scenes in the middle third, but that's out the window by the end; guns disappear whenever the script calls for ten minutes of physical beatings. The final fight resembles the brawl from The Outsiders with more colorful costumes.<br /><br />Caveats aside, Moretz carries the film. She's stellar, vastly better than the writing. On the other end is Mintz-Plasse, who the producers apparently told to chew the scenery, vomit it back up, and then swallow it again. His character alternates between insanity and teenage insecurity. I had no idea Carrey was in the movie until I checked IMDB. He's totally unrecognizable and steals every scene he shares with Aaron Taylor-Johnson.<br /><br />I'm giving Kick-Ass 2 four stars because it was engaging to watch and emotionally affecting. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one. But watch with modest expectations be prepared for a little more darkness.who thinks nothing of amputating limbs be hurt by the rejection of someone she doesn't respect?<br /><br />Wild tonal shifts swirl into that morass.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Love it. I want more. I am intrigued from beginning to end. I could not put it down. Mockinham here I come.
B000A42QIU|5.0|there is almost no way to review such a work of art. if you love 80s, BUY THIS, if you love club/house/pop, BUY THIS, heck, if you're into old school indie, alternative stuff like new order (who I don't like)....BU BU BU BUY IT. this is the stellar kind of pop that you dream about. his voice is so lovely, and the songwriting is just tops.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Seems as though the movie comes on FX every week now, but glad to have a Blu-Ray for whenever I'm craving it. Looks amazing on Blu-Ray. Taken 2 was a bit of a disappointment, really wish they had ended it with Taken.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Rare movie that depics an intense yet gentle relationship between a grizzled hard nosed hit man and a luckless street tough but adorably cute young girl - all without an once of &#34;creep.&#34; Factor. Plot is incredibly well crafted to provide depth of character without turning into a Jane Austin yawn fest... punctuated with some super intense action. Every scene is compelling given the riveting performance of every actor (kudos to the casting crew). The juxtapositions of the characters will strain if not strip the gears of your mind. I've seen thousands of movies at this point but never anything that approaches the unique blend of storyline and acting talent. For those of you who are usually board after 5 minutes of most action films because you've already got it all figured out... you'll like this one... it will keep you guess right up to the end.  Put this one on your must see list if you are a fan of action and character substance.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I just got this.  Wow impressed with all the room!  But it's not overly large or cumbersome.  Big plus.  Definitely room to grow with the bag.  Seems to be made well.  Time will tell.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|The Maze Runner didn't leave me desiring to read the next books of the series.  The chemistry between Thomas and Teresa seems lacking, however I know it's only the beginning.<br /><br />Many things seemed predicable and despite the fact that the characters are supposed to be smart, leaves me wondering how they missed important key details.<br /><br />It over all was an okay book, but I can't say it leaves me wanting more, or even caring about the movie that comes out next fall.  I'm still undecided whether to continue on reading the series.
0767903862|5.0|love book - really well written and very entertaining. there is a good mix of irony, comedy, history and storytelling
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Love the product! My only complaint is that the outer shells on all three seasons are broken. The shells do not open the way they are supposed to because of the broken shells. Other then that...the remaster is beautiful! The DVD set is everything I have ever wanted in a &#34;Star Trek&#34; DVD set!!! I'd recommend this to anyone who loves &#34;Star Trek!&#34;
B001DSNELA|1.0|Didn't send me the edition I ordered (which clearly says 3 disc Collector's Edition) which was the only reason I wanted to make the purchase in the first place.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Can't go wrong with Craig's Bond. I actually don't need to say any more because the movie is pure perfection!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|But you should updated more often and let pe minecraft have mods on all devices other than that it is a.great game I rekamend it
B00F1RR3Y8|5.0|Gils love this!  They love to play this and paint the nails different colors. It is a lot of fun for them and best of all there is no mess or nail polish to spill!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is fun when you have enough credits and when you have a crazy amount to Monet justnlike every other game but its fun in its own way
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|Impeccable video quality, ~32 Mbit/s H.264 video. As a film, it really feels like they took the original people in a cabin with evil spirits bit, and decided, &#34;OK, this is going to well for Ash...how can we make it worse?&#34;. They dispel with the lopsided cutting between characters and just focus on the point. Skip the pretense of serious (and the ridiculous cutting between serious and nutty that the first film had) and go straight for camp and laughs.<br /><br />In particular, I was impressed with Bruce Campbell's &#34;Rocking chair&#34; scene where he freaks out. And I can't help but wonder if the blood colour changes because they ran out of red corn syrup.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Luca Rossi ushers in a new era of science fiction. I personally am not inclined to the genre on a regular basis nor would it be my first choice of reading material. But this was different and wonderfully so.Galactic Energies contains stories that take the reader to various corners of the universe and into the lives of various, peculiar characters. And though this is sci-fi, the language is clear, the scenes very descriptive, and the characters contain enough personality that you go through their cycle of emotions in whatever they experience. Galactic Energies has the possibility to change the science fiction from this point forward.
B00005JLEU|5.0|One of my fiancee's favoured movies and one I've come to enjoy as well. As a DVD, I must say that I'm impressed at how well the video quality has held up, much better than say, The Simpsons Movie on DVD. Both English and Japanese audio is provided along with English subs, so whether you prefer dubs or despise them, you'll still be happy.<br /><br />The story proceeds fairly quickly to the crux of the matter and then kinda gets side tracked for a bit. I would say that is intentional. It's something you're either gonna go &#34;Aww&#34; by the end or be a sleep. Me, I now watch it regularly while my fiancee's off to work lol.
B00GII9UCW|5.0|Norah Jones can seemingly do no wrong, but the surprise here is the voice of Billie Joe Armstrong.  His voice blends perfectly with Norah's and of course the songs are great.  &#34;Long Time Gone&#34; and &#34;Kentucky&#34; are highlights, but the whole album is terrific.  A fine tribute to the Everly Brothers and a damn fine listening experience in it's own right.
B0002KVULG|4.0|No one embodies the count greater than Frank Langella. What a splindid actor. The best Dracula ever. Electrifying performance. Romance.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Well told stories with a plot that keep you spell bound. Delightful reading that keeps you reading from start to finish
B008JFUPZI|1.0|I went to three Red Boxes to get this film in hopes of some good sci fi. I never saw the trailer so I came into this \\"film\\" clueless, and remained clueless as I watched it. Somehow one great actor (Bridges) got mixed up with Ryan Reynolds and the negative forces of the universe to create an aptly named film called \\"RIPD\\".<br /><br />While watching the first few seconds of the film I thought I was watching an ad and said to myself \\" is this some kind of 90s tribute mess\\" only to discover I was watching the film I ardently sought out. I was sick to my stomach as a dumbed down Rooster Cogburn gets partnered with a dead and gone to Limbo cop. Plot= go back to earth as a Chinese looking man and hope the\\" Twilight Zone Movie\\" TV monsters don't act up.<br /><br />You've heard of Greek tragedy, this movie was just a tragedy. I wouldn't  allow any ethnic group to suffer such a connection. The 4 and 5 star reviewers, I'm convinced, were on acid, and having a good trip at that. Somebody got payed to sit at a desk and create computer animation using old instructional materials going as far back as 1990. The\\" entertainment \\" value is so low that you may actually start noticing the texture of your TV screen with mouth wide open while a dull glazed look involuntarily covers your face.<br /><br />Your  thinking, but could the films musical score save it? If you have ever imagined the horns from the The Munsters tv show theme inverted and chopped, this is your baby. So that's a no go as well. I also don't know if this is a comedy.  In fact, I don't know what it is, but madness may set in. Don't anyone ever make a movie like this again, ever!
B001O6W9QC|2.0|I thought this was very funny up until Jack-Black was tied to a tree talking about oral and cum guzzling, sorry I feel that sense of humor is immature and childish. I use to have a sense of humor like that at one time, but that was when I was 17.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great read! Kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat! I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00F2LKJ4Y|3.0|When I purchase this video, I thought I was going to get the DVD.  I'm very upset about it.  Will NOT be ordering any movies or show of full season from amazon again, if I can not own it.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|This is one of my 7 month old child's favorite toys! My wife was like, &#34;he's not gonna like it&#34;, and I was like, &#34;you just watch&#34;. And voila! He loves it!... He especially likes &#34;eating&#34; the little white product-label for some reason, haha :-D
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|EMINEM IS THE RAP GOD! Best album of 2013, Eminem as out done himself once again. You gotta buy this album pronto.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is pretty good, no offense to Amazon, google play version is better thanks to updates, 2 New suits and a new course
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is perfect for what I need as a writer. It's simple and quick for notes and ideas, and even the occasional first draft.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Every track is smart and different, the entire album was well worth the purchase. Seriously like the music/lyrics and creativity.
0767810856|5.0|This film confirms that most people really are basically good.  Our characters loved themselves and therefore with or without their good fortune they could love the human family.  The fact that they did come into money, they found ways to express their love for others.  It was easy because they believed in the good nature of people.<br />\
B0081SRJSY|1.0|For some unknown reason, because I assume it doesn't serve any ads, it doesn't work without network connectivity. It goes for a turn or two and then dies.
0316055433|5.0|A truly wonderful book. Very descriptive and beautifully written. This book should be an award winner. Great story line.<br />Highly recommend.
B0015XASFS|5.0|Josh is great on this DVD but to me he is always one of the best performer, he is very down to earth.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is a good device to stream netflix, pandora, hulu plus and Google play music to your TV. But Google really needs to add more apps. it's great to have for the price but I'm hoping more apps down the road gets added to the chromecast .
B000BFH2S2|1.0|I could not play that DVD as I did not understand what it mean Region, this was for Europe. So now I know
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I can't even start to describe how much my son loves this toy!  He uses it so many times a day to get all of that energy out!!  He was able to sit and play with the toys at 4 months, and he is 9 months now and still loves it.  Now he uses it for the jumping function.  Great quality product.  The toys are very entertaining to my son.  He can move around easy and the jumping springs allowed him to jump even at an early age.  He was a little short for it at the beginning, but we just put a pillow under him, and it worked fine.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|While I do not promote criminal activities, the 'team is family' theme in Fast Five continues demonstrates respect for the human family by depicting that each family member plays a vital role and contributes equally well for the accomplishment of an objective.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing Fast Six.
1476747016|4.0|This book is just as cute and funny as I thought it'd be. I'm sure my nephew'll love his present.
B002LANLDK|5.0|I love the diverse cast; women and men of different nationalities are depicted as capable human beings.  While I do not promote criminal activities, the 'team is family' theme demonstrates respect for the family unit; the multi-culture design of this 'team is family' also shows respect for ALL members of the human family.
B005JCT4B0|5.0|Great way to experience the classics for a those just beginning.  It has the core albums and while some may debate their relative value and others complain about incompleteness (no Metal Magic)  It's a great (and cheap) set to give you an idea of who Pantera was and why they're famous.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Our family really love this movie and the actresses portray their characters very well. It's very, very entertaining. This movies shows how you can get so caught up in making a name for yourself that you loose sight of who you really are.
B003B02O0A|5.0|One of the best books ever! Much better than the movie and it was great!  I am now a big time Grisham fan
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very interesting book, hard to put down. The intertwined lives of several people was captivating. Thoroughly enjoyed from beginning to end
1607066017|5.0|Staples art is amazing. this comic series is amazing and really draws you into the characters. there's really something for everyone.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Husband loves it and was instanly addicted. Good extension of the first LP. Includes some of my new favorite songs.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Highly engaging, addictive, and leaves you wanting for more.  Wish the sequel was available now.  Great character development and we haven't even scratched the surface of the story's antagonist.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Highly recommend. I'm sure it will be a great motion picture someday. Great characters and a compelling storyline. Hard to put down.
1439156816|5.0|Experience is the best teacher and someone who has succeeded and knows what it takes, is good to emulate into one's style.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the whole family enjoys the game. sometimes action freezes on kindle and you lose your scores. different. locations keep game interesting.  we do wish more characters available for purchase with bananas
B008JFUS8M|5.0|No iTunes DC? Will change rating if included. Otherwise I won't buy. Stop pushing just UV. Give us a choice. UV is not HD.<br /><br />Update- It does come with a choice.  Thank you LG. Way to make the customer happy.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Read it the book is AWesomeness and I think it is hilarious to the last page I think it is a great way to pass time
B008D28HYS|3.0|Love this game but it seems the past few weeks I've had progress on unfinished puzzles going back to a previous state &amp; some completed ones going back to unfinished as well.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Love this app COULDN'T be better thanks for updating it!! It's the best texting app ever and should always be updated!! THANKS!!!(:
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|When I read about the book sounded like a good book, liked the story line, then I started to read it and could not put it down had to find out how it ended
B00G70WLJA|3.0|I don't know, I just did not enjoy this movie as much as the last one. I has lots of action and great fight scenes, etc.
B00E4W40C4|3.0|THE MOVIE.....<br />To begin, I am well-versed in the Wolverine character, and have wanted to see a more gritty take on him--something wherein Wolverine stood ALONE, not sharing scenery with a cadre of Mutant heroes and villains, all vying for attention. Like Hugh Jackman, I enjoy the character for his own dramatic potential.<br />That said, I`ll keep the movie review short: This film delivers a better Wolverine than the 'Origins' (so-called) stand-alone Wolverine movie.....Logan gets center-stage here for real this time, and Jackman makes the best of it. The storyline--based upon the  classic Claremont/Byrne Wolverine limited series--is merely okay, due to the Claremont/Byrne tale being unfortunately altered for some bizarre, unexplained reason...The old saying goes \\"If It Ain`t Broke, Don`t Fix It\\", but Hollywood seems to never quite grasp the value of that.....sadly.<br />This was a good Wolverine movie....BUT...It could have been great.<br /><br />\\"Of All The Sentiments Of Word Or Pen, The Saddest Are; 'It Might Have Been\\"<br /><br />Now...for THE MARKETING.....<br /><br />Call me a curmudgeon..call me crazy if you wish...But I am tired of multiple-disc set offerings . I am tired of having to purchase formats that I DO NOT WANT in order to get the one that I do. I really did not want a '3D Blu-ray' copy of this movie.....nor can I play one, as I do not have the gear for it... Likewise, I did not want the standard DVD of theTheatrical cut with the existence of an 'Extended' version available....nor did I want a Blu-Ray of the Theatrical cut with an Extended version available...... I  DID want the' Extended Unrated' version of the film....<br /> So.... I had to buy THREE MORE formats just to get THE ONE that I was interested in?<br /> I don`t know what the marketing genius who dreamt up this idea got for it, but it should have been LIFE Without Parole. ( Hey, Bernie Maddoff could use a checkers partner, I`m sure)<br /><br />Of course, I immediately sold off the extraneous versions of the set on Ebay, to the effect that the movie cost me nothing...<br />But frankly, I would just as soon gone to the store, bought the one that I wanted and been done with it.<br /> Buying a movie should not have to be a pain-in-the-ass exercise in buying things I do not need  or want.<br /><br />(sigh)....I just had to say it...Thanks for allowing me to vent.traneous versions of the set on Ebay, to the effect that the movie cost me nothing...<br />But frankly, I would just as soon gone to the store, bought the one that I wanted and been done with it.<br /> Buying a movie should not have to be a pain-in-the-ass exercise in buying things I do not need  or want.<br /><br />(sigh)....I just had to say it...Thanks for allowing me to vent.
B00BWJ6JO4|3.0|I like this as movie. The actors all did a great job and special effects are really good. But, I loved the book &#34;The Hobbit&#34; as a child. All of that said. This movie really shouldn't be titled the hobbit, as much as &#34;peter jackson's: the lord of the rings prequel.&#34;  I say that because Jackson has added and subtracted so much that it can't be called &#34;the Hobbit&#34;. I was really disappointed. But it is a good movie if none of that matters.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Love the movie and the book!!#lol and what do u think of this book read it for yourself and find out why
B00FPGV3RS|2.0|This is not the best movie ever made and I would be shocked if it won any awards. At the same time it is not horrible and does have some entertaining moments. Its watchable if nothing else is on prime or TV. Sadly, I paid money for this which was a mistake.
B0053KWDES|2.0|Only noticed a loudness increase while using the amplifier but the music didn't seem to sound any better. I expect a good amp to be able to do more than just increase the volume. I expect to hear a more rich spectrum over integral aspects like the bass hitting harder and cleaner at a given volume. Maybe the changes were imperceptible to me because my ears aren't as sensitive as others.  The eq buttons didn't change much either.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I was a little frightened about reading a book about college students but then I'm glad I have this book a chance I'm not disappointed at all and can't wait to read book two. Thanks for the experience. Janielle
038536315X|5.0|This is great price of American fiction for Grisham or  non Grisham fan. Peels back a piece of American culture and psyche, at the same time you are truly entertained. Many unspoken issues, thoughts laid out before you. The type of book you would recommend to someone who wanted a deeper understanding of how America got where it is. Or may still be.  CW
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Hello My name is Triple A and my brother asked a person from Amazon to get this game and I was so happy when he said that this game came out and this game is the greatest kindle game of all time and if you are a dc fan you should get this game.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a very good game and will have you up all night playing it is not only free but is worth the memory space
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I had heard a few songs without knowing who it was, when friend invited us to go see them in St. Augustine. They are a great live band, and this album really showcases their work.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Superb acting by the entire cast, this 1947 movie is the definitive version of this heart-warming but never saccharine story.
0670022950|5.0|This book has accumulated information, Good News information, that is hardly available anywhere else.  Its a very large book and can take a long time to read if you are thorough, and it may make you ashamed to be a member of any organized religion...but in the end you will be proud to be a human being who believes in the true teachings of Christ and others that love and peace may prevail.
0385491026|4.0|I am attending a Literature and Landscape series reading group at one of our local bookstores.  I didn't know how much I love this author.  I finished this one and the first of the Oryx and Crake trilogy.  I'm almost finished with the second of the trilogy.  Great prices!  I would never be able to collect all of these books at full price or even on Kindle.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Good
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works very well as it is described to do. I would love to see more apps being compatible as well as Android Mobile Chrome Browser having the capability to cast as well.
B00005JKCH|5.0|A good one to watch
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|this app works great. I have never had any problems playing... and It's lots of fun bowling!!!  I enjoy it.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|My best movie
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It just is not as user friendly as the &#34;Facebook full for  Amazon kindle&#34; app.  I can not zoom on the pages in this app and it is just not as easy to find my way around FB in this app.
1558908366|5.0|One of my BEST!
034580404X|1.0|what a stinking pile of wasted paper. and I can't believe it's now been optioned for a movie?<br /><br />a book about a sociopath who loves torture porn and an airheaded bimbo with no amount of self worth make for a truly epically horrible piece of cat regurgitation.<br /><br />here's a spoiler so you don't have to read it: all the characters are inspid vapid self centered morons with no redeeming value at all.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|A good DVD movie with no scratch, manual, and case in good shape just like new. Will recommend it to any buyers.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What can be said to compliment this fine story about the everyday life of an everyday small town in Nazi Germany. This book should be required reading for everyone who lives in the violent world of video games and thinks of war as glamorous.
B001E75QH0|5.0|Arrived on time and as advertised (shiny and new).  The package printing has a bit of a &#34;bootleg&#34; feel to it, but the DVDs work great!
B003B02OOG|4.0|A great bunch of short stories. All take place on familiar soil and all involve lawyers to some degree but all are splendidly unique.
006202406X|4.0|Great series over all from start to finish<br />I own all 3 and loved it<br />Can't wait for the movie I hope they keep to the storyline of the book
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Wonderfully fun to play and has enough levels to make spending the money worth it. This game can be a bit challenging with is great.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|first and formost let me say, it is over-priced but not because of the program being sub-par, it is not. The Day of The Doctor, Rocks! What doesnt Rock! is the 7 dollars or so I paid for it on instant video. I actually wanted the blu-ray of this, but that is even way more over-priced. I wont give away plot-lines here,dive in, enjoy fellow Whovians ! Def. Epic :)
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|Laboriously boring. The topic has great potential but the author continues on a very superficial level, not at all engaging or thought provoking. If this is the best of present day fiction, I might just go back to TV.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|so sad, had me missing the previous Superman-actor before the 1st-act was over. I liked Supreman Returns a lot but I kept an open-mind and gave this new one a chance. Sadly, after we leave Krypton, which wasn't bad at all,the movie immediately self-destructs after that segment. Save your time & money, this is not anywhere close to being a good superman movie.Hollywood doesnt know what to do with this franchise anymore,and it shows.
0061998494|4.0|I've enjoyed Craig Ferguson on TV, and the book is a humorous/serious autobiography. He's had an interesting life and tremendous achievement for someone who didn't even graduate from HS (I didn't know). He's very well self-educated.<br /><br />Very interesting and well written. Also, great title when you read the book.  Makes to proud to be in USA.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Love the set up of this bag.  Makes it very convenient.  High quality and very durable.  The small hard case is a huge plus for protecting fragile items.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I enjoy this game when I need to kill some time.It works well for me since its a play at your own pace game.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Katy's vocals are as always stellar.  There's a lot of hate going on for Lady GaGa's Artpop and being a person who loves both artists I will say this.  Artpop is much better because it pushes boundaries not just for the sake of being provocative pretentiously but because Artpop dares to tear down walls and break boundaries with highly charged sexual energy in a great way.  I say this because this cd while definitely excellent isn't really breaking new ground especially.  I would say there are a handful of stand out songs that are absolutely amazing and that the other songs are at the very least good.  In other words, you cannot go wrong buying this especially if you are already a Katy Perry fan, she has one of the best voices in music today.  In both cases Artpop and Prism I have no idea why male rap is thrown in; if I want a rap cd I will buy one but that is my only complaint.
B000W94FE6|5.0|Very helpful book. I have read a few books about happiness. This book fill the gap that other books do not discuss in deep. I don't agree with some reviewers who said this book is long and wordy. To me, every page and even every paragraph is adding value to the topic. Thanks Prof. Csikszentmihalyi.<br /><br />Btw, I has a habit now to only read psychology books that received good reviews and written by PHDs or Professors. The rule rarely disappointed me.
B00F1BV4F8|5.0|One of my fave movies for halloween and any time I want to just veg in front of the tv. If you like family movies but with enough action for adults you'll love this movie
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is my favorite book so far. Such a captivating story that is definitely a huge tearjerker. Very inspiring to me as a woman, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who read The Kite Runner. If you don't have this book in your possession yet, you need to purchase it right away.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This game has all my favorites in it.  Hidden objects, fun puzzles, lots of places to snoop around in. Love it!  I really appreciate the fact you do not have to backtrack huge distances where I always seem to get lost and frustrated.  It's what a hidden object game should be..fun, decent graphic, no long boring conversations.  So if you want a game that will not drive you crazy trying to figure it out, confused about what or where your supposed to do or go, try this one. After all you can try it for free!  Ok, enough of this I have to go rummage through a dead thiefs pockets!!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Season 1 is by far the best season of this show. Even though it is only 6 episodes, it sets up and develops an entire support system carried through the following seasons. I would highly recommend this to those who have not watched it yet.
B001AYENBM|5.0|What is not to like?  I love this ending it is much closer to the original book.  The Theatrical release ending was depressing,  This one is much better
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of Grisham's best books, it evolves around the untimely death of Seth Hubbard, a reclusive millionaire who, just before his death, does a handwritten will which cuts his entire family, save for his missing brother, and gives a great deal of his assets to his live-in housekeeper.  Some of the plot is obvious, you just know that his offspring will challenge the will and hire high-powered attorneys to attempt to intimidate Jake Brigance, hand-picked by Seth Hubbard to defend the handwritten will, and Lettie Lang, the  proposed benefactor.  The book really concentrates on the details yet is tough to put down after the first few pages.  I especially like the part where the missing younger brother of Seth Hubbard, Ancil Hubbard, has his deposition broadcast in the courtroom.  Don't miss this part!  There is plenty of suspense, and the book is altogether very realistic and credible.  Fans of Grisham should not miss this read.  Especially at the very attractive price for those of us who read this on their Kindles.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I ordered this for my nephew for his Christmas gift.  He loves legos and minecraft so I'm sure this will be a big hit.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|So far, i like everything but the voice!  eventually i will play with it enough to find out if i can change it =-)
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|I purchased this for my nephews Christmas present, so I don't know how much he'll like it, but my son seems to think that it is totally cool.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. My friend showed me it and I decided that since it's so awesome, I'd get it on my Kindle Fire HD. Makes waiting for my bus not seem to take so long anymore whenever I play this game.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|A game for grown ups- you just need patience:) It is great to play before going out the door to work!
1442355476|5.0|Loved the Audio version.  Very dramatic, Lots of suspense. I found it hard to drag myself away from listening to it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I chose this rating because I enjoyed all of the other books in the series. I am not a huge fan of the ending but I expected some of that type of sad depressing stuff. Overall there was enough action to keep you excited and a good bit of character development even for the end of the series. I enjoyed this book and the whole divergent series. Hopefully everyone agrees with me. (Also hoping the movie is as good as the book!!!!)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm not completely thrilled with the ending. She could have captured the love in depth quite a bit more but overall great book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved everything about this, the detail the emotion the story. It made me laugh cry and was so thrilling!
B000XUBFE2|1.0|Ridiculous. This book is entirely too long, disjointed and contains way too many plot lines without really developing any of the characters. It's set from the point of view of Death who is extremely busy in Europe during WWII, obviously, but for some reason he tells the story of this unremarkable girl. Her story isn't special and I find it hard to believe Death would take an interest in someone so mundane. I struggled through finishing this book. I don't recommend it.
0786958731|5.0|My husband loves this game!<br />It was the ultimate Christmas surprise as we have read all of the Drizzt series together.<br />Game play is easy and this comes with all you need.<br />Price was a little high, but where are you going to find it cheaper?
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|What is there to say about this movie and particularly this<br />version ???<br />Ah....Maybe that made me love Matthew Macfadyen even more than ever before.<br />Well, this is a excellent version of this history, great scenario, great performance<br />by ALL actors.Very well produced and directed !<br />I want to thank this vendor for the fast delivery.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Big Bang continues to stay fresh!  They have managed to add characters and continue to make the originals more and more interesting.  A good clean comedy.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN, PLOTTED,DIRECTED AND VERY WELL ACTED BY ALL CAST. EVERY SEASON GETS BETTER<br />AND BETTER. I BOUGHT ALL SEASONS AVAILABLE  (INCLUDING SEASON 4 BEFORE THE TV SHOWING OF 4 IS OVER,<br />AND ALTHOUGH I'VE ALREADY SAW IT ALL FROM THE NEW RELEASE OF S4, I WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN) !<br /><br />VERY ADDICTING !  CAN'T BARELY WAIT FOR SEASON  5  !!!!!!!
B008NABUU8|5.0|The game is really fun because if your bridge isn't that strong then you can use cars. If it's stable then you can use a truck and get extra points. Best app ever. P.S. you have a budget which is usually pretty big. The tools you have are cinder-block wood cable and the metal stuff. P.P.S. sometimes certain tools you can't use but you can ALWAYS use wood.
0316074314|3.0|it was easy to put down and not pick back up for a week.  Enjoyed the history of an era I knew little about.  Must say the ending was very disappointing as well as confusing it felt rushed.  Author obviously did a lot of research but I was disappointed after all the hype on the news programs, book award etc.
B000F8O35U|4.0|The movie is just what I expected.  good quality and price was resonable.  I happy with this purchase for my daughter.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander's credentials make this experience credible and compelling. His scientific approach and analysis goes beyond sentiment and provides convincing proof of heaven.
B0026PW67W|5.0|I bought this map for my little sister for her birthday party for her friends/guest to sign. We had 40+ people and there is still room. It is huge, well detailed and worth the money!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|You should be able to log on to Facebook without WiFi...but no u have to have stupid WiFi for it to work.
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|A totally awesome prequel to the original and just as funny for adults or kids.<br /><br />More words required - It is a DVD and comes in a DVD case.
B00594XOZU|5.0|The new update is...... way better than the first one. Way better than text now and text plus if u don't have instagram  use this but instagram is better even though I don't have it. You can send and do awesome stuff on the update! I LOVE THE APP!!!!<br /><br />  GET IT!!!!!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|A lot of fun and truly addictive! Great graphics for a kindle game.  Look forward to playing  everyday.  Not too gory or disgusting for smaller children either.
0345548981|4.0|It's a great book  for people who are looking for something new and healthy. The experience of Novak is remarkable and the way he's taken control of his diet is outstanding.
B00G922EA2|4.0|Quite a few different style of games so it was fun. Both of my kids, 10 and 12, enjoyed it as well.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy keeping up with family and friends, especially those out of state. I like being able to get pictures off Facebook saving family and friends time and money in sending them.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|♡I love this game so much. It's so creative. It's hard, yet very simple if you take your time. Can't recommend it enough.
0375869026|4.0|Wonder by R.J. Palacio<br /><br />I love this book because it's a book that shows us that we shouldn't judge people by their outwardly appearances, and that we're all unique in our own way and that's okay because that's what makes each of us special.
B00E8KC5HY|5.0|It's different to any St Matthew I've ever heard or sung in, BUT, I LIKE IT!! The emotional intensity is just tremendous and the research and dedication backing up the conception of this interpretation is very solid. Over all, as other reviews have said, the bar has been raised ever higher for the standard of both performance and recording of Bach's &#34;Great Passion&#34;, the St. Matthew.
B008602KQI|2.0|What a bunch of hooey. Deep meaning? HELLO!!! Changing rules in the middle of the game, creating creatures at will, what a waste of time.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I am so happy it is on the Amazon store! I have been waiting for this for a while now, and now it's hear!!!!
B00A5IXYR8|4.0|Who hasn't pined after the girl next door, had awkward dinners with the in-laws, accidentally shot some sperm at the wall, been driven nuts when a baby wails nonstop, observed ugliness in their neighborhood, felt like their brain is disintegrating.  Sounds familiar, but Lynch does make it very interesting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited for what seemed like a lifetime to get CCS on my kindle and now....there's no separating us!  No really, the old man is complaining...but we don't care.  this is the best game ever!
B000FBJAOG|2.0|Stick with World War Z, this book is lame. I skimmed through a great deal if it- this book does not take place in the WWZ world.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Simply put get it, download it! I don't review that much things unless is really worth (good or bad). Bloons TD5 is a Tower Defense game, I don't like TD but this game is TOO AWESOME! Is super entertaining!! Super easy to learn, no learning curve (you just need to read what the upgrades does to the towers and that's it).<br /><br />The game is very well done, the attention to details are great, music is the same but is likeable goes with the game.  I have put over 5-6 hours in a 24 hour period in my cell phone and I don't play on my cell that much. Please do yourself a favor a GET IT! And enjoy the game.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love the game! A favorite with the family.  I do wish that you could put the dinosaurs in the ice world<br />.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|This movie is not new to me which is why I ordered it. It has a great cast, beautiful scenery, and a devilish plot that only Agatha Christie can conjure. If you love classic whodunit movies, add this to your list.
B00E32507O|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time! Sweet and poignant. Well written with wonderful characters! Even though it deals with serious topics like the activities of wartime Germany, it doesn't dwell on the dark and brings light to everyone.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Good movie. A little over the top but then again that's Hollywood. Reminded me a little of 2012 with the crazy non-stop action and close calls.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This a great ap to learn a language on a portable device.  I like the repetition,  it really helps with memory issues for us older students.  A little more explanation of the grammar would be helpful.
B00FOJ0ROQ|1.0|That's a little overpriced. Especially considering you can get the collection that comes with wolverines claw things for cheaper than this. Best Buy has this exact collection for $45.
B00GNL251C|1.0|Not at all what I expected, movie was a letdown. Moving headed in wrong direction. Should have concentrated more on fighting
B00E9A656K|3.0|This is a great game but u should be able to sell cars thank you please put selling cars on next update.
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|An all time favourite, not as know as The Wall or Dark Side of the Moon... even tho echoes is a classic, the other songs are definitely worth it, every day ! Saint Tropez, chilliest song of all times...
0810983915|5.0|It came in great condition! The only thing that was wrong the box was open when I got it. Cant control everything though once it leaves your hands.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|WALL Street will be the cause of our downfall. I read this twice and will some day read it again.

B008JFURII|3.0|&#34;Red 1&#34; was OK. This one was a bit too cutesy for me.<br /><br />Every time something happens, you sort of know were it is going.<br /><br />It was OK to watch, but I am glad I didn't go to the theater to see it.<br /><br />I think &#34;Red&#34; has run its course.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is an engrossing second installment of the Follett trilogy.  Over 800 pages and I was sorry to have it end. This follows the second generation of American, British and Russian families through the 1930's and WW II.  The characters are richly portrayed, and the depiction of life in wartime is vivid.  I especially liked reading this on my kindle app on my ipad, as I could easily link to google names and events that are part of the story.  Just a fantastic read.  Wish I could pick up the third book today!
0316010669|1.0|Gladwell must have laughed all the way to the bank on this one. As one reviewer said, who inexplicably gave it 5 stars, &#34;there are lots of interesting examples, but none of them relate to the theme.&#34;  He is a compelling writer, but either a con, or not very bright. He posits a theme or vague idea that you  can learn to make the right snap decision within 2 seconds. He then pretends that he will teach you how over the course of the the book. He then takes you through &#34;examples&#34; that in no way prove his nebulous theory. And some of them are interesting I must admit. But by the end it is utterly muddled and you begin to ask yourself what is the point.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|even the free version is really cute and the kids enjoy it. i purchased the full version since my kids enjoy the free version so much. fun and worth it
014241543X|4.0|If I Stay is a heart wrenching story about a young girl who has to make the hardest decision she could ever face, if she wants to live or die. The plot isn’t extremely complicated. There was a car accident that killed Mia’s parents and put both Mia and her younger brother in the hospital in critical condition. Mia watches from outside of her body the goings on after the accident for a day, trying to decide if she wants to continue living or if she wants to die.<br /><br />I think this is a great story for a few reasons. First off, you have a teenager who is for the most part, really relatable. If you take away the being in a coma part, Mia is facing issues that every day teenagers have to face. She has a boyfriend who she is worried about her future with because they want to do different things in life, she has to figure out what she wants to pursue after high school, she has issues with family and school and friends.<br /><br />Although being in a coma and trying to decide if you want to live or die is probably not something most people would say that they have experienced, there are a lot of teenagers that can relate to wanting to be able to choose that. This forces you to look at why you should be thankful to be alive. Even if it seems like you have lost everything, even you whole family, there are still reasons that you should continue living. I think that is a great message for teenagers and people of all ages really. You can’t just give up on life because things are hard.<br /><br />I found myself getting frustrated at times with Mia. She has all of these people rooting for her to wake up from her coma and she wants to take the easy way out and just die. Although it is a sad story, it is also a story about love, friendship and family. Just because someone is not related to you by blood, which does not mean that they aren’t part of your family. That’s one of my favorite themes from the book.<br /><br />Overall, this story is a good read that will leave you teary eyed but also feeling kind of warm and fuzzy inside. It seems like love and music can make life better, according to the story. It is really character driven and not plot driven, as I stated, the plot is simple and it is more about just answering the question, should I live or die?
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I didn't want to start playing another game, but I couldn't resist this one.  It's got a great storyline and the tasks can be completed with a little patience (or some money.)  My absolute favorite thing, though,  is the graphics!  So colorful and detailed!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time. Definitely worth the purchase. I kept it for myself but I know a lot of my friends were jealous so I'd consider giving it as a gift in the future.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Pendergast and his companions never lose my interest, respect or my love of their unique take on humanity.  By living their own lives and how they view others.
0553801473|5.0|What's not to love about Game of Thrones?  Great books!  I just hope the remaining books are written before the author croaks.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|I love those Minon's, could not wait any longer.  No DVD available so the best way is to download from Amazon.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys are AWSOME!  Beautiful renditions of classic Christmas songs...A MUST HAVE for anyone who has a Christmas CD collection!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This story can be read by middle school students, especially while instruction about WWlll is happening. And adults read about a young girl struggling to survive in a town not far from one of the &#34;camps,&#34;
B00ECUARO8|5.0|A little slow but then it picks up. I really enjoyed this movie. It really told a great story and then to find out it was true.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|its not my Internet so it has to be candy crush , but I like the game so I don't know what's wrong with it
B00C3TCBFS|5.0|This is how to make a cover album. Take a mediocre song, then grind it up with some Goth Metal style. Simply brilliant and a definite must buy. Before discovering this, I'd not even heard of most of the original versions. Then after listening to this and comparing it to the originals, it made sense why I never listened to the original versions in the first place - they were mediocre to meh.<br />Bottom line - this is one of the few albums that I can listen from the first to the last track over and over again!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Fantastic movie.  I knew the ending and I was still on the edge of my seat as it was happening.  Bravo for Canada as well!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really loved the first two books, this book was not as good. It was slightly confusing. But if you already read the first two this book does have many surprises that you would want to know. Also this is extremely sad. And when I finished I felt died inside. So it's sad but good.
1476727651|5.0|If a book cannot hold my attention I'm done. My mind wanders easily. This book grabbed me and held me for the week it took to read. This book is less of a sequel than it is the continuation of Dan Torrance's life decades later.  If you're expecting scary hotel stuff this is not what you'll get. \\"Doctor Sleep\\" only has minimal in common with \\"The Shining.\\" and It's more of an edge of your seat story than a scary story.  Although one should read the original book or watch the movie with the understanding Dick Hallorann does NOT die like in the movie. This work stands on its own.  I didn't want to like the True Knots. An evil bunch of steam sucking, filthy rich gypsy monsters. But they made for some really hateful villains. Spoiler alert.... I was thrilled to read a Stephen King Novel that has a happy ending as so many don't.  So thank you Stephen King for grabbing my wandering mind and holding it captive while I plowed though this book very quickly!
B000002JBG|5.0|The CD came awesome I needed to buy the space jam song for a dance and It was totally worth buying the cd instead of the song.
B00000GAIW|5.0|just one of the most sem,inal  rock albums of all time---amazing talent from ian andersen, the flute, acoustic guitar and keybosards all amazing, tyhe other 3 guys as well.  saw them in '72, had great seats, and it was just indescribable.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|At first I only gave this one star because after paying for it the program didn't download. Then I discovered I had initially downloaded it to my Nexus rather than my phone.  Apparently you have to pay separately for each device even though you are the only person using the devices and can only use one at a time.  Oh well. .. In any event it seems to work on the Nexus.  I would give it 4 or 5 stars if I could use it on both devices.
0670026182|5.0|I'm not familiar with food blogs.  What caught my eye was the photography and layout of the book.  Then I read it - and wanted to try more than half of the recipes!  Sure, I probably have at least 10 different recipes for friands, crepes, muffins,  and fish pie, but Katie's seems to have that \\"extra\\" in taste - and even to impress.  Edgier than anything from Martha Stewart or the Barefoot Contessa.  And without the extra sugar and fat, which is a welcomed break for the American palate.  I'm glad that I purchased this cookbook - it is the only one I have chosen for my collection from blogsites.  A great cookbook to give to highschool and college graduates who enjoy eating good food!  - Even a fun wedding shower or 40th birthday gift.
B009A87X80|5.0|I was fortunate to have seen Eva perform at a small club in Wash, D.C. in the early 90's.  Her voice was warm, tender, and absolutely mesmerizing.  Every song that memorable night Eva delivered with an intimacy that made you feel the song was only for you.  It was a sad day when I learned of Eva's demise.  That night in D.C. was magical and it ranks with the most memorable in-person concerts I attended by Nina Simone, Barbara Streisand, and Sara K.  I am so happy to see this CD.  Her voice and music are  for the ages and hopefully, even in death, her fans will increase and recognize a truly talented, warm, and loving person that was Eva Cassidy. You were the &#34;Song Bird,&#34; Eva.
B003U69IX6|1.0|Awful, just awful.  As a fan of the books I wanted to like it, but ugh, so so bad!  They changed WAY too much.  My husband watched it too...he's Greek, and had to study mythology growing up.  He hated it...everything he complained about were things that they added in (ie: wasn't in the book) or had neglected to include from the book.  I look forward to him reading the books to our boys, because I think it's a fun modern twist on the classic mythology...but this movie adaptation is the worst movie adaptation I've ever seen!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love that I can wake to my meditation music and that the alarm starts quiet and gets progressively louder. I can set multiple alarms for my usual work schedule.
B00G6MW68K|5.0|The DVD(blue ray) was really clear and it was just a great concert! It also came with a cd of all the songs, and auto-rip for the cd and was just  a great deal for the price!!!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!  A Great addition to our Christmas music collection!  Highly recommend you hurray up an get your copy!
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I'm sorry, P.D. James, but I just didn't think this was a very good novel and certainly not  when compared to Jane Austen.  I usually do like your books--just not this one.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|I originally had a problem with this game when I first installed it. It kept freezing. But then I restarted my phone after several frustrating attempts at playing, and it worked perfectly. Very rarely after that would it freeze but that did not detract from the value of the game in my opinion.<br /><br />This is at once an intriguing, rewarding, and entertaining game that I could literally sit in my bed for hours watching Star Trek on one screen and this game on another.<br /><br />There are some balance issues, and there's plenty of room for improvement and expansion on many of the items already implemented, but it seems that the developers are currently working on a plan to do just that. I for one I am very excited to see what they do with it next.<br /><br />Absolutely worth the money!
0740748475|5.0|So excited to have this in our house! Just bought it for my husband, 2nd year anniversary. He saw it in his married brothers' houses when he was younger and always thought about getting the complete set for his own home one day. Well he never got around to it so I decided to get it for him. Calvin & Hobbes was part of both our childhoods, and we are thrilled to have our very own set.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could never fathom how much I would get into this book! Took me less than 3 days to finish! I could not put it down and when I did it was extremely difficult! But if you are expecting the movie to follow the book you will be extremely disappointed because the book is a million times better!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it occupies the mind. I would like it even better if I could play it again tonight. You seem to have taken it away.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome game. My family love it we all have it on our phones and kindle lol<br />Love it great job inventing this one.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is THE gift for Christmas 2013!  Totally bringing joy to my daily commute. I keep thinking of someone else who needs this musical marvel.  Buy it now and send it early so they listen all month!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|love it it is one of the best games i have ever played. love the 2d. way better than minecraft.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Highly addictive!!  Love playing even when I get frustrated. I love the challenge of clearing each level and playing with friends!
B00EVCD9HY|4.0|Her music is eclectic and modern at the same time. If you want a taste of the past with the sounds of an artistic modern female, then this is the album for you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is an interesting SciFi book in that the main concepts in in could certainly happen. I would not let a young child read this. I feel there is much more in it for adults than kids. Will be interesting to see what the author comes up with next.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I love Alicia Keys ever since her first album. She is very talented and you can feel the emotion and thoughts that ride her words. If you loved any of her albums then you will love this one.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I love young romance novels and normally I read supernatural fantasy but I do occasionally read other types of novels. I had heard from so many people, &#34;Oh my god! you have to read fifty shades of Grey!&#34; and after about 10 people suggesting it I decided to read it. I purchased it at Wal-mart for $11.00 and thought this better be worth it. I read about 16 pages and already could tell this book was junk. I pressed on and read more....&#34;Oh Christian Grey I want to be you sex slave....yes, I will sign your stupid contract....i am a innocent little girl who loves to do naughty things....blah blah blah. The sex was getting boring. When you read a book you want the characters to build up to the moment they are doing the dirty not on every single page. It makes the book predictable and silly. I literally made myself read to page 45, lol, and I could not take it anymore. I sold the book in a yard sale. DO NOT WASTE YOUR $!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|disappointing in that it can become quite costly after receiving it free ... game is fun until you need to keep refreshing at different levels
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I really like Daria and when i saw the complete set on Amazon I was thrilled. Maybe make a new version of it?!!!! that would be great!
006202406X|3.0|I'm so sorry to say this, but it is what it is... Just ok... And as it is, it was all right in the begining, horrible in the middle, and it got a lot better towards the end. Thankfully! Honest to God, there was a point there I almost stopped reading. I didn't, and I'm glad, since the end was what I thought it should be (don't worry, no spoilers) But still, I was sorry for the whole thing.<br /><br />Just so we're clear, I LOVED the first two, couldn't wait for the finale. And I could argue that this was the problem: too long had past between the second and the last books, my expectations were way high, I had forgoten Roths writing style, forgoten a little of the plot. I had to re-read a lot of the first two books before starting this one, and also read the first of the Tobias Stories, to get in the mood. But I thought it was worth it then.<br /><br />So I began reading the book, which starts slow and that's ok. It was understandable, since she was building a whole new world. But then all the in-your-face hard-ass wonderful characters that I fell in love with started, in my opinion, going completely out of character - so to speak. They explained - instead of showed with action - every single feeling they have had so far. And they explained it with therapist-like understanding of their psyque, giving a self-important life lesson at every page. Suddenly I wasn't allowed to comprehend anything for myself, everything was chewed down for me. And I swallowed it with a good dose of self-pitty that came from almost every character. I felt stupid through this whole process and that's when, around chapter 20, I almost quit reading the book.<br /><br />But I didn't, and I'm glad, since, shotly after, the action portion of the book began and it got a lot better. Like I said, the ending was how I thought it should have been and at least I wasn't completely frustrated with it. I was actually satisfied at the end.<br /><br />So I guess the point of this review is: don't get your hopes up. I did and it didn't help me much. But it is still worth reading if you have read the first two.
B002XXUWMI|5.0|Loved it. Was surprised at how good this film was and that I hadn't already seen or heard of it (hubby picked it out as he has seen it).
B00024I31C|4.0|Received this CD promptly as promised but the plastic jewell case was damaged internally and the CD will not stay locked in place.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy setup, easy to use. Device looks great, and packaging for the device itself was top notch. I will SO be getting another for my next tv.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Amazon is one of the easiest sites I have ever used for purchasing, definitely user friendly.  The quality of everything I've purchased off of the Amazon site has been very good.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Not bad- Decent superhero movie. Had some moments where the plot fell through, but it lived up to what I was expecting. Would watch again.
B001BANK32|5.0|I think this is one of the best books King ever wrote. I actually read this book when it first came out in print and have re-read it many times. Downloaded a copy because downloaded books are handier than the paper copies
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Bookalicious discussion is going to be quite the frenzied event -So much to talk about.  Great stories...<br />Highly recommended...  Wish this was made in amino-series.
B0095G5AFU|3.0|It seems to be a well designed app but I don't understand why anyone would still use this kind of note taking system. With EverNote, Google Drive, Google Keep, or any of the other cloud based note taking apps available, you can access your notes from any device, have reliable backup, control exactly who can see them, share with others selectively, not have to export and import when you upgrade devices, not have admob and adsense in your notes app, and access your notes instantly from your computer where you can do more with them. Why would anyone use such an old school limited note system when newer technology has made it essentially obsolete?<br /><br />One reviewer noted that after a crash she lost all her notes and the developer wouldn't even respond to her questions. Why take that risk with your work, notes, thoughts, etc? Just go with a cloud based notes app like Google Drive, EverNote, Google Keep, or the others and you'll be much happier with the features, anywhere access, and backup.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I enjoy this mouse a lot. For the price, everything was met in standards, quality, and reliability. The programmable buttons are very nice, but I was quite leery about the side buttons, yet they are actually a nice feature; I use VOIP's very often when I game, and programming the middle side button to a preset key is a really awesome feature, and also easy to use/click while playing a WASD style game, or a different one like League of Legends. Also, I enjoy the speed and accuracy of the mouse, even though I don't use any of the preset DPI settings - they are WAY to fast for me to use in my games I play, so I can only imagine someone who loves uber fast control, would love these settings. My only downside is that you can only change the 'Anker' symbol where your palm rests on the mouse, still though, it is a cool feature to have - 5 stars if I could altar the color of the wheel and lights for the DPI setting. Thanks Anker, timely delivery and quality mouse.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|You will not be sorry you watched this film.  I have always been an admirer of Dr Grandin. She has accomplished so much. I have watched this movie 3 times and don't get tired of it.<br /><br />That says a lot being that I am the kind of person who NEVER watches anything twice, even sit-coms.<br /><br />Even if you don't have a person in your life suffering from autism it is just an interesting true life story about someone who &#34;took the bull by the horns&#34; and made something of herself.  And thank God she did as she has helped the cattle industry be more humane to the animals who end up on our tables every day.
0761169431|5.0|I can't wait to give this book to my husband for Christmas!  I might even take a stab at one or two myself.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Had this game on my iPad.  Bought it for my Kindle.  Works well.  Appears to have more levels than my old game had.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My family loves this game and I told myself never would I let a game get to me so... But one day I said to myself let's see what the big deal is about this game. It has been a few weeks now since I started playing and I find myself looking forward to play on breaks, lunch time, and even before I fall asleep. The feeling of achieving a level is quite exhilarating that you want to do it again with the next level. It can also be very frustrating when you cannot pass a level too but that is why it can be so addicting because you just want to pass and achieve that level already not knowing that there are hundreds of levels with this game. Whoever created this game knew how entertaining this game would be to people.Thank you.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Unexpected end for the show- unusual role for Denzel -  but given the development of the story line it was necessary to have him meet the consequences of his choices..
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|Great movie, great features, horrible price. I was angry that I paid over a hundred dollars for this and a it was rereleased on Blu Ray and DVD a few months later for thirty bucks.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I'm play this game on a Nexus 4 and this works great, cards look wonderful, no ads, no personal informations required, no lag. I seriously can't understand all the people downvoting this app 'cause of inconsistent problems.
B00CE03UOC|1.0|could not get download to work no help found can't say how game works not sure what else too get it to work
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is fairly entertaining, however, it is constantly asking you to pay money or invite friends so you can't just play for enjoyment.
0142410314|3.0|The audio-book did not correlate to the book, so it was of little to use to us. My assumption is that this is more for pure listening vs. following along.
B000000WI6|5.0|This is my favorite album by Johhny and one of my favorite all time albums by anyone. Give it a shot!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Like most deftones albums, I had to listen to this several times before I really started to like every song. I am completely in love with this album now, and my only problem is that I'm scared I'm going to over-listen to it...that's probably not possible though.
B00004W4UB|5.0|John Malkovich is outstanding in his portrayal of both the evil and good Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.  Julia Roberts and Glenn Close were  excellent as the maid and the Madam respectively.  The story was comfortable to watch because it was not only a very good adaptation of the story but so overboard with gore that it was gruesome.  The special effects of the physical change was outstanding. I looked for two years for this DVD because I could not remember the name (im old) but no other version of it would do because it is the absolute best version of the story.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It might be good. I think it's cool. I was told it was cool. So it might be. Have something.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Purchased this movie for my father for Christmas because he is big into action and thriller movies and I really liked this one!  The DVD arrived in great condition.
B00EY7LT9Q|2.0|This series has been getting better, but through nine episodes, it's just...dour. It's been underwhelming from the word go and it's difficult to see them squandering potential on such a consistent basis.
B008JFURII|5.0|The movie arrived in good condition!  This is a great movie and I hope they will make a third installment.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was literally up all night reading! And it's the third time I've read it.  I would recommend it to anyone, obviously starting with the first book.
B00C81LYH2|3.0|My order did arrive much faster than I anticipated. However the Barbie's hair does not look good at all. It's not styled like the photo of her in the box I saw here or the ones I saw at walmart and didnt buy since she was cheaper on amazon. If you're a collector who leaves the doll in the box, you may want to buy in person to be sure you get a good one.
1401323820|5.0|Just what you would expect from a castle book full of pasion and excitement attention to detail is not forgotten I likeed the first one so much I orderd the rest
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It has many options for drawing and editing. By far my favorite. I've been drawing nonstop for the past few days. It kind of reminds me of instagram.
B00003CXB2|1.0|This film would not play. A message came up on my TV &#34;check regional code&#34;. I don't know what this means and returned the DVD on 29th November. I am very disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minions is awesome and I love the minions so hilarious just wish there was no lag when your doing really good!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm not a big game player but this game is right up my alley. Just like the crimson room that I played like 10 years ago.. love it!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This works great. Automatically detects when new installs can be moved to the SD card and it keeps memory free by reminding you to clear the cache. All that and free too. Perfect Product.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book in the world. I know you took a long time on this book I think Katniss and peeta were great characters for the stor
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I purchased up to $12 worth and when I had to reset my S4 I lost all of the viruses I purchased. Don't bother with customer service; wait! What service?? You've been warn!
B006O5XYWG|5.0|I didn't see this film when it came out in theaters, and I had really wanted to see it. So when it was offered in Amazon I was thrilled. I hoped I would not be disappointed. I wasn't.<br /><br />This is a prequel to the original Planet of the Apes done way back in 1968. It tells how the decline and devolution of humankind came to be. In trying to improve human lives, apes were experimented on and things went terribly wrong; or right; depending on how you look at it.<br /><br />The CGI is the best ever; especially with the close ups of the apes. I will say that in the ape crowd scenes the apes moved much like the crowd scenes in video games; Identical to each other although slightly out of sinc.<br /><br />The facial expressions on Cesar were superb and very human, but not too human. I could tell, though that Cesar, the hero of the movie looked very much like the Gulum around the eyes. In other scenes he resembled the Hulk. I didn't check which studio created these effects but I am guessing they are the same one.<br /><br />The humans were not all the stereotypical comic bad guys. They had different motives, even though they all amounted to the same mistreatment of intelligent animals. Even Cesar's &#34;adopted father&#34; treated him like a pet.<br /><br />Look for hints and links to the original movie such as famous lines and familiar names. Just showing how history repeats itself and turn about is fair play.<br /><br />I rooted for the apes.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Truthfully, it paled in comparison to The Shining and didn't really grab my attention. I did like the characters a lot, I just felt the story itself was dull
B00FCAJZTK|5.0|First of all, the tape hiss is exciting. It just makes it all more original - as in the days when musicians actually had to know to play music...<br />It starts of like a camp fire improvisation. Then it gets actually jazzy, even funky. Keith takes time to explore material, thoughts, emotions, with no great hurry. He just goes on and enjoys himself. Plenty of errors in the playing do not limit listening pleasure. It's just being played live! Wow!<br />His guitar is not exactly technically outstanding, but this thing sings!<br />This record does not actually swing. For many, it may be a &#34;difficult&#34; disc. It is rather an introspective exercise of a great musician who may have been on the sea like Ulysses to become better known to himself. Sometime he sounds like The Doors, sometimes like a lovely Lou Reed (we all wish him the best in the other world). The musicality of the man is impressive.<br />I invite, if you are a music lover, to enjoy the ride into a time long passed and into the mind of a man you has touched the imagination and senses of generations - I got to know this guy from my father playing his LPs on Sunday mornings; now my daughters carry him on their iWhatevers.<br />It's just great, unambitious music to enjoy. Do so!
B00009XITP|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Before she got crazy. This is pretty much a fairy tale story but hey, we could use one every now and then.
B004SIP7XK|5.0|God damn you Ben Affleck for being such and amazing director... A truly emotional, and intense thriller. I am pretty disappointed Casey Affleck didn't get an Academy Award for his amazing performance in this movie. You can tell Ben wrote the role for his little brother.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I had NO idea how much I'd LOVE the Kindle app! Whether I'm reading from my tablet or phone, my books go with me wherever I go. Stuck somewhere unexpectedly? Who cares! I've got books to read! So convenient and works like a dream. What's not to love?!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have not finished the book...but, typical of Grisham, I have to find time to finish, and I pick up my Kindle every chance I get.  Just great!  I am continually amazed that I can't wait to read reams about court room procedures.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I give this story points for originality, although it does get awfully repetitive at points. But, considering the main character is suffering from a mental issue, it kind of fits the character. I have not seen the movie yet, so I spent the first several chapters wondering how in the world it could translate to the big screen. In any case, I will get the movie now just to see how they interpret the story. There were a couple of surprise twists to this story as well. If you like something different, you'll like this book.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Like all of Mr. Baldacci's books, this latest was a great read.  I enjoyed the main characters and hope to find them in future novels.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Handiest little app in the world. I keep running lists in different colors on my phone. I can even pin them to my status bar or set them to notify me at a convenient time. Best thing I use it for is a running grocery store list. I can edit it on the go using the keyboard or voice and I use it ALL the time!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter said this game is so much fun, so I went ahead and tried it to see why she wouldn't stop talking about it and the game really is amazing and amusing.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game. Their is never ending things to do and explore. It keeps me entertained for hours on out. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good endless game to play.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I have 3 reactions to this book.<br /><br />First, it badly needs an editor.  It would have been a much better book if 250-300 pages had been cut from it. It's just plain unwieldy.<br /><br />Second, it reminds me of Fielding's \\"Tom Jones.\\" There's a story in there, and it's a good one, but you have to suffer through a lot of long passages of philosophical posturing stuck in the middle of the story plot.<br /><br />Third, people should write about things they know about. As a New Yorker, I could identify with her descriptions of one slice of City life. Although I know nothing about Las Vegas,  her descriptions of it were believable. The descriptions of the crimes carried out by professional gangsters were absolutely cartoonish. They were not in the least bit believable. I  know almost nothing about that world--and it's clear the author knows even less.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the NYC part came first, followed by the Vegas part,then more NYC, and then the least interesting, least believable part. At page 700, I almost stopped reading--it was just plain bad.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addicting game but fun. Hint: don't spend you Dozer Dollars to buy the prize baskets. Save them to upgrade your prize levels. It is slow going at first but eventually as you level up your prizes and complete the puzzles you will be on a roll. Need extra coins, click the free coins and what I did was to downloaded games to get coins. You usually only have to get to level 3 or so to get the coins. I probably have gotten over 1000 free coins since playing the game.
1476747016|5.0|This book is beyond adorable. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face. The illustrations are quirky. My girlfriend loves it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Awesome (and very addicting game)! You can even change the background- now, if only you could change the cards.. but yes, very addicting. And it pauses when you exit out. Very convenient. So yeah, you should get this.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|What's to say? Either you're an Enya fan, or you're not. I am, and this is beautiful.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Fantastic app, glad it finally made it to Amazon.... well worth the effort for the extras. It suffers from a little slowdown, but nothing serious.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This movie is very touching, and has a lot of charm to it.  The characters are both true to themselves and able to grow and develop, and the initial sequence with Carl and Ellie is almost like a second movie within Up.  There's a lot of good themes here too, whether you're 9 or 90, highlighting the value and importance of friendship and loyalty.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Omg my child and nephew love this movie! there are so many beautiful vivid scenes. And the sloth is hilarious. Duh-duh-duhhhhh<br />makes me laugh everytime. This is a beautiful movie and is a great present for any young child.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|This was a low cost solution with high quality. Not much more to say other than this is a great deal!
1476729085|5.0|Bravo!  Graeme Simsion, for this gem of a book.  Pitch perfect writing, funny, whimsical, poignant and insightful.  Don Tillman, Professor of Genetics, diagnosed with many social disorders including Asperger's, in his search for a suitable mate, takes us on a delightful journey.  I closed the book thinking I love Don Tillman and Rosie and I love Graeme Simsion for lifting the veil on labels for people.  Love knows nothing of labels and always finds a way!
B003G4W49C|3.0|Very tedious after the first 80 pages or so. It read like a marathon of  obscurity and conceptually a non starter. Very disappointed
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great book, the love-story is great, I couldn't put it down! I recommend it! It was heartbreaking but great, I hadn't cried reading a book in a long time.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is one of the BEST GAMES I`'ve ever played including games on consoles it`s just an amazing game full stop.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a wonderful virtual pet app for when you get bored or to waste time when you are waiting
0385493800|5.0|This book arrived in perfect condition.  It is a hard back with the sleeve cover, which was also in great shape.  I've just started reading it so I'll update when I get finished reading.
1742204147|4.0|Lonely Planet does a good job with their guidebooks. They give you a lot of information, and do not skimp on pictures or descriptions. Of necessity, they cannot be complete, and have to skimp on some things. But it's helpful to have one place to look to get information on a planned trip than to have to search all over the Internet.<br /><br />That said, guidebooks quickly get dated and often are too broad and general to give you enough specifics on a particular place to go. For example, we took a recent trip to Kyushu in Japan, and went to five cities -- Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Nagasaki. The entries on those cities in this guidebook were just a few pages each. When we tried to find hotels or restaurants based on the guidebook, we found the entries unhelpful, either because they were outdated or they were inaccurate.<br /><br />The guidebook did better in describing sights to see and other general information. All in all, I like this guidebook, even though I found it wanting in some respects.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|If it did not have the doubling & undo tab on the right side of the board I would have given it 5 stars !

B00881VLCE|4.0|Puzzles are great and really beautiful! However, sometimes download speed can be slow.<br />Aside from that though the game is excellent.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Fabulous book! I found this book and author because I had just read &#34;The Light Between Oceans&#34; and Amazon recommended this book. I could not put it down. It also mostly ket me guessing and after the guessing was no longer necessary, it kept me thinking, &#34;What would I do in the same situation?&#34; I asked my husband and we both decided, we would do nothing; sit on it, swallow it and stuff a sock in it. I can't wait to read more of her books.<br /><br />I feel like I found a gem!

B00B1EEKM8|5.0|My son loves this movie and I love the fact I can download it to my ipad with this included disk.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Good book enjoyed reading it then she sold out and made a junk movie. How can a writer put all that time into a book writing it the way they envisioned in their head. Then let Hollywood buy them off and hack the whole story to pieces. Easy they have no morals and are a sell out. This is the last thing I'll read of hers to bad she had talent and books flowed. But she made enough cash for selling out that she doesn't need my money anymore.
B00BAXFAJC|2.0|Looking for a long, drawn-out 19th century saga that mimics the many regrettable novels of that time?  Maybe not.<br /><br />The setting is a small gold rush town in New Zealand.  The only likable character appears near the end to wrap things up.  Before that, there are 500 pages about 12 characters and a myriad of settings which vaguely relate to the signs of the zodiac.  Their every thought, how they dressed, what they said (at length) and what setting they are in are described in exhausting detail.<br /><br />The plot is convoluted and told from all the characters' points of view.  The mystery is clever, but after a while the reader doesn't care anymore whether it's solved. This book is interesting only in that it describes life at that time in a place that's not often a topic of fiction.
B008I34ZQG|5.0|It was my initiation into Zappas universe - and even at this early point in my personal timeline FZ made my life complete, cause he has helped me to reveal my intellectual inner self (but I learned this decades later), although I was fourteen: my friend andy told me in early 1980: hey, you Beatles-and-Neil-Diamond-hearing jerk, try this from my oldest brother - and lets see, if you gonna start voming right away - I did not, but was strucked by Zappa and am until today.  I was unable to hear any other pop music 'til '91, diving totally into the Glenn Gould, LvB etc. -thing then for another 13 years.  And it brings tears to my eyes: Frank is dead, no doubt, and today is December, 4, 2013 - 20 years after. but anyway. - it's \\"rat tomago\\", which makes sheik yerbouti a five star item, but not only rat tomago. the whole album ist fantastic and, sorry for the \\"diploma jargon\\": dense, consistent, kind-a-perfect-woven, funny, brilliant, thrilling, compelling. But back to rat tomago: it tells you any answer to the really big questions in life: what is the reason of the universe? why i am here? where do i go to, when i'm not here anymore?  why there isn't nothing instead of something? I love the man, he made my life complete and was my guard ever since the magic day way back into early 1980. Adore you Frank, see you, Frank. Thanks for all.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is perfect. It found all my hidden junk, useless folders and obsolete apks. I finally found and was able to uninstall all the old unused apps hiding in Kindle FreeTime that was hogging my storage space.
B00E9E4EC8|3.0|If you like bluegrass which I do, this was an excellent bluegrass cd. However, I bought it for my hubby who likes Allen Jackson as a country western artist. Although I was impressed and enjoyed my hubby was looking for something more country & western.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a very fitting conclusion to the story of Danny Torrance.  Loved the setting, the new characters, and the story.  I even liked Rose.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|An excellent read, even on the tenth time through! I've always been pleased with Stevenson's works, this being no exception.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fast-forward hundreds of years and Earth is on the brink of destruction, barely fending off the attacks from an invading alien species, the Buggers. After a narrow victory in the second attack, with a third one eminent, hope seems all but lost. Andrew (Ender) Wiggin is just a young boy when he is drafted into an elite school designed to train and produce soldiers to fight in the intergalactic war. He leaves his family, a dysfunctional group consisting of his parents, who are brilliant and kind, but somewhat distant, his psychotic child-genius brother, who didn't make the cut for Battle School, and his sister Valentine, whom he loves more than anything, and travels into space, entering the journey of a lifetime. Ender is brilliant, and excels quickly in the Battle School, showing off his talents in the Battle Room, where children are thrown into mock battles against each other. However, the other students do not welcome Ender's talents, and he is left to fend for himself, faced with isolation, loneliness and the fear that he may turn out to be like his sadistic brother, Peter. Ender is pushed to his limits as the war wages on in the background, an ever-looming threat.<br />  Enders game, the first in the Ender Saga is excellently written and is very relatable. Although the story line may be way out of our realm of possibility, the struggles and challenges that Ender encounters draw many parallels to our own lives. Obviously, we are not given the responsibility of the entire human race, but everyone has faced the struggle of the pressure to reach your full potential, no matter the forces working against you. Ender is also confronted with the realization that he may not be able to make as many decisions in his life that he thinks, and discovers that he may not have the choice to be the person he wants to grow up to be. This story tells a tale of the nature of humanity, the desire to win, and the reality of a world in which someone else may determine your future.<br />This book is a must-read, and will leave you on the edge of your seat, nervous for the future of the Earth, rooting for Ender until the very end. It is a fast paced, action novel that will slip in these life values and morals without you even knowing it. This novel, winner of the Nebula and Hugo awards for best novel, is sure to leave you satisfied and wanting more.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|If I could give this film more than five stars, I would.  It is a really wonderful story, great animation, and will bring a tear to the eye of anyone with heart.  And Tom Hanks assuming multiple characters - what's not to enjoy?  I believe you will appreciate and treasure this as I do (and it's appropriate for all ages).
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I treid to read the book, but the choppy writing style was to much for my dyslexic brain. I then purchased to book on audible and it was one of the most beautiful things i have ever heard. I almost rated the book four stars, but i realized that a book that made me cry deserves the full five. I laughed through the hunger games, my tears are a high standard. I recommend the audio book for those who have the time. If not try to put up with the choppiness, it is definitely worth it.
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|Your the only one who can save the plane and passengers.  Excellent game if you enjoy flying games and it's challenging
B0015AARJI|4.0|Everyone knows the quality of this product. I personally don't like this controller for shooters. They fixed this for PS4
B00992CF6W|4.0|I got minecraft for Samsung galaxy note 2 and my kindle fire, but you can't play multiplayer locally. Fix this and I'll rate his 5 stars and a clap on the back.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|So beautiful!  Watching these movies for the first time since I was a child, I could barely remember them.  Visually stunning movies that were decades ahead of the game. It is difficult to believe how old these movies are based on the special effects and set design.  I will never tire of these movies.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I love FFDP! Just got the CD yesterday and absolutely love it! Not much more to say. You either like this band or you don't. :)
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is the first CD I've bought in over ten years. I have nothing but respect for these independent artists and love what they are doing for the music industry. I hope they have the longevity to change the game help cut back on the crappy music that record labels feed our mindless youth.  This is what music is all about in it's purest form.  Can't Hold Us always gets me hyped up. Love it. The entire album is great.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book kept your attention throughout--2 degrees of separation was normal in this war torn country that is constantly in our news. Very good read!
B002ZBPPHA|2.0|There are two endings to this film which I was not aware of when I rented it on Amazon Instant Video (AIV). This version had the ending I was not familiar with and I was not expecting it. Without spoiling it, it negatively affected the entire build up of the movie. The ending I was used to was very emotional and actually depressing. It was not a feel good ending, but it was an emotional experience that I appreciated. The alternate ending is a feel good ending which makes no sense and contradicts the entire plot of the movie. So I'm sorry, but the version AIV is not what I was looking for when I returned to an old movie I enjoyed years ago.
B000LC55F2|5.0|My favorite movie. You have to watch it multiple times but it never gets old. The dvd was used but came in great condition without a scratch on it.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|So, I'm rewriting my review for this show since someone didn't find it helpful.<br /><br />What I love about this show is mostly the presentation. The design of the environments, characters and zombies are the biggest pluses for me. It all looks good and it provides a believable atmosphere to immerse yourself in.<br /><br />Secondly, the character development isn't the best, but it's not bad. Sometimes they introduce new characters only to kill them off immediately, which is amateur/lazy writing in my opinion. The main characters are nicely developed though.<br /><br />This is a show where the acting carries the poor writing in several of the seasons, but the writing has improved as the show has matured. Many are aware this show is based on a graphic novel (aka comic book), and the hardcore fans will argue with me when I say the story, at times, is frustrating for the viewer. Particularily seasons 1&2; eventhough, the show has improved, you still have frustrating episodes in more recent seasons. Believe me when I say, the good episodes make up for the bad ones.<br /><br />So, overall, this is a series that has grown from a smaller production to the headliner for AMC and the increased budget has significantly improved the show. It still has it's \\"WTF\\" moments, but the overall quality of the production provides leniency and you learn to stomach the short comings in favor of staying submerged in the atmosphere the show provides. You will have a tendency of including yourself in the shows community. You will also root for much of the cast to survive, but you will also wish death to a few characters. Mostly because of bad acting or idiotic decision making procured from nonsensical writing at times.<br /><br />In short: I hate watching TV, but this is worth watching. I give this 5/5 stars because it isn't quite the caliber of Breaking Bad or Hannibal when it comes to story, but it's efforts in doing a zombie TV show were extremely ambitious and the fact they are having success speaks volumes. This show is one of the few things I anticipate any more.<br /><br />Thank youe of the few things I anticipate any more.    Thank you
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Cute story. Not as good as the first and the kids found parts of teheran story line to be random but, I love Ema Thompson and the character so full stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of the best apps made in my opinion. It could be for anyone. You should definitely get this app!
0545615402|5.0|It has some fake handwritten notes in the beast book as if it is a real textbook. Definitely a cute gift for a Harry Potter fan :)
6305428050|5.0|OMG this is such a funny movie set in the late 80's. This young adult woman has to babysit a little girl and a teenage guy and his friend. They run down town to pick up the young woman friend at a train station in downtown Wisconsin(I believe) and on the way to go get her, they all run into so many funny troubles along the way. Get this movie, it will have you laughing at almost every moment.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|This book could have been so much more.  The dystopian future is interesting enough, the characters are decently developed, and the plot is far darker than most YA dramas.  Yet Collins refuses to take the step into truly deep moral debates.  Never is there an actual delima in the killing of other Tributes; it's always good versus evil until the very end.  Never does there feel like the Games are actually destroying the humanity of the participants.<br /><br />When the ending finally does arrive, there is no horrible acts done for the greater good, no debate over the cost of rebellion to those who have no say in the matter, only an idiotic love-based decision to defy the game's rules.  While the gamble pays off, you are left scratching your head going &#34;really, this is what they decided to do?&#34;<br /><br />If Kat had taken the next step and gone down a darker path, or if more of the other Tributes had souls, the book itself would have led us towards moral debates rather than only leave you wondering &#34;what if&#34; while the obligatory love triangle begins.  Sadly, this book will fade in a few decades rather than forever be installed in anals of literature as a masterpiece of socio-philosophical debate.  For all the enjoyment of a nice light read, truly a disappointment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is such an addictive game. I originally downloaded it to help my daughter out with lives but now I am hooked.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|Great story. Makes you think about our youth and about parenting in general. I always wander how things parents say or do inadvertently affect their children. Are there such things as just bad souls or do we make them that way?
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|I started out loving Patricia Cornwell and then stopped reading her books for several years because I grew weary of the same premise over and over. When Dust came out, I decided to give it a try. Same boiler-plate premise. I forced  myself to finish it but not without skipping portions along the way.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved that it flowed at a nice pace and I couldn't predict the ending. It was as good as promised!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Ah, I'm not sure what to say. I was absolutely stunned at what the secret was and finished the book feeling unsettled and uncomfortable.  Not my favorite read.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|There were plot twists I found unexpected and I really liked how characters learned how to relate to eachother or learned about their similarities.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|ABSOLUTLEY THE BEST! I love their renditions of  Christmas songs. They bring such a twist to the familiar songs that it's enjoyable to hear over and over again! You won't be disappointed
B003G4W49C|1.0|I decided to read this because so many people have told me it was a good read and I wanted to read it before the movie came out. Well...it just wasn't for me. I couldn't get into the character Ended. Sci-fi books are a hit and miss for me, but if you love this genre then most will probably like the book.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|At the time of writing, it's still pretty limited in what it can stream.  I was expecting it to be able to show whatever I had in my browser, but right now it's no better than the cheapest roku.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|We have always loved the story.  This blue ray edition adds great detail and clarity to one of our favorite holiday movies.
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|Buy this edition!  It's full of wonderful material and a longer version of the White Council!  The more Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) the better!
B00D48BT5A|5.0|Written with wit and intelligence.  The book gives an insight into the paranoia and delusions in the modern American mind-set, and the corruption and abuse of executive power that we continue to witness.  Set on the eve of the Great Depression (read GFC), the similarities and parallels with modern times are unnerving.  Was this Bryson's intention perhaps?
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fast paced and repetitive but easily as addictive as the Temple Run games. The upgrades and XP mechanic make for a somewhat richer than average casual mobile/tablet game.
B001PPGAJY|4.0|They keep bringing comics to films and this is a very fun BRD to own. I will watch this one more than a few times. Petty must all of the graphics will make sense for many years. Worth every dime for this one.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|An assortment of top-notch actors and actresses, but somehow the movie was uninspiring for me. I adore Maggie Smith and wish her part would have been more lively and imaginative....she is a genius when given something to sink her teeth into. I loved seeing the Indian scenery and culture.
B008JFUR10|1.0|This film has so any cliches and do-overs that it get very ridiculous. I usually like sci-fi films but this one is near the bottom. It is no Star Trek series, Alien series, Terminator series or other greats. This one scrapes the bottom of the barrel. I had never seen it and I had heard that most people liked it. I did do one thing as I matured, I grew up out of silly little movies for kids. Don't waste your money on this trash. There are only a couple of recognizable actors but so many story lines or copies of others. Wait for cable is your best bet.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book was hard to read at first. After getting into the story and realizing who the narrator was, the story was more understandable .  I picked this book because I knew I would be seeing the movie.  I enjoyed reading the book more as the movie cut out so many things.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|Loved the idea and price-point of this model. But, when I first opened it. And, despite the fact that my husband and I are fairly mechanically inclined, we could not get it working. Returned it and am now very happy with a Crosley Executive USB model.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|The app works well and I would have given it five stars if not for one minor music preview contention.  While listening to the short clip (usually after about ten seconds) of a song one is considering adding to the collection it is sometimes unresponsive to switch to another song.  Mind you this is not an issue for songs on the device, only those one might navigate through in making choices about new music to add (purchase).
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I love the way it was written in the form of wonderful letters between friends. the joy found in new friendships, acceptance and love.  So refreshing after all the blood and gore being spewed out in book form these days.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This is a must read.  Achor debunks the myth that happiness comes from success.  In fact, through scientific study and research he proves that success is a result of happiness.  He also gives very practical steps to achieve more happiness in your life and in your work.<br /><br />Achor gives tips on how small, incremental change can have a huge impact, and how staying focused on the few things that are truly important can increase happiness and decrease overwhelm.<br /><br />Biggest take away: &#34;Common sense is not common action.&#34;  Most of us know what to do, it's doing it that is difficult.  It's doing it that is truly important.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|The exercises are fun and easy to follow and I can pick exercises for one body part or a whole body work out. Well organized, too.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like this game. I tried playing it on Facebook, but I don't really have any Facebook &#34;Friends&#34; so reloading was next to impossible, and I wasn't willing to sell my soul for new &#34;friends&#34;. I think the thing I like best about it is I don't need to buy anything (although if you want you can), and I don't need to rely on anyone for extra lives, I just need to be patient and new lives will come to me after time.<br /><br />Why 4 stars? Because I get the feeling that skill has absolutely NOTHING to do with this game. When the app wants you to move ahead, you will. Also, this is terribly addictive, so I am glad that when my lives run out I have to wait, or I may not be able to get lots of stuff done :)
B00992CF6W|4.0|best game ever but I wish there were more animals and it needs to be more like the full version on pc
B0041KVYIW|3.0|The fact that so many books still name the Beatles &#34;the greatest or most significant or most influential&#34; rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved.<br /><br />In a sense the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little attention to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as one can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for free for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply publicize what the music business wants to make money with.  TL;DR<br /><br />Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. And rock critics willstudy more of rock history and realize who invented what and who simply exploited it commercially.<br /><br />Beatles' &#34;Aryan&#34; music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll: it replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.<br /><br />Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for a good reason. They could not figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to &#34;Beatlemania&#34;, which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavors to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon & McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Fours'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of &#34;Tommy&#34; and &#34;Quadrophenia&#34;. Not to mention later and far greater British musicians. Not to mention the American musicians who created what the Beatles later sold to the masses.<br /><br />The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented &#34;beatlemania&#34; in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial band. Note of 2010. The Beatles were not a terribly interesting band, but their fans were and still are an interesting phenomenon. I can only name religious fundamentalists as annoying (and as threatening) as Beatles fans and as persevering in sabotaging anyone who dares express an alternative opinion on their faith. They have turned me into some kind of Internet celebrity not because of the 6,000 bios that i have written, not because of the 800-page book that i published, not because of 30 years of cultural events that i organized, but simply because i downplayed the artistic merits of the Beatles, an action that they seem to consider as disgraceful as the 2001 terrorist attacks.<br /><br />Jakub Krawczynski sent me this comment in 2010: I find it quite amusing that almost all of the Beatles songs have their own entries on wikipedia (nothing wrong with that in itself, actually), even if they are not singles, and each of them is meticulously dissected as if there were transcendental suites exceeding human comprehension, yet bands like Faust or Red Krayola, etc. have biographies even shorter than just one article about any random Beatles song. Needless to say, none of their songs have any articles on them, yet I'm sure there would be a lot more to talk about. Moreover, if you had put any bad review of their album on the site with the intention to show the broader scope of opinions, you'd risk your &#34;life&#34; there, since such fanatics don't accept any single sign of trying to be objective. You are seen as public enemy number 1 to them. It's like your article is one giant cognitive dissonance to them and vandalizing your bio was the only way to reduce this dissonance. (Italian text translated by Ornella C. Grannis)<br /><br />The Beatles most certainly belong to the history of the 60s, but their musical merits are at best dubious.<br /><br />The Beatles came to be at the height of the reaction against rock and roll, when the innocuous &#34;teen idols&#34;, rigorously white, were replacing the wild black rockers who had shocked the radio stations and the conscience of half of America. Their arrival represented a lifesaver for a white middle class terrorized by the idea thatwithin rock and roll lay a true revolution of customs. The Beatles tranquilized that vast section of people and conquered the hearts of all those (first and foremost the females) who wanted to rebel without violating the societal status quo. The contorted and lascivious faces of the black rock and rollers were substituted by the innocent smiles of the Beatles; the unleashed rhythms of the first were substituted by the catchy tunes of the latter. Rock and roll could finally be included in the pop charts. The Beatles represented the quintessential reaction to a musical revolution in the making, and for a few years they managed to run its enthusiasm into the ground.<br /><br />Furthermore, the Beatles represented the reaction against a social and political revolution. They arrived at the time of the student protests, of Bob Dylan, of the Hippies, and they replaced the image of angry kids with their fists in the air, with their cordial faces and their amiable declarations. They came to replace the accusatory words of militant musicians with overindulgent nursery rhymes. In this fashion as well the Beatles served as middle-class tranquilizers, as if to prove the new generation was not made up exclusively of rebels, misfits and sexual maniacs.<br /><br />For most of their career the Beatles were four mediocre musicians who sang melodic three-minute tunes at a time when rock music was trying to push itself beyond that format (a format originally confined by the technical limitations of 78 rpm record). They were the quintessence of &#34;mainstream&#34;, assimilating the innovations proposed by rock music, within the format of the melodic song.<br /><br />The Beatles belonged, like the Beach Boys (whom they emulated for most of their career), to the era of the vocal band. In such a band the technique of the instrument was not as important as the chorus. Undoubtedly skilled at composing choruses, they availed themselves of producer George Martin (head of the Parlophone since1956), to embellish those choruses with arrangements more and more eccentric.<br /><br />Thanks to a careful publicity campaign they became the most celebrated entertainers of the era, and are still the darlings of magazines and tabloids, much like Princess Grace of Monaco and Lady Di.<br /><br />The convergence between Western polyphony (melody, several parts of vocal harmony and instrumental arrangements) and African percussion - the leitmotif of American music from its inception - was legitimized in Europe by the huge success of the Merseybeat, in particular by its best sellers, Gerry and the Pacemakers and the Beatles, both produced by George Martin and managed by Brian Epstein. To the bands of the Merseybeat goes the credit of having validated rock music for a vast audience, a virtually endless audience. They were able to interpret the spirit and the technique of rock and roll, while separating it from its social circumstances, thus defusing potential explosions. In such fashion, they rendered it accessible not only to the young rebels, but to all. Mediocre musicians and even more mediocre intellectuals, bands like the Beatles had the intuition of the circus performer who knows how to amuse the peasants after a hard day's work, an intuition applied to the era of mass distribution of consumer goods.<br /><br />Every one of their songs and every one of their albums followed much more striking songs and albums by others, but instead of simply imitating those songs, the Beatles adapted them to a bourgeois, conformist and orthodox dimension. The same process was applied to the philosophy of the time, from the protest on college campuses to Dylan's pacifism, from drugs to the Orient. Their vehicle was melody, a universal code of sorts, that declared their music innocuous. Naturally others performed the same operation, and many (from the Kinks to the Hollies, from the Beach Boys to the Mamas and Papas) produced melodies even more memorable, yet the Beatles arrived atthe right moment and theirs would remain the trademark of the melodic song of the second half of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Their ascent was branded as &#34;Beatlemania&#34;, a phenomenon of mass hysteria launched in 1963 that marked the height of the &#34;teen idol&#34; mode, a extension of the myths of Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. From that moment on, no matter what they put together, the Beatles remained the center of the media's attention.<br /><br />Musically, for what it's worth, the Beatles were the product of an era that had been prepared by vocal groups such as the Everly Brothers and by rockers such as Buddy Holly; an era that also expressed itself through the girl-groups, the Tamla bands and surf music. What the Beatles have in common with them, aside from almost identical melodies, is a general concept of song: an exuberant, optimistic and cadenced melody.<br /><br />The Beatles were the quintessence of instrumental mediocrity. George Harrison was a pathetic guitarist, compared with the London guitarists of those days (Townshend of the Who, Richards of the Rolling Stones, Davies of the Kinks, Clapton and Beck and Page of the Yardbirds, and many others who were less famous but no less original). The Beatles had completely missed the revolution of rock music (founded on a prominent use of the guitar) and were still trapped in the stereotypes of the easy-listening orchestras. Paul McCartney was a singer from the 1950s, who could not have possibly sounded more conventional. As a bassist, he was not worth the last of the rhythm and blues bassists (even though within the world of Merseybeat his style was indeed revolutionary). Ringo Starr played drums the way any kid of that time played it in his garage (even though he may ultimately be the only one of the four who had a bit of technical competence). Overall, the technique of the &#34;fab four&#34; was the same of many other easy-listening groups: sub-standard.<br /><br />I don't hate The Beatles byany mean, they are just hugely overrated. They just aren't THAT great.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Not a big fan of Stephen King, actually tossed Rose Madder in the trash after reading it.  I originally borrowed 11/22/63 from my local library, but returned it...daunted by the sheer size of the book, and the leaf blurb about time travel.  When I received an Amazon email offering the book for $2.99 on the Kindle, I decided to go ahead and read it...very glad I did.  I loved the characters, suspense, look into the late 50s and 60s.  Was a senior in high school when Kennedy was killed.  I felt like I was struggling along with George/Jake and Sadie to stop the assassination.  Sit back and enjoy.  Kudos to Mr. King.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Jack teacher does what we all want to do at times...correct a wrong. He has done it again and it is plain, pure entertainment.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The story had me hooked from the beginning. Couldn't put it down. It made getting over the shingles a little more tolerable.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Would buy from this seller again thank you very much.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It wasn't too difficult, but it made you think. The game was fun and engaging. Now I'm just waiting on the new levels.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|this app helped so much.  I had hardly any content but it said my internal storage was full.  I can't believe this app was the solution to my problems.

B009K916ZK|4.0|Simple and easy way to connect a MacBook Pro to monitors with VGA ports, or to projectors for presentations.  Critical if you do presentations with a MacBook pro.
B00DQC2FPM|3.0|I was hoping for a little more bang for my 30 bucks.  The box is tiny. But that's kind of always how I feel about Legos! We will see how my son likes it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Enough like the PC version to make it worth playing.  If you like the PC version you'll like this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|over all the app is so far good an fast moving kills time fast and easy also cant beat that its free. I would recommend it to someone else for a good app.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|This is a good movie.  It's even better if you have read the book prior to seeing the movie, which I highly recommend, so you can understand what's going on exactly.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very nice, easy to use, really making it easy to take better advantage of online services on the big screen tv.  Can't wait for new services to be available to expand the value operation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game but running out of lives is getting old. its too much work and patience for a game that you should be able to use to kill time.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|This movie has so many amazing things going on for it!  Excellent!  Not without a few flaws--but DEFINITELY WORTH OWNING!
B00FQ53NIA|5.0|I love Britney Spears and i bought this album for one of my best friends for Christmas and i know that he will love it <3<br />The album is amazing and you'll love the songs !<br />I wish i could've gotten the deluxe version in my opinoin the deluxe is better because of the 4 bouns tracks<br />(Brightest Moring Star, Hold on tight, Now that i found you, and perfume dream mix).<br />My favorite songs from the album (deluxe) are...

B00G32VYDG|3.0|same topic as men in black, but not nearly as well done. Just picture Jeff Bridges holding a pose as a hot blonde, vomit, look away from the screen and pretend it didn't happen. The cowboy stories were the best part of the movie, that coyote is my hero.
B00003CWL6|1.0|i got the dvd and it didn't even play. I tried multiple dvd readers. including my computer, ps3, xbox, and dvd player
B00FHATBGW|3.0|I got to the final scene when I realized the ring artifact was &#34;lost&#34; along the way! (Unable to keep it after it was used in the headstone.)  So reloaded two more times only to have the game glitch earlier each time! So I was not able to finish the game!  :- (
B0095G5AFU|4.0|It's a great app but I can't backup my notes to Google drive. 5 stars no doubt but need to fix this issue Please fix!<br /><br />I did test it with drop box and that worked!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Cannot put this game down. Seriously the best game I've played an a long time. I am addicted! Just when I get to the point of giving up I figure it out. It's brain food I'm sure!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Having been born in the 70's, I developed a liking for post-apocalyptic fiction in my youth. This book takes me right back to all the things I loved about those classic P-A books. There are several mainstays of the genre here, but Howey puts his inventiveness on display and gives us some new twists to enjoy. Very entertaining and nicely edited. I will read the sequels and recommend the series to others.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is my very favorite show, it's hilarious!!! The cast is great together and it's such a fun show to watch
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Well made.  This prop replica of the Starfleet Command Division is made of quality metal.  Great addition for any Star Trek aficionado.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie stays true to the book which I love! The cast is phenomenal and works well together. Love it!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I liked it, but not as much as &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34;.  The 'secret' was pretty predictable and while the author's 'resolution' was interesting, I found some of the plotlines difficult to swallow.  The three intertwined stories were well done.  I thought the best part of the book was the Epilogue.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Very thought-out app. I can tell it's the 5th iteration, because it's really clear, easy, and fun to play. And there are tons of different options for towers and leveling up. Very satisfying!
0694003611|5.0|My little one loves this book and we love reading it to her. I think it's going to be a classic in our household.
006202406X|4.0|Though I did find Allegiant to be a little rushed I enjoyed it and found it to be a wonderful and unique end to an excellent series. I can't believe the 3 stars and all the crappy reviews simply because the book didn't end as they wanted it to.<br /><br />NO, the ending will not be what you expect or want but the reality of it is that in war, nobody is off limits, sacrifices will be made.  In  the end, hearts may be broken, but life ultimately goes on.
B008220C56|5.0|Must underrated movie EVER.  So artistic in every way…this is the kind of film that I strive someday to make.  BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|Some of the dialogue in the beginning was a little rough, but then again, it was two teenage girls. More importantly, the hardship and pain was agonizingly poignant and believable. Glad to see both sides of the humanity ala Radclyffe!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love this mouse. wire is supported with a braided fabric. mouse is very precise. i love that you can change the weight
B00CLF80O0|4.0|I'm listening to this right now and loving it. I don't own and never heard Made In Japan so I'm not bothered by comparisons. If the songs are downtuned to accomodate Dave's voice, that's fine. That's the right thing to do to make sure the songs sound their best live. It will also make it easier for Dave to sing night after night after night. But honestly, this band is so hot I barely listen to the vocals..lol. I don't care what anyone else says, Mr. Coverdale put together one heck of a hot-rocking combo here! Is it the best sounding live recording ever? No it's not, but it is very good for what it is, a snapshot of a great band on tour.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|When it comes to camera gear, I have learned its important to spend the money for the brand name than going to alternatives. This works great, feels well made, and is so much better than the cut-rate model I had before.
B000YHC9WQ|4.0|Very graphic.  I purchased this to show to my high school students.  Nope. I did appreciate the film at home.  It is well done.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Great game. Keeps you busy for hours. It really makes you think and its challenging. I love it. It's well worth the money.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book held my interest and I will probably try other books by this author.  Good rainy day book read
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It could have been anywhere in the deep south but, with  John Grisham , it had to be in Mississippi and it fits like a glove.  Wonderful book, well written with lots of character development.
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|There is nothing that Kanye has done that I haven't loved until now and Yeezus.  The fact is that he has ramped up his ego and arrogance, which is odd given the fact that this album is mediocre.  Don't get me wrong, there are flickers of awesome (see Blood on the Leaves, Black Skinhead, Bound 2) but I find it hard to listen to the entire album and get into it.  I loved My Dark Twisted Fantasy and thought it was brilliant the entire way through, song after song.  Here, I'm skipping through songs.  Part of it may be that I'm turned off by the media saturation he has received since dating the Kardashian chick.  I think that has really overshadowed him as an artist and has added to the negative perception people have of him.  I almost hate listening to Bound 2 because images of that awful video pop in my head. Whatever it is, I thought Yeezus was OK.  I will just stick to the good ol' back catalog.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Awesome game, it's very addictive  I play this game for hours all the time, it's tricky but fun nonetheless and worth downloading.
0393317552|4.0|In Guns, Germs, and Steel, Diamond makes a very reasonable argument that Europe's theory of how they were so great is not at all what the real story is. In truth, their ancestors were just at the right place at the right time under the right conditions. Diamond supports this theory throughout the book with evidence from thousands of years of history. He is able to tie them all together in an efficient manner in which to further prove that it had happened throughout history. It was not genetic superiority that made Europe a powerhouse, it was the use of agriculture, development of guns, strengthened immunity to deadly diseases (and the spreading of them), and the use of iron and steel to forge tools, weapons, and machinery.<br /><br />This book was a very thought provoking book. Diamond looks well into the past to find clues to what made successful civilizations successful. I have to admit it was a pretty lengthy book. He goes in depth into a lot of the topics. Though some are necessary to prove his point, I believe that he could have been able to establish the same point in a more efficient and effective manner. Overall, Diamond had done a well job in condensing thousands of years worth of history into a single book that reveals the reason to why the white people have so much cargo.
B00BEIYH6U|1.0|Not sure this movie rates even one star because the bar was set TOO high with the first film.  And as expected Kick-Ass 2 falls flat on its face.  But I'm not going to bash the director or the acting either because both are at the mercy of the writers and bashing isn't my style.  I don't recommend, if you anticipate something as epic as the original film you'll be let down.  Rent first and then make a decision whether to buy - you've been warned.
B005GCCJME|2.0|Good:<br />I ordered M8 size, but real size is somewhat bigger - M8,5.<br />Crocs looks better than on the photo (it seems photographer put too much light on it),<br />real colours are better and more bright.<br />Material is soft and lightweight.<br />Design is really nice and you will not look like a clown as it was with previous models.<br /><br />Bad:<br />It rubs a feet like a soviet shoes.<br />After a month of usage I can say that the only to wear it for me is with socks.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Originally sideloaded it as amazon didn't have it.  With Facebook app, syncs with my pc re lives given and level achieved.  Good to have it on amazon because all my stuff is in one place if kindle needs to be reset to factory settings.  I have a few other apps they should consider...<br /><br />UPDATE.  the level i'm on (421) does not play the same way on the kindle as on the pc.  on the pc, the tornado can't hit in the same spot 2x; in the kindle, it does.  on the pc, you preserve the corner stripes so you can get a stripe/stripe combo after the 1st pizza bomb; on the kindle it wipes those out, too.  very disappointing as this is a VERY hard level and I wanted more chances to beat it.<br /><br />UPDATE, UPDATE.  deleted game from my kindle using curvefish app remover and reinstalled candy crush app from another site.  I can now get past level 440 and get odus.  a few glitches that come and go, but well worth it.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|A lot of things in this book just clicked for me, and Mike does a great job of supporting everything with studies that make sense to the common layman.  He even makes himself accessible to answer questions.<br /><br />My strength has already increased and I'm looking forward to seeing where I am in a year.  I'll update this post at the end of 2014.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game features a fun action packed fun filled experience for everybody. The only downside is that there is no storyline. It's all just fighting.overall this is a must have game.
B00B4804Q2|5.0|If you have purchased the original Fast and the Furious then you know you need the 2nd one. And you might as well by the next four so you can do a Fast and the Furious movie marathon. Makes for a great movie night.
B00D2CYV9E|5.0|This was a lot better than I even expected, although I think Michael Douglas was doing more Carol Channing than Liberace.  Matt Damon was better than I have ever seen him.  It doesn't come across as cheap like I thought it might.  Debbie Reynolds and Dan Aykroyd were a surprise also.  Easily worth the money.
B00B4804NK|5.0|Just remember once you see this one you will need to get all the others. And if you are just buying to complete the collection make sure and buy everyone you are missing. Great movies if you like fast cars.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|Engaging characters, compelling plots and fascinating world building combined in one. Another excellent book that kept me up well past my bedtime...!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|While some court case stories can become tedious, this one holds the readers' with a cast of interesting characters, and twists and turns that defy your ability to forecast the outcome.  This is a typical, well written and interesting John Grisham story.  I actually give it 4 1/2 stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am very impressed with this app for a number of reasons.<br />It has NO hidden costs.<br />It has the capabilities of the high cost apps; without the cost.<br />It enables the user to highlight in various colors, to write notes, to place bookmarks and even label the bookmarks in various colors.<br />It is called the 'You Version' because of the fact that it has various translations of the Bible. I chose the amplified and the amplified Bible app was 12.99 if I remember correctly.<br />It enables you to connect with facebook and Twitter and gives you the ability to post to your profile.<br />It even goes so far as to give you an on-line profile.<br />It has sync capabilities, for whatever profile, or device that you are dealing with.<br />It is evident that the providers of this app did so as a ministry; because it is a gem and it is easily worth $12.99.<br />Thank you to the makers and providers, I doubt that you will ever see this review; but I am grateful and your reward awaits you:)
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Very funny movie, skillfully filmed so that every photograph looks like it came from a Norman Rockwell painting. A delightful view of young kids and how they view the world.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|My wife has always been a Tom Cruise fan, so when this came out I got it for her. As for me, Mr. Cruise does a fine job in the movies that he does, but I feel that he is miss cast for some (War of the Worlds).
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I love their voices and their takes on some old Christmas songs (Baby It's Cold Outside is way less rapey somehow when Zoe sings it). Great to play at Christmas parties.

1416594795|2.0|Very readable, but . . . . .<br />Dawkins in his New York Times bestseller, The Greatest Show on Earth, asserts that evolution is a fact, not a mere theory.  Anyone looking at the world around him would come to the same conclusion: evolution is the key to nature’s existence.  Although many people stress that evolution is merely a theory, Dawkins presses that evolution is a theory with the same qualifications as the theory of gravity and the laws of thermodynamics. Surely billions of years, mutations, and natural selection can produce the great variety of species today because sexual selection, coevolution, natural selection, mutations, and selective breeding have been proven to produce drastic differences in an organism’s characteristics in just a short while. Along the same lines, tree rings, radioactive dating, and carbon dating are ultimate proofs that this earth is billions of years old. Evolution occurred at tiny increments, thus from one generation to another there were very small differences, but over millions and billions of years there was an accumulation of differences that produced the variety of organisms seen today. He defends evolution because no designer would have created the bodies of organisms the way they are; bodies are just a mess of organs, nerves, muscles, and blood supplies.  “Mistakes” and the poor design found in nature obviously points to the process of evolution and not to a loving Creator. Richard Dawkins uses these “evidences” and many more to prove that evolution is a fact; this assertion, as a matter of fact, is his reason for writing this book.<br />  Richard Dawkins is a Neo-Darwinist.  He believes that everything, without the help of a Supreme Being, has evolved from a common ancestor by gradual increments by way of natural selection and mutation. For example, Dawkins uses the example of the awkward body of the dachshund to demonstrate that by just one simple mutation proportions of a body plan can be changed drastically (35).  According to his worldview, this is in favor of his view that mutations played an important part in the development of the variety of organisms today (37). In addition, he asserts that natural selection and sexual selection have great ability to promote and choose certain characteristics. In his illustration, natural selection in guppies lead to various changes in color, lifespan, time of reproduction, and maturation rate (139). Dawkins extrapolates that moderate changes in a couple of years must produce drastic and extreme changes in a billion.  The author also presupposes uniformitarianism.  In his chapter on dating techniques, he assumes that carbon-14 has always decayed at the same rate throughout evolutionary history (106-107). This underlying presupposition, consequently, is demonstrated by his view of the slow movement of the continental shelves as they move away from each other.  According to his worldview the continents would not nearly be so far apart if the age of the earth was around 10,000 to 6,000 years old (276-77). These are just a few examples of the presuppositions that permeate the entirety of Dawkins’s book.<br /> Dawkins does tend to have a good scientific basis for his arguments. But he does reference and use the unscientific example of pseudogenes. He laughs in the face of the Designer who “tricked” us by placing useless areas of DNA into our genes for no purpose.  But pseudogenes were officially ruled out last year and have been proven to be important in gene expression. To his credit, he uses organisms seen today and contemporary experiments to support many of his points, for example, guppies and Lenski’s E. coli. Most of the problems with his views are the presuppositions he uses and how he interprets the data.  One example he uses seems illogical: he asserts that we have good evidence that the monkey family and humans share a common ancestor, and then he demonstrates from different fossils the found “bridges” between chimps and humans.  He doesn’t have proof of the common ancestor, but he has examples from either side of the phylogenetic “tree”. Then towards the end of this discussion, he inserts that there has been no fossil demonstrating the connection between the upright early human and the stooped monkey family (204). It sounds like these two ideas conflict.  Someone could counter this example with scientific evidence that demonstrates that all skull sizes found in the reportedly ancestral human are seen in populations today. Also, dating based on tree rings (90-91) works relatively well, but there have been instances where a tree produces more than one ring per year and would present a problem to this argument. Again, most of his arguments are scientifically correct; he just views them through the glasses of Neo-Darwinism.<br />The theological implications of his view are devastating.  Dawkins does not believe in a Creator.  This means we are not answerable to an All- Powerful God for our actions.  Morality, then, is derived merely from social and cultural evolution. In addition, his worldview implies that there is no curse. The death, destruction, hurt, and mistakes in nature seen today are nothing but the result of an endless cycle. Death is just a fact of life that will occur to even the best of us. Consequently, life becomes futile.  There is no purpose in life: everything is ultimately determined by its genome and its environment and true freedom of choice is impossible.  This worldview can lead to the justification of murder (including abortion), theft, and dishonesty, because this life ultimately boils down to survival and finding pleasure.  His views also annihilate the doctrine of sin; sin is an offence against a holy God. No God means no sin. No sin means no Saviour. No sin means no hope at all.<br /> I would highly recommend this book to my science peers.  Not only was it an eye-opening experience, it was also an evaluation of my attitude toward evolutionists.  One must be careful and mentally prepared for the bombardment of hate and bitterness against the Bible, God, and creationists throughout this book.  Also, it will give you a perspective of how evolutionists are misinformed about our views on speciation, natural selection, mutation, plate tectonics, and “vestigial” organs.  Reading this book will change your perception of evolution, and will better prepare you for reaching out to them.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Great classic songs done by no one who is either a singer or a singer of that type of music.
0307720748|5.0|great to learn more about a business man with his priorities in right places. I hope he can continue on his path and help change the world
B005CKPQNE|5.0|One of the greatest series I have ever watched. Incredible writing and acting. You should really watch all of the seasons to appreciate the show.
0143038095|5.0|I enjoyed this book during high school. Later I saw a movie of it with my mother, but it missed the mark. I purchased this as a gift to her so she could get the whole story, since interesting parts were left out of the movie.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Nice to have but sometimes hard to read daily temps and variations. This is a convenient app and handy.I like it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely the most powerful series I have ever read. I am at the age where it takes a lot to keep my attention when reading a work of fiction, and I read for a straight 48 hours when I downloaded this series to my Kindle (stopping only to sleep and eat....literally. I was rendered completely useless for two days). Start to finish, I absolutely could not put it down, and finished the entire thing in the space of those two days. A perfect 10 in my opinion! A definite must-read for anyone over the age of 12 (or under, provided it has been approved by their parents). I would definitely recommend it to my own kids, and I will certainly be recommending it to my students!!!
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Lots of things are missing such as the ability to execute throws and counter attacks. The graphics are gorgeous and make the few short comings easily overlooked.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This has turned out to be one of our new favorite family movies.  When we rented it, we watched it 5 times in the 48 hours we had it and then purchased it for one of our daughter's birthdays and have watched it multiple times as a family since.  One true test of a good movie is when you find yourself as parents lying in bed at 11 pm, quoting lines from a children's movie and laughing out loud because of it!  That's what happened to my husband and I with Wreck-It Ralph!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book two of the hunger games is probably my favorite, it's a page turner that keeps the reader interested and entertained at the same time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first I thought that this was just another match three game. I find them boring. But the created ways that this game is put together I find it very challenging. I just wish I could get the other sagas on my Kindle. I would really appreciate it.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This game is a challenging game with good helps.  It keeps the mind active. It will keep you busy and loose track of time.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Worth every penny! lot's of behind the scenes footage from all four movie. The chest busting scene in Alien is one of the greatest moments in movie history.
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|fun n good<br />long hard and entertaining but takes awail to get going.one of the best I play for a tablet of kindel
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|I enjoyed movie a lot. Jim Carrey did not agree with the violence in the film so he refused to do any publicity for it. That was probably a factor in it failing at the box office. Mr. Carrey could have waited and voiced his opinion after the movie ran it's course not before it was released. Maybe he could have just came out with a story of being too busy with another project to promote it.  Think about all the people that worked on it. Funny he must have forgotten about that movie called &#34;Me, Myself and Irene&#34;. Anyways I loved the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game! And I highly recommend it for horse lovers. Or any animal lover. Tons of fun and a Great game!
B008JFUN6E|5.0|Loved it!! Screw all of the want to be movie critics giving it a one star. If you like sci-fi action flicks then add this Blu-ray to your cart.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Well when this app got deleted I still had it but anyways you have to update it but by the reviews I don't trust it or want to because I think something would happen to it but besides that it is the best
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of the few games I actually play longer than a week. It's fun and fast paced, but not extremely hard to play.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|I Love this album!!! All the Classic Christmas Songs done absolutely perfect. The songs are great and I especially like the Yule Log Video!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox really dropped the ball when the cancelled this fantastic Sci-fi show by Joss Wheadon(Of Buffy and Avengers fame) and starring cult TV personality Nathan Fillion(of Castle fame). It merges westerns with sci-fi, and while many people are turned off by the idea of cowboys in space, it's actually really well blended!<br /><br />The series centers around Malcom Reynolds(Nathan Fillion) Smuggler extraordinaire, his ship Serenity, and his crew that is more like a family, as they fly through the stars, performing odd jobs to put bread on the table all the while staying one step ahead of the alliance.<br /><br />If given a second season, I am sure this show would have been a massive hit, but alas, fox did what it usually does, and cancelled it quickly before it could find it's niche. Thankfully Wheadon brought his fanbase a conclusion in the form of a bigscreen finale called Serenity.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I used to use Swype when it was in beta and free, but with the version 3 upgrade things got worse and I decided to try SwiftKey. So far I regret not having used it sooner. It was great even before they added the flow feature, but with that addition I doubt I'll ever try anything else. I just realized that sounds scripted but I promise I'm a real person.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|A simple but addictive &#34;Match 3&#34; tile swap game with beautiful graphics! What makes this &#34;Match 3&#34; game stand out from other bejeweled clones is the fun story included! The story is based obviously on the classic novel of the same name. It also includes levels that are basically &#34;Hidden picture&#34; puzzles, so it's like having two types of games packed into one great title.<br /><br />It ran perfectly on my android phone, which isn't that fancy of a phone, so I am fairly confident that it will run on most phones that can install it, quite well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome so worth it!! I am addicted and I just got it!! Totally recommend this game! Awesome awesome awesome awesome
142311339X|5.0|Great story telling and incredibly interesting. I couldnt stop reading it. Each main character has something that makes them so likeable and cool. Im 21 and i would recomend it if you are in the fantasy sort of thing.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast is brilliant in that it understands how we consume content.  Rather than creating a separate set-top device, Chromecast understands that we typically consume content from second-screens (laptops, tablets, phones) while watching TV.  With that in mind, Chromecast turns your second screen into a remote for your first-screen (your TV).  By doing so Chromecast simplifies watching content from any device.<br /><br />It is important to understand, however, that it's a new technology that's still being developed.  It works very well with the limited set of apps .  It's also important to note that some apps are supported better on Android than in Chrome (on your laptop) and vice-versa.  As of now that's roughly Hulu+, Netflix, Google Play Movies/Music, HBO Go & Youtube.  For these apps you get a near flawless streaming experience.  see the wikipedia page for currently supported apps: [...]<br /><br />The other major feature is the ability to stream any Chrome Browser tab onto your TV.  In this case the quality wasn't that great.  Videos streamed in this way were grainy and stuttered.<br /><br />So what it comes down to is this.  If you are the type of person who uses your laptop, tablet or phone while watching TV, and want a simple way to send content to your TV, this is a great device.  Just make sure that the bulk of your content is in a supported app (see the wikipedia page).<br /><br />About the setup process,  I did have some setup problems when I first tried using my Chromebook.  I instead ran the setup from my android phone which triggered a software update on the Chromecast.  After the software update, my Chromebook had no problems connecting to the Chromecast.  So if you have problems detecting the Chromecast, try another device.  If things go really wonky you can hard-reset the Chromecast by pushing the tiny button on the dongle itself for 15sec (it's near the usb port on the dongle).
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|Difficult to get through.  Slow moving and kind of boring.  Really nothing intriguing or exciting in the story.  May not ever finish it....
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It excellent it work very well I would tell every one about it even my colleagues and friends at work. Very well organized
819073914X|5.0|This book is a classic. It was inexpensive, shipped quickly, and came shrink-wrapped and. In great condition. It made a perfect Chanukah gift for my 8-year-old daughter.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The graphics are great. It's just like playing the original card game. Play can be a bit slow at times but it's still fun.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|This book does not fall into the same category as Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  Storyline is not there and too many unnecessary war details.  I don't plan on reading the next two unless I see rave reviews.
B00005JNQS|5.0|The movie was great no problems whatsoever with the quality. Shipping was fast and packaging was great. What more can you ask for... Snagged it for $5
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All I can say after finishing all three books is- wow. I am truly speechless. There are many emotions and thoughts running through my mind. For one- I read the first book after hearing all the buzz. I had mixed emotions about it. I thought there was too much repetitive sexual content and although I was captivated in the story and the characters, I was left with a feeling of disappointment in the book because like Ana- this type of relationship wasn't for me and I wanted a loving \\"vanilla\\" love story. I waited a month or so and was bored one day. I kept going back to my kindle and my mind started to think about Fifty Shades. I read the reviews for the second book and decided perhaps I should give this relationship and storyline the benefit of doubt. I wanted more than to just read about sex. Since beginning book two- I haven't been able to put down the books. I read the two books (book two and three) in four days. I got lost in the story and fell in love with the characters and their relationship. These stories are not about a type of sexual relationship and preference that most people don't speak of- it is about two people... one with major baggage and having them fall in love. They learn about each other and themselves in the process of forming their relationship which every human can relate to. Although they are not  in the type of relationship Grey thought he wanted in book one, they are in a new type of relationship. Their own \\"vanilla\\" mixed with \\"kinkery fu..\\" well you know if you read the books. They create their own type of relationship, one that is indefinable but is their equilibrium to what make  each of them happy. Another point that everyone can relate to.  Is any relationship definable? Every loving relationship is what each individual brings forth to it and some how an equilibrium does form which is indefinable and different. I am so sad this has to end. But I love the way it ended and left me with hopeful thoughts. Truly amazing story.  E.L. James isa true genius. ALTHOUGH by the way the  movie looks and is casted, I'm not sure  I will want to see it. It may ruin the beautiful relationship of Ana and Grey that I have envisioned and fell in love with.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Not sure who loves this game more me or my son:) For a 5 year old he is quite good. He gets super excited when there is an update and loves new characters. Would give more stars if could. Parents beware as in app purchases can be made.
B00BHBBSZ2|1.0|Ok. Here's my problem. ..i write, and it reprints, in my handwriting . Ok cool. But it makes it to small to read later, and there's no way too change it. Using soft keyboard takes to long to be useful. For what it is, the are to many that have a better ui to bother.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Very entertaining for young and old. Does allow for in app purchases so beware if you have a child playing as they can rack up the money real quick buying different suits of armor.
B0095G5AFU|3.0|What I'd like to add hereis an ability to write directly on the page lines myself and after I'mdone convert to type. there's an app simply called WRITE that allows me to write directly on the &amp;#34;page&amp;#34;. i like that a lot for speed of note taking, Combine that w Nolbooks Pro and we'd have a Big winner!&amp;#34;
B00C2VIA52|2.0|App worked great for a couple weeks. Out of no where it started freezing up and crashing. I finally had to delete. Would not recommend.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is awesome I was blown when<br />I saw all the action in it.Hope u have the same opinion
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|.As with all his books-Excellent. Goes to show that a book doesn't need lots of starting and descriptive sex to make an impact.  Just a good story line and command of the language.
B002QUWYWE|2.0|Like most of King's novels, the movie falls far short of expectations. I wanted to like it, but I wasn't a big fan.
B002CM03PQ|5.0|This is so much more than what i thought it was going to be... it came with cool reprint of notes, and it was just amazing. And yes that is a tambornine (sp) on top that you can actually play... not that I will ever take it out of the protective plastic it came in. It was def. worth every cent i paid for it. I was only looking for a DVD with bonus features and with this i got that and so many more collectors items that i've not seen before! Super Fancy!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love injustice one of my favorite games and now its on my kindle fire i was so excited when i saw this i love this game /app thats why i gave it five stars
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I LOVE this movie. This is probably my favorite movie. Even if you're not religious, this is an amazing movie to watch! Definitely get it!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Very nicely done.  Thank you.  I was also impressed by the developers interest in the comments and willingness to clear up issues with his product.  Love being able to play several sounds at once and adjust the volume for each separately. Very soothing.
B005K17RU0|5.0|My family and I rely on the information we get from this app.  Ranching is a weather related occupation and I'm so happy to be able to pull this app up and plan our days/weeks.  I haven't had any issues with the app unrelated to my connection. I should upgrade just to say thanks.
B008VZCU2W|4.0|It makes you think about the social commentary from time to time after watching the movie. It sort of pops into your head off and on over the next several months. That is a hallmark of a good movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book grabs you & holds you until the very end. It is cleverly written about a subject that was a cancer on the world - World War II Germany. A little girl is a star of light in a world gone mad. The writer draws you into each character & makes you feel like you're living right there with them.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Such a great deal!!  Wouldn't be able to find a better price for a new set of these movies anywhere.  My boyfriend was soo happy with the gift.
006202406X|5.0|I almost didn't buy this book after reading the very mixed reviews.  I'm glad I took the chance.  I didn't see the flaws that so many others wrote about.  All three books grabbed me and kept me reading when I should have been sleeping.  Perhaps it grabbed me because I can see myself and people around me in the factions, whether pure or Divergent.  Perhaps it's because I have teens at home who are just as volatile as the characters, though thankfully they face fewer life-threatening situations.<br /><br />I found the ending somewhat sad, but nowhere near other things I've read (grab anything from the Deryni series if you really want to be depressed at the end of a book).  While it's not what I would have wished for the characters, it was a fitting ending.  \\"And they lived happily ever after\\" wouldn't have done justice to the trials the characters faced.  The story ends much like it started -- bad things happen, and you need to keep moving on in spite of, or sometimes even because of, those events.
B00FOF8W8I|5.0|Read the full reveiw @<br />[...]<br /><br />For such a short story to give me stitches on my side, it is worth the read. Hilarious. The author uses words, not scenes, to make you laugh. Can't help but quote a line.( Pardon me Peter John) but I've been quoting these lines to all friends and of course giving you the credit)<br /><br />'She padded foundation powder onto her cheeks and carefully applied a thick coat of glossy red lipstick before finally inserting her dentures.&quot;<br /><br />Dentures? I had to read the line twice before the humor in it really hit me. Such an unromantic object but used so aptly.<br /><br />This love story is of Victoria and Bob, a rekindled affair after 45 years of a chance meeting. The love, the  fears and the desires in an old couple is beautifully depicted.<br /><br />But be warned that it contains some explicit words, but all told in a very humorous way.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Dear George,<br /><br />I am not happy with you. Yes, I admit it. I am angry.<br /><br />Call me a &#34;fanboy&#34; or whatever. Dismiss my opinion however you wish. Say the movies belong to you and you can do whatever you want with them, as you are so fond of repeating. And yes, legions of pro-Lucasites will come to your defense. Or make fun of me and people like me. But they are wrong. You are wrong.<br /><br />I loved the original trilogy. They were a great part of my childhood. And I still enjoy them as an adult - except for where you have meddled with them. Why, George, why?<br /><br />Why did you add a bunch of cartoony, distracting CGI junk into the background of the Mos Eisley spaceport?<br /><br />Why did you change Han's character by trying to make his shooting in the cantina more &#34;obviously&#34; self-defense? We already knew it was self-defense! It looks stupid.<br /><br />Why did you make it so Luke no longer says, &#34;You're lucky you don't taste so good.&#34;?<br /><br />Why did you change the music in several parts of the movie, especially at the end of Jedi?<br /><br />Why did you make Vader say, &#34;NOOOooooo!&#34;?<br /><br />Blinking Ewoks? Who gives a ____?<br /><br />Why did you take out the perfectly acceptable - and fitting - ghost of Sebastian Shaw at the end of Jedi, and put in a totally-out-of-place Hayden Christensen?<br /><br />Why do you keep making these distracting and pointless changes, while ignoring the things that actually NEED to be fixed? Such as Vader's PINK lightsaber, and Luke's Green-no-it's-Blue-no-it's-White-no-it's-Green-again lightsaber in Star Wars?<br /><br />I know I'm beating a dead horse here. You're rich. You're successful. You're not going to read this. You don't care. Well, you know what? I think you're arrogant.<br /><br />Just give us the original CLEANED UP, WIDESCREEN versions on Blu-Ray, and people like me will go away! But no. We're stuck with you and your lousy &#34;better&#34; versions of these movies. Until you're gone, at least... Not that I'm mean enough to hope for that. It's just disappointing that your pride has brought us to this.<br /><br />That's what it's all about. That's why we're stuck with these. You're certainly not above milking another blu-ray release. But you don't want to give us what we want because it doesn't conform to your pure &#34;vision&#34; of what Star Wars ought to be. Well, that's a load of horse hockey George!
B0041KW2LK|5.0|Movie was of amazing quality and at an outstanding price. I enjoyed the movie and will continue to enjoy it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works as advertised but be warned, if you have 5GHz WiFi that you want to use it with it doesn't work.  I actually have to downgrade my phone/tablet/PC speed to use.  If Google adds this feature I'll try it again but for now I'm not wasting my time.
B00BEIYN3M|5.0|Very funny and entertaining movie.  Lots of great laughs but be sure the little ones aren't around when watching it.
0786891416|4.0|Disclaimer: I got this book as a birthday present.<br /><br />I am a big, big fan of the Castle TV show. It has everything that I like in a good show: suspense, crime, thriller, humour, and high doses of irony. To top things, the main character is a writer. Like me! Only that I am not as successful as Castle is... Anyways...<br /><br />I really liked this book, but I keep on thinking that the TV show is better. The ending was a bit predictable and I would have tightened a bit more certain scenes. But nonetheless it is a good and entertaining book. So if you like watching Castle, don't miss reading about the first adventure of Nikki Heat: suspense, romance, humour, and all the elements to make you turn the pages.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I took all my grandkids (5) at the time, to go see this movie when it came out and we all just loved it! Because I'm a Amazon Prime Member, we can stream this movie free with the Amazon membership! Well worth the $$ per year! Will renew and keep watching the movies on Amazon!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read. Hard to put down. Suspenseful, with well New developed characters and a welcomed return of old friends  from A Time to Kill. In all, the best book I have read this year.
1781162646|4.0|not the normal S.King story,not to say thats a bad thing.I found this story interesting and kept my attention.Don`t go into this thinking its horror it is not!But for all you fans who said its not his normal type of story well read the cover it says hard case crime.I got it from the library because of the 3 and 2 star reviews and didn`t want to spend money on a bad book.It was a GOOD book,I thought the story was really well written and loved the story about the little boy.
6301797906|4.0|An excellent video.  I actually liked it a lot.  It needed another chapter, however.  We need a happy ending for Tom and the whole family.  With a happy ending, I'll give it 5 stars.<br /><br />The service by Amazon was excellent.  I give them 5 stars.<br /><br />  Fred Shetler
B00A285OOW|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. It was well written, and I  hated to see it end. I would read it again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Started playing the Facebook version on my pc months ago, but was able to download the kindle version and continue where I left off.<br /><br />It's challenging at times, but getting to the next level is very rewarding. Plus the story each section is very cute. As you level up you have to get more creative in using the special candies to achieve the task.
B00BXKOMT6|5.0|A definitely nice read. It is a little bit rough on some edges, but compensates with fast-paced action and lots of event turning.
B0047VEE0U|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2FHXMPB0PT96C]]If you're a fan of Harry Potter or just a fan of film music (perhaps you're both like I am), then you've no doubt considered purchasing this Collector's Edition soundtrack for \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1\\".  Well, I can tell you that I don't regret my purchase, but I was not completely satisfied with it's value either.  The main selling points are an additional 6 tracks of Alexandre Desplat's score that were not included on the original soundtrack album, as well as a variety of collectibles and memorabilia from the film.<br /><br />The breakdown of disc content:<br />DISC 1: Soundtrack CD - 26 tracks (same as regular release)<br />DISC 2: Soundtrack Bonus CD - 6 exclusive tracks<br />DISC 3: Audio DVD w/ 5.1 Channel Surround Mix of the score<br /><br />Most listeners and fans will probably not be satisfied with the 6 Bonus Tracks, which total around 15 minutes.  Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 had such a subdued and low-key score that its among the least memorable of all the Potter albums - and the tracks on bonus disc do little to change that.  The most memorable of the new tracks is \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\", but that's about it - there's no exclusive music here that even comes close to matching the best tracks of the regular release (one assumes this fact is precisely why the bonus music was left off the original album release in the first place).  What I do not understand is of all the Harry Potter soundtracks to make a Collector's Edition for, this is the last one I would have picked given my personal preference.<br /><br />Here are the additional items included in this set:<br />- Numbered Certificate of Authenticity<br />- 7\\" double-sided vinyl disc.  It's very nice, but if you're planning on playing it you should know that it only plays 2 songs.<br />- Film Cell display card w/ two 35mm film frames.<br />- Sheet Music for the track \\"The Detonators\\" w/ Desplat's signature (nice, but obviously not individually hand-signed)<br />- Banner-style Poster - folded down the middle to fit in the box; the crease doesn't lend itself to being worthy of display.<br /><br />One key blunder in the product design is the lack of protection of the contents - the box is simply too big, and there is no padding inside.  This leaves the collectibles to be tossed around inside the box (especially if you're having it shipped from an online retailer).  The discs do not come in a jewel case, but are inserted into cardboard-type slots inside the box - anyone familiar with this style of packaging knows that it increases the chance that the discs will be scratched.<br /><br />So while there is a lot to like about this set, the whole is not quite the sum of its parts.

B00F4BJ4M0|3.0|i like the sound of the original 1994 release because it has deeper bass & it sounds fuller on a home stereo.  the new remaster although clear sounds tinny in comparison.<br /><br />for me, i will stay with my 1994 copy & skip this remaster.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I have not finished the book....but up  to now it is different than any other book  ever read.  One learns how the young people acted in Germany during the Nazi years.  All young people had to join the Hitler Youths......Interesting how these young people felt about the whole thing,  from forced to salute by saying Heil Hitler  to studying the book Mein Kampf.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book made me laugh SO hard.  It was so refreshing to read a book strictly from the male POV and ACTUALLY have it sound authentic.  I kept reading parts to my husband, which I normally don't do when I'm reading a book, and the fact that he found them funny as well just proved to me that Ms. Chase was on to something.  At the same time, it was a true love story.  I loved seeing the progression from lust, to curiousity, to challenge, to competition, and back to lust and love again.  I can't wait to read more of their story, but was glad that there was no cliffhanger.  Too many of THOSE books going around these days.  Two thumbs way way up!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Liked the book but hated the ending.  Disappointed that it ended the way that it did.  I'm trying to use up the required words here.  Stupid
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is just an excellent tool for all of us, comparing many Bible translations and the NWT is always is the easiest to understand.  Thank you.
0920236251|2.0|I ordered both the board book and the paperback versions.  I love the original text so I thought that the board book was a little dumbed down and lost something in the translation.  I would have preferred the original text, even though its a bit longer, in the board book format.  Also the board book I received wasn't completely flat - it seemed a bit warped which was a disappointment because it is supposed to be a gift.  I didn't realize before I ordered that the paperback version is basically a mini-book.  It is about the size of a folded book of stamps; maybe slightly larger than that.  I opened the package and couldn't believe how small it was.  I think it would easily get lost in my purse!<br /><br />My advice for anyone would be to spend the money on the hardcover version or you will likely be disappointed.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|By now you know that A Visit from the Goon Squad has won a litany of prizes, chief among them the Pulitzer for fiction.  But a quick scan of the reviews here will tell you that the book does not necessarily resonate with all readers.  It is certainly different.  Egan is adventurous, (the controversial \\"power point\\" chapter for instance) and the structure isn't for everybody.  But most of all, this is a novel about the passage of time and its effects on people and relationships, and if that's not something a reader has thought much about, or is currently interested in, the book may not speak to them.<br /><br />I'm in my 40's, and time is increasingly interesting to me. Egan did a wonderful job conveying many of the observations and angsts I've begun to feel as I've aged, having now lived long enough to \\"look back\\" and see some of time's effects.  She does so with a series of brilliant interlocking narratives where characters take turns being central and peripheral.  You'll start one narrative having no idea how this new voice relates to the ones you've already read, and then Egan ties it together, sometimes well into the new story.  I enjoyed making the connections and tying them back to earlier characters and events.<br /><br />A Visit from the Goon Squad also has something to say about the way communication has changed just since the 1970's.  Characters \\"lose\\" each other as they age, but as the internet emerges as a central means of communication Egan observes through one character that we won't lose each other anymore, and in fact, it will be hard to get lost.<br /><br />I feel like this novel is a bit of a memento mori, and I enjoy such reflections.  I can understand how some readers did not relate to the characters, but for me they were an interesting way to think about the passage of time.  I recommend this book with the caveat that it is different.  It is certainly a worthwhile read.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game has great graphics and the animals are very realistic,the long shots however,could use some range numbers.I love the long shots  but I would love to know how far away they are<br />when the targets fall
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this is a great way to start a career being a hair stylist even my 19 year old Sissy loves it  I will be up all night yes!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00G3Q6VPS|1.0|Boring!  Slow songs...all sound like they've been remixed.  None of the songs are catchy.  HUGE flop.  We need more hits!
B0081SRJSY|1.0|I installed and tried to open the game, but I just get the title screen which is not responsive. I uninstalled and reinstalled, but it won't go past the opening screen
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was such a touching story! The movie could never capture the intense story like the words. So well written. Best book I have read in a long time.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Everyone in our family loves to this game...they fight over who gets to play, but they also help each other find items.  I like the fact that it has a somewhat built in time limit-they use &quot;energy&quot; for each picture they search and it runs out and they have to wait.  In my opinion, as a mother, they could stand to wait longer (I think children get too much screen time in general).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is challenging, addictive and frustrating - what more could you want? May I have a lollipop hammer now?
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I was hesitant to read this book, to be honest. I very much enjoyed her first book ad very much hated her second. I was afraid I would be disappointed again. I am happy to say I am far from disappointed. When I finished this book I felt like I was coming up for air and I am going to miss the characters.
B000059GEH|5.0|This is one of Marilyn Monroe's best movies. She is a true comedienne.  Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable round out the perfect trio for setting a bear trap. Funny movie!
0553103547|5.0|I just got this today, the quality of the book is awesome! It's definitely going to last a long time and look really nice on my shelf. I LOVE the television series and I am so excited to read the book series-which everyone raves about! :)
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|Just received mine today. LOVE it! The detail is so accurate, it looks exactly like Daryl. The quality is excellent. The box arrived in mint condition with no wear and tear or nicks. I haven't opened it, and I won't open it. The poncho is removable. It's not made of fabric. It's some type of hard plastic or resin. But I still love it! Once again, I'm pleased with McFarlane's superior product. A must have for any Walking Dead fan.

B00B5HQLMI|3.0|had to get used to Bond/D.Craig looking so old and vulnerable.  crazy adversary was interesting.  lizard fight was ridiculous, in fact most of the fights were not up to par....train chase was vintage Bond, well done.
B00DYEN5QU|4.0|Excellent movie!! A new vision for the man of tomorrow. Maybe it's because of the success of The Dark Knight trilogy and The Avengers. A more realistic view and a discussion of a s super powerful being on Earth.<br />And I was very impressed with a refund due a price drop on the release date of this movie.<br />The only problem is that UltraViolet is not available in Brazil so I can't download the digital copy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|omgi got this on my I pad it works amazing,! people who.made this game rock! the graphics rock! if on your Pc your looking for a game get star stable
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I read the ENTIRE \\"Silo Saga\\" (this book all the way to the last one \\"Dust\\") and I can say unequivocally, this series sucks. I know what you're thinking, if it sucks so bad why did you read the whole thing? I hate to be cliche, but it was like a train wreck I couldn't look away from. I was duped into starting the series after reading some of the positive reviews. After reading the first book, I was amused but not really impressed. The writing was poor, but the storyline had potential. I erroneously thought that the series would get better. I was wrong. I should have given up entirely after I read the second book. It was written poorly AND it obliterated the story line. I'm not one of those people who can easily just cut my losses and move on. Once I'm in, I'm in.... so I finished the series.... doh!!<br /><br />(1) It's unimaginative. It's as if a 6th grader read a \\"How to Write Science Fiction\\" book and regurgitated the prescribed forms. I kept expecting twists and turns, but only got an impotent plot that dragged on and on; (2) The science is totally unbelievable and eye-rollingly naive... not to mention unimaginative. Nanotechnology (made synonymous with biological warfare, circa 1910), predator drones (circa 1994), giant computer servers (circa 1980s), and grow lights, that's as edgy as it gets; (3) The sociology and political science is way off too. One of the things I like about SF is the way in which SF writers use technology and a futuristic context to probe deeper questions of ethics, political philosophy, and human nature (like PKD). No insight was forthcoming in this series, and it made me mad how naive and unoriginal his \\"social critique\\" was; (4) The ending of the series is an absolute joke... hands down, one of the most contrived, tactless endings to a SF series I have ever read; (5) Howey's writing style is extremely tedious. The amount of superfluous detail that Howey goes into is excruciating. Also, the sub-stories are schizophrenic, red-hearings that add nothing to the overall storyline. Between the pages and pages of superfluous details and the pointless side stories, it's obvious that the entire series is a money making scheme. It is replete with \\"fillers.\\" Howey definitely didn't write this series as art for art's sake... it's clear that from the start, he endeavored to exploit the free-for-all that is e-publishing to make a quick buck.<br /><br />Reading this series was a waste of my time.  Don't make the same mistake!!!the fact that this side-story is creepy, it has nothing to do with the story-line whatsoever. Anyway, the rebellious silo dwellers use a big digging machine to dig their way out of the silo and away from the cluster (of the other 49 silos).  When the rebellious silo dwellers get to the other side, they realize that the rest of the world is like the Garden of Eden. They look back from where they came from, and see a cloud of bad air hovering over the silo cluster.  Apparently, over time the rest of the world had returned to normal, and the toxic \\"nano-air\\" was just surrounding the vicinity of the cluster of 50 silos (?). The rebellious silo dwellers live happily ever after in the open air. THE END<br /><br />Reading this series was a waste of my time.  Don't make the same mistake!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have downloaded and played tons of puzzle and point/click adventure games but have NEVER seen one like this before.  INCREDIBLE!!  Fun, challenging, frustrating and completely addictive!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I really was expecting a lot more from it after so much advertising. I can only transfer to TV videos from Chrome and Google products. I don't think that worth it. Be aware!
B001EBWING|5.0|I ordered this movie for a school project for my wife and the movie is a old movie from way back. It is a classic still and worth having a any collection. Who doesn't Bogart
B00CTT9646|1.0|The gun came apart since I took it out of the box, very bad for a very expensive gift set.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is great for everyone. There is always something new to do each day and the puzzle pieces and red Apple's are also really fun to try. I love the fluffy unicorn ITS SO FLUFFY!!!!!<br />  So yeah I think you should get this app. It's cool and not that hard to learn the instructions. It is similar to temple run or subway surfer.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This was a great action moving with interesting angles. I thought it was great in terms of how it followed the disease a bit more than most zombie movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|To me this book was the best book ever! It is so adventurous and is so dangerous! The second I started this book I could not stop reading it ! I read it over and over! It was amazing!
075640407X|3.0|I don't know. A friend recommended this book to me, I have not finished reading it, but I can tell you that I am in no hurry to finish it either. I was into it for the first few chapters, but then the story changed drastically and lost my attention. When I say the story changed I mean the perspective and the plot. I read a lot of high fantasy fiction and this book just does not excite my imagination.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is the perfect solution for cleaning up your Android and I highly recommend it! A must have to keep things working properly.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Wait until the last book is released before starting on the &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; book addiction, so you can make an informed time commitment.<br />Unaware that there is yet no ending to the stories I started reading the Game of Thrones series (5 books so far). It was well recommended by a couple of friends and the ratings were good. About half way through the 4th book I started looking for the next one (not part of the 4 book set that I bought for the Kindle), only to find that there will also be a book 6 and maybe one  or two more.<br />Let's be fair, the books are interesting and the stories engaging, but you have to be ready to read nothing else for at least a couple of months. These are good sized books! Had I known this I would not started the series. Believe it or not, I have a life outside of my reading chair. And don't think that you can put the books down and restart a week later, there are too many interweaved stories and way too many characters to remember without loosing continuity.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was very vivid like I could see everything that was happening. This the best book I have read. I recommend this book to anyone.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I know other people with the kindle are having the same problem; I try to log in so I type in my information and when I press &quot;log in&quot; it says &quot;The log in is taking longer than expected, please try again later.&quot; When I contacted the kik corporation it said they don't have an app for the kindle fire, so the makers of this app are just ridiculous.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Slow and kinda boring not any action weird how you can't just pay to upgrade your storage or sell everything to make room
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Best Die Hard yet - loved the father/son dynamic<br />also, the son's profession, now lends itself to future Die Hards with son & dad working together
B008JFUNJQ|3.0|I loved the original short story and enjoyed the book.  The movie took an interesting exploration of psychology and ethics and turned it into a testosterone-driven anti-authoritarian angst-fest for teenage boys. It wasn't completely unredeemable -- it did have some exploration of right/wrong but turned an ethical conflict into an interpersonal one. It tried to emphasize how much Ender was manipulated and in doing so completely missed the true scale of the manipulation in the book. It was watchable and partially engaging -- a better translation to screen than was Starship Troopers. Overall: rent it if anything, but don't bother is fine.
0316017930|4.0|Engaging examples of how society works and a testament that a closer look will often reveal that things aren't always as they appear on the surface. This book prompted much lively discussion with others who were familiar with it.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's not Christmas until you've watched &#34;Its a Wonderful Life&#34;. What classic to behold!  This movie makes me appreciate my life.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Definitely a fun game. The action is solid for a kindle game and the graphics are crisp. Definitely recommend this.
0307592731|5.0|Inspiring and honest. I can understand why there has been an upsurge of hikers on the Pacific Coast Trail. Definitely worth reading.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|There are a ton of great things to think about in this book. It's a quick read I will enjoy again and again.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this series since it's inception.  My only complaint was the character, Deborah, with all the foul language.  I don't think it was necessary.  Would recommend the series.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Picked up this album in town the other day and absolutely love it! I'm always looking for Christmas music and the Piano Guys are great! Definitely would recommend it! Relaxing and seasonal, the perfect thing for the holidays!
B008JFURII|5.0|A fun action filled movie and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Would recommend the movie to anyone wanting an entertaining evening.
B000002J1S|5.0|Great DVD of a Great Band With Peter Gabriel as the Front Man. Genesis was one of my favorite Bands Growing up and This gives me the chance to see that all over again.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|Great movie!! My grand daughter and I really enjoyed it!! The songs and characters in this movie are so much fun!!
B000E41JUC|5.0|One of the Better Groups from todays music. If your not familiar with Porcupine tree Get one of their CD's and check them out. A good find and a Good Price.
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|Previews made the movie look pretty funny. Unfortunately most of the really funny lines were shown in the previews. We were all glad we didn't spend big bucks to see it in the theatre.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I will read his book again.  It is an amazing journey of the soul.  I thought the &#34;love&#34; section a bit weak and predictable, however it does not spoil the entire journey. Maybe on second read, I will be able to understand the third section better.
B00GQ7OZR0|2.0|I loved Dexter seasons 1, 2, and 4.  Season 3 was OK, season 5 was OK.  I didn't care for 6 (sigh...Colin Hanks, I expected better of you).  7 was tolerable.  8 was bad.  Just plain bad.<br /><br />I won't reveal any spoilers, but the plot was bad and the series finale was bad.  I really wish they would have wrapped up Dexter after 5 seasons.  I wish season 5 had been devoted to the downfall of Dexter (getting caught by Quinn AND LaGuerta...Why did LaGuerta never talk to Quinn about his suspicions from season 5?).<br /><br />The writers apparently saw Dexter as a folk hero vigilante playing out their daytime fantasies.  As much as I loved Dexter the thing I wanted most was for him to have to face his biggest fear: go to jail (plus having his son and everyone know who he really was).
B00EV6T6DQ|3.0|Thought I was getting a novel; instead i received a cartoon format.  Would like to read this book w/o the cartoon drawings.  The story is a bit weak. The women are a bit pouty. I really didn't love this book.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|This works great on my phone.  The only problem I have with it is that the cord is too short.
B00FAVRFXE|3.0|While this is an excellent episode, I think the fans were expecting more from a 50th Anniversary show... namely, more Doctors..  we have the technology to digitally add them, why not take this opportunity.  (seeing them on tiny monitors does not count.)<br /><br />Meanwhile, I am so glad that they have added The Night of the Doctor to this DVD,<br />BUT, where is the hilarious mockumentary, The Five(ish) Doctors??  It was  produced as a gift for the fans who wanted to see other Doctors and companions participate in the 50th Anniversary episode, and we were all hoping it would be on the DVD.  Also,  an Adventure in Space and Time, about the beginnings of Doctor Who, should also be included.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 8 year-old and I love taking turns and trying to out do each other.  Very fun, fast-paced game. Definitely worth your time.
B00ERP55NQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing, instantly with ease locate everything from smart phone, tablet and computer. An essential when traveling, gets you the nearest gas station, best hotel and food choices available. Super, super app.
B005LAII44|4.0|The plot was good.  The acting was pretty good.  Lots of action.  I definitely enjoyed watching this movie.  I will certainly watch it again.  I highly recommend it.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|The best and most thorough search app. It's google, what do you expect.  Thanks' google, keep up the Good Work.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|It came when you promised and it just what was promised, just what she wanted, keep up the good work
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wow!  I'm usually pretty good at figuring out what is going to happen in books, but so many moments in this were unexpected...a fascinating and exhilarating read
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Absolutely excellent!  So much appreciate the talent and the good music.  The best new album I have heard in a long time.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The app works fine but because of the size it only fit one of my TV's. it was a little trick to download but now it is running fine. I use my smartphone to run it which is cool. They need to make it smaller to fit all TV's.
B00B97TMIE|5.0|This is a really great album. I like almost every song. Can't wait to hear future songs to as well!
B001BZF9UY|5.0|It also has the best music composed for the trilogy!<br />When I first purchased this CD I had my doubts as to whether or not I might like the whole thing.  But I found out that I LOVED it so much!  This is perhaps the best orchestral score in the Trilogy series much in the same way Jablonsky's did in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.  Zimmer and Jablonsky seem to find what goes right in the first and brings it out more fully in the second.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I love her writing, so satisfying.  While it isn't quite as good as Eleanor and Park it comes close. I can't wait to read her next book.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this game, if there a second game out I'm getting it. So like I said, this is a very fun game to play.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|If Veronica Roth ever happens to see this there's a few things that she must hear. I LOVED Divergent. It's the BEST book ever, I loved Insurgent it's my number 2 book. I was so sad when I found out that there wasn't a third book, and when I found out their was I counted down every single day even though it came out the next year. When I started to read it, I loved it. When they went out side of the fences it blew my mind and the rest was downhill. HOW COULD YOU KILL TRIS PRIOR!!!!! She was the best person ever! She was way more than a character to me!<br /><br />  If you ever read this, could you do something for me, please? Wright a 4th book. Make it so Tris found out that the last day of her life was a dream and then when she wakes up she keeps her gun with her and she shoots David. Or her ashes magically reform from the dust and she returns clothed in mud. Or maybe some one else was shot and she's been living in the walls for a few years or something. Or they made a syringe that made it so she could come back to life and a lot of people try to use it and it starts a war or something. Please consider this idea.
B00BBA6FMU|4.0|I liked the book, and I liked the story because it shows the way the slaves lived and the differences between the house and the field slaves were treated.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|it is so awesome and great I love it but sometimes it messes up and I don't like that part

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Catchy, fun, inspirational... Lady gaga at her best. A true pick-me-up album, to be listened to at full blast. And the foiled cover is just beautiful!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best game ever and I wish it was like the PC but its still awesome. I cant think of any game better than this on my kindle!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|no clear instructions, game seemed to just begin..i had no idea what or how to manage the game..really, need a set number of words to be able to give an opinion...this sucks!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come out for the kindle fire HD for awhile. I played  the ios version, an it wasn't as detailed an smoother then the one on the kindle. I has been well worth the wait. I loved the one for Xbox 360, this is just a good addition to the injustice family.
B002J8LVO0|5.0|U2's best album as far as this listener is concerned.  I should have bought 2 copies as it was a gift and mine is on disc.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|This is an awesome game. Only thing is that you can't redeem the coins that are given to you as gifts.
B00957T6X6|3.0|Warning to those looking to purchase this! Read the following before you do:<br /><br />When I purchased this book I thought it was a box set as in 5 different books for one low price. However, that is not the case. Instead it is one huge book with all five of them back to back. While that is slightly annoying, the more frustrating part is how my kindle (paperwhite) detected the book. While there is a table of contents at the very beginning which links to each chapter, the actual chapters aren't registered with the kindle. Instead, the kindle acts as if each BOOK is a chapter. So upon opening the book for the first time I was told I had 27 hours until I finished the chapter.<br /><br />Giving three stars because it is still a very good price to get all five stories but feels like a very hacky reading experience.

B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|If you've been waiting for Boston to return to its roots and make more of its 'classic' sound, then I advise you to pass.  If you like the music Boston has been releasing after the first three albums, then give this one a chance.<br /><br />There are two main categories of responses to this album showing up:  &#34;This is fantastic; classic Boston!&#34; and &#34;Don't waste your money on this garbage.&#34;  To be blunt, I don't hear classic Boston.  However, I certainly don't hear garbage.<br /><br />I'm giving Life, Love & Hope five stars because Amazon says 'five stars' means &#34;I love it.&#34;  And I do love this album.<br /><br />As a fan of every Boston album - including Walk On and Corporate America - what I hear is a collection of music that I really enjoy.  &#34;Heaven on Earth&#34; is a good start - it's strong enough to be catchy, but it doesn't clear out the best the album has to offer at the start.  Second in the line-up is a bit of an odd choice:  &#34;Didn't Mean to Fall in Love,&#34; taken directly from the Corporate America album.  However, I feel like it fits well where it was put, and I still like it whether I'm justified in that opinion or not.<br /><br />Now the album takes a sharp turn into its strongest points, starting with the instrumental &#34;Last Day of School,&#34; which I find to be one of the most interesting directions taken for this album.  I've found myself humming it several times already.  When the instrumental fun is over, &#34;Sail Away&#34; kicks in with maybe the greatest departure from the Boston style ever released - thumping bass and chanting vocals more angry even than &#34;Corporate America&#34; from the previous album, quickly shifting to soft piano and back again.  There's some irony to the change in sound, given that this is the last song that the late, great singer Brad Delp contributed for a studio Boston release.  &#34;Sail Away&#34; is easily one of my favorites from this album.<br /><br />The dark vibes from &#34;Sail Away&#34; are swiftly cleared by the upbeat title track, &#34;Life, Love & Hope.&#34;  A happy rocker with a simple message, and it does its job well with a guitar solo that borders on funk.  The next song is &#34;If You Were in Love,&#34; sung by Kimberly Dahme.  I just love this song.  Ironically, it's as close to classic Boston (think Third Stage) as this album gets, in my opinion.  Next is &#34;Someday;&#34; very upbeat, very positive, very catchy.<br /><br />&#34;Love Got Away&#34; is Tom Scholz' first lead vocal ever released, and I like it a great deal.  Tom's voice works (surprisingly?) well with the music, which is very well-done in its own right.  Afterwards are two rearrangements of songs from the Corporate America album, &#34;Someone (2.0)&#34; and &#34;You Gave Up on Love (2.0).&#34;  Interestingly enough, these have been arranged differently enough and have enough new to them that I feel their inclusion on the new album is justified.  Especially noteworthy is the addition of Spanish-style guitar like that of &#34;Didn't Mean to Fall in Love&#34; in &#34;You Gave Up on Love (2.0).&#34;<br /><br />Last and far from least, the closing track:  &#34;The Way You Look Tonight.&#34;  It's tender and heartfelt, and an excellent mood to close the album with.<br /><br />So, as I already said, I love this album.  I understand that there are strongly-divided opinions on this album, but don't let someone from either side persuade you to drop money instantly or to never give this music a chance.
0316228583|3.0|Strengths: The multiple plots are very deftly interwoven, and there are elements of suspense in each and elements of suspense throughout that make you want to keep reading. The writing is clear and straightforward, not particularly elegant, but it doesn't get in the way.<br /><br />Problems: Think of the multiple plot-lines as making up a web -- everything is connected, but there isn't a clear shape to the whole thing. You can break down the individual lines and find some shape -- and that helps you keep reading -- but where's the shape to the whole? There are many generational conflicts and familial tensions, but it's hard to see anything emerging as a kind of thematic center out of the varieties of these. In a sense, there's too much going on, perhaps, to be drawn together. The canonical writer who does this kind of thing better is Dickens, but one could say that in \\"Nicholas Nickleby,\\" for example, you just have to go with a not-very-well-centered mass of plot elements just as you do here, and, one could argue, these are melodramatic within the conventions of Dickens's time in a way that Rowling's plots are melodramatic -- like the stories on reality TV -- by the conventions of ours. \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\" is compulsively readable, and to Rowling's credit, her book is too. It's long, and I couldn't put it down. But there are novels by Dickens like \\"Bleak House\\" and \\"Little Dorrit\\" where the variety of invention coexists with clear central themes that pull things together. Let's see if in later novels Rowling can bring that degree of coherence to diverse material. \\"Harry Potter\\" -- all six volumes of it -- suggests that she maybe could, but she hasn't done it yet. Her later novel, \\"The Cuckoo's Calling,\\" is a fine mystery procedural, but that's a less ambitious genre.<br /><br />One could perhaps argue that \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" and \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\" share a great theme: innocence in danger. The trouble is that it's hard to see Rowling's innocents (with the exception of Robbie, perhaps) as really innocent. Most of the young characters are damaged and unattractive to start with. And there isn't a central malevolent force who emerges -- like Ralph Nickleby -- as a focus for the forces that threaten innocence. Too many of Rowling's characters are dangers to themselves and others for such a focus to be clear. The closest thing to a central sinister figure is himself a teenager, Stuart \\"Fats\\" Wall -- but he's not, in his destructiveness and unhappiness, sufficiently different from the other damaged children to really fill that central role. For a sinister adult figure, there's Howard Mollison -- but the effects of his machinations do not obviously fall on the younger characters. As for the causes of the unhappiness of the younger characters, one can point to shortcomings of the parents, but the book doesn't really allow you to generalize about that -- they're screwed up in so many different ways. And oddly (or ironically), the children who suffer the trauma of parental death seem to be quite well adjusted throughout.<br /><br />The author has to know everything, but he or she doesn't have to TELL everything. Space needs to be left for the reader's engagement through inferential interpretation. It's a weakness of the novel, I think, that Rowling's narrator is in EVERYBODY'S head. The characters are all explained; their inner thoughts are laid bare. There is nothing mysterious or fascinating about them. One could argue that the sheer number of the characters whose interwoven stories she is telling requires Rowling to be explicit to the point of over-explicitness in order to keep the reader from getting confused by the sheer number of characters about whom inferences would have to be made (and remembered) with a less heavy narrator presence. Maybe . . . . but I still worry about the sheer amount to information conveyed so bluntly.<br /><br />For all that, there are vividly realized scenes nonetheless, often embarrassed social encounters, that Rowling brings off well. And some readers don't mind being told rather than shown. With all that, and the impressive plot-line weaving, this is a highly readable book. It's a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion: you can't look away from these overwrought, melodramatic figures.rs, that Rowling brings off well.

B00DJUPLY8|3.0|I've been searching for an android player capable of showing the subtitles in the mkv video files I watch. This is the first of all to be able to show them. Also, the video rendering seems to be pretty good as well. No problems so far!!!<br /><br />Edit: Ok, so after some usage with different file types I have found this play reasonable, not worth 4 or 5 stars. It seems pretty capable at playing and handling subtitle on mkv files but it seems to have trouble with other file formats like mp4. Also, when I try to edit settings for the player there is a big problem. When I change a setting and scroll down to change other settings I see that when I look back the settings return to their defaults. It is a pretty big problem for me. [btw, I use a Kindle Fire HDX 7\\"]
B00FGM0JTY|4.0|Great documentary that goes behind the scenes for anyone interested in where all this great music originated. Fans of Rolling Stones will love it.
B00EKQ3YZI|2.0|I was one of Donna's biggest fans, even through the disco 'revolt' days. I was so psyched to get this CD. It didn't take long to realize that for the most part, this was an insult to a legend. Who could  even think to substitute someone else's vocals on 'Working the midnight shift'? I mean, really? 'Dim all the Lights' and 'MacArthur's Park' are simply awful. seriously, the only fresh take was on 'Hot Stuff'. Save your money fans.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|This story is an easy read, and definitely starts off immediately upon opening the book. I really like the immediate dive into the cause of the book. I did think that the conversation and tone felt forced at times. I think that Thiede has a LOT to offer to a good crime mystery book series. This book would be a 5-star if it developed in the vocabulary and did not feel so forced. I may have a hard time sleeping though, and I have definitely been double checking all of my locks.<br /><br />I would DEFINITELY recommend this book to young adults who are just branching into crime mysteries. I am going to be keeping the book for my children to read as they become old enough. I had a hard time putting it down, even if I did feel as if it was not quite fluid.<br /><br />Pros: Has you drawn into the story, and you are stuck there until you get through the book.<br />Cons: Conversations between characters was off. The details and descriptions were put in a bit odd, taking a bit from the story. However, if you can get past these two points, the book is a terrific read.<br /><br />I look forward to the next book in the Max Larkin series!
0920668372|5.0|It took a long time for me reading this book multiple times to finally be able to read it without crying or at least not profusely. My daughter is not in love with the book as I hoped but I think it's more that she just loves all kinds of books. I bought a recordable Love You Forever book from hallmark so that I could record my voice reading the book as a keepsake for my daughter. I haven't been able to record it yet because I still get a little choked up....
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The opening scene of the pilot is one of the greatest hooks I have ever seen, I was in for the duration after watching it.
0140177396|5.0|I do not usually read many books, but this Steinbeck's novel kept me intrigued 'til the end. Different feelings are experienced in this story such as friendship, loyalty, deception, lonliness, racism. The main characters, George and Lennie, want to succeed in their lives, so they work hard to get it. The ending is unexpected because one of them takes a very difficult decision, and the rest of the story let the reader understand why he decides that. In contrast to the movie (1992), the end has no explanation. I highly recommend this book because it shows greatly friendship and loyalty between them.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I've read a lot of books on on spirituality where the authors have launched into these long esoteric monologues that have just left my head spinning, only to find myself skimming for the salient points that were promised on the cover of the book. This book is completely different!  Pam gets right to the heart of the matter in a clear, no BS, to-the-point, and whimsical manner that conveys her message in the simplest of terms without all the stuffy, mamby pamby sentimentality that this genre is known for.  As a result, you're actually going to get something out of this book that you can use!<br /><br />But beware...it's not all for the faint of heart. Oh we love to daydream about manifestation and creating our desires from our Source, but one of the exercises calls upon your intuition. And if your intuition returns an answer that counters your desire, you're left with a choice: obey that intuition or defy it. It could be the greatest exercise in the book, because it might just cause you to dig. (Note to Pam: a book on learning to trust and follow the intuition may be a great follow-up to E-squared.)<br /><br />This book doesn't try to convince you to \\"believe\\" in these principles; it challenges you to \\"know.\\"  And \\"knowing\\" is much deeper than merely believing. You can believe something all you want, but only when you truly know something have you arrived. If you're ready to stop reciting and practicing theory and start experiencing reality, this book is for you. It's brief enough that you can easily review the chapters again and again so that you can stay in the mindset of the exercise.  It is a brilliant and inspired work!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I give this two stars not really bc of the writing.  Roth is a good writer. (Though, I'll agree, she didn't give the characters different voices so it was hard to remember who was telling the story at times. Overall though, I enjoyed being able to hear from Tobias' POV. She also left a number of holes in the story but I was already too attaché to the characters to care about that. ) I give it two stars bc I hated it. I hated the ending so much that it honestly made me regret ever picking up the first book. That has never happened to me before. Other series, sure there may be bits and pieces I would have preferred happen differently... But with this book, it was just so horrible I wanted some  Serum to forget it all!!!  I felt let down by so much of the build up they left me with at the end of book 2. As for the ending, I felt it coming but I kept pushing the thought away, thinking the author would work some kind of magic and give me the happy ending I was seeking after so much death and sorrow. That never came. I put the book down with tears in my eyes and a hollow spot somewhere.  I inserted myself into this story. I fell in love with the characters and the places and ways of life. After she killed off almost EVERYONE you care about in this story, she sticks a knife in your gut and walks away. So much death and destruction, if there was EVER a story that needed a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel, THIS WAS THE STORY!
044024367X|1.0|I have been on a Jack Reacher bender since discovering him several months ago.  Obsessive about following the exact order of the books, I have listened to each on CDs and have found each highly entertaining and gripping.  This one fell so far short in both areas that I mentally lapsed throughout, having to go back to catch up (yes, I know I didn't &#34;have&#34; to, but did I mention I have a compulsive bent?).  There is a sense of nothing having been developed or completed, neither the characters nor the various random subplots.  I finally finished it moments ago and instead of the usual sense of hating to see the book end, I am glad to be done with it and start the next one.  I'm not giving up on Child, but this one's a loser.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Five stars because, this is an entertaining action film with monsters and robots where the male and female protagonists are not subjected to unnecessary romantic tension.
B008LXZEYU|4.0|Legendary cast and cameos by great comedic actors.  All turned in a fun performance.  Slapstick humor not really my style but it was still entertaining.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this instead of a smart Blu-ray player for use in a bedroom, since there is a PS3 in the house that play blu-rays and have access to most apps. It is extremely easy to set up and use and every app I've used with it has worked very well. If you subscribe to HBO, access to HBO Go has been limited to mobile devices / tablets and XBOX Live (which I refuse to pay for because, Netflix, Hulu+ and various other entertainments apps should be free considering, you pay for those services individually). Being able to catch up on full seasons of shows using an actual television -- not a smaller-screen device, or sitting in front of a computer -- makes the price of this well worth it. It's also really good for listening to music, especially if you have a Google Music subscription. It is small enough to conveniently travel with, so you could use it in hotels and in other's homes (and maybe even the Doctor's office, if they have WiFi and you feel so inclined). I think the apps that currently work for this device and potential for more app support in the future makes this a good deal.
B004UID2LC|5.0|i love this app. is the best app, we could have found is easy en fast, give what it offers
B00F2362IE|4.0|I thought I would never get this app because of the price but I got it free on black Friday.
B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|Disclaimer - this is coming from a fan who was completely obsessed in the early days...I grew up musically on the classic albums. I'm not \\"stuck in the past\\" thinking BOSTON should sound like the first two albums, but I do believe the evolution of Tom's sound has not been as good as it could have been.<br /><br />The liner notes confirm that this is really Tom's solo project, with other artists brought in for vocals, and an occasional guitar lead (Gary Pihl), harmonica (Curly Smith), and flute (Kimberley Dahme). If you're envisioning a group of artists collaborating, rehearsing, and then finally recording together, that didn't happen here, and from what I gather, didn't happen on the other albums either. I envision Tom toiling over most of it, for months/years on end, and then \\"layering on\\" the vocals and other non-Tom bits. I think this partially explains why Tom doesn't use a human drummer.<br /><br />Generally speaking...someone named Tommy summarized it well with \\"Good music, not great rock and roll.\\" There are token BOSTON elements included of course...I will say that I think the hand-claps are overdone on this one. If you're looking for a \\"heavier\\" track, in line with past releases (Walk On Medley, Cool the Engines, Foreplay/Long Time, etc.), you don't get one here. The music generally lacks \\"fullness,\\" in that there is not much emphasis on the low end /drums, a pattern Tom's been following a lot since \\"Third Stage.\\" I listened to this CD with my \\"good\\" headphones with associated DAC, but they were not necessary.<br /><br />'Heaven on Earth' is a decent song with the \\"modern BOSTON\\" sound Tom maintains, and David Victor's vocals are pleasant. This is the strongest track on the album.<br /><br />'Didn't Mean to Fall in Love' was, for me, the best track on \\"Corporate America\\" ... remastered for this one, although my ears don't detect any appreciable difference. I think Tom simply wanted to give it greater attention by throwing it in for slot number two, which is \\"supposed\\" to be a strong track as albums go. I don't think any of the other tracks would have fit the bill, except perhaps the title track, and placing it second would have been \\"too soon.\\"<br /><br />'Last Day of School' was \\"performed publicly for the first time on the huge pipe organ at Boston's Symphony Hall...\\" got me looking forward to some thundering organ work, but alas, there was none. I do like the piano pieces, but it would have been nice to have some more organ too, and if not on this track, other tracks. And I don't mean \\"sprinkled in\\" organ here and there...something significant. Less hand-claps, more organ, please.<br /><br />'Sail Away' had some good potential with the piano work and Brad's vocals, but IMO it falls short musically. I can't exactly put my finger on what is off, but I believe it has to do with the chorus, in that it doesn't really mesh with the rest of the song the way I think it should, and the ending of the song is too abrupt for me. Then there's the fact that another classic rock band had a huge hit with 'Sail Away' in the title, and perhaps I'm subconsciously comparing the two (with the other one winning). Sadly, I don't believe this song will survive in my library.<br /><br />The title track is quite good; however, I can't stand the \\"talking guitars\\" thrown in to the middle of it...they are a complete distraction and a blemish on a good song. It's like getting a spec of sand in your eye and not being able to get it out, ever.<br /><br />'If You Were in Love' sung by Kimberly Dahme is far more tolerable than 'With You' from \\"Corporate America,\\" and again we get some good piano and guitar accompaniments, but nothing breathtaking. The hand-claps feel a bit \\"thrown in\\" at this point. It will survive in my library, unlike 'With You.'<br /><br />'Someday' has been compared to some \\"Third Stage\\" work - yeah, because the basic rhythm of the song is very similar to 'I Think I Like It.' This is where we get Curly's harmonica work, and a very small bit of organ thrown in towards the end.<br /><br />Tom's vocals on 'Love Got Away' aren't horrible, but the song is just okay. I'm not sure it's a keeper.<br /><br />The two \\"2.0\\" tracks are indeed different, with 'You Gave Up on Love' much more so. The changes to 'Someone' weren't enough to regurgitate it IMO. Filler.<br /><br />'The Way You Look Tonight' is a decent effort, and a good closer. It's got Tom's \\"modern BOSTON\\" sound, which is quite different from the original, and not as memorable, but still good.<br /><br />Overall, this album is good, but not great. True fans like myself will appreciate it; I don't expect Tom to gain many new listeners from it.ery small bit of organ thrown in towards the end.<br /><br />Tom's vocals on 'Love Got Away' aren't horrible, but the song is just okay.

Could not more highly recommend.

B001NOD0Q8|2.0|My 9th grader was reading this book for school, so I thought I'd read it too and we could discuss the book over dinner.  I have to say I was a little taken aback by the frequent and needless references to boys being naked in various parts of the book.  It was seemingly random and served no purpose other than to make me question whether the author was some kind of pervert. Overall, the book was a decent read, but I found the scenes with boys laying in bed naked or running the halls naked a bit disturbing.  I'm just glad they did not incorporate them into the movie!

Those this had some great moments in choreography and actually some very solid acting and directing, the dialogue was weak in parts and the plot was so unimaginative: really the plot was the biggest disappointment.<br /><br />One caveat on my review...I saw it on Amazon instant and it cut out frequently, which was very annoying...so factor that in when you read this.

The extra footage is seemlessly integrated, and answers many of the questions which arise in the original.  The real cherry on top of this hugely delicious sundae, though, is the multiple discs of behind-the-scenes footage.  That in itself is a tour de force.

We had a number of D.I.s who managed our platoon, but I'm not going to get picky about just showing one.  I've read that he actually was a D.I. and it really added a lot to the film.  Hearing him count cadence and calling out orders for rifle drill really took me back.  Watching him chewing out recruits reminded me that the only humor we had available was listening to other guys get reamed by a D.I. who took sardonic wit to a new level (but we didn't dare smile or laugh).

And most important, this movie is brilliant. One of the best movies i've seen in a decade. I didn't even realize when I first saw it that it was Ben Affleck. He has as grown soooooooo much as an actor! (and handsome!) =) and did an amazing job directing this! A must for any movie buff or even non movie buff. Even my big manly friend shed a tear at the end. Amazing cast, amazing story! Cheers Ben hope to see more stuff like this out of you!!<br /><br />-Jess Roselle /Rock the Shots

B00AU15HPC|5.0|Like Moody Blues Very Much so had to try this and hope he doesn't do what so many do after a solo...Leave the group
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, it seemed like some of the early Grisham books that I enjoyed most. It was a great story that had enough twists to keep you guessing and a satisfying ending.<br />This book is well worth your time and money. Read and enjoy, it will keep you entertained.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game. So simple but challenging.  The time outs it gives you after you fail a level are annoying.  It offers you chances to buy more moves or share on fb  to avoid a timeout. I wait I hate to pay for apps and even more cant stand all that game info on my fb posts. if not for time outs I may have rated it 5 stars.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|It is best to wait for the new remastered Version to be finished. If you're serious about buying this product for you or a friend you might want to consider the newer remastered version season one on Blu-ray as it has added scenes and it cost less
B0070YDOT8|1.0|Played on this site for ENDLESS number of hours.  Never came close to hitting one of their &#34; jackpots&#34;, nor have I ever actually seen anyone else hit one, yet they claim to being hit almost constantly.  I have a feeling that there may be a lot of false information on this site.  I won't play it anymore.  Constant interruption in play, reels freeze up or spin continually during slot play.  Far too frustrating.  A waste of time in my opinion.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|I read rolling stones review a few days after listening to reflektor all the way through two times across three days. RS called it arcade fires best album, which made me actually grimace. No. Is it a bad album? No. But its not a very good one. The first disc makes me understand why people label AF &#34;pretentious&#34; . I can imagine win rocking out in the studio to songs 7 minutes long with 4 minutes of substance and everyone else looking around like &#34;is this guy serious?&#34; But afraid to challenge his autocratic authority. The title track is the first, and maybe biggest, offender. Even one of the shortest songs, flashbulb eyes, which is somewhere around two and a half minutes long, feels strung out. Probably because there is a total of like 20 words in that repitive drivel of a tune. Here comes the night time is a good sing, and joan of arc is good enough, but everything else on side 1 is the ugly part of what would happen if arcade fie crashed into lcd soundsystem.<br /><br />I suspect james Murphy had a little less to do with the much better second side. I always thought of AF as making fairly sentimental music, both a compliment and criticism depending on who is wielding the words. Thus, on side 2, the band starts sounding less like the art student members of The Reflektors, and more like the actual Arcade Fire. There is a concept to the second side that was less prevalent in the first. Sure, the whole 'technology is making us less sociable&#34; has become a bit of a tired cliche, but its still relatable and getting more relevant by the day. Tracks like porno and supersymmetry could be about anything, really, but at least theyre easy to trace back to that core concept. Individually, id probably give side 1 two stars, and side 2 four stars. This averages to 3 stars, my rating.<br />Also i know i should probably be calling them cd's or discs rather than sides because it is a double album (technically), but i say shove it.<br />Favorite track: afterlife<br/>Least favorite: flashbulb eyes (dethrones several neon bible duds as worst arcade fire song on any lp to date)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I want to yell at myself all the time for starting to read this series. The book is engrossing and frustrating. Chapters invariably end at a spot where I want to know more. But because I've been waiting to read more about the previous scenes that were cut too short, I keep flipping pages. And that's how you go through 500+ pages in a sitting. Lucky I didn't put the kettle on before I opened the book. Like as not, I'd have burned the house down.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Well acted with a good cast (and John Goodman is a special treat, as always). The special effects at the beginning of the film were really sub-par for Hollywood these days, but this movie is not really about a plane crash at all. An interesting psychological drama about a man's destructive lifestyle and his testing to see how far he can run from it before facing his ultimate judge: himself. This has been done many, many times over in better films (Elmer Gantry, Citizen Kane, Picnic, and on and on). It was an entertaining movie, just not a great one.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Who can honestly watch this show and not love it. The characters are brilliant, the story phenomenal and the acting grade A. I recommend this show to everyone
B00AY5B712|5.0|As a woman who loves Christmas movies like White Christmas and British everything - this is my &#34;go-to&#34; holiday movie.  As an actor, Emma Thompson brings me to tears every single time.  The realistic control and depth is astonishing in what could be just a casual holiday movie.  Everyone shines and it's nice to see beloved BBC favorites in all kinds of roles.  You will definitely laugh, cheer, cry and enjoy this film.<br /><br />As if there is anyone who hasn't seen it by this point in time.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully written!  I love the perspective the story is told from.  The impact words have in this novel really makes you think.  I enjoy the beauty in the ashes perspective.  I am reading this book with my 5th grader.  She is very interested in WWII and this book touches on many of the significant events that happen but you see it through the lens of a young girl.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing CCS on my phone and laptop for months......I am so very glad King and Amazon finally brought it to Kindle!!!!! Love love love this game!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Takes a while to load and for some parts of the game the instructions are unclear but overall it's a great game
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read this book several times over the years, and it hasn't lost its power.  One of my top 25 books.  A must read for any SciFi fan.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Funny, different, and funny! The plotline was a little weird but thats what made it so different! I would definitely watch again
B000FA675C|5.0|Loved this book.  Awesome pacing, and an easy read.  This is one of a handful of books that I could not put down.  I read it well into the night.
B00GIY5OGC|5.0|UM I LOVE THIS MOVIE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!! its so funny!! i was crying from laughing so hard the first time we watched it (yes i watched it two days in a row) and i dont understand for a second how it could get only a 6.4 rating on IMDB. It was perfect!!
B005HSL626|5.0|Wow the creator of this app should be proud of this. This is one of the apps that just hooks you into it. It's like you just have to get all the blades and backgrounds. People that Don't have this app, or just like killing fruit, I highly suggest that you download this app. It's even better now that the update came out!<br /><br />But the creator of this app should make the next update so that it does not delete all the blades you have collected.<br /><br />I rated this five stars because I think it has good potential and will be #1 app.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|hilarious! I normally hate the kind of movies where anything that can go wrong does, but I forgave this one for that...because it was about weed and hilariousness. Rock on!
B00GPE9HEA|5.0|Solid album where she co-wrote all of them. Sometimes I wish Will.I.Am was not the producer of the album, otherwise it would be ten times better.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|I loved this movie exactly the way I thought I would. I don't even know what I can say about it other than its awesome and pure gold. LOVE LOVE LOVE!
0634060384|5.0|Great compilation of jazz fake sheets, perfect for jazz lessons or performances for a beginner or a more advanced player
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|I'm amazed at how much I liked this movie considering I hated the first one. I am a die hard Disney fan but for some reason when Monsters Inc came out, it just didn't sit well with me. I didn't have any expectations for this movie but watched it mainly because my friends raved about it, and I was blown away by how good it was! It was funny, touching, full of life lessons, etc. The plotline was excellent, I thought it was going to go in a much different direction. Well done Disney!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|He never ceases to astound me with each of his novels. Each is better than the last. Hope he continues with his initial character,Jake Brigance and his cohorts.
B00BT0ZS52|1.0|I haven't read the book and after watching this confusing piece of crap I have no desire to. No plot what so ever.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing this game. Have met lots of people and play all the time.  It is easier for newbees if you can get in a group to trade and get help with questions.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fantastically written!  I hate reviews that give away the story so I will say it was a wonderful read and I recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is XXX Porno!  Story line is really unbelievable.  Can't believe they're making it a movie.  I am sooo over it!
0804161380|5.0|I  cannot express to you how happy I am to have received such an amazing box set. The Legend of Zelda has always been a very special franchise to me, and I could not pass the opportunity up when I saw this item. I really cannot say much more than the other 5-star reviews already have, but wow, what a great steal. BUY THESE BOOKS NOW. Seriously, right now. The price listed here on Amazon is unbeatable, and the prices will surely go up. I paid just shy of $18 for each book considering the total price I ended up paying (oh yeah, and free shipping). This is BEFORE all of the other features of the set, such as the sturdy bookmark, certificate of authenticity, and chest container. I think it is very well worth it by all standards.<br />Now, my set had only a few minor flaws that I felt should be pointed out but do not subtract my overall score because they are, as I mentioned, relatively minor. My bookmark has several small scratches on the back of it that I had noticed directly after I had pulled it out. It's a shame... It's quite a nice looking bookmark. Another thing to note is the fact that some of the golden gilded pages were not entirely, well, gilded. There were a few spots on various books that had tiny amounts of the golden paint missing. Where it is lacking, the edges look slightly darker than the surrounding area. Overall, just a tad bit disappointing, but nothing that will make me disregard the amazing features of the entire set.<br />I love these game guides and hope to find ones more like them in the future.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|I'm addicted to this game!!!, it should have more people playing It . And I nevvver give reviews to games ,that should prove how epicly amazing this game is!!!!!

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Probably one of the best book I have read in along time. Had me interested throughout the whole thing. The ending was really good but it made my heartache to not know if they find each other again.
0062255657|5.0|Perspective can be an elusive prospect.  One can “lose” perspective for any number of reasons; perspectives shift with new information or points-of-view, a new perspective will arise on occasion – seemingly of its own accord.  Neil Gaiman is a master of using the slippery nature of perspective to create a story that is, at once, vastly expansive and impossibly intimate.  He shows this talent at its finest in this physically small, but literarily massive, novel.<br /> A man in his forties returns to his childhood home for the funeral of a close family member.  He journeys, lured by smoky memories, to the Hempstock Farmstead, a place he knew in his childhood but had forgotten until he is standing beside “the ocean.”  His recalling of how he met the members of Hempstock farm and what caused that meeting to occur is the story of this book.  To detail the plot would be to undermine: the experience of living the book, the recalling of the fun and danger of being a child and the validation of what was under your bed after the lights were turned off really did exist.<br /> This is not a horror book.  It is more a book of myths played out in present day.  The tension the reader may experience in reading is rooted in the memories of “almost” seeing the “bad thing” in the closet as we were trying to go to sleep.  Those memories are balanced by the comfort in knowing that there was always someone nearby who would make the dark places safe. Those “almost” creatures who lived just beyond our perception, seen only as void or in the motion they create in passing are the most frightening, having a friend who can define those fears and lend us courage enough to face them bring to mind the friends who will never leave our lives.  Such is the depth and color of this novel.  The hero finds such a person in Lettie Hempstock.<br /> There is much religion within these pages - Celtic Myths are present, pagan practices are evident, the “new” religion lurks in the corners and the dynamics of a curious mind offer a flavor of creativity that is near a practice of faith.  The Ocean comes to represent the timelessness of Life (an event that spurred the language of religion and spiritual practices) and the author paints such a vivid picture of that encounter it comes near to stealing this reader’s breath;<br /><br />“I felt the coldness of the water – if it was water – pour into my nose and my throat, felt it fill my lungs, but that was all it did. It did not hurt me.<br />“I thought, This is the kind of water you can breathe. I thought, Perhaps, there is a secret to breathing water, something simple that everyone could do, if only they knew.<br />Lettie Hempstock’s ocean flowed inside me, and it filled the entire universe, . . . ” (p. 142-3).<br /><br /> The brilliance of this book is found in its ability to pull the reader into a world that began when we were children and allows us to hold those cherished days close once again.  The book plows into areas of the reader’s mind that were allowed to become fallow because adults “know better” than to believe “such rubbish,” waters the seeds found there and cause the flowers of our childhood to blossom again.  A delightful walk in a beautiful meadow is thereby created.

B0053JJLLC|5.0|This was only my second book by Crichton.  When I started if, I didn't expect to finish it because I thought that it was some sort of Lillyputian story.  It was riveting to the very end.  One of the best reads I've had.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. I think some of the game's features are a little tricky, but I personally think it's more entertaining than temple run. It runs a little slow on my Kindle Fire.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game, tho hate the fact that you have to wait a minimum of hours at every cross road to continue to play! But due to the fact that we finally have it on the kindle n it's free, I can't really complain!

B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|A positive energy album!  Rock on Boston!  Don't kid yourself Boston today rocks as hard as they did in the past.  The vocals on this album are more down to earth and mellow compared to the high end vocals of the past...  (though if you were to here this live it would rock!)  the guitar riff's we love, soft distortion, harmonies, heart, the Boston we love is here...  better yet.... this an CD that grabbed a couple of the great songs from Corp. America that most people can't get a copy and were lost...  I saw the Corp. America concert tour here in Portland, OR...  and we want Boston back....  Tom has taken ten years of what Boston is and presented here in a format that we can all enjoy....  this is more than good...  more than a few hearts in Heaven as well as  Earth will sing and rock on ..  \\"Life, Love and Hope\\"... is here now....  meanwhile we are still waiting for a live album... ( and the West Coast is waiting for a tour for Boston to rock! )  Thank you Tom!

B00BAXFECK|5.0|It was well worth waiting ten years for Donna Tartt's new novel \\"The Goldfinch..\\" Other reviewers have gone into more detail more eloquently than I can, so I will simply say that for me it is the best piece of contemporary writing I've enjoyed in a very long time. Ms. Tartt is incredibly talented and imaginative, and I certainly hope it isn't another 10 years before she publishes again. Theo Decker goes into literary history with Holden Caulfield and Pip. I also found all the secondary characters, especially Hutch, Mrs. Barbour, Andy and Boris, to be well-written and fascinating, going well beyond the usual stereotypes or plot devices  that secondary characters often fulfill. It's apparent that a great deal of research and effort to \\"get things right\\" went into this novel. Favorite line: when Boris is trying to discover from Theo if Hutch is only helping Theo because he is a \\"poufter.\\"  Theo says he doesn't know and Theo responds: \\"Who cares? If he is good to you? None of us ever find enough kindness in the world, do we?\\"

1401324029|5.0|For years I've poked gentle fun at friends and family who are addicted to any particular television program, Downton Abbey being exempt, of course.  Much to my own embarrassment, I now find myself absolutely hooked on &#34;Castle&#34;.  So much so, that my husband and I DVR'd the reruns and the current season, then began watching it from the first episode on DVD through Netflix.  Therefore, it was with genuine delight that I found the books referenced in the program actually exist!<br /><br />My sleuthing skills, being somewhat less keen than Kate Beckett's/Nikki Heat's, I have been unable to discover the ghost-writer behind this series of books.  Having said that, I must now admit how much I LOVE the fact that the &#34;Nikki Heat&#34; books are treated as if Richard Castle is actually the author.  I loved the 'author's' photo on the jacket(s) as well as the &#34;about the author&#34; blurb.  In reading the acknowledgments, which is something I rarely, if ever do, I have been known to laugh out loud at the sly way in which the (real) author slips into his acknowledgments, the names of the actors who portray the characters in &#34;Castle&#34;.  Talk about blurring the lines between fiction and reality.......<br /><br />The actual writing and story lines of the &#34;Nikki Heat&#34; books are about what one would expect; that is to say, not in the same league with famous author procedurals.  That's OK.  They're just plain fun.  Personally, I am thankful that intimate 'Nikki/Jameson' scenes in the books, which could have turned into gratuitously graphic sex scenes, gently 'fade to black'.  That sort of bodice ripping would ruin the fun and become, in my opinion, an 'Ick' factor lowering &#34;Nikki Heat&#34; into the almost-porn category.<br /><br />Since the books roughly follow the formula of the television program, they provide a spark of recognition (and a frequent &#34;ah-ha!&#34; chuckle) when episodic elements and relationships, from the series, are used as plot devices in the novels.

6305428042|5.0|Hocus Pocus is one of those movies where you watch it once and it becomes a Halloween tradition for many years to come.  When the Sanderson Sisters from old Salem are reincarnated back into their former selves after being hanged for being witches, the modern day 1990s Salem is in for a Halloween they will never forget.<br /><br />The Sanderson Sisters, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, Bette Midler, and Kathy Najimy, are after children.  They need their life force to remain young and beautiful.  This, of course, doesn't leave the children in good sorts.  When they are first introduced they are in historical Salem where they are hanged after consuming the life force of a young girl.  Her older brother, Thackery Binks, in his attempt to save her, gets transformed into a black cat that is cursed with immortality.  He takes it upon himself to guard the Sanderson Sister's abandoned house for 300 years.  Until, unfortunately, Max, his sister Dani, and his love interest bring the sisters back to life.<br /><br />The movie is hysterical, mostly centering around the naivete of the sisters three centuries later, and it is a good watch for people of any age.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Still the raw emotion that only Eminem can bring with a touch of aged beauty.  Why do I say.this? For starter I as well as Eminem are no longer the 20 somethings that are criticizing saying that this is his worst album yet. Did his music.change? Yes to an exstent however he still shows his anger and bitter side in his lyrics but the songs are about something more than that. In his 20s his song were more on the comical side. He still shows his witty sense of humor however just more toned down. So for the ones disappointed with this album I'm guessing are from the younger generation. There are a few songs that are not my particular favorite but I have yet to be disappointed by Eminem. Its interesting to age along with one particular artist expecially when you are around the same age. If you think about it people of our generation has not had someone to do that with since michael Jackson (and no I'm not comparing the two)

B007URVZJ6|3.0|A lot of essential information here, but some of the instructions are confusing and inaccurate -this may be partially due to the many shortcomings and inept design of microsoft word, but it would be nice if Amazon did a better job of explaining the apparently unexplainable.  It took me numerous tries to build a table of contents following the kindle building book, which insisted that I should start by locating a &#34;references&#34; tab.  I sorted through five separate versions of word on five different computers and never found a &#34;references&#34; tab - I eventually got the job done, but it was a nightmare.  Hopefully a newer edition of &#34;Building Your Book For Kindle&#34; will resolve some of these problems.

0307887448|5.0|When I first picked up Ernest Cline’s “Ready Player Number One,” I was skeptical.  The premise – a poor geek must digest, absorb, and filter through a universe of 80s pop culture in order to solve the riddle of the online player platform Oasis and win a fortune left by an anti-social geek genius – seemed too absurd and silly to me, and I doubted a professional so-called geek’s writing ability.  And while the plot seemed too much Willy Wonka-ish at first, I came quickly to immerse myself in the world of the Oasis, and loved the detail, nuance, strategy, and games of that virtual world.<br /><br />The plot, characters, and setting of “Ready Player Number One” seem to draw so much of the popular culture around us that while seemingly so foreign is immediately recognizable.  There’s the familiar motif of a band of teenagers fighting against pure evil while discovering themselves and their hormones, a la The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Harry Potter series, the Ender trilogy, etc.  There’s the immersive world of Oasis, which is based on the popular player platforms Second Life, World of Warcraft, and Everquest.  And of course there’s the constant allusions, references, and use of classic video games, movies, and toys (a geek’s wet dream, basically).  But while the characters and plot elements are drawn from tried and true motifs, “Ready Player Number One” achieves a feel, an aesthetic, and a world all its own.  The plot twists, while not totally believable, are all well-executed, and the final epic battle is truly final and epic.<br /><br />“Ready Player Number One” will be an enduring classic for both a graying generation of geeks so wedded to their childhood memories, and a new generation growing up in a brave new world where virtual reality is the dominant mode of existing and living.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I'm so sorry, but this book is actually terribly written.  I love the plot, it's just that Suzanne Collins is simply not a good writer!  Compare this with other writers like JK Rowling, and there's a world of difference.  The style of writing here is very short, very choppy, and very fragmented.  She may have been going for a stream-of-consciousness thing, but I just couldn't get into it and it was driving me nuts - it seemed liked a 3rd grader could have written this.<br /><br />This is one of the few times where I actually prefer the movies over the book, because I couldn't handle the writing style

B008ODSYZI|5.0|Love this movie!  So cute and funny!  A New Classic!  My kids and I watch it all the time (ages 18, 14 & 4).  So much so that I had to buy another cd because the other one was used so much.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|While it was fun revisiting the Brigances and the rest of the Time to Kill cast, this book felt hurried and less dynamic than its vivid predecessor. Gone was the sense of urgency and excitement; it was rather predictable and tame. The characters seemed a bit glossed over, as if he was being careful to project their original &#34;reputations,&#34; and they did not naturally evolve in this story. Still, a good and familiar read. Excellent for passing time, but don't expect too much.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|This installment of the medical examiner's life differs from those in the past: Patricia Cornwell delves into Scarpetta and Benton's psyches much more so than has been done in her other novels. At first I thought it was all a bit more than I wanted - the story lagged - but as I kept reading, I realized it was essential for us readers to understand a bit more about these two characters whose lives have enthralled us for many years. Well written, great story!
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Typical twist and turns on par with other Bond movies. Good entertainment! One time watch for sure! If you're a Bond fan, then you'll have fun!

B00GTZJLAK|4.0|Good movie to watch with the family.  However, not as good as the original Cars movie.  Many similar attributes to Cars but not as easy to identify with main character.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|If you loved Evangelion or are interested in the series then this is the best way to revisit it. &#34;You Are (Not) Alone&#34; is the first part to a great retelling of a legendary anime.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Excellent collection of all his hits through all of the years and more.<br />I bought the single disk of the same name and then saw this.<br />Well worth it!.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|It's a wonderful movie, so touching and inspiring. I loved it and will probably watch it again sometime in future.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a great book, not sure I liked the ending<br />I will continue with next next two books!<br />Hopefully its satisfying
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I am so in love with these characters! I read it in one night it was nicely written. I have to say I was turned off fro mthis book for months after seeing some of the reviews, but i am so happy i gave it a try. Travis is my new book crush and im not ashamed to say it! lol<br /><br />I can understand if some readers felt it wasnt for them, because of the relationships intensity, but if you put that doubt out of your mind and just take it for what it is going to be you find that every conversation between them makes sense and they arent just stupid kids.
B000VUCIZE|5.0|Great book.  Sam is an excellent author and I love his clarity of thought.  Sam uses very tight reasoning which I appreciate.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have a couple laptops and Cell Phones connected to this device and they all work great.  I've watched a few movies streaming from a laptop. So far only one would stall for a second here and there simalar to buffing.  Overall, awesome product.  Turns any TV into a smart TV.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is a great movie..  The Blue ray transfer quality is good.  One of Tarantino's better movies.  .. .. ..
B008MWBY6W|4.0|Bought this for my T4i.  With the 18-55mm kit lens it fits easily.  On the outside, the bottom is hard and plastic, which I can set down anywhere it won't get knocked over and I don't have to worry about it.  The pockets are fine, I have a spare battery, a cable, and a extra SD card, all with a bit of room to spare.  I bought this fully with the intention that I will outgrow it in 1-2 years and that is ok for the amount that it cost.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Didn't take too long to go through but was awesome for the levels there were. It kept me enthralled until I finished the game.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It was super easy to set up and does exactly what it says it does. I bought this device primarily to stream Netflix. It took 10 minutes to set up and I was quickly able to stream Youtube, Netflix and Vimeo videos from my Android phone, a Chromebook, and a Windows laptop.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have been waiting for this to cone to the kindle fire and its finally here. Graphically awesome and on my 8.9 inch screen was amazing. Definitely a must have app for DC fans.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It's my way of relaxing after a long day at work. Thank you amazon for allowing it to be on kindle. Now I can sneak in a game in the middle of the day.
B0090SI582|1.0|This is more a knock against Amazon.com, the package in the picture /CLEARLY/ shows both extended and theatrical cut.  This product is ONLY theatrical cut, or at least the one they sent me was.  Its very frustrating to have to do a return for a mislabeled product.  The movie is an awesome movie, except for the third act, which pays homage to the solo story arc in the comics.<br />What is terrible is that Amazon.com mis-represented their product and shorted me the extended cut, causing me to miss out on other Black Friday deals I could have used instead of preordering the crappy Amazon.com one.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|Life duplicates fiction. Experiences of life are reflected by a master storyteller.  The story is true and validated by Snowden, NYTimes and the deceptive DEA.  Our freedoms are taken by those protecting us.
B004LL1HMY|4.0|I loved their self-titled debut cd.  I like this one.  Only a few of the songs on this title are really outstanding.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|Lousy ... and very disappointed with Amazon. The movie stopped 1/2 way while watching movie. Had the SAME thing happen last night while watching the HEAT. I am going back to Netflix!
076790592X|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  This book will change your perspective on life.  It is a very quick, easy read, and yet profound.  I highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play games such as Bejeweled, Tetris, and Dr. Mario. This is just as fun, and I am hooked! Great game!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Season 3, at least the first 3 episodes, are a touch dull. It could be the novelty has worn off. The plotlines seem too contrived when compared to the first 2 seasons.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|OMG, this book completely sucked me in. The writing was superb, the story was intriguing. As I was reading I had a sense that I would be let down in the end. I mean, a boy is accused of murder and the story is written from the perspective of his father. I couldn't imagine the ending would be satisfying in that scenario. The author did a superb job in crafting a surprising conclusion. Recommended!
0399160477|4.0|Command Authority is the 14th novel comprising the Jack Ryan Sr/Jack Ryan Jr franchise catalog, which began with The Hunt for Red October, published in 1984, and I have followed the series since that time.  For me, Command Authority was a compelling read.<br /><br />The story first takes us back 30 years, to a meeting between a GRU Special Forces Captain and a special member of the KGB. The purpose of this meeting is not fully revealed until much later as events unfold, piece by piece. Present day finds Jack Ryan Jr in London working on not military or political but financial intelligence - and a case involving Russian intelligence and criminal elements that will ultimately lead him into the upcoming fray. Meanwhile, Ryan Sr meets with a former foe and now friend (a retired SVR chief) at the White House, who warns the president that the new Russian chief-of-state seeks to return his country to the days of old - just prior to dying due to being poisoned with a radioactive isotope. In Moscow, a Croatian assassin takes the fall after pulling off a devastating bombing that takes out someone in addition to, and much more important than the \\"targeted\\" UK finance man (and former British agent) - the current head of the SVR. Thus, the stage is set for another action-packed, political/espionage thriller in this series.<br /><br />The new president of Russia has what most would call skeletons (literally) in his closet and he will do anything - everything - to keep those tucked away and out of sight as he continues executing his plans (and opposition) for what he envisions as Russia's domination. He will stop at nothing to achieve his agenda, including merging the separate FSB (internal) and SVR (foreign) intelligence agencies into one, under the leadership of his chosen man. Meanwhile, in the UK,  Ryan Jr's investigation into the world of financial crimes gets him involved in some extremely close-calls that eventually leads him to reconnect with his team (the US off-the-books black ops group known as The Campus) after he uncovers a conflict that began three decades earlier, one that Ryan Sr had investigated, when based in the UK as a CIA analyst. This tale is detailed through the inter-woven backstory, and those events now threaten the world's balance of power, unless Jr can connect all the dots in time for his father, the president. The action in the story shifts back and forth between the present, primarily in Russia and Ukraine (with ops planning in DC), and 30 years prior, in England, Switzerland and Germany.<br /><br />Are there flaws? Yes, a few. One example is when the bad guys find out about and attempt to breech a CIA safe house in Sevastopol, Ukraine. During the amount of time outlined in the story (between the start of the attack and the good guy's escape) it seems highly unlikely that they could have survived, given the odds against them (manpower and fire power). Does it take away from the story? No. And I have definitely read (and seen) much worse.<br /><br />There is plenty of attention to detail, with outstanding narrative and it is, quite simply, highly entertaining. From the technology and methods used by covert and black ops personnel, to the involvement and machinations of political, intelligence, financial and criminal factions, and everything in-between, this is a compelling read. The writing kept leading me forward, page after page, into the plot and sub-plots and backstory. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys action, espionage, and political intrigue, with criminal elements and some high-tech thrown in for good measure, and, of course, to those who appreciate a good ole US vs USSR tale.black ops group known as The Campus) after he uncovers a conflict that began three decades earlier, one that Ryan Sr had investigated, when based in the UK as a CIA analyst.

B00F880BWG|4.0|The picture was a little blurry at times, otherwise its a great show. I can't wait for the second half of this season
B0015AARJI|1.0|Does not work as intended. Save your money and pay for the real deal. Not responsive as it should be.
0060930349|5.0|I found this book to be just the best.  An unbiased account of the people who formed a nation, starting with the story of the pilgrims, those people who came to a land for their freedom. That entire motive, freedom, carried through many years which developed into the greatest nation of free people. I appreciated the fact that the author was not political in his description of the events and people, but how each event and those people involved formed the outcome of events.  Those events were happenings of that time and the people involved were the men and women of that time. Those people learned from previous events, history, and acted, sometimes not to the best for those involved, but to their thinking of that time.  I keep Paul Johnson's book at the ready to glean historical events that can apply to today's happenings.<br />Any History buff should find this book enjoyable.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|the book really lives up to its title. maybe the most important business book I ever read. read it three years ago, use the learnings every day. recommended reading for knowledge workers, entrepreneurs and managers alike.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again I was entirely engrossed by one of my favorite authors. Been awhile for me. Loved every minute! Thanks
B00EJOCB4G|2.0|I bought this on Sunday from the Lego store for  $32.00. (not on sale). Since then it seems to have been hiked up in price from 100-500% for these Lego mine craft mini sets all over Amazon. If you buy it for more than 36 bucks you aren't saving any money.  It should be illegal for these venders to inflate the price and mark off a little (still making you pay more than double) to trick you into thinking you're getting a deal. These sets retail between 32.00 and 36.00 at in store venders.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is a stress breaker . I need this to relax me after a trying day at work managing and directing employees to do their jobs. I like the the exciting challenge of the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is challenging and addictive for many of us. I like the play I get here compared to the way it plays on my smart phone. I couldn't stay away darn it.
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|Short & Sweet: It is GREAT<br /><br />Buy It. You will enjoy it ALL.<br />It is non-stop action packed<br />with many subplots.
B009GCF3Q4|5.0|as always, Michael Connelly is an author who never disappoints.  One of my all time favorite authors - excellent read & left me wanting more
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Fun! Easy! Sort of like Yahtzee but easier. It's fun and quick to play. You do have to use a bit of strategy. Any game hand can change with any roll. Fun for all ages too. Also I think it would be a good drinking game.
B00DHBOQMM|5.0|once again a fantastic read - love Mickey Haller & Harry Bosch - can't wait for more offerings from Michael Connelly
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|their music is so amazing and I can't believe there are no instruments involved. Best A Capella group I have ever heard! I teared up when I heard the little drummer boy.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Like A Painted House, this book grasps the escence of american culture, and although it's about lawyers it's also about racial problems, and the conflicts among the rich and the poor..
B007JNWQZS|5.0|OK you've got Uma Thurman in two Quintin Tarantino films along with a slew of great actors. Are they believable? No. Are they lots of fun? definitely! cool fight scenes, gritty violence and old school story telling come together in a very affordable set here. arived on time in great condition.
B00GIXWHZ4|1.0|This review is basically one big spoiler.<br /><br />I love all the XMen movies. I own them all. I watch them every time they are on TV. I have been checking several times a day for this movie to shift to rental. When I got home today, I fixed some munchies and flipped on the projector. At last, I get to watch \\"The Wolverine!\\"<br /><br />As the movie opens, we find Wolverine is now a dirty looking street person. He is convinced to go to Japan where they give him a bath. Another mutant infects Wolverine and he starts to lose his ability to heal and is weakened. He has to have a Japanese girl defend him. He regains his ability to heal only to get his metal claws chopped off in battle. The Wolverine got his butt kicked and declawed by a man with a robotic exoskeleton. Another Japanese gal had to save him by using one of his chopped off claws. Now, with his tail tucked between his legs, he goes to the airport to leave Japan where Magneto and the Professor stop time and give him an urgent message the world is about to be destroyed.<br /><br />It seems to be a trend in superhero movies to make the superhero impotent the majority of the movie then after having watched your superhero get his butt kicked for over an hour, they finally muster enough strength for a brief comeback.  Well, this movie not only follows the horribly overdone trend but goes a step further. Wolverine gets his metal claws taken away and someone else has to defeat the bad guy.<br /><br />I cannot believe Hugh Jackman would agree to such a movie. This falls second to Data being killed on Star Trek.<br /><br />Total disappointment.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|Movie arrived on time in perfect condition at a great price. This version has more to the story and I think fleshes out the characters better than the theatrical release. Very dark movie (intentional) so was impressed by clear transfer to HD blu ray. Any sci fi fan, keifer sutherland fan or jennifer connely fan should pick this up. very interesting exploration of human cognitive ability in creative sci fi context.
0865478007|5.0|I was skeptical about many things involved in the pharmaceutical industry before I read this book but now I am fully horrified. I actually work in a pharmacology lab in a major university and we are regularly involved in projects analyzing drug safety (unfunded by that industry). I am familiar with many products that were/are heavily marketed by drug companies which our analyses show to be clearly much worse than nothing. This book did much for me in explaining how this can and does happen.<br /><br />Being in academia, I see a lot of nonsense with journal publishing and authorship. It is clearly less of a means of scientific communication than a currency of career advancement for scientists. What is therefore contained in this ostensibly scientific record is definitely suspect. I, however, did not fully appreciate the degree of abject corruption of this scientific record by pharmaceutical companies.<br /><br />The problem with this that I don't think the book really emphasized quite enough is that if the official scientific record is so thoroughly subverted, it is therefore hopelessly flawed. To be clear, science, as it is practiced in our civilization, is flawed. As a science enthusiast, I'm pretty horrified to see science, as a concept, left only with a theoretical defense against woo and superstition. Why should a faith healer be impressed by our so-called &#34;science&#34; when clearly everything that makes it scientific has been distorted? When people tell me that I need to have faith in their mystical book of miraculous supernatural superstition because it was written by Someone Very Important, I tell them that is not good enough. I need to know the details. Currently, as far as I can tell, the details of academic publishing that I do know about (from my own sources and Bad Pharma) prevent me from giving any more credibility to what we think of as &#34;science&#34;.<br /><br />For example, if someone does something that turns out to be ineffective, is it scientific to repeat that? In my opinion no. But in our so-called scientific culture, negative results are almost never published leaving pointless situations to recur at enormous expense over and over. This book just showed me how this theme extends beyond my most cynical doubts into territory that is clearly harming people. Normally it's a special kind of larceny when you kill your victim while stealing from them, but this seems to be another day at the office for drug companies.<br /><br />I was shocked to learn that all of the information to really make drugs much safer exist. I thought that because of drug company lobbying and chicanery that it was impossible to find out certain obvious pieces of the puzzle necessary to clean up this mess. But no, this book tipped me off (and I verified it) to the fact that drug companies do know exactly how things are going. They have information that would be very interesting for patients. For example, the fact that they buy prescribing histories from doctors, hospitals, etc, is fascinating since that information could be used to greatly improve pharmaceutical safety. Were this data available for open scrutiny, bad drugs would be spotted very quickly as I'm sure they are in the only area of the entire pharmaceutical enterprise that is scrupulously scientific: the marketing departments. I know a lot of people make a comfortable living in drug marketing, but it horrifies me to imagine them being so naive as to think that kind of biased meddling leads to better patient outcomes.<br /><br />If after reading this book you don't have serious doubts about regulatory agencies, &#34;scientific&#34; publishing/journals, peer review, doctors' expertise, and drug marketing that is literally unhealthy, then you're probably the kind of person who will respond especially well to a placebo effect. If you don't die from (known but suppressed) side effects.ntific to repeat that? In my opinion no.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Arrived on time and in surprisingly nice packaging. came with nice little art book as well. also includes digital copy of trilogy as set for mobile use. blu rays look great and have all sorts of extra goodies for those Nolan fans. great price to boot @ $25! go amazon.
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|This is a great album to rock out to, and I also like listening to this CD when I want relax and hear creative material
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|very good game to pass the time in those quiet moments,  cant see why anybody would pay money for the add on extras
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I like Nickelbacks sound, and that they are always trying new sounds with their material. They stay current, and that is an added bonus.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I just finished The Husbands Secret and must say this is a great read.  Highly recommend.  The characters all have their separate dramas taking place, but their lives intersect throughout.  Very nice writing style.
B00E03ULJS|5.0|I love their fast-paced electronic sound! This is music I can both listen AND dance to , and I love that. Krewella also manages to be both current and original.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the most accurate app out there.  We had a few days of severe storms this fall.  Used this and the hourly forecast was right on the money.  Love it,love it,love it!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Katy Perry showed both vulnerabilty and creativity on this album, which is refreshing change from the party-and sex charged songs that came before in her previous albums. I love all of her albums, but the vulnerabilty showed on this album is stunning
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've this calculator it's big and so easy to use on my kindle when I'm balancing my check book. It's right there when I need it .
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|I loved that I could buy a CD with  all my favorite Genesis songs for such a decent price.Getting this CD online was better than going to the store and paying store prices.
0071762345|5.0|This is a brilliant read for anyone working in or with Social Media.  Well written, and easy to follow with actionable items to help you process what you're reading.
B001QXE0OC|5.0|I think this album is better than her more current albums because she takes more chances on this CD, and her more recent albums are more about fun and dance
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is the last book of the psy-changeling serious so far, and I have a hard time waiting for the next novel, which also has a powerful but emotionally dysfunctional psy as main character. Nalini Singh describes the Kaleb's emotional healing process believable and without pity. The love story is set against the backdrop of a civil war, which gives the story additional depth.
B008LV05EG|5.0|Rita Ora is as thoroughly enjoyable with her material and sound as Britney Spears. I would definitely buy another of her albums
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|In my opinion this game is BETTER THAN TEMPLE RUN! I have found it to be addicting and the price us the best.
B00EO10M54|5.0|I really like this album by Miley Cyrus because she comes across more fun and adult, and takes risks with her voice that she didn't take with her previous albums. The price was really buget-friendly, and I liked that I didn't have to go to a store in person to buy it.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This has become one of my favorite albums for the holidays.  Sting is a journey not to be missed.  I saw the live performance on PBS and had to have the album.  It did not disappoint.  In fact, just listening was a better experience than watching on the television screen.
B0000013G9|5.0|I have been looking for this album at a decent price for a long time, and Amazon satirssfied my budget and my schedule. This is one of my favorite albums by TLC because their  sound and material is raw and street-wise, which I really like in the artists I listen to
0553328255|5.0|Nice collection, It looks as the description, I'm satisfied! Both books come into an special box, and the price is amazing, don't wait more time, go get one of this.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game! Needs more free stuff, does every thing in this game have to need me to pay for it. :(
0307236722|5.0|This book arrived in excellent condition.  It had the recipes in it that I'd been hoping to find (after seeing Martha Bakes on PBS recently) along with many more recipes and great photos.  The instructions seem straight forward tho some of the recipes are far more complicated than I want to attempt

B00G3P6VA4|1.0|Amazingly bad movie.  If I could demand a refund as well as punitive damages I would.  Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot.

B008FTAAG2|5.0|I love In This Moment. I think they are a great band. I love every song on this album. I think Maria's voice is amazing.
0143123173|3.0|Craig Johnson’s The Cold Dish introduces Walt Longmire, long-time sheriff of the fictional Absaroka County, Wyoming. If Walt’s name sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because he has a TV show named for him (Longmire, on A&E). Some elements of The Cold Dish made it into the pilot episode, while the rest filled out the first season’s climax. I was drawn to this book by the series, as I suspect others before me have been.<br /><br />That may have been a problem.<br /><br />The titular “cold dish” is revenge, which drives the action throughout. Two years after four white teenagers are given trivial sentences for raping a developmentally disabled Cheyenne girl, one of the accused rapists turns up shot in the back by an antique rifle. Most everyone in the area believes the boys were guilty and the local Cheyenne still bear a grudge. While Longmire and his band of deputies investigate the murder, more bodies start to pile up.<br /><br />This book is a traditional mystery, meaning solving the puzzle surrounding the crime at hand is the main point of the plot. In this regard, Johnson’s debut novel does a fine job. The victims come with plenty of baggage, and there are more than enough suspects to keep Longmire and crew busy for much of the book. There are enough of the requisite false leads, lies and mistaken accusations to keep fans of traditional mysteries entertained. You probably won’t guess the villain before Longmire does.<br /><br />If you’re a fan of this genre, you already know much of what’s going to happen, and you already know Our Hero will solve the crime in the next-to-last chapter. You come back for the characters. So, would you want to spend time with Walt Longmire?<br /><br />More than likely, yes. He’s a paunchy, middle-aged-plus veteran of small-town crimefighting in the wide-open-spaces West. He has the mandated Painful Past (recently dead wife, absent daughter, empty house), but he’s at least still able to do his job. He’s plain-spoken, respectful of his environment without fetishizing it, and aware of the ways of the Cheyenne without fetishizing them. He does heroic things without placing much value on being a hero. Johnson’s dialog for Longmire is clean and suits the man.<br /><br />The people surrounding Longmire are a mixed lot. Walt’s primary sidekicks – Henry Standing Bear, his oldest and best friend, and East Coast transplant Victoria Moretti, his newest deputy – are drawn clearly and well, although Vic does tend to go over the top at times (which may be the author’s intent). The others are more types than people, which I suppose is the luxury a series provides an author – he can color in the details over multiple volumes.<br /><br />Johnson clearly has a firm grasp on the setting (alpine Wyoming) and provides plenty of atmosphere for the story and his characters. The mountains, the plains, the trees, rocks and scrub, the many faces of fresh or falling snow, the sky’s thousand personalities, all roll easily off Johnson’s pen.<br /><br />Yet by the end of this, my reaction was more “hmm” than “wow.” Why? There are a lot of little reasons, and one big one.<br /><br />The little reasons range all over the map. Dialog tics aren’t always confined to a single character; this and Johnson’s sometimes idiosyncratic punctuation and paragraph breaks not infrequently make it hard to tell who is saying what. Johnson adheres to the Trad Mystery Guidebook perhaps too slavishly. It feels like the author’s running out the clock in the last couple of chapters before the denouement. While told in first person, Longmire’s spoken voice isn’t the same one that waxes lyrical about the landscape in the narrative; that latter is the author’s voice, and it’s jarring to hear coming out of Longmire’s thoughts. The villain falls from the sky in the final act; while I mentioned before that you’ll never guess whodunit, it’s not because of clever plotting but rather because the culprit isn’t even in the running until the last minute. And it appears all the ladies of Absaroka County are unaccountably attracted to our crusty, overweight, out-of-shape, nearly over-the-hill sheriff (including Deputy Vic), which makes very little sense and gets intrusive over time.<br /><br />The big reason? This will infuriate the nobody-can-make-decent-films-of-books posse: the TV series shows what the book could have been, but isn’t.<br /><br />The sheriff’s department Johnson wrote is staffed with people who mostly get along, set in a town where most everyone likes Our Hero and each other. The one potential irritant in Walt’s command (a wayward deputy) poses no real threat and is dealt with almost as an afterthought. In short, there’s not much conflict or tension beyond the specifics of the crime. As a result, Longmire has an essentially clear field in which to do his work. Perhaps this is Johnson limiting the problems he poses for himself in this debut novel, or perhaps he really meant the county seat of Durant to be West Mayberry.<br /><br />In contrast, A&E’s version of Absaroka County is riven with petty rivalries, ancient grudges, prejudice, class and racial animosity, and its share of cranks, creeps and crooks. (Village politics, like those in Henry Kissinger's academia, are so vicious because the stakes are so small.) TV Walt has a deputy running against him in the election for sheriff, an ex-sheriff who’s a conniving snake, positional and sexual politics at the stationhouse, and near-open warfare between the ranchers, energy companies, casino developers, Native Americans, meth cookers, hunters, tourists, and roughing-it outcasts. In short, the environment Our TV Hero navigates is far more rich, complex and dramatic than the one literary Walt inhabits, and looks more like the real world. Granted, this took some time to develop, but the seeds were planted in the first few minutes of the first episode. It also helps that TV Walt (Aussie actor Robert Taylor) is, though weathered, a fine figure of a mature man, so it makes more sense that he can do the things he does and also attract the county’s ladies.<br /><br />The Cold Dish isn’t a bad book, and is certainly worth checking out if you enjoy traditional mysteries not involving Oxford and country manors. Whether you press on after the first installment, however, will depend on what you seek from the series. I expect that fans of the TV series will be disappointed. Perhaps author Johnson adds more flavors to make for a richer stew in subsequent books. Maybe someday I’ll come back to find out – just not in the near future.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I was always trying to figure out how to clear up my internal storage so i can download more apps. This app is great, it shows all of your files and u cwn decide what to clean out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy so much, and Suzanne Collins managed to create an ending that brought justice to the capitol, but also struck the reader with surprise. I can't wait to see this adapted to the big screen!
B00G6MW68K|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the best concert DVD/Blu-Ray's that I've ever seen. Muse puts on such an amazing show, utilizing a fantastic backdrop and the entire stage, plus portions of the stadium floor.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen them in concert I highly suggest you pick this up then pray they come to your area next time they are on tour. I was lucky enough to see them this year (2013) and was completely blown away by how tight they are live. When I saw them I only owned 2 albums... now I have them all. What an amazing band, I can't recommend this enough.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the audio CD is much shorter than the Blu-Ray concert, only 13 tracks as opposed to the 22 on the Blu-Ray.
0553801473|5.0|It was a very good read, and it tied in nicely with the story line of the previous 4 books
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|what can you say.... 7 Freddie movies all wrapped in 1 package..... You can't beat it!!! I love these movies, the special effects are excellent, none of the computer generated stuff we see everywhere now, old school makeup, I love it!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as good as the first one and not as bad as the third one. It's an ok read, gives you plenty of time to steel yourself for the third one, which is not good at all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVE!!<br /><br />This game keeps me on my toes. It's so fun and exciting! I tell all my friends to down load this awesome game.
B000SX9IXO|5.0|This is as good as the band gets.  I would have preferred the original contents.  Don't need or care for the bonus cuts.  The original lp said everything the way it needed to be said.  You need to own this.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Coolest restaurant game I EVER played!<br />I've never played this one before just the regular Dinner Dash, now that I've tried this one(Cooking Dash) I'm addicted to it at the moment lol! It's great! It's amazing!
B000069KE0|5.0|Great buy.  Nice to get the MP3 for devices and the CD for the home player.  Absolutely one of the best Chicago albums you can own.  I really had forgotten why they set the music on fire.  This reminded me.  Spends a lot of time being played.  Terry Kath really made this band smoke and the dialogue between he and Cetera is outstanding.  GREAT music.
B00GINENG0|5.0|It is fun and is completely new and improved its own ideas and fables to love your own pet it is like gust say lol
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love these movies and they are good quality. I'm trying to catch up on the story because<br />I was a late starter.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's a very good product to watch movies/tv serious from the computer at the tv and also it's very good to present presentation at work to people from the laptop so they can watch it on a bog screen.
0061997811|5.0|My daughter is a Harry Potter fan (to say the least). I purchased this for her and she was delighted with it.
B002YVAT72|5.0|easy to use. I chose to use Audacity instead of their very limited packaged software. The turntable works fine, the sound is good. It does what I need. Very simple to hook up to my Mac.
0062101897|4.0|I gave this as a gift. It was on my daughter's Christmas list. She was pleased with it. She is a big Harry Potter fan.
B00BNPWBOO|5.0|Awesome Music .... never get tired of listening to this CD.  And, it grows on you - the more you listen the more you'll like it.
B00ABXA1HI|3.0|It does what it advertises. Seems like it uses a lot of resources, which I guess is to be expected. I haven't tried it anyplace away from home yet, just used my tablet from the other room to access my PC. Works OK for that so far.
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|Borrowing more than a little inspiration from the monstrous success of Broadway's WICKED, wherein two very different sisters play out their conflicts in Technicolor and with magic, FROZEN is both a throwback to the classic Disney animated features and a smart newfangled creation that surprises you at nearly every turn.  The score, by the Lopez duo who brought us some of Book Of Mormon and Avenue Q, is Broadway-ready, with a sensational centerpiece in the gorgeous and thrilling LET IT GO.  As sung by Idina Menzel (yes, Elphaba in the original WICKED), it is a spine-tingling anthem about, well, just being yourself.  Olaf the Snowman offers an adorable jolt of humor that feels organic, and not forced (think Shrek 3).  The 3-D version I saw surrounds you with snow and ice, and had me reaching for my scarf.  The script allows you to be drawn in, like all of the best stories, rather than clobbering you over the head.  It's a fantastic movie treat - for everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Well isn't this some crap?  Chromecast page says works with Chrome on Windows ... PERIOD ... just like Obama said!<br />After I get it and start the setup procedure I am told it is only for Win 7 & later ... I have Vista ...<br />Nothing I can see on product page about no Win Vista!<br />Now what ... Hold it until I upgrade?  Send it back?  Scream about it online?<br />Waiting to cool off first!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is such a fun game I'm glad it's on the kindle it's good on the xbox but better in my opinion yo have it moble.
B002UD56I6|5.0|If you're a Michael Jackson fan then you must definitely buy this!  It shows everything Michael was planning to do for his concerts in London before passing away.  His music and dance moves are still really fun to watch.  This is a must own!  You don't even need to watch it.  Listening to it is fun by itself.
B0063IH60K|1.0|this was one of the VERY few app that I was able to download and then play on my kindle fire later. Now, after about 2 months, It tells me that it was installed incorrectly and I need to re-download it!!! that's BS!  HATE THE KINDLE FIRE HD!!!!!!!
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|One of the best surfing movies told.  Gerard Butler and up and coming star Jonny Weston tell the true story of Jay Moriarity and Frosty Hesson.  I'm sure Hollywood jazzed the story up a bit, but who cares.  This is a great movie for the whole family to watch together.  It's definitely worth owning so buy it already!
B00EMAGCJM|3.0|It is a big change for Miley. I think the change is good and mixes things up, but not every song is very good. A do a lot of skipping around on his album.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have read this book three times, once as an audio book, and I get into it every time. The first time I picked it up was at a Starbucks on the bookshelf. I stayed and read through thirteen chapters before I realized I was supposed to be running errands that day. When I borrowed the audio book, I found myself in the car yelling at the CD player during turning points in the plot. I just can't help but get into it. It's wonderfully written and I've snagged several good and profound quotes from this book. It's emotional, funny, and inspiring. I highly recommend it.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Her best album by far. Every song is great and can be played on repeat! Buy it is you like Lady Gaga.
0061122416|5.0|Really wonderful read. I enjoyed the way the story was told and the length was perfect for a relatively quick read. The message was clear and I was very happy I finally got a copy.
B000V63AVY|5.0|I love supertramp, so naturally I found this album to be awesome. BUY BUY BUY. If you're a fan, buy this album.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|I am a woman and this watch is perfect for me. Everyone love it. Easy to adjust the size. Can wear it with sport, casual and business casual attire. Recommended to every swatch lover.
B0009VSB06|5.0|I am a novice at this. I wasn't sure what to expect after ordering this. I really really enjoy it. This is a great gift item for anyone who likes some adventure. I have found plenty of coins and other misc. things. I'm sure there are better ones out there, but this one is perfect for a beginner. I give it a five out of five stars. You can also set it for whatever type of things you would like to find. That is a plus as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to read this book after i saw the movie because the movie really didn't explain about why they do the games and why some people have more names in then others. Well i got my explanations and then some! I can't wait to read the next book and see the next movie.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|If you like Lady Gaga you will love this album. I thought it was pretty good. Some of the songs take some getting used to.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is so cool it can fly and I always dreamed of flying I love it. Me and my brother pretend it. I want to really fly someday.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I was really excited to play this game I thought it would be sick but after waging 5 min I got a little frustrated please fix this so I can play.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for so long and it is so nice to have it on kindle
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|totally hooked! Got my boy and nephew geeked on it too! Started wishing it didn't take a half an hour to receive an upgrade without having thousands of glu coins...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm seriously addicted to this game, I play every chance I can... I really need to check into rehab! lbvs
159102594X|5.0|What a pleasure to find a new author who's compulsively readable. I saw this book listed somewhere on one of those lists, &#34;Best of....&#34;, and got it from the library (sorry Jeff Bezos) -- I really enjoyed it. Literate, lots of interesting well-fleshed out characters, several threads going at the same time, and some things cleared up and almost resolved at the end of the first book. I am definitely a Joe Abercrombie fan now. Hurry and write some more, Joe.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|This is not Kanye...can't be Kanye. This project sounds like yeezy was reaching into no mans land and cooked up some 808's and headaches. I heard the reviews prior to downloading this project and I waited for the hype to blow over. I thought that this would be the type of album that grows on you. Unfortunately my biggest fears came true when I pressed play. The songs I reviewed prior to hearing the entire body of work are the only songs I like (3 tracks). Huge disappointment.
0553805371|5.0|My boyfriend just loved this book. He's a huge fan of Stephen Hawking and it answered a few of my boyfriend's life questions.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Awesome game I am so addicted to it already after playing a few matches I can't wait to see what else it has
0385493622|5.0|I could not put this book down! In clear, lively, captivating prose the author recounts the story of Fermat’s Last Theorem and its elusive mathematical proof. The period covered is essentially from the days of Fermat until the theorem’s proof by Andrew Wiles in the mid 1990s. Along the way, the reader is treated to the various valiant efforts by brilliant mathematicians through the centuries towards establishing such a solid proof – all in vain before Dr. Wiles. The ups and downs in the history of this seemingly intangible proof are particularly well illustrated.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the reader is exposed to various mathematical objects that mostly form part of number theory, as well as mathematical techniques that have been developed over time. Because the mathematics is so masterfully described, this book should be accessible to a wide audience.<br /><br />This amazing book should appeal especially to mathematics/science enthusiasts but any interested general reader could follow it quite easily and enjoy it tremendously.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app. It always works great for me. I don't really have any problems when playing it. My young nephew loves to play the little mini games and enter the competitions.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Well, it's Harry Potter complete collection on Blu-ray. If you didn't adore the Harry Potter franchise, you wouldn't buy this.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I really like the graphics and the gameplay of this game I really want more characters in the game or I Will explode<br />Robot that is perfect for the world :-D and the government got
141694740X|5.0|Excellent book.  I've passed it on to my girlfriends so I can't go back to read it - but words from it come back to me all the time.  I met a man I loved deeply, passionately.  I thought I had met the man of my life.  But all the signs were there as he became less and less &#34;into me&#34;.  It was hard to swallow, but I could see the truth after reading this book.  I felt I deserved more.  Since then, I've met someone who shows me every day how important I am to him.  I've had to retrain myself because I was attracted to those &#34;bad boys&#34; who treat you badly.  I guess I thought that was the way it is. Now I found a good man and I count myself very lucky not only to have him, but also to recognize how incredibly awesome he is.  We sometimes need a wake-up call.  Thats what this book did for me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Totally fantastic series! Read all three books in about three days and now I don't know what to do with myself. The books are amazing and you can't beat the price at 12.99 for the entire series
1609613937|3.0|I wanted permission to eat starch and this book gives it to you!  But I just couldn't get excited about eating starch if I wasn't allowed to have any oil.  I mean - no wonder you lose weight.  I like spices on things and I suppose you could bake some potatoes with spices but sooner or later, I don't know, I just didn't think I could keep this up.  What I did take away from this, though, is to completely cut down on the amount of animal protein I eat and try to have vegan meals.  So, I can have my starch and eat it too!  I just couldn't give up oil as well as meat.  But if I eat oil and starch, I think I can stay away from meat.  There's always a middle ground - though I doubt Dr. McDougall would agree!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works well most of the time.  It does need to be reset from time to time if it loses power of wireless internet.  It is nice that it doesn't stream from your device and you can use your ipad or phone without it slowing down.
1416909532|5.0|Great Book.  I read it as a companion to &#34;He's Just Not That Into You: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys&#34; and I highly recommend them together.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A lot of my friends have been trying to get me to play, I finally have and I like it. I'm stuck right now on 17, but it's ok.
1439107955|2.0|Very scientific.  This is a great book, I'm certain.  My mom has terminal cancer and I wanted to know more about it but even with that motivation, I couldn't force my way through it.  Still, I'm certain this is a good resource and for those who make their way through it, I'm sure they will take much from it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I fell in love with the characters.  Very well written. My only disappointment regarding these books is they had to end.  I would love another ten at the least!
0810994739|5.0|My son read &#34;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&#34; in one day and then ordered all the other books in the series.  He is 12 now and still gets a book as soon as it comes out.  &#34;Rodrick Rules&#34; was as good as all the rest.  Just a wonderful look inside the life of the &#34;antihero&#34; on a kids level - a young boy who struggles with everything.  It makes other wimpy kids not feel so alone.  And let's face it, we all have wimpy moments!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Quality of the movie is great in Blu-ray, I don't care about special features. All I wanted is the movie. Why rent it when you can buy it for $8?
B00F94CYJW|5.0|Our daughter loves LEGO Friends. She first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them. We purchased the \\"Olivia's Tree House\\" Set for her for Christmas and it was a big hit. Since then, we have purchased several additional sets for her collection.<br /><br />The LEGO Friends Dolphin Cruiser Play Set comes with a big 612 pieces. It includes two girl characters (Mia and Maya) and one boy character (Andrew). It comes with everything you could imagine for a boat trip. It has large yacht type boat that has a top that lifts off so you can play with your characters in the inside living areas (living room with an L-shaped couch, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom with two beds). The boat has several features like deck chairs, a water slide, a captains area on the top for driving the boat and a wave runner with a ski rope and skis for the characters to use. It also comes with lots of little accessories for drinks and snacks, music equipment, two dolphins and some fish to feed to them. It is a really nice and big set with a lot of playability and plenty of pieces to let your child's imagination run wild. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow and the recommended age is 7-12 because it is such a large set, but a 6 year old will only need minimal help with it.<br /><br />One point of caution, the MSRP on the LEGO web site for this set is $69.99. If a set isn't Retired, you shouldn't have to pay much more than the MSRP. That is the going rate from WalMart/Target/LEGO and usually when Amazon is the seller. Some secondary Amazon retailers sell the Friends sets for much more so be careful if the seller isn't Amazon, especially around the holidays when Amazon sometimes sells out. Make sure to shop around.  We picked it up when the price dropped to $50.99 on Amazon.  You can check the Amazon price history and set price drop alerts on camelcamelcamel dot com.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a huge and fun set that will be a great addition to your LEGO Friends collection. It looks really impressive when it is built and it is designed really well to allow for a lot of pretend play. While this is one of the more expensive LEGO Friends sets, the 11 cent per piece price is right in-line with the average for other multi-character sets. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Please Note: There is a another Amazon listing where I purchased this set at a better price available here: [[ASIN:B00CNBGUJE LEGO Friends Dolphin Cruiser]]EGO Friends collection. It looks really impressive when it is built and it is designed really well to allow for a lot of pretend play.
