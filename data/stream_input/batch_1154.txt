B0051QIGP4|1.0|If the point of the 99-cent price was to get me to try Amazon's MP3 store, it worked; if the point was to convince me to continue to use it in the future, it was a complete bust.    I was patient yesterday and last night, when repeated download attempts resulted in failure; I'm less patient today, now that Amazon's download software is telling my time has expired to download my purchase. Sent two e-mails to Amazon customer service so far; I'm still waiting for their first reply.    I'll be happy to replace this review with one regarding the actual music, but so far my experience is dominated by the fact that Amazon took my $1 and delivered roughly half of what they promised for it.

B004K4AUZW|3.0|The Fame and The Fame Monster were truly pop classics.  That said, Gaga's producer on The Fame chose to keep her vocals constrained into more manageable snippets using repetitive phrasing, cool synths and clean dance beats.  With the Fame Monster, the producers decided to let Gaga go into a longer format singing style using more analog instruments and limiting the cut up, simplified and electropop mixes that were on The Fame.<br /><br />With 'Born This Way', the producers have, once again, allowed Gaga to expand her vocals even further choosing to steer away from the cleaner dance pop arrangements into longer format vocals.  Also, they have added electric guitar and other genres into her songs.  While that's not necessarily a bad thing, it does make this album sound much less like the Gaga we have come to know on The Fame.  Instead, this Gaga is actually singing the number (for the most part) rather than singing clips and letting the mix engineer arrange the pieces into a song.<br /><br />That said, I would have preferred a combination somewhere in the middle.  Give us some natural vocal arranged songs like Marry The Night, Born This Way, Judas and Schei&szlig;e, but also give us some lighter dance pop songs like Pokerface, Just Dance and Love Game. Unfortunately, we don't really get much of lighter fare on Born This Way.  So, don't go into this CD expecting much of what you heard on The Fame.  In fact, Born This Way is more like The Fame Monster than The Fame.  In places, it also sounds strikingly like Madonna.<br /><br />On the production side, this CD is way overproduced. There's far too much reverb on many of the songs, the compression is too strong leaving the audio spectrum flat with far too little bottom end.  Comparing production of The Fame to Born This way, there really is no comparison.  The Songs on The Fame are crisp, clear and her vocals are front and center.  On Born This Way, her vocals are buried too deep in the mix, the compression causes the sound to attenuate too much leaving the songs sounding weak and unnatural.  The sound engineer needed to reduce the compression a lot and re-EQ the entire mix to sound clearer and crisper.  Also, whomever decided to go with distorted vocals in this mix should have been pulled from the project.  Distorted vocals never sound good and especially make this CD sound annoying rather than pleasant.<br /><br />As for the songs themselves, I wanted a chance to listen to the songs a bit before reviewing.  Now that I've had a week to digest the compositions and arrangements, here's the rest of this review.  For this CD, Lady Gaga would have done better to hold mix contests.  Put the stems out there and let remixers and DJs have at it. Does that mean the mixes on Born This Way are bad?  Well, let's just say that they are far weaker in arrangements than what's on The Fame.  Extreme care was taken crafting the songs on The Fame and, to some extent, The Fame Monster. Unfortunately, that level of care didn't carry into Born This Way. Now, some of that may be the compositions, but most of it is the choice of beats and choruses.  In some songs, there almost seems to be a case of adult deficit disorder.  That is, lots of mini-songs strung together to create a whole song rather than attempting to craft an entire song.<br /><br />Musically, the most cohesive songs (and the most like The Fame) are Marry The Night, Government Hooker, Judas, Schei&szlig;e, Bloody Mary, Black Jesus + Amen Fashion (which might as well be Madonna) and Born This Way.  Now, that's not to say they sound completely like The Fame, but they do sound the closest to The Fame that you'll find on this release.  The rest of the songs are fair and have their moments, but just aren't cohesive or dare I even say 'filler'.  Specifically, Bad Kids sounds like circa 1979 disco, Fashion Is His Love is just straight mid-80s dance and Electric Chapel just tries way too hard, but never gets there.  In fact, the rest of the songs all try way too hard, but never reach the level of the material on The Fame.  Basically, the melodies the songs not mentioned are too straightforward without a Lady Gaga spin on the material. Literally, anyone could be singing the rest of the material and, worse, it's just not that strong.<br /><br />The second disc is remixes of songs from disc 1. All I have to say about the remixes is, why bother? If these mixes represent the best remixes she could find, I'm at a loss. The best remix on disc 2 is Marry The Night, but unfortunately only lasts for 59 seconds before turning sour.  In fact, for that intro of 59 seconds, that mix sounds amazing and is far better than the 'real' mix on the first disc. I absolutely love the piano only mix for that 59 seconds. it's too bad Lady Gaga (or whomever) didn't choose that sound for the 'real' mix.<br /><br />Finally, the last problem.  I purchased the deluxe edition assuming it would not be censored.  Unfortunately, this is not the Explicit version.  In the Queen track, the arrangers have censored a word from the song leaving a noticeable drop out.  Instead, they could at least get Gaga to sing an alternative word instead of just blanking out the audio.  This sounds cheap and unprofessional.  Be advised if you purchase this edition.. it is not the Explicit version and is clearly edited.material on The Fame.

B004K4AUZW|1.0|There is a \\"thing\\" known in the recording industry as the \\"sophomore curse.\\" This usually occurs when an artist has such a phenomenally successful first recording, that all hype and expectations on the second are held at such a standard that it is almost never achieved.  Sad to say, such is the case with GaGa's sophomore recording, \\"Born This Way.\\" While \\"The Fame Monster\\" was a breath of fresh air to a pop/rock field which had become stagnant, \\"Born This Way\\" is stagnant.  It is over-produced, each track actually sounds identical to the next and the imaginative edge which Ms. GaGa experienced and defined in her first recording is seriously lacking in this attempt. It seems that her message, while being blunt as always (which is fine) is so in your face that it touches no one. The album is dull, unimaginative and boring. GaGa is a talent, there is no doubt about that.  What she needed to do is pour more of her talent into this album and less into her social causes and her meat dress.  A sad second release.
B000VZBCWE|4.0|I was not a Queen fan until I saw a portion of their 2008 Ukraine show with Paul Rodgers on DirecTV.  I liked that well enough to buy that DVD, and it is now a favorite.  So I wanted to wind the clock back and see how they were when Freddie was their lead singer.  This DVD is smashing.  Freddie was waaaay over the top, but an amazing performer.  He had an excellent voice that he shows off nicely here, along with good piano action.  After first seeing them in the 2008 show, seeing this 1981 show put Queen in better perspective for me.  Freddie could have been a top Broadway star if he had lived.  What a loss.  As others have already said, the video and audio quality on this are top notch.  And Freddie was in great form.
B004289ZW0|5.0|I've used a number of small GPS's and this is the best. I use it while flying in a small plane in combination with a navigation app on my iPad. The Bluetooth is great to reduce the number of cables in the cockpit. Once I had accidently left the unit turned on in my shirt pocket while flying and it still picked up enough satellites to provide a navigable signal.
B001DF68MA|5.0|We purchased this bike seat for our 18 month old after seeing it featured in some celebrity photos in People Magazine. We figured, \\"If it's good enough for Matthew McConaughey, it's good enough for us\\". This bike seat did not disappoint.     The construction and materials are quite superior and very sturdy, yet still very lightweight. The seat comes with padded cushions on the seat, back, and front pedestal which is great for little tushies on long bumpy rides. Our little one actually fell asleep on a ride and was able to use the padded front pedestal as a headrest! The foot rests are vertically adjustable to grow with the child and the seat belts are fully adjustable.    The most notable feature of this bike seat is the forward placement design. Most other seats we looked at were designed for the rear of the bike, which we felt was not ideal since the child is not easily visible nor accessible. With this seat the child is safely tucked in front of the adult rider allowing the rider to easily monitor the child and, if needed, protect the child in the event of a fall. This design also allows the adult rider to safely, quickly, and conveniently mount and dismount the bike without the risk of accidentally kicking the child.     The installation was quite simple (about 1 hour total); however, we did have to remove and re-install the mounting bar twice after a few test rides just to get to perfect fit. I have a mountain bike with an over-sized head tube, but luckily the installation kit comes with extra long hex bolts for this reason. And because the seat is easily removable from the mounting bar with just a single hex bolt, I can still go on solo rides without having to uninstall the whole thing.    The only minor drawbacks (and they are very minor) to this bike seat are that my knees bump into the seat a bit so I end up having to ride with my knees pointed outward; the cushions are not removable for washing, but can be spot cleaned; and lastly, with the mounting bar installed, I cannot raise or lower my own seat without first loosening the mounting bar.    Overall, we absolutely love this bike seat. Our little one loves this seat mostly because he gets a fantastic view of the road as opposed to watching daddy's sweaty back. Because he is safely tucked into my arms during a ride, we can easily talk and hear one another without having to turn around which makes for safer, more interesting and more interactive bike rides.
B000067JBN|5.0|I was a bit dejected to see that I had somehow ordered the VHS of this film, and not the DVD.  However, it played out beautifully on my combo DVD/VHS player (no wonder I paid so little?). So, no harm done.      I've read a lot of negative reviews about this remake, comparing it to the Rod Taylor 1960 original.  I don't get it.  The original is a great classic (I first saw it as a child in the early '60's; I own it now); however, this new version has a nice twist on the storyline, as well as beautiful special effects--especially the Eloi Cliff Village, which is amazing to see (I'd frame a poster of it if I could get hold of one).    Orlando Jones is absolutely perfect as a holographic encyclopedia who, through the centuries, remains stoically hopeful and ever eager to impart all he knows to any who will listen and learn.  Jeremy Irons, although thoroughly evil, is somehow deserving of our sympathy--unlike any 1960 Morlock.  Samatha Mumba and her real-life brother acomplish a very passable effort as \\"dark-skinned\\" Eloi--unlike any 1960 all-blond Eloi, by the way.  Guy Pearce played it as he always does--flawlessly.  And the time machine--the actual prop--is a work of art.    If you've seen the old version and loved it, don't feel guilty if, after watching this one, you find some good changes here.  And don't compare the original apples to the latest oranges.  Just enjoy the sights, new storyline, new characters, and traveling through time from the safety of your living room.      Yes, this new version does not contain the beautiful (but somehow too-childlike) character of Weena (Tuesday Weld).  Oh, darn!  But that was then.  The new-version Eloi didn't lose their IQ ... they just sort of lost track of time.    Caution!  This is not a film for small children.  The 1960 version was scary, but this newer version goes far beyond those years.  Enjoy!
B0051QIGP4|4.0|The power of music and fanfare can draw the masses, and Lady Ga Ga has succeeded in doing just that.  Indeed, the title track of the album, \\"Born this way\\" is a jumping dance number that had already made waves that thousands have compared to Madonna's \\"Express Yourself,\\" yes, the inspirational lyrics and the slight melody and rhythm.  But for this listener, this song as well as a few of other tracks on the album possess, an array of musical influences of rock and cabaret that even go back to the sounds of the late 1970s and 1980s, Donna Summer, Abba, Rickie Lee Jones, Elton John, Queen, and many others; the sound can be heard underneath all of the electronica hence the tracks, \\"You and I,\\" \\"Electric Chapel,\\" \\"Americano,\\" \\"Hair,\\" and \\"Bad Kids.\\"<br /><br />Besides the comparisons, all the songs on the record have a unique quality.  Indeed, there is a bit of electronic experimentations, but who can deny that important element when the album's production, as noted on the liner notes (the digital booklet with the song lyrics and provocative photo portfolio), occurred at the legendary Abbey Roads Studios; where rock and classic music was and is still being produced.  An amazing fact to know for music lovers, and Lady Ga Ga following in the tradition as many others before her.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I was extremely happy to find this series on sale here on Amazon, and snagged up this blu-ray set immediately. It arrived quickly, and I was amazed at the quality of this set.    Not only is the picture crystal clear in many shots (they did a really good job doing whatever they needed to do to get the film in HD), but the interface is great as well. Lots of commentary to listen to for all the fans who want to watch their show again and again, but this time with some insight.    I won't speak to the series itself. I don't think I need to. It's too good and needs no introduction.    If you're a Firefly fan: buy this immediately! If you're not a Firefly fan: buy this and watch it immediately!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|When I first heard Gaga's music, I thought I was hearing Madonna remix. Deja vu.    Don't fault me, as I spent my late teen years listening to Madonna's every song up to date, you really can't deny there are some similarities between the two - in a good way.    Finally, I hear the new generation of \\"meaningful worthy\\" pop ( Britney, Christina, sorry, you are not there at all... ), before I forever taking Bach with me to the grave.    Personally, I prefer to have a CD ROM, to preserve a \\"hard copy\\", but since Amazon has the cloud drive, and the price ( it was 99 cents on Monday 5.23.2011 for one day only for the whole album. )is too good to pass, I figure I should give it a try.    Working in technology company, I know such a good deal for such in high demand artist is going to put any network in jeopardy, even for Amazon. So I expect it is going to have tough time to deal with the sudden massive download ( remember how Victoria's Secret fashion show brought down the Internet many year ago ? ) . I waited until 11PM US Central time to do my purchase and it's just like that, in a split second, I have the whole album on my cloud drive and download to my PC.    So, for me, I have no complain but satisfaction on the download part.     The music is good, the deal is great. And I did my first digital album purchase in a perfect fashion.
B0051QJ83S|4.0|I too purchased the cd yesterday when it was on sale and after 24 hours it still did not download. All I did was give the MP3  downloads customer service dept. a call and the guy gave me a link on my invoice to re-download the CD again. Once I clicked the link the songs started downloading in the Amazon MP3 downloader and it finished within 5 minutes. Now that I have heard the cd it was worth the wait.
B004LZRRRE|1.0|The folks at Amazon graciously sent me a replacement \\"Deluxe Edition\\" when the first DVD was missing the Bonus Features.  However, the replacement DVD is also missing the Bonus Features.  It seems that all the Deluxe Edition sets in NTSC format are missing the Bonus Features.  Hopefully, Universal will get on this now that enough folks are getting these faulty NTSC formatted DVDs.  Pity, the concert video was well done--but both my DVDs did freeze for a moment during playback. Something is most certainly not right about this DVD production.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Lady Gaga's recent album is great, and another step in how her music is evolving. The only reason why it has a 3.5 star rating is because when she released the album on Amazon for 99cents, it overloaded the servers. So most of the low star reviews are due to the Amazon digital download service...so don't be deterred to buy this album.     Additionally, it was 99cents until a day ago, when it went up to 6.99. The reason for the 99 cents deal was just a release day promo...so it is not a bait and switch. You just had to be one of the lucky thousands of people who knew about the 99 cent deal to get this album for 99 cents.
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|Yes, the sound is old and sometimes a bit harsh. Still these are amongst the very greatest performances of the sonatas, and at a bargain price well worth having. (Reading some of the reviews I get the impression that had Beethoven risen from the dead and recorded these in 1960s sound some would pan the set for it.)    Also at a bargain price is Ashkenazy on Decca, who has better sound.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|It's that epoch already...<br /><br />Yes...<br /><br />Bethesda is launching an \\"Elder Scrolls\\" game late this year... oh boy. About the only tech release that is able to make me rush into upgrading my pc.<br /><br />My previous mobo/proc was an athlon 5400 with msi nvidia 550 mobo and 2 gigs of ddr2 800. Up to this point, and coupled with my trusty GTX 260, that combination just worked. Fallout 3 and new vegas ran on that setup very well.<br /><br />But still, Skyrim is coming, and nothing irks me more than running an elder scrolls game with an underpowered pc, like i did back when oblivion was released. Not this time, not a chance!<br /><br />I got this for the upgrade:<br />* This exact processor (I5 2500, not the 2500k variant which has unlocked multipliers and is more overclocker-friendly)<br />* P67 mobo from ECS (With Rev B3, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET THIS VERSION OR FURTHER OF THE CHIPSET as it no longer has the SATA bug)<br />* a Patriot 4gb 1600 cas9 memory module<br /><br />**** IN A NUTSHELL ****<br />This I5 just flies, zips around like a Porsche. First time in almost 12 years that i get an Intel instead of an AMD, and I tell you, this one is worth every penny.<br /><br />**** PERFORMANCE ****<br />I've tried a bunch of programs and games on it, some old some new, either in Win7 or Linux (ubuntu 11.04 \\"natty narwhal\\"), and I'm yet to find any program that comes close to challenging it. Games, compression apps, you name it, this processor rocks...<br /><br />From my previous setup to this one, as an example, \\"Fallout: New Vegas\\" runs so much more smoothly, at 1920x1080, full antialiasing and details. I guess the proc/memory combo was a bottleneck in my previous setup.<br /><br />**** THERMAL ****<br />At first, when I unpacked it, I noticed it comes with the run-off-the-mill heat sink and fan used with the LGA775s, the round aluminum one with the copper core. I was kinda nervous, as this being a quad core processor, I was afraid it couldn't possibly be enough for cooling it. I even thought of scraping the factory thermal wax that comes with it and applying a bit of silver-based thermal grease. As I didn't have any with me, and the prospect of keeping it on the box while i ordered some thermal grease online bugging me, I just plugged it with what came in the box.<br /><br />Wow, were my fears unfounded!<br /><br />It doesn't just run cool, it's downright gelid. If the gnome sensor applet i installed is to be believed, under a stress program I wrote no core went over 45 degs C... Are you kidding me? This thing is just amazing, the 32nm process does wonders to the thermal performance.<br /><br />All in all, if you're considering this CPU as an upgrade, don't ponder it any further, go and buy it, you won't be disappointed!

B0042RJWTC|1.0|My one star is based solely on the lack of captions. I loved the series, but of course, there were captions through the tv. There are many people who rely on captions when they watch DVDs. Older viewers whose hearing is not what it used to be and viewers whose second language is English are particularly helped by close-captioning and/or subtitles. In fact, many people learn English quicker by watching films with subtitles. Considering how many movies have captions, it can't be very difficult to offer them. I bought the first season and was disappointed that captions were not included. I was about to purchase the complete season, hoping that there would be captions for the final boxed set, but since I don't see captions mentioned in the properties, I guess I'll save my $70.00. Maybe I can spend it on \\"The Borgias\\" if that studio has the courtesy of supplying subtitles.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Bought the album for .99.  Thought it was a great deal and I'd give Amazon a try.  Never was able to download on the day it was offered.  I thought I would leave the downloader up and get it the next morning after the rush.      Guess what, OFFER EXPIRED and Amazon got my .99.  WTF?  Thanks Amazon, I'll stick with Apple if this is the kind of Customer Service you offer.  Can't quite hang with the big boy.......
B0051QIGP4|1.0|What happened?  The album (not just one song) was suppose to be priced at 99-cents all day.  It shows $6.99 right now.  Bate and switch?
B0051QIGP4|5.0|99 cents isn't much to lose and it downloaded to my itunes and transferred to my iphone in 10 mins.  This was at 9:15 pst, so well after the well documented issues.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|Possessing a Doctorate in Dance Music and a talent large enough to match her out-sized persona, Lady Gaga gifts her Little Monsters (as well as the rest of us) with the stunning \\"Born This Way.\\" If you're familiar with the first two singles \\"Born This Way\\" and \\"Judas\\" but are not impressed, take heart. The balance of this CD is an instant classic.<br /><br />Hitting with the force and intensity of an F5 tornado, \\"Born This Way\\" is a dance floor tour de force sampling a wide variety of genres of dance music and a broad range of stylistic influences. Obviously there is Madonna (though Lady Gaga has a true, powerful voice) but I also heard hints of Bruce Springsteen (\\"Marry The Night\\" complete with sax work from E Street Band member Clarence Clemmons), Santa Esmeralda, Grace Jones and Abba - to name a few. Yet ultimately it is all thoroughly Lady Gaga. Listening to \\"Born This Way\\" I was reminded of Beck in the way she has digested her various influences and returned it back to her listeners in fresh, new forms.<br /><br />Perhaps this CD's biggest strength is the razor sharp songwriting. Lady Gaga knows how to write a killer hook and how to structure a song so that it corkscrews into your brain and booty and won't let go. The production and engineering are pristine. Even if the Lady G is not your musical cup of tea you can't help but be impressed with the sonic storm she and her cohorts have whipped up.<br /><br />If I have any quibbles at all it would be the lack of a single ballad and a certain thematic sameness to several songs. That said, I loved \\"Marry The Night,\\" \\"Government Hooker,\\" \\"Bloody Mary,\\" \\"Electric Chapel,\\" \\"You And I\\" and the brilliant new single \\"The Edge Of Glory.\\"<br /><br />In sum, \\"Born This Way\\" will rule the charts and radio for the remainder of 2011 and maybe into 2012. If you don't like it or her you need to find somewhere else to be because Lady Gaga and this special CD will be EVERYWHERE. It is now truly Lady Gaga's world and we just live in it.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|i'm so glad i got this so cheap, even if her words are worth a thousand pictures <3     so glad i didn't listen to the leaked tracks.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|This movie promised to be very good but fell short. The cars were cool and Kurt Russel is always worth watching, but the aimless dialogue sequences between the groups of female characters drug on forever! I had to fast forward until the scenes of Tarantino's idea of \\"girl talk\\" were over. Imagine two 15+ minute episodes of four females sitting around talking about crap before the movie begins again. If you will take note, Tarantino always has extensive scenes of dialogue between characters...it was ok in Pulp Fiction, but it is becoming quite annoying as his films progress and he sticks to this routine. Planet Terror was much better in this grindhouse double feature scenario...Tarantino should learn from Rodriguez!
B002P8O29K|1.0|Although i really wanted to see this movie on blu ray,perhaps amazon should be more specific about blu ray zones,as i cannot watch this movie here in Australia.
B0041L0Z1S|4.0|I would give the movie itself 5 stars.  It is a very good adaptation.  However, the instant video version is NOT the full version.  There is at least one scene completely left out of the movie, and I can't be sure it is the only one.  I was very disappointed as it was at the climax of the movie.  (For those that have seen it, it is the scene on the bench when they are discussing the workings of her heart.) And Amazon does not tell you it is not the full version of the series either.
B004K4AVAG|1.0|Coming off of The Fame Monster, you would expect more from the woman who promised the album of the decade. The album consists of very generic (and repetitive) music and terrible, terrible lyrics. The vocals are the only thing that can be admired on the album.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I bought this CD long time ago when I didn't have a child and actually was not married. Now my daughter is 9 months old and she falls asleep with the first song in the album. I think there is a special magic energy in this music. Thank you, Celine, for such wonderful performance.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This morning I was very bummed because i knew I would not be able to get Born this Way thanks to my broke college student status. However, amazon kindly emailed me to let me know they were selling it FOR ONLY 99 CENTS!! I jumped on that offer asap! After reading to make sure that it was the entire album and that it would be playable in itunes, I went ahead and bought it.  Apparently the download is not working for people now, or is very slow. I downloaded my album today at 4pm EST and it seriously only took about 3 minutes... I think it might have been before the major traffic came, but still, I think the bad dl times are just a fluke thanks to Lady Gaga's popularity. I wouldn't recommend writing off amazon just because of this, especially since the price can't be beat!  Anyway, the album is great and it was super super easy to put it in my itunes folder and onto my iphone. I'm definitely going to check out amazon's prices before dl-ing from itunes for music in the future! Thank you amazon!!
0316069353|4.0|I liked Mickey Haller straight off the bat with the Lincoln Lawyer and can easily see why Mike has decided to shift from the Bosch series (writers get tired of extending the same characters too, not just readers). Connelly is on strong form here, and while this isn't quite the kick start I enjoyed with The Lincoln Lawyer, it's a worthwhile addition and we can see he's on track here.<br /><br />However, I notice a lot of complaints about the Kindle pricing. One reviewer goes so far to blame Amazon - without realizing it's the publishers usually protecting their paper pricing (how can they sell a $20 hardback in the shops when an e-book version is available for less than half? That's the nub of it right there.) For more on this, see Joe Konrath's and Barry Eisler's arguments.<br /><br />I say this too because of my own experience with just recently putting up one of my own books at $2.99 on Kindle. An old book, you say? Not really. It's the first time it's appearing to a US audience, and when it came out in England it was matching Connelly's The Poet in both sales and reviews. And when you look at the price gap, there seems no justification for a new Kindle at such a high price.<br /><br />But don't blame Connelly or any other author: it's a publishing protective pricing issue. It will change given time - though not just now.

B00005N6KG|2.0|I love these headphones. I really do. But they don't work for very long.

Around 05 or 06, the pairs generally started to last for around 4-6 months. I would gladly pay $30 dollars for these if they last for a year - they're that great.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Great album, great price, great way to get it.  Downloaded directly into iTunes in 2 minutes.  Good job Gaga and Amazon.
B0015DROBO|2.0|This book could have been so much better.  The character development is ok, but if this were a movie, it would be a softcore porn.  Here's the main theme of the story: Who's sleeping with who, and how many times?  If this were real life, the main character would have at least 5 S.T.D's, and would have about 8 kids with 4 different women.  The author must be an atheist, because he sure doesn't talk too highly about religion either.  I put down the book before I finished it because I just couldn't take it anymore.  Do not waste your time with this book.  It is overrated.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|So....  I do understand the frustration with the downloads today.  But aside from that, the album is amazing.  In no way are the songs that have been released as singles so far the best ones.  This album showcases Gaga's creativity, diversity, and epic talent.  I have nothing but respect for an artist that can write, sing, dance, and play instruments while existing in the pop genre.  Aside from this, she has a positive message and is a voice of inspiration for youth and adults alike.  She is like the unicorn, nearly mythical.  The songs go from 80's inspired hits, to club anthems, to epic ballads.  She does take inspiration from a number of artists... and while some may look at it as unoriginal... I see it as paying tribute to the artists that inspired and formed her.  You go Gaga.. keep on making magic.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I heard about this being offered for 99 cents, logged into Amazon to download it, found it offered as promised. Took about 10 minutes to download, no problems. Thanks Amazon and Lady GaGa!
B004PP158W|5.0|So, I loved this episode, but it made me wonder how much of it was accurate, so is that really Bob Singer? Is that how many of the sets are built?  I know it's filmed in Vancouver.  I guess I'm not an avid fan to watch all the behind the scene stuff after all! And I was very mad about the line regarding the viewers... \\"according to the lady, not many people do\\".  SAD!  So is this the final season then?  I love this show!
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I wasn't really sure if I wanted to pay more than ten bucks for this album. Then amazon was like you want it for less than a dollar?! Ha I mean you must be the world's most stingy person in the world to pass it up for less than a dollar. Overall the album gets like a B+. Bloody Mary and Marry the night are really good.
B0050N8N0Q|2.0|One good song does not an album make. I was in love with \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" when it came out and I mildly enjoyed \\"Houdini\\" off of the EP. Unfortunately, those are the best two songs on this whole album. The rest of it comes off as MGMT throw aways or half cooked ideas. I think these guys have the potential to write great pop songs but this album doesn't show case it outside of the songs you probably already heard. Save your money, stick to the EP and look for their sophomore effort.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have to start by saying that generally I am more critical of an album that is popular with the masses. Personally, I gravitate towards singer-songwriters and songs that are more under-produced than over. However, that being said, I finally decided to give this album a chance and cannot BELIEVE how much I love it. Another reviewer mentioned that with the handful of songs that are just magical it is hard to keep up that momentum throughout the whole album...but...the ones that are \\"magical\\" are enough to keep me playing it over and over, soaking it in. Highlights for me: Rolling in the Deep, Turning Tables, Set Fire to the Rain, Someone Like You, Take It All, He Won't Go (Ok, maybe I should have listed the ones that are just \\"good\\"). Her voice is original, and combined with the songwriting, it sounds vulnerable. I think this is good enough to hook people no matter what genre you usually listen to. You can't ignore the flat-out talent.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|worked perfectly for me! i just downloaded it then put it on my amazon cloud and from there downloaded them all to my iTunes with my amazon mp3 downloader! very happy :D can't believe it was only 99 cents!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This Album is Amazing. The Beats are very intense and very loud. I Love The Meaning of this album. Being Free and Loving Who You Are.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|I ordered this over 24 hours ago and yes I feel I have been patient. It hasn't even started to download and is just showing waiting with 0% complete. I, too, have downloaded from Amazon before with no problems but this is ridiculous. This is not the artist's fault, it is Amazon's. This was a huge event as fans have been waiting and they have failed greatly ... as of now, now competition for Itunes....yes, they had the best price but am still waiting for the new album.....so wrong and they are not even answering the emails....I have sent four and no response. Great Customer Service....right?????     PS Need to rate.....having heard some of the new songs on Fuse I can rate her product....as for Amazon's service and customer service....-0.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Would love to leave a review of the music, but as of this morning, no download to my PC or Cloud.  Funny how easy it was for Amazon to download the money from my account.  My customers would be all over me if I ran business this way.  Disappointed.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|So you make an incredible offer, don't deliver the goods (downloaded content didn't work) and pull it back (offer expired).  Do you know how much business you're going to lose because of .99?
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|This is one of my Favorite Movies, I never been to Scotland maybe some day I will. The life of Sir William Wallace the Greatest Scottish Hero who fought for Scotland Independence from the British in the 12th Century. I have seen BRAVEHEART several times, at first was hard to understand the accent, now I know it by Heart...I love the Battle Scenes, well done and very Exciting and Believable, so is Mel Gibson, I like the Relationship with his Wife, you can feel all the Love...in the Movie That is. Winner of 5 Oscars, no wonder it is an Awesome looking Film! Thank you
B000T05R90|3.0|Big PF fan since they started when I was in college but this really only has one saving track and that is Arnold Layne. Probably why AL became, I think, their first single.
0596805527|5.0|JavaScript: The Definitive Guide is not just a complete reference of the language, like O'Reilly's other 'thick books,' but also provides a deep dive into JavaScript development. However, if you're just starting out and will be using one of the various libraries (like jQuery), this book may not (yet) be for you.<br /><br />First, the sixth edition is the first I've read, so I can't speak to any changes. Instead, my review is focused on the book as a first-timer reader to the 'series.'<br /><br />JavaScript: The Definitive Guide is broken up into four parts; Core JavaScript, Client-Side JavaScript, the Core JavaScript Reference, and the Client-Side Reference. If you've ever picked up one of O'Reilly's other reference books, like Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference, you know about what to expect from those last two parts - a deep reference to the language.<br /><br />The first two parts, however, are a 'deep dive' into the actual language itself. Unlike a mere reference book, JavaScript: The Definitive Guide actually teaches you how to develop in JavaScript, starting at the core fundamentals, and working your way up to more advanced topics.<br /><br />Part of the 'deep dive' aspect also includes following best practices, making numerous references to Douglas Crockford's JavaScript: The Good Parts throughout the first part of the book, which is about 30% of the book. Alone, the first part of the book provides an excellent, near-complete, tutorial on the language.<br /><br />Historical information is also included, which I found to be very interesting when it came up, as well as implementation-specific functionality, that has limited use at this time (and as such, I personally found it distracting, and began skimming over later instances, but it's still nice that it's provided).<br /><br />The second part focuses on the Web aspects, which is quite honestly where most people will be making use of JavaScript. This part covers about what you'd expect, as well as jQuery, client-side storage, and HTML5 functionality.<br /><br />The jQuery information is around 60 pages of content, covers version 1.4, and also includes a bit about jQueryUI (a very little bit). It's quite refreshing to see jQuery included in the book, but as noted initially, if you're looking at focusing just on using a library, it may be better to get a resource focused on just that.<br /><br />The second part is approximately 40% of the book.<br /><br />The third and fourth parts are similar to O'Reilly's other reference books, and are therefore fairly detailed, with examples included. Depending upon your preference, you may find the reference valuable, or prefer searching online. The examples included give the book a slight advantage over the average Web site. Honestly, I generally prefer using online resources, so I don't see myself consulting these later parts very often, if at all.<br /><br />Finally we come to the actual book itself. I received an electronic copy of the book, through the O'Reilly Blogger Review Program, so I can't speak to the quality of a physical copy. However, in the past I have generally found O'Reilly books to be well made, with bindings that last.<br /><br />And now comes the rating.<br /><br />After the first part of this book I was impressed by JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, and could easily have stopped there and been happy. The jQuery inclusion was a nice touch, which may be sufficient to push people who weren't thinking about using a library in their development to doing so, and may actually provide enough information for someone who wants to start learning JavaScript via jQuery. It is, in short, a true guide to JavaScript, and not just a reference book.<br /><br />For these reasons, I must give JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 5 of 5 stars.The jQuery information is around 60 pages of content, covers version 1.4, and also includes a bit about jQueryUI (a very little bit).

B001QITO52|3.0|Favorite track on this is Learning to Fly; this really shows PF's change when you compare this with same track on Pulse. Love all PF but won't put this anywhere near the top of their stuff. I'm same age as David Gilmour so have really become attached to their music over the many, many, many years.
B004K4AUZW|2.0|I am a Lady Gaga fan and I was anticipating this album.  It would have been like the second coming of Jesus,as Lady Gaga would put it, but it all spiraled to a flood of repeated beats (I am an atheist anyways, so all the religious reference on this albums are bland).  The only savable beats are \\"Government Hooker\\" and \\"Bloody Mary\\", which I am currently listening and totally digging but thats it.  It's been six months in waiting, and kind of disappointing, in fact this year music has been disappointing.  The end of the world should have been last Saturday if music isn't going to get better.  Of course Lady Gaga can't do wrong with all her outfits and crazy performances.  Her videos however, have been wacky, to say the least, I think I should take over and show her some worthy films that would be awesome to lay tribute in her videos.
1594202559|5.0|Mallaby has done an outstanding job researching this book. The title may be misleading which perhaps has contributed to its lack of great popularity. His book is much more than just a history of hedge funds. There is a lot of excellent analysis of various financial crises around the world. Mallaby examines these crises through the eyes of various hedge fund managers. In the end, he has come up with a very enjoyable, interesting and insightful book. In the final chapter he tackles the subject of hedge fund regulation.     If you have enjoyed \\"Liar's Poker\\", \\"When Genius Failed\\", \\"The Big Short\\", or \\"Fool's Gold\\", you will not be disappointed with Mallaby's book. Besides its historical value, investors can also learn a lot from this gem. Highly recommended.
B000N6TYLW|2.0|Seasons one through six are great!  I don't know what happened in the final season, however, it is the opposite of great.  The season feels rushed and choppy.      Lorlei takes off to Paris with Chris to dump Gigi off with her mom and then they decide to get married?!?  Luke and Lorlei continue their love-hate relationship but it is more strained than ever.  And Rory decides NOT to marry Logan?!?  Come on!  Lorlei and Rory's relationship seems distant and not as quippy as the previous seasons.  Overall, I did not enjoy the final season.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This album is fantastic. Very different from her previous albums, a good kind of different. This will definitely be an album that people will remember.    Best Tracks..  Marry the Night  Born This Way  Government Hooker  Judas  Hair  Scheibe  Bloody Mary  Bad Kids  Fashion of His Love  You and I  The Edge of Glory
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I only wanted to download \\"Judas\\" but when I found out that the entire album's $0.99, why not?  I ought to be thankful and I truly am.  For that I will just point out one very eggregious issue I have with this piece of work out of maybe three or four.    \\"Americano\\" is sooooooooooo bad (as in AWFUL) that I have to delete it from my computer!  The first couple of lines is a rip off of the song \\"Mambo Italiano\\".  Other than \\"Judas\\", the song I really love in this album is \\"Electric Chapel\\".  The rest are just OK...kind of the songs you just hear in the background.  I haven't heard \\"You and I\\" because the download failed...anyway, if it's really good, I don't mind spending $0.99 to buy that track.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|For 99 cents for the whole album? I'll wait to get it. Except mine downloaded in less than 5 minutes.  So go for it!  Go get the new album for 99 cents, and enjoy!  It's a great album too.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|I listen to lots of music. Lots. My headphone collection spans Sony, Ultrasone, A&H, and AKG, and I am constantly listening to music in various forms, from live to out of a small MP3 player. My following review is based on the items attributes<br /><br />Ease of Use:<br />It has an on/off button, bass boost switch, and volume control. All in all it is pretty easy to figure out how to use. There is an input label where you plug in from your mp3/cell/whatever into the mini-amp. It has the international headphone symbol where you plug your ears into as well. Its the size of a hotel/restaurant matchbox (or about twice the width of an ipod nano, but the same depth and height). it has a belt clip that I used more for clipping onto my lapel since that worked better for me with the length of connecting cable that came with it. All in all, Ease of use gets a 4/5 due to it's basicness. I would have given it a 5 if not for the volume control, but that will be covered next.<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br />The frequency response was decent and audio is pretty normal. It won't ever make an inferior recording sound good (nothing will) However it is pretty decent at maintaining minimal distortion from the original. Most of the distortion areas typically occur at the cut off areas for MP3 compression so its not really noticeable. But if you are listening to say...a record...or using it as a live-cast headphone amp you'll notice it. I don't know why you would use it for such events though.  With a portable CD player you will get some distortion at the upper and lower frequencies, but for most people, those are about the same frequencies your headphones cut out in. Now, the volume button is pretty much worthless on the box. It won't ever make it any louder than the input line, so its not really a gain control. It just extends battery life so your music box won't have to power your headphones. Put the volume at max and leave it there is my advice. All in all its a pretty standard audio quality, so it gets a 3/5<br /><br />Battery Life:<br />Okay, now lets get into the nitty gritty of this beast. Standard iPod play time between charges is now up to 40 hours. The iPod is of course the industry standard for mp3 player comparisons, so if you have a zune or an alternate brand, don't be hating. I got about 6 hours of listening per charge before it had to be recharged again. The nice thing was it only took about 3 hours to charge, after an initial 8 hour charge time. This listen/charge cycle meant that for me, I ended up charging it about every two days. Still, only getting about 6 hours of playtime per charge means I give it a 2/5 rating.<br /><br />For the final battery life though...I was impressed with the idea of a rechargeable headphone amp, but the follow through was horrible. In just over a month of use (admittedly near daily use) the internal battery died and could not be resurrected. With the design of the amp, it could not be changed either. The whole thing had to be replaced. Total battery life gets a 1/5 rating.<br /><br />For $20 you expect a whole lot more than what you get, so my final over-all rating is a 2/5. I think that if they renovate the E5, they should just get rid of the on-amp volume control, and FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S MUSICAL allow the owner or user to change out the internal battery.3/5    Battery Life:  Okay, now lets get into the nitty gritty of this beast.

B0019LY5IM|5.0|I got this at a great price compared to retail stores, brand new and arrived at my doorstep in that condition.
B0000DZ3EN|2.0|Fans of the dark and dire \\"Return To Oz\\"  (1985) defend it by saying it is closer in style and tone to L. Frank Baum's original Oz books than the cherished MGM \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\" from 1939. I've read quite a few of Baum's Oz books, and I strongly disagree. True, Baum's Oz books do contain more darker elements than the MGM musical. But Baum's books are also philosophical, whimsical, full of humor, happiness, and joy. There is no humor, happiness, or joy in \\"Return To Oz.\\"<br />  I have no objection to a film being closer in style to Baum's books. I don't even mind that this is not a musical. The problem with \\"Return To Oz\\" is its tone and approach. For this, Walter Murch and Gill Dennis, who adapted  Baum's \\"The Marvelous Land Of Oz\\" and \\"Ozma Of Oz\\" into this one film, are entirely to blame. We begin six months after Dorothy (Fairuza Balk) returned home to Kansas from her original Oz adventures. She can't stop talking about Oz, so Aunt Em (Piper Laurie) decides to take Dorothy to a mental hospital for electroshock treatments-- so all of Oz will be erased from her mind!! I assure you, Baum never subjected Dorothy to mental hospitals or electroshock therapy! Surely, Murch and Dennis could have devised another way to return Dorothy to Oz.<br />  As if narrowly escaping electoshock therapy in Kansas wasn't frightening enough, Dorothy soon discovered that Oz is in dis-repair, being taken over by the Wicked Gnome King (Nicol Williamson) and Evil Mombi (Jean Marsh, who played a very similar role, as Evil Queen Bavmorda in \\"Willow\\"; also in 1985). Dorothy makes new friends, Billina, the talking chicken, Tik-Toc, the mechanical man, Pumpkinhead, and something called The Gump-- while discovering that her old Oz friends have all been turned to stone!  And Dorothy's beloved dog Toto has been sadly left behind in Kansas. Meanwhile, Princess Ozma of Oz has been trapped inside of a mirror.  Williamson and Marsh also play the psycho doctor and his stern nurse at the mental hospital in Kansas.<br />  The entire film rests very heavily on the young shoulders of Fairuza Balk as Dorothy, who saves the film from being a complete disaster. Fairuza Balk plays Dorothy with the same wide-eyed innocence that Judy Garland did in 1939. The difference is: Judy had a good script and co-stars to work with. Poor Fairuza is stuck with a terrible script and no co-stars at all to speak of. Fairuza, full of life, is surrounded by a bunch of lifeless animatronic characters from Jim Henson's Creature Shop and too many annoying Claymation effects. Fairuza Balk's performance is all the more extraordinary considering she is trapped in a cinematic disaster and she seems keenly aware of that fact.  You  can't help feeling sorry for poor Fairuza. The film's only other saving grace is the hauntingly beautiful musical score by David Shire.  A justice, of sorts, was done. Fairuza Balk went on to have an interesting adult career, Walter Murch, mercifully, never directed another movie, and \\"Return\\" eventually gained a cult following.  Watching MGM'S 1939 \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\", I always wondered why Dorothy wanted to return to Kansas. Watching this movie, I wonder why anyone would want to watch such a dire version of Oz.  The film takes a preverse delight in its own relentless gloom and doom.  And the relentless darkness sinks this movie.  No, this is not the MGM Oz. But it is not Baum's Oz, either. It is not Oz at all, in fact. It is an odd  Anti-Oz;  the Oz film for \\"Oz fans\\"  who prefer darkness to light, and despair and misery to hope and happiness.Kansas.

B001ECQ4HG|5.0|Just got my bluray copy and checked out a bunch of scenes and it's excellent, the best transfer of this film I have ever seen  (I have seen it on vhs, the original dvd and the \\"2-disc special edition directors cut\\" dvd)    It's a high-fidelity digital transfer that looks as close to the original film as I expect most people are ever going to get.
0307595862|5.0|High quality crime fiction - if you like good writing, gritty details, totally engrossing plots - here they are.  An intelligent book for intelligent readers. I highly recommend  reading  all Nesbo's books.
0307270807|5.0|I am amazed that writing about such a heinous fiasco, such a gross mistake, such a mind-bending substance as the Vietnam War--from the grunt's perspective--could have been so lucidly, so beautifully rendered in prose.    This book is a two-fer: Great writing. Extreme war reporting. I did not want it to end--And I've read it before.    A lyrical war trip: an all-time classic of war writing, close, at times to poetry.    What \\"Catch-22\\" was to WWII, \\"Dispatches\\" is to Vietnam, except it is not fictive.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|I love that Lady Gaga has included some poppy easy hooks and some new interesting different sounds. Doesn't sound exactly like all the other stuff that comes out from the pop world. Still very fun.
0743566572|1.0|I saw this on the shelf in the library and thought I would give it a short. Nope, I made it maybe 40 pages in and turned it back in. Boring and derivative and then I realized why the author's name was familiar. She's that plagiarist I heard about years ago. I never read any of her stuff back in the day, but if this book is any indication, her writing has not improved.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is a very good bag for someone looking for a new bag and wants some room to grow. It is not very big making it a great size for most people.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It is has a lot of room to grow for someone without an excessive amount of equipment<br />- The construction of the body seems very solid and well made<br />- The padding isn't excessive but it's enough to protect your gear<br />- Amazing price at around $40<br />- Looks good and discreet<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The straps are the worst part of this bag. They seem to be an afterthought to a great bag. They are not too uncomfortable but seem very flimsy. If you carry too much weight in the bag(like I did), the straps and handle do not feel like enough to carry the bag. Let me say that I never saw any tearing and it's just a feeling I got.<br /><br />Overall this is a good bag. I had to return mine because I am someone with an excessive amount of gear. I did not feel completely comfortable carrying a lot of heavy gear in this bag because of the straps. For the price this is a great bag and is made for people without a lot of heavy equipment. I would be fine using this bag without all my heavy gear and only a few select things, but I already have a bag for that and that's why I returned this one. This bag was not made for someone like me but it may be for you. Next I'm trying [[ASIN:B000YIWR8G Lowepro Fastpack 350 (Black)]] at double the price but seems like a better fit for me.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|Not as good as Fame/ Fame Monster, it almost sounds like she's trying too hard to keep her fan's attention. I originally only wished to purchase one song from this album, but at 99 cents, how could I resist? At least the price makes up for the disappointment in the rest of the album AND the 8-hour download time.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|I tried to order this digital download last night from Amazon.  The Gaga album wouldn't even begin to download at all.  I was sure that my unfamiliarity with using Amazon's digital download since I had never used it before had something to do with it.  But for $0.99 I went for it.  Then I started reading about the various issues that everyone was having.  So, I thought I'd just wait for the server traffic to slow down and try again in the morning. Well, today there's no sign that I even ordered it and now my only option is to re-purchase it at the usual Amazon price.  I've NEVER had any problems with NUMEROUS physical orders from Amazon.com but this ONE problem is enough to ruin my view of Amazon. I could understand if I simply had to wait for traffic to slow down and attempt to download the next day, but the fact that I can't download the album AND it seems as if my order was never even processed, I have to re-purchase at FULL PRICE.  Which if I decide to do will be done from iTunes.  BAD, bad experience, Amazon.
B00006CXXU|3.0|this album is ok for me but i must say i love the first 3 singles and the 5th. other tracks like the album intro and songs like im ok and the voice with in are stand out tracks.    she has a very good voice and they all work well with the songs on this album. my only prob is that i love pop i mean very popsh sounding. this album as more soul and other things that do work for her but i dont care much for.   overall 3 stars
B0051QIGP4|5.0|From what I have been hearing this album is either love it or hate it. Personally I love every song except for Bad Kids and The Queen (latter of which is on Deluxe version). I would admit that for .99 cents this is a great bargain; for me though I am glad I got the deluxe version...I am a fan of remixes so it works.    One of the biggest things I noticed is that this album is a totally different style than what I - and presumably other - Gaga fans are used to. I think this is far from \\"trash\\" that people have been calling it. Again, I feel that you will either like these songs or they will not be your style. My personal favorites are Marry the Night, Government Hooker, Bloody Mary and Heavy Metal Lover. Overall the album does not disappoint. If you are looking for similar music to what she has released in the past, you may find similar beats/rhythms in parts of the songs; however, the songs are less general pop and more heavy rock style.    Also, a small comment - please STOP saying Gaga is copying Madonna. Seriously...every artist has obvious influences and they use those influences to help with the creative process. Madonna is just one of many influences that can be found in Gaga's music. And no, I am not \\"brainwashed\\" by her music either...I'm quite capable of thinking for myself - I just know good music when I hear it. And hey, if you don't like it, enjoy your your freedom to choose not to listen to it :)

The oat bran for fiber solves the problem of feeling hungry and getting bound up. The three of us have lost over 20lbs. each this month so far and have not felt hungry or had cravings.
1602830452|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this set; Clive Merrison is amazing as Holmes and Michael Williams is an outstanding Watson.  In my mind I could see them as I listened, and although I have movies and audio CD's with at least 25 sets of different actors playing Holmes and Watson, Merrison and Williams have become one of my favorite Holmes and Watson pairings.  The duo have the right mixture of affection and (in Watson's case) exasperation.  Merrison is not afraid of being friendly to Watson and does not hide behind a Spock-like façade of un-emotionalism, as do some actors who play Holmes.  The technical audio productions is very well done: the other actors are great and the music is mesmerizing.  All in all, this set is a bargain considering the number of CD's and gave me many enjoyable hours of listening.  I would recommend it without reservations.
0446195529|3.0|This is fiction and therefore one can suspend the real facts for the benefit of the story.  People who know Washington DC know that there can be no restuarant at 16th and F Streets -- that's the back side of the White House.  This turns out to be a key clue and leads to one of the \\"aha\\" moments in the plot.  Any other nearby location would have done, but for the author and the editors not to have known the key geography is unfortunate and unforgiveable.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I see that quite a few people had issues with their download after purchasing.<br /><br />I wanted to say that I had a great first experience yesterday with my purchase, and The Clouse worked flawlessly.  My Born This Way digital songs were available immediately and are there to listen to or download to put on my iPod.  I am impressed and will use this service again.<br /><br />The Born This Way CD is EXCELLENT - just as her previous music has been.

B0051QIGP4|1.0|I bought the album at work and installed the Amazon mp3 Downloader.  When I ran it, though, it never downloaded a single megabit and stayed stuck at 0% for about 15 minutes.  I figured it might be some kind of security thing at my work and that I would just fini.... I mean start the download at home that night.  Little did I know that it wouldn't be available when I got home and they wanted me to pay for it again.  Why Amazon can't just use your browser's downloader like every other website on the planet is beyond me.  Instead, they want us to clutter our computer with yet another program that doesn't even seem to work. 0 stars for Amazon on this.  It was only $.99, but it will be worth the inconvenience that it will cause to someone at Amazon so I'm gonna dispute the charges on my Credit Card. F-in ridiculous.  Media people just can't seem to figure out why piracy is so rampant.  Well, free or not, it's easier than going legit.
B003YOZNBU|2.0|The target audience for most Westerns is predominantly male.  The same goes for sci-fi and steampunk.  Supernatural ghost whisperer, however, is a show with Jennifer Love Hewitt.  And until that gets on Showtime and gets a little more risqu&eacute; it's not going to draw in the male audience.  Therein lies the problem with Jonah Hex (and Wild Wild West); one bad apple spoils the bunch.  Add to that a script written by a clearly confused screenwriter and direction from someone who gets lost in a single-stall bathroom.  Only Hollywood could screw up the story of a guy who turned into a Wild West bounty hunter after a life in which his prostitute mother runs away, his father sells him into slavery with an Indian tribe, he fights in the Civil War (South), gets accused of being a traitor, shoots Stonewall Jackson, has his wife murdered the day before the wedding (some would call this a lucky break), and is disgraced in an Indian battle to the death and branded with a searing hot tomahawk to his cheek.  Jimmy Hayward should never be allowed to direct again.<br /><br />Whatever, it's not like they tried to introduce the characters at all.  Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin - decent performance) gets his history changed, and all we know is he has an enemy, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich - going through the motions), who murdered Hex's family after Hex supposedly betrayed his fellow soldiers. Turnbull is the most shallow character Malkovich has ever played.  Inserted purely because a movie needs an antagonist.  Speaking of pointless characters, Michael Fassbender is completely wasted, and they may as well have blind-folded Megan Fox, gagged her, stuffed her into a corset fitted for an anorexic, thrown her into bed, forced her to play the role of a prostitute, and zoomed closely on her pouring assets.  Crossing my fingers for an extended edition.<br /><br />Beyond that, ridiculousness abounds.  Saddle mounted Gatling guns that don't bother the horse (but dragging a fat guy is too much for the trusty steed).  Unnecessary, anachronistic weapons inserted purely for CGI.  Fight scenes that purposely obscure the action and impact.  Dynamite crossbows.  Yeah, because those were necessary.<br /><br />I now have post-traumatic stress because of this choppy, misfiring mess..  Unnecessary, anachronistic weapons inserted purely for CGI.

B00004STPT|5.0|I like pretty much every song on this CD...that's right CD, not mp3 I downloaded from some fancy schmancy iTunes.... OK, I ripped it to my computer as an mp3 so I could play it on my iPod, so sue me!! Still a great album.
030745455X|2.0|Is it just me or do most readers need a modicum of plot?  By page 320, shouldn't the fire be roaring and the pot bubbling over?  In this case, no.  There is no boil.  There is no fire.  No one has bothered to touch a match to the stove.  The book should be renamed, \\"The Girl Who Played With Something:  We'll Find Out Later What It Was.\\"<br /><br />Fascinating characters would also be a nice touch, but that's wishful thinking.<br /><br />Characters (for lack of a better term) are introduced at random, not that anyone will care.  The reader will also discover....news flash....the Swedes are more sexually open than uptight Americans.  However, these are characters you will never want to fantasize about, and will certainly never want to see naked.  I shudder at the thought.<br /><br />In the not too distant future, this book will be assigned reading in the halls of academia.  Picture students scurrying to find Cliff Notes, picture the guys falling asleep in class, as the professor drones on about the author's fine distinction between boredom and apathy, while the girls underline passages and write \\"Very true\\" in the margins.<br /><br />However, this is a page turner, as you mutter to yourself, I will defeat this behemoth.  Your perseverance will be rewarded when you jubilantly slay the beast and fling the hefty carcass across the room, to send it bouncing off a wall.

B003UESJH4|4.0|I loved this film, but for the acting more than for the story.  The story was good, but incomplete in so many ways; also, the flow of the story does not match the events as they occurred. But the acting was oh so good!  I loved both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush.  Their chemistry together fantastic, from the King learning to use the F word, to Lionel sprawled on the throne of Edward I.  None of us really knew the royals, but if George VI was half as entertaining as Colin Firth, he would have been an interesting person to know.  Buy this movie.  You will enjoy it!
B004ZISVWC|4.0|The digital rental was a little steep ($9.99 US) for pre-release. But the it was a good movie. The CGI was much better than I expected, it was often done as through the lens of a hand camera, or at night, but much much better than what you would normally see on a Sci-Fi channel movie.    The movie was sub-titled, which is a minus for me but the story was good. Most of the movie and action is done with a shaky handy cam documentary style (with lots of running involved) If those make you nauseous this movie is not for you.    The story played out like a modern day Brothers Grimm style fairy tale, about a jaded giant-slayer followed by three college journalists looking into a bear poaching story.    The hero spilling bits of wisdom to this biographers regarding troll ecology, physiology, and mythology, after each near death encounter.

0525423273|5.0|Out of all the books I have read in my near-23 years on the planet, I have only cried over three of them.    The first time was when I was 11, and Gavroche's death was too much to bear.    The second time was when I was 19, and Fred Weasley died with the ghost of his last laugh still on his face.    Tonight makes three, and a character I loved didn't even have to die*  It was 2:36 am last Saturday when I finished the book, and I loved it s much that I immediately started scribbling out this review on my sketch pad. I was SUPER stoked to tell you about this book. Once I get my hands on a hardcover (it's currently only on my iPad), I suspect my friends may start to wish I would stop trying to force this book on them. Still, totally worth it. As I was reading I had no idea how it got so late, or where all those crumpled tissues had come from (but to be fair, I also have a cold). But I did know that I had just read what is, in my opinion, the best YA Contemporary romance I had ever read. I don't say that lightly, and I'm not exaggerating at all-- and I don't even generally LIKE contemporary romance, YA or otherwise.    John Green said this book was like if his books had a threesome with Maureen Johnson's and Sarah Dessen's books and then had a baby. I was expecting that to mean it would be a little like all three. No no, my friend. Stephanie Perkins takes all of the best elements of each to the fullest.** For example, in one scene Anna draws a chocolate mustache on herself in order to cheer up St. Clair, and it reads just like an MJ tweet.    But in my opinion, Perkins also excels in her own right when it comes to the execution of the love story. It starts slow and fairly shallow, but the relationship between Anna and St. Clair grows slowly and becomes more about the same elements that make for a really good friendship-- trust, empathy, and support. In the beginning we are bombarded by descriptions of how hot St. Clair is. I was worried we had a Cullen situation on ourhands. But just like Anna, the reader falls in love with St. Clair's personality, and by the middle of the book St. Clair looked goofier and shorter in my mind, his temper and other faults got a smidge frustrating, and he was just an everyday, real-life guy. By the time you hit the chapter that is comprised of emails between Anna and St. Clair, you'll love him too... but you'll still totally call him on his b.s., should it arise.    I also loved how Anna is complex in that John Green kind of way, where she is the protagonist because she is trying to solve the Big Problem she has with her self. Still, Perkins manages to make that core idea completely her own. Unlike Green's novels where the protagonists have generally already identified what they perceive to be their Big Problem, Anna has to work out 1) that she has an internal problem and 2) what that problem could be.      Lastly... Paris. Wow. I hadn't really had a desire to go to Paris prior to reading this (London and Cork are way higher on the list), but now I will have to rethink that. Paris is essentially a character in the book as well, and Perkins incorporates its details in an incredibly fluid manner. This is even more impressive after you've visited her website, where says that the only really significant time she spent in Paris was the month of January, 2010. She rented an apartment and apparently memorized the nuances of the city.   I'm going to have to read this book many, many more times. The trick is going to be getting myself to read it primarily to watch the execution of the storyline at least once without getting swept away by the love story. I don't know if I can do it.      *I suppose that's technically a spoiler, but you can tell from all the indirect Nicholas Sparks jabs in the first 20 pages that this is not going to be the kind of love story where the starcrossed protagonists fall in love and one of them dies a tragic, cancery death.   **But I haven't read Sarah Dessen yet (shame! Shame on me!), so I can't vouch for John's claim fully
0060933275|5.0|In 1957, Harper Lee took her manuscript entitled, Atticus, a story about a southern lawyer who defends an innocent black man accused of rape, to various New York publishers only to be met with rejection after rejection.<br /><br />Three years later after many rewrites, the book retitled, Too Kill a Mockingbird was published to wide acclaim. One of the endearing elements in this work is the marvelous description of a small town in the 1930s during the depression and its people who are viewed through a magnifying glass. Throughout the book, there is a consciousness of how one behaved in a small town back then and the way one behaved was central to who one was.<br /><br />In short, the story is pure truth and the impact of the raw language used as in the case of the \\"N\\" word which was an acceptable way of speaking in those days might give offense to today's readers.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of a child, nicknamed Scout who serves as narrator but as an adult looking back. Scout is a girl and a tomboy who speaks with her fists and is curious about the world around her. Her father named Atticus Finch, whom she addresses by his first name, is a soft spoken very dignified attorney who has earned the respect of the town not only by his reputation but also for being kindhearted when he accepts payment from clients in kind as he understands they cannot afford to pay him in cash.<br /><br />The story's structure centers on the town courthouse where Atticus defends Tom Robinson, a black work hand who has been accused of rape by the daughter of his employer. The story is both dramatic and powerful when one considers the courage is took to write what is was like to be in a black person's skin from the point of view of a white person. And the fact that it was published at the beginning of the civil rights movement. There is an understanding of the nature of the harshness of humankind exemplified through legalized segregation which is an amplification of the south in the 1930s without being judgmental about it. We know the injustice that is being created against Tom Robinson as there is no proof that he committed a crime but only the prejudices of the townsfolk that formulate the opinion that he is guilty and seal his fate.<br /><br />There are many characters is this classic story. One in particular is Boo Radley, Scout's next door neighbor whom she has never seen and through invented tales by her friends and neighbors she comes to view Boo as a menacing phantom capable of murder. It is the spreading of rumors about people and the harm it can cause that is also expressed in the story, which unfolds dramatically and brilliantly with Tom Robinson, Atticus, Scout and Boo interwoven.<br /><br />Charles Blanchard<br />author of Mourning Doves After The Firetal about it.

0451526279|2.0|I can't remember the last book I disliked as much as I dislike Emma. GoodReads informs me that I have been struggling through this book since the middle of October, but in actuality this book has been haunting me for at least ten years. I bought it sometime before I went to boarding school. Though I remember starting it several times, I never made it past page 30. As I vociferously complained about this book as I was reading it this time, both M and my mother asked me why I was reading it if I disliked it so much. I didn't really have a good answer at the time, but now I know. Leaving this book unread for so long was haunting me. I really don't like leaving things undone, and I wanted to challenge myself as a reader. As an apprentice-writer, you are supposed to read as much as you can. If left solely to my own devices, I would mostly read YA, so Classics and Modern, Adult Lit are good for me.  Usually, I like reading about Austen's heroines. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. Northanger Abbey was a fun read. But Emma Woodhouse makes me want to hit people. Okay, mostly I just want to hit her. So what were my issues?  In Northanger Abbey, the heroine is also fairly naive and kind of creates the problems in her life. But you know what? She feels badly about it! And she learns! Emma's excessively high opinion of herself pissed me off beyond belief, and though she feels bad for a minute or two, in another 30 pages she'll be doing exactly whatever it was that got her into trouble last time. In fact, I don't think she focuses too much on starting the rumor about Jane Fairfax being in love with a married man. If she even thinks about it, it wasn't for very long. In fact, she focuses more on making a catty comment to Jane's aunt (whose ridiculously chatty dialog is *painful* to read), and that's primarily just because Knightly chastises her for it.  Which brings me to my other issue: Knightly. Not a super-hot Austen heroine, in my opinion. Call me a crazy modern woman, but patronizing guys just aren't attractive to me. Now, I think he's perfect for Emma, who continues to act exactly like a spoiled child/Mean Girl, but I couldn't get 100% behind a relationship predominately based on him trying to fix her and get her to grow up. Maybe I'm missing something, and I'd love to see your thoughts or defenses of the book in comments. But really I'm just glad I accomplished that. Hopefully my other 10+ year book that is haunting me, The Phantom of the Opera, won't be as painful.    Rating: 2 stars-- At least I will never have to start this book again.
0312323867|4.0|I wasn't disappointed in this sequel!  As a true Rachel fan I wasn't keen on falling in love with Darcy.  It took a while, half the book or more, and some much deserved humiliation but Darcy finally evolves into someone worth rooting for.  This was an excellent follow up story with a few predictable turns and an unpredictable surprise.  I've been recommending the set to all my friends, because to me \\"Something Borrowed\\" and \\"Something Blue\\" are a set to be read together.
0848833031|3.0|Let's start with some Universal Truth time: I love bad movies. I'm not talking Ed Wood, Night of the Lepus, low-production quality bad. No no, I am referring to the pulpy summer flicks. Sahara with Matthew McConaughey is probably the best example of this. I accept that it is generally regarded as terrible, juvenile and implausible.  But there is a point in the movie when you run across this scene:   Al: Well, we're in the desert, looking for the source of a river pollutant, using as our map a cave drawing of a Civil War gunship, which is also in the desert. So I was just wondering when we're gonna have to sit down and re-evaluate our decision-making paradigm?   Dirk:   [coming up on the fortress seen in the cave painting] I don't know - it seems to be working so far.     And it's at that point that the movie is amazing to me. The movie seems to be aware of exactly what it is-- a summer, action, buddy romp. It wasn't pretending to be anything different, remember? So just sit back and enjoy the characters.      So why are we taking this little review detour? Because Darkly Dreaming Dexter is a little like that. This is not groundbreaking literature. This is a beach read. If you accept it for what it is, I think you'll enjoy it a lot. That being said, I think I let Lindsay get away with some slightly lackadaisical character development because of my love for the show. Book-Dexter is a well-defined character, but he's not as nuanced as Michal C. Hall's incarnation... probably because we're always in Book-Dexter's head. And yeah, he's kind of a know-it-all, like other reviewers have said.  Thus far, none of the other characters have been terribly fleshed out, and on the whole the police force appears to be populated by the duller crayons in the box. Again, I think I'm willing to overlook that because I'm filling in the missing bits with the tv show information until proven otherwise.    And yes, there are some big differences between the book and the first season of theshow. I may have to have a talk with M's friend because I have no idea how he reached the conclusion that they were the same. I mean, the tv show followed the book almost verbatim for most of the way, but it veered (really sharply) starting about   of the way through.      Because we are in Dexter's head, the book focuses on a plot aspect that (if I remember correctly) the tv show kind of mentions and then passes over-- what if Dexter is committing these murders in his sleep? The crazy comes out a lot better, along with a more satisfying picture of \\"the Dark Passenger\\" than the show gives.    Another part of the book that I thought was interesting is when Lindsay starts to play with words. The title comes up in the book (p. 238) when Dexter wonders if this new serial killer in town could possibly be a \\"darkly dreaming Dexter,\\" and there's another point where the narration veers into d alliteration for a good few lines. It's playful, but it's also a moment of stress for Dex (oh, if only I had marked it when I came across it... grr...) so it also feels like a way for him to stay sane. Some of these lines also ring with a sort of Poe-ish iambic feel... I need to start marking these interesting bits as I'm reading so I don't quite sound like I'm making things up. Oh well.  I'm learning.     I will definitely read the second book and third books. It sounds like the second book still loosely follows the same plot line as the tv show, but it also sounds like we move past that by book 3. Both prospects sound interesting to me.       Rating: 6- Good, but I had a few issues: accept the pulpiness and you will love it. If you fight the pulpiness, you will hate it.
0440241901|4.0|Didn't change my life but definitely made me laugh out loud!  I loved the writing of this book and the dialog the main character has with herself.  The concept is brilliant, think you're dying so you spill the beans to whoever is listening then, bingo, that someone is your boss.  The main character is predictable as are her actions and reactions but I liked it, I'll tell all my friends to read it, it would make an excellent Ginnifer Goodwin movie...probably wouldn't read it twice.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|Thanks to the daily special I (and maybe a few others) was able to get a good deal on this album on an impulse buy. Would I have bought this album otherwise? I never bought a Lady Gaga album before, and perhaps I shan't buy another, unless it's a sequel daily deal impulse buy. You go, grrll! Keep it up!<br /><br />That's not to say I've never heard LG before. Of course I have. That's why I can say \\"it's varied\\" in my subject line. Some of this material has a rock beat. Another song has a fake sax (or maybe it's a real sax....imagine that!). One track even sounds like Shania.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good album. Worth my time and investment.
0439023521|5.0|When I heard about the Hunger Games and how good they were I put them on my list to read. So one day I just bought the first one and started reading the first few pages. Wasn't that into it and set it down for a couple of months. But, as the popularity waned on, I had to see what all the fuss was about. So I got past those first few chapters and ended up liking it by the time Peeta was drawn to be the male tribute. Because I knew at that point that there was going to be some kind of romance. I think I officially liked it when Katniss and Peeta held hands on the chariot.<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br /><br />The thing about the Hunger Games series is that not only does it start with a dystopian society in which this one government has complete control over everything you do, but also throws some romance in there. When you read the first book you come away with a book full of romance drama that bleeds into the second book. But by the end of the second the events take a turn and by the third readers are reminded of the main theme that has been the central idea the whole time..But I won't spoil it there. The Hunger Games was one of the best fantasy young adult series I've read in a while. And while I like the whole series I have to say that the first book is my favorite.<br /><br />There were a few things that annoyed me sometimes. For instance, Katniss can be a bit annoying in the beginning but a lot of her selfish thinking leads to her growing up later on in the books. Overall Katniss is a strong heroine and I do like her as a character. One thing that got to me was the prep team. They were so annoying to me but necessary to the changes that happen in Mockingjay. Katniss's constant \\"Right now they're looking at us kiss in the arena\\" got kind of old. We get it, they can see you kissing, talking, ect. It just got kind of annoying at times. Other than that it was really good.<br /><br />Favorite character hands down is Peeta. Very strong, very amazing. He's just awesome. Great book, nicely written, couldn't put it down. Please please give this book a try, even if you think you don't like it a few chapters in. Give it at least a try.n't put it down. Please please give this book a try, even if you think you don't like it a few chapters in. Give it at least a try.

It should be shown on TV; shown in every high school, college, and university in America; shown in community centers and meeting halls across the country.

0439023491|5.0|Sometimes sequels don't do too well. Catching Fire, however, was just as engaging as the first book in the series. I couldn't put the book down and became obsessed with Peeta and Katniss's little \\"romance\\". By the end things take a turn, which reminds readers of the main theme behind the series. Catching Fire takes off a bit slow but once it gets going you can't put it down. When I was in the bookstore talking about the series, I told someone I had the first book but not the second yet. They told me then that I will want to go ahead and get the last two books. And they were right, because by the time I was done with the first book I was upset and going \\"No! What happens now!\\" So the very next day I bought Catching Fire and Mockingjay, which I read those two in a week. I don't have anything bad to say about this book because I absolutely loved it. Sure, there were probably some things that bugged me or something but they weren't big enough to make a big deal over. I think overall I just don't have any cons to talk about.<br /><br />Read this book. It's too good of a series to pass up.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I really wasn't feeling the singles and videos, but listening to them album is a different story all together.  BTW is an utterly joyous experience, sort of reminds me of late 80s/early 90s Madonna only more vocally versatile and aggressive.  Sonically BTW has touches of industrial music, a little Joy Division and a continuation of the European techno sound that she is famous for.  The album should be listened to in its entirety in order to be fully appreciated; it is more of an 'album' rather than 'singles' album where only a few songs are good and the rest are so-so at best or do not fit in with the overall theme of the album.  Definitely not a sophomore slump, that's if you do not count The Fame Monster as real album because it was an EP from The Fame.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Well imagine my surprise to find this sweet gift of the entire album download (\\"just .99¢\\" she said) waiting in my Inbox, from my cooler-than-cool Mom! Yeah, I'm old, she's older (obviously!) but she knows that I too my daughter to see her last summer, and God does that woman LOVE A DEAL! Issue- I click on the link to download, and it takes me to the actual page to \\"buy\\" it.  :(  I'm whinning here because no one in CS has a good answer me other than \\"wait. I understand all of the slow download issues, I mean come on! This Lady's gotta lotta little monsters all revved up, and Amazon is practically giving it away.

B004FEFS5E|5.0|I have been taking photographs for over a decade -- 17,000 and change to date according to my Adobe Lightroom counter -- and the way the author describes the triangle of photography - ISO, aperture and shutter speed - with clearly defined note AND IMAGES just made it all click.  This is an amazing book, a necessary read for any photographer.
0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas was an incredible story that kept me in suspense and anticipation to the very end. It combines phenomenal storytelling within very different genres and settings. Each one made me wonder how the author thought up such inventive characters and places. The plot unfolds like a maze and little connections throughout each vignette stitch together into a big, important and deep theme. Fantastic, yet utterly conceivable. Elements of the \\"Handmaids Tale\\", \\"The Road\\" and \\"The Matrix\\". This book became my instant \\"year's best\\". Friends are reading it now and all have the same reaction. They are confused and intrigued through the first couple stories, then utterly hooked. Loved it.
B004U52VPS|4.0|I think the concept of this toy is really fun, and my kids certainly enjoy it although you need to be prepared to search around for scattered pieces if you don't have a restricted area for shooting the birds. I find shooting toward a rug or on a table with a tablecloth keeps them from ricocheting all over the room.<br /> First, the good stuff:<br />PROS: The rules are simple, easy to explain to younger children, and you don't have to know how to read to figure things out,  so that's also great for little ones.<br />The birds, pigs, catapult, and the structure pieces all seem pretty sturdy. Plus my five year old likes to just play with the game pieces as action figures. We only got this game because he wanted some plastic Angry Birds to play with and this was the only thing we found that fit the bill.<br />The game builds coordination and (hopefully) a little patience in the best case scenario. But that leads me to the cons...<br />CONS: This is more a downfall for folks like me who can't stand tedious projects :) but I get a little frustrated trying to build the structures shown on the level cards sometimes. They are supposed to be grouped according to difficulty, but some of the Level 1( ie: allegedly easier) structures are just as difficult as the Level 2 and 3 ones. There are some I think might be impossible to build at all based on the law of gravity, although my husband disagrees and says with enough balance they're all possible.<br />I'm kind of a fumble-prone mom and I spent more time knocking down half-built structures with my clumsy hands than with birds at first. If you have a child who doesn't have much tolerance for slow, meticulous projects then he/she might be annoyed trying to build the structures.<br />As far as the actual shooting the birds part of the game, that takes some getting used to and is actually a lot harder than on the Iphone app. in my opinion. That said, it is doable. My five year old and eight year old are fans of the game and have already played with it a lot. One tip: make sure you keep up with all the pieces because losing even one or two of the logs or blocks will seriously hamper your ability to complete the structures on the cards.ne tip: make sure you keep up with all the pieces because losing even one or two of the logs or blocks will seriously hamper your ability to complete the structures on the cards.
B001AQO400|5.0|It's a character study, and a great one, the kind they used to make in the 70's (like her dad did)... similar to The Last Detail, The Conversation, Five Easy Pieces, etc. Loved the shots of Japan, the acting, the writing, the pacing, the mystery at the end - everything about it. And it has a lot of subtle humor to it. Sophia's awesome.
0316056863|5.0|I loved the book and recommend it to anyone who likes Tina Fey.  I would not recommend this book to people without a sense of humor, or who don't understand sarcasm. They probably gave the book 1 star.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Good album and got it for a dollar. It works great playing straight from my cloud player and downloaded it to put on my ipod. As always no problems at all. And its good to know I can download it any time I need to again from my cloud player.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This is the best deal for this caliber of music ever! Lady Gaga for $1?! WOW. I love the album!
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Amazon cloud is a great NEW product very happy so far.  Very very very happy with the .99 cent deal for this album. Love it! Thanx amazon!
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I have to say it's a disappointing release.  It's just standard dance fare - the songs start running together and sounding the same after the 2nd song.  If it weren't for LG singing each song, I would have guessed it as a dance sampler.  Some of the choruses I've heard her use on other songs.  Many of the recording techniques and sound effects are commonly used by other dance artists today. I've listened to it 3 times now and there's not any one song that really jumps out. I really like LG - think she's a terrifically talented lady who has her act together. But for whatever reason, the innovative and catchy songs that made her last release a multi-platinum seller aren't here with this one.  I have to give both LG and AMZ props for putting this out for .99 cents - helluva marketing scheme and much appreciated.  But in the long run, I'm glad I didn't pay more than that.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|First off, if you are having trouble downloading the album, try re-downloading the ones that didn't download the first time. I had to do it twice but I have all the songs! So don't whine until you try that, it's a simple fix!.    Okay, really enjoying this album, so far I really like Bad Kids and Scheiße as the songs I haven't heard before. Just got done with work so I am listening to it now. Currently on Heavy Metal Lover.    Gaga has such a great voice and a great ear for sounds and beats, so far everything has blended together awesomely! I really enjoy listening to well-made songs instead of songs that try to sell something or pretend to be \\"cool\\".....    I recommend this album! If you get it today, you will only spend .99 cents for the WHOLE album like I did, can't beat that! What other artist has done that? None!

Right, go ahead, support other locations when it is simply download overload...you tried, didn't ya? Be patient, you'll get the sorry album soon enough, but I spent 99 cents just to get a chance at calling the whiners out. Worth more than the album itself as I can't stand this lunatic and her screechy voice. Just wanted to add the 5-star to the cause of bringing album prices down and support a company that's tryng its best to take care of YOU, the customer.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|As I write this, this is Mastadon's latest album and the only one of theirs that I like. Although it sounded like they were trying to break away from death metal with their Blood Mountain album, I found their vocals to be too damn quiet for me to understand a word he was saying. Crack the Skye doesn't have this problem. The vocals are clear, the metal is good, and the new Mastadon is here! I hope they keep this up and stay away from their death metal past :)

B00319ECC4|5.0|If Demanufacture or Obsolete were your favorite Fear Factory albums, you just might have a new favorite. Fear Factory has come back with a vengeance. I think it's safe to say that Mechanize is their heaviest album to date. Don't worry though, it's not the death metal that Fear Factory started off as. And they're still keeping true to the hate of the machine. In fact, I think this album amped up the hate to a whole new level :)
B0051QIGP4|5.0|The entire album... ON release day... in digital format... for $.99?! I have died and gone to heaven.    I had no issues buying, downloading to Cloud Player (even though I'd never used it before) and downloading from there to my iTunes. Listening to it on my iPhone right now... <3
B000GPI2EK|1.0|Maybe I would like this album if I could actually hear what he was saying. When I listened to it online, I thought the vocals were quiet...but I just figured that was due to poor quality. I thought that the album would be a bit more clear on CD. Turns out...NOPE! Still can't hear what he's saying. A shame too, since they broke away from their death metal ways with this one...just wish I could enjoy it.
0307887960|3.0|If you follow the diet in this book you will defiantly lose weight. The problem is following the diet.  I'm not a dietitian but it just doesn't seem like a healthy way of life. When I got this book I thought that the doctor who wrote it was a a specialist in the field of nutrition, he's not. I would save your money and just eat a sensible healthy diet with regular exercise.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|God, I love this album! The Way of All Flesh continues the same music that was found in From Mars to Sirius, and is NOT like that of Link or Terra Incognita. I hope Gojira keeps this trend going. The weird lyrics and understandable vocals are still here. And I don't know if anyone can match the instruments in this or From Mars to Sirius. Who would have thought that perhaps the most original sound in music comes from a French band called Gojira (which is japanese for Godzilla).
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|I was very disaapointed in this movie.  It was very boring and did not deal with the hereafter the way the trailors led you to believe.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|This album is where Korn died...at least to me it is. I thought everything before this was great, and then from here on out Korn just lost it. They got too emo and mainstream with this. Their second self-titled tried to pick it up a little...but was still way too mainstream. And now with Korn III - Remember Who You Are...it's just too little too late. It sounds so bland. I wish Korn would take some advice from their album title and remember who they were.
B004E0Z4XK|4.0|This album sounds like Danger Mouse paired the Eurostar Itallia with the 3:10 to Yuma.  Parts of the album are as cool and dreamy as the idea of sipping espresso on the Eurostar while gazing out the window as it approaches Milan just after sunrise.  Other songs are seductive in a masculine way, like smoking in pool of shade near the station tracks of the Sunset Limited as it resupplies in Tucson, Arizona.  This album should get plenty of play at local coffee shops, and deservedly so, Rome is really good background music and works great as a whole album.  If you're interested in getting any of the tracks, I would recommend getting the whole album because as a whole Rome is better than any single song on the album.     But, I have to wonder if the thematic limitation - spaghetti westerns - caused the producer to stretch thin the creative ideas that went into the album.  The whole album is only 35 minutes long and some of the instrumental tracks at the end seem a little bit like a delirious man lost in the desert, unsuccessfully looking for that oasis of water as he unknowingly walks in circles.    The Tracks     1.  Theme of Rome.  This track is more of an interlude than a song, and it sets the spaghetti western theme for the rest of the album.    2.  The Rose with the Broken Neck is slow and seductive and features a lot of chimes paired with an acoustic guitar.  Singers in the background sing \\"Ooooooh\\" while Jack White slithers around like a snake at the bottom of the song.     3.  Morning Fog is another interlude with chimes, like the sound a toy wind up ballerina makes.      4.  It sets up the next song, Seasons Trees.  Seasons Trees is the Eurostar coming down the tracks, as might be seen from a distant hill, so even though the train is moving fast, it doesn't appear to be speeding.  Norah Jones breezes you through this song.    5.  Her Hollow Ways is another interlude with chimes, string interments and the background Ooooooh singers.      6.  Roman Blue is an instrumental song with the Ooooooh and Aaaaaah singers at the end.  This song seems to derail the album a little bit.  Although at first it sounds at first like it's going to place you in an OK Corral gun fight, it is not set in the wild west after the first 35 seconds, nor is it anywhere on the Eurostar track.  It kind of feels like maybe riding in a Roman taxi you know you don't have to pay for, so you're not worried the meter is running.  The main problem with the album is that there are more instrumental songs like this one that lack clear direction.  (That's why I almost gave it three stars instead of four).    7.  Back in the wild, wild west again, Two Against One is led by Jack White's serpentine voice over  guitar.  The instruments follow Jack White as he seems to fight himself and you, \\"... there's only three.  It's just you and me against me.\\"  This song sounds a little bit like a White Stripes song, which should make people from 2002 really happy.    8.  The Gambling Priest is an instrumental song with chimes and the aaaaah, aaaaaah, oooooh, ooooooh singers over a base and drums.  It sets up The World, which is another interlude with chimes and the aaaaaah singers.    9.  Back on track, the song Black picks up where Seasons Trees left off.  The song is crisp and cool.  Nora Jones is airy and sounds really good on this track.  Black could easily be a radio single for this album.    10, 11, 12 and 14.  The Matador Has Fallen and Morning Fog are instrumental songs in the Roman Blue mold.  Morning Fog and Her Hollow Ways are also instrumental.    13.  Problem Queen starts with a galloping horse guitar and Nora Jones pipes in to break up the pace nicely.  The galloping horse guitar returns and in the second verse she jumps on the horse and rides with it, like a cowboy into the sunset.  This is strong finish to Norah Jones contribution to the album.    15.  The last song is The World, featuring Jack White.  This is sort of an epic grand finale that signs off the album.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|I bought this on Monday after receiving an email from Amazon that is was .99 for the entire album. What a great deal! I just am curious because both the audio and booklet are censored where there (I think) should be expletives. I'm not cool with Amazon posting a download of an album without informing us that it's the censored version. I want the original. Amazon, if you post that this is an explicit version, then please do all of us the favor and post that it is also a censored version so we know we are buying the right thing.    Anyone else feel the same?
B004K4AUZW|4.0|Bloody Mary and Heavy Mental Lover are WICKED songs - my absolute favorites from this album. But that Americano song needs to go. Overall, great album!!

B0051QJ83S|5.0|I love every single song on this album. Born This Way is very techno but she also plays with a little country on \\"You & I\\" and the results are fabulous! $0.99 for all 14 tracks is a freaking awesome deal!
B004TTMYQG|4.0|only 4stars because widgets are not scrollable. make it do that then 5 stars. I love though that widget is very customizable
0345522478|4.0|This was very different from books I normally read. I picked it up in a bookstore when I was there to pick up another book I had ordered. I found this interesting, fun, and definitely worth reading. I will be picking up the rest of the books in the series. I can't wait to see if Granuaile decides to become Atticus' apprentice after all! I very much enjoyed this book and it was a refreshing break from other books I read. Well done!
B0051QIGP4|4.0|People shouldn't use this to complain that the downloads were slow. Obviously they were going to be slow, thousands of people were on at the same time trying to get it. Everyone should have their Downloads now, mine downloaded right away last night with no problem. Amazon is great, they always have deals on MP3's and CD's!    As for the album, I was originally only going to download \\"You and I\\" because dance music isn't really my thing, but I couldn't pass up the great deal of 99 cents for the first day only for the whole album. Even though I'm not a big dance music fan, I like Lady GaGa's personality and respect how she writes her own music, actually sings live, and can even play the piano well. The songs are catchy and fun, and it's not all about dance beats, there is a lot on this album. Some good guitar work, especially on \\"You and I\\" by Brian May from Queen. Lady Gaga should do an album like Elton John, some great piano/rock songs! I like this album, Fans will definitely love it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie and the performances by Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter are outstanding!  The story and how \\"Bertie\\" was able to overcome his stammer and speak publicly is inspirational and since it is true even more so.  This is one of the few movies I have recommended to friends and family and one we saw in the theater more than once and will now be able to screen it at home for friends who sadly missed it!
B003FB0268|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my father but years went by before I actually read it. Once I started reading it I couldn't get enough. It changed my outlook on life forever. Highly recommend this book to anyone.
B0034G4ORM|2.0|Battle Los Angeles can best be described as Independence Day, but without the common sense to realize just how absurd it is. The plot is typical summer-fare, though with perhaps a few more truck sized plot holes than the average summer movie. It plays every scene with total seriousness, never stopping to consider just how silly the premise is. And the writing just is not of the caliber to sustain that sort of intense drama. Too often I, and others in the theater, snickered at scenes that were supposed to be moving. By the time we got to the inevitable big, rousing speech, people were yelling at the screen \\"oh come on.\\" The movie tries to pull at every heart string, and in so doing over-reaches. It tries to crank everything up to 11 - the special effects, the action, the patriotism, and the drama - without every realizing that the constant barrage of maximum level stimulus results in numbing the audience, or that it is the quiet moments that give the intense moments their power.    A good movie exists in here somewhere, but it would have required a director and writing team far more comfortable with subtleties and nuance to bring it out. The cast is remarkable and do their best to deliver a good film, but they just weren't enough to polish this turd.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|Like many other Little Monsters, I downloaded this today with much glee and anticipation. However, that glee ceased when I got to the song \\"Government Hooker\\" and realized that this content is censored. Nowhere in the product description is this noted. Had I known this, I would have paid full price for it on iTunes. If you believe in free speech and freedom of expression DO NOT buy this CENSORED version, and let Amazon know your feelings.
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|As a woman who has been struggling with a continuous battle with an eating disorder for years, I am not a huge fan of reading other's struggles because it tends to trigger. And who wants to read about a person's struggle with an ED when your own eating disorder is already what you constantly think about? Well despite my slight hesitation to read this book, it was amazing. It is the kind of book (for me atleast) that I can only read so much in one sitting, because it is very heavy and really hits home. However I couldn't help but think about the book whenever I wasn't reading. Portia's story is so strong, and part of the appeal of this book is that we really see Portia's true character as she details her internal struggles. I find myself thinking about her a lot when I'm having extremely difficult times with my ED. She is so relatable, and she is so real. I cannot thank her enough for this book. PLEASE READ THIS! It will change your life. It really makes me feel like there's hope.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I saw this movie on an airplane and have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.  Too many people let their opinion of a movie be colored by their opinion of an actor/actress.  A lot of people, for whatever reason, genuinely dislike Ms. Jolie (despite having never met her) and decide to pan everything she does.  So much so that I had actually expected to dislike this movie based on all the negative chatter from haters.  However, it is really a good, solid, smooth movie.  A little predictable?  Maybe, but most movies are.  Is there anyone here who didn't know Luke Skywalker would win and Darth Vader would lose?  I didn't think so.  If you watch this movie with an open mind, I think you will like it.  If go into it focused on how much you dislike Ms. Jolie (or Mr. Depp), why bother?  As for the people who say Ms. Jolie \\"can't act\\" they are just plain wrong.  YOU may get distracted by how she looks and think that all she does is look good, but the woman is an exceptionally subtle actress.  Mr. Depp also gave a solid performance.  This is a sly, understated movie and I think a lot of people just missed it.
006019250X|5.0|This by far is my favorite story.  Simple timeless truths, beautifully written.  The pangea of books for dreamers of all ages.  No wonder people throughout the entire world love this magical masterpiece.    The words seem to leap into the heart forever, just like great music that one remembers forever.  Inspiring over and over again - And you'll want to read it over and over again!    I see how my own adventures in life affirm and parallel with the story.  I am now collecting editions of The Alchemist for my library.  Thankyou Paulo Coelho!!
B0051QIGP4|3.0|So this is inevitably a great price for the whole album. Just one note to the promotion of free 20GB storage on the cloud drive: apparently it is only a trial offer and it will only last one year. I am a bit disappointed because I have purchased this album partly because of this offer.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|First off, The cover is a picture of him Shirtless. A view Clary would definitely enjoy. buy this book. its amazing.
B004WMKXWM|3.0|Another Harry Potter movie where a very limited amount of stuff happens. Good lord, is this supposed to be a MINI SERIES you watch as you grow old and die?    Beautiful film visually, as always, but I really think the plot of these things DRAAAAAAAGS. Sorry, but that's my two cents. You can leave it in the leave a penny take a penny jar if you like.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I have all the Harry Potter films and this is by far the least understanable of his movies. The plot was hard to follow and it didn't \\"connect all the dots\\".  I hope all the questions that it left me asking will be answered in Part Two. I like to see a movie with a plot I can understand  from beginning to end with no added emblishments (computer added backgrounds), like this one. This is more of a movie for the younger, computer graphics fan.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is a powerful historical fiction novel, set in Nazi Germany.  Although the story takes place in the historical era of the Second World War and the Holocaust, it is not merely a factual retelling of history. It is geared toward young adults, as it explores the thoughts and emotions of a young German girl who, in this setting, progresses through adolescence and experiences many pivotal changes in her life.                                                                                                            While the story focuses mainly on the girl, Liesel Meminger, the narrator is actually Death.  He tells how he took Liesel's brother, Werner, when his mother was bringing him and Liesel to live in Molching with foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann.  Liesel is continuously haunted by his memory and begins stealing books, perhaps attempting to compensate for loss.  In her new home, she learns to read with the help of Hans, her beloved stepfather, and Max Vandenburg, a Jew in hiding.  She learns the power of words and ultimately uses them to create her own story- one populated with unforgettable characters like Ilsa Hermann, the woman who inspires this, and Rudy Steiner, her neighbor and best friend.    Markus Zusak employs a desperately hopeful tone throughout the novel.  The plot is built around characters in dismal situations.  While these characters find themselves in temporary despair, courage usually saves them in the end.  Frau Holtzapfel is one such character.  She experienced a tremendous amount of despair since one of her sons was killed at Stalingrad, and the other committed suicide shortly after he returned.  At first, she was tempted to take her own life, but Liesel's words gave her the strength to carry on.  The mood the reader experiences is definitely dark, but with a beautiful glimmer of hope.    Zusak strives to bring out the beauty and brutality of humans in Nazi Germany, something by which I was intrigued as a reader.  People have a tendency to vilify the Germans, presuming that they were all Nazis and violent persecutors of Jews.  The Book Thief contradicts such beliefs by presenting characters like Hans, who are opposed to Hitler's ideas and feel compassion for the persecuted.  Zusak does an excellent job, not only with historical accuracy, but also poignant portrayal of human feelings in a time of war and Death.  My only criticism is the lack of clarity regarding whether Liesel's mother survived.  I would have liked confirmation on this matter.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|In case you didn't know, Lady Gaga wrote or co-wrote as long as co-produced EACH song on this album. I feel many of the 1 star reviews are from bitter Britney Spears fans who are afraid she might break her record for the most albums sold in a week by a female artist. Well, so what? Britney had her moment and now let Gaga have hers! I think the only song on this album I don't like is Americano and that is only after one listen.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|This is such a great CD. It is truy addicting. Hair is by far my favorite song - truly inspiring! I have not stopped listening to it since I got it on 5+23+11 at 4AM!! Gaga keep up the great work.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I'm not a HUGE Gaga fan, but figured this was a great price for her album.  Took a bit to download, but c'mon, for the price, it's worth retrying.  Got half through the first time, then the immediate retry got the other half.  Still a deal.  People needn't be impatient at this price.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This artist can do no wrong. Each song is great and she pushes the bounds of current pop music. She said this album would revolutionize pop music and she was dead on. Other artists will strive to emulate but none will compare.
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|Foster the People burst on to the alternative music scene when their first single, Pumped Up Kicks, began receiving heavy airplay in the latter months of 2010.  The track details an eerie account of a latchkey kid, whose distorted reality leads him to wield a weapon and deliver the ominous warning, \\"better run, better run, faster than my bullet.\\"  The song's upbeat and cavalier style, which bears a striking contrast to the sinister lyrical content, piqued the interest of listeners and earned Foster the People instant notoriety.  However, their EP album was simply a tease, and it left their newfound devotees clamouring for more.  The release of their first full length album, Torches, is the antidote to the feverish pleadings of their trip hop-craved following.<br /><br />The group's global sound alludes to something like a fusion of MGMT and Passion Pit's signature electronica stylings, with a hint of Two Door Cinema Club thrown in the mix.  The heavy hooks and infectious rhythms are practically begging to be absorbed with the car windows rolled down and the volume jacked up, whilst head bobbing and steering wheel tapping ensue.  A combination of reverb-heavy synths and sleek instrumentation, in addition to the laconic delivery of alluring, intentionally repetitive lyrics, create dance-worthy tracks that are both accessible and instantly endearing.<br /><br />Despite the fact that it is a debut album, Torches is certain to leave Foster the People deeply entrenched in the alternative landscape.  Not all of the songs contain the magical elements that garnered the attention of  \\"Pumped up Kicks,\\" but they do coalesce to form a uniquely satisfying auditory experience.  Furthermore, although there is a notable lack of diversity amongst tracks, they have established a formula that doesn't eagerly invite tampering.  This is certainly a group worth following, as their raw potential is largely uncharted in an industry that seems preoccupied with providing easily digestible, ubiquitous pop to the masses.masses.
B004OKFIQI|5.0|After years knowing that Steve Hoffman had remastered this history making LP it has finally arrived.  There are NO disappointments, either.  180 gram virgin vinyl pressed at Pallas -- these two records are dead quite.  The bass is punchy.  The mids are warm and lush.  The cymbals sparkle.  Then, there are the vocals -- you have never heard RUMOURS before you have listened to this version.  Two 45 rpm discs -- high resolution.  Warner Bros. originally limited production to just 4,000 copies world wide.  Production has been extended (quantity unknown as of this review) after early release copies sold on Ebay for $125.00+.  If you have a turntable -- BUY THIS NOW.  Truly and AUDIOPHILE reference LP.
B004TACMZ8|5.0|Having seen my house being built, I knew exactly where certain studs/pipes/wires were, and this device found them all correctly with no false readings in other places.  The device is intuitive to use, so I can't comment on the instructions as I didn't read them.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This album is so high energy and upbeat! I also love the different creative ways she sings the lyrics.  I think its the best album I have heard this year so far and I have heard a lot of albums this year! and for only 99 cents the first day for the MP3 album what a bargin!! Go Lady GAGA go! LOVE it!
0307454541|4.0|As \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" opens, cutting-edge journalist, Mikael Blomkvist has just taken a massive professional hit, losing a court case, facing jail time and a fine; and possibly watching his beloved Millennium magazine go under.  When he receives an offer to investigate a thirty-year-old murder, he reluctantly agrees, thinking that the money and time out of the limelight might help him recoup his losses - plus, Henrik Vanger, his benefactor, promises him assistance in bringing down the same corrupt financier who landed him in this mess in the first place.<br /><br />Meanwhile, off-the-grid, anti-social computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander, who ran Blomkvist's background check, is running some investigations of her own.  Eventually, the two of them, Blomkvist and Salander will cross paths and agree to join forces, becoming one of the more unusual crime-fighting teams out there.  As their research deepens, the information that they turn up becomes increasingly horrific, and it soon becomes apparent that this thirty-year-old murder or disappearance is far from irrelevant - and someone will stop at nothing to keep them from finding out what really happened.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, it's not the best-written book ever, with occasional cliches thrown in.  The atmosphere is fascinating and evocative.  The characterization is fairly strong(although I didn't really understand why all of the women were so immediately enamored of Blomkvist).  Salander in particular is a wonderful depiction of an antisocial, gifted person who, if she can't find acceptance, wants nothing more than to be left alone.  The pacing and plotting of the book was its strongest point - I had a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />A great vacation read.  I'm looking forward to the next two in the trilogy.
B004K7HMJ6|1.0|This was terrible... she looks like a metal, rocker, or goth.... and her music is exact opposite.. does she want fans or not? she is obviously a wannabe and her music is terrible.. who does she think she is? she thinks she's so tough and then goes out and sings terrible music... she shouldn't even be allowed to wear black... she makes pop fans scared of her appearance.. and rock fans dissapointed with what they thought she was..because that's not what she is.... -40000 stars
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Yes, \\"Born This Way\\" is a blockbuster! Gaga does not disappoint as she shines through with yet another well-deserved stride to her place into superstardom. Her body of work on this CD exemplifies her God-given talents as a true maestro of music.    Love her or hate her, Gaga proves that she is one intelligently strong woman who can be rebelliously powerful with her genius lyrics and cleverly arranged music. Gaga steps beyond the boundaries of tradition and breaks the rules once again. Gaga was Born This Way to entertain the masses ... and she does it with excellence.    Bravo!
B002RKSZKI|5.0|If you have not read Emma since you were in high school or college, read it again!! A wonderful story which held my attention from beginning to end. I read it on my kindle and could not put it down. The recent movie follows it very faithfully.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Great app.  I use it on a Xoom and it works almost fine.  Quite often the player will only play the first few seconds of a song and then jump to the next song in the list.  After that, it plays fine.    It could use some better sorting, searching, and filtering (would love to filter by year released)... and a way to change the song metadata, but I'm not gonna complain too much as it's new, and I'm sure there are updates coming.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Takes a little time to get it fit in right, but it works as advertised. Just make sure you place the mouse back on the charger every time or you will have a dead mouse in no time.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I haven't been able to listen to the whole album yet but I thought Amazon was genius with this deal.  I have been loyal to iTunes for years now but when I read an article about how Amazon was selling Gaga's new albums for $0.99 I was curious.  I was not going to buy the whole album from iTunes because I very rarely like Gaga's full albums but I couldn't not take advantage of this deal.<br /><br />Yes the download is slow but that is because so many people are taking advantage of this deal.  I didn't download it to Amazon's Cloud Player, just to my computer.  I had to hit \\"Retry\\" about four times but after that it worked fine.  I will be taking advantage of Amazon's MP3 store more often now!
0316286850|5.0|This book was in perfect condition.  I am very satisfied with it.  However, the time it took to get here was longer than expected but overall satified with my purchase.
B0051QJ83S|2.0|after spending 4 hours trying to get my amazon downloader to actually start the download; I got it to download all but one song, some how by dumping this album on America they think that it will make it popular. I love lady gaga, I do. I just think that she has gone too far, this album pretty much sucks.  She needs to stick to love game, poker face, alejandro, just dance, and bad romance.  There isn't anything appealing about a 24 year old that has some good values, but then deems herself the Oprah of the youth. I dont want her to pick the president of the US, tell me what to buy, where to buy it, what to eat, or how to think about God. Sorry Gaga, I am over it.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|For one dollar getting the new pop \\"album\\" is a fun buy.  I don't get what all the bad reviews are for towards Amazon.  If its just a dollar wait for it.  God these kids don't remember the days of kazaa or napster where you waited all day for albums.      I got mine when I got off of work and it took about 5 minutes total.  Five minutes, and a dollar for something that really not that good, and I didn't need to deal with annoying Best buy staff.  I buy lots from amazons digital download service and it works great all the time.  Yesterday was a hiccup, but even then it worked fine.      Think people (kids) millions of people were hitting this site for this one deal.  No site can handle that stress. But hey, the album is OK...  She just seems pretty aimless with this and is having fun experimenting with things.  Which is cool for a dollar.  But I wont be buying the special edition CD anytime soon.   Maybe I'll warm up tot it some more after a few plays.    Thanks Amazon, Awesome deal!
B000002PB2|4.0|A good solid album.  Wish I'd seen the concert back in the eighties but they moved the night to one where I couldn't get off work.  Should have found another job....
6302753295|5.0|I saw this movie on TV in the mid-sixties, when it was a two-night movie spectacular.  I loved it then, and I still get a kick out of it today.  Sure, it's a farce, it's sexist, and it's not politically correct, but it's also a lot of fun.  Wayne pretty much plays himself in this comedy, co-starring the fiesty and lovely Maureen O'Hara.  This was the fourth pairing of the two stars, (previously they appeared together in Rio Grande, The Quiet Man, The Wings of Eagles), and their on-screen chemistry is real and intense.  The two carry this movie on their collective shoulders without slouching.  Their on-going relationship battle is the framework from which this movie moves forward, and is akin to the chess game that Wayne plays early on in the film: one makes a move, and the other reacts (usually in a very funny way). It is not meant to be a serious film whatsoever; it was made for fun, a chance to pair Wayne with Maureen again, and with Wayne being film money magnet, a chance for the production company to turn a nifty profit.<br /><br />It has been written that at some point in John Wayne's career, he started to become the characters he played on the big screen - life imitating art.  Perhaps this film begins the transformation process.  Through the character of McClintok, Wayne dispenses his views on what it means to be a man, what a man-woman relationship should be, the role of government in life, his view of politicians, freedom, self-expression, and even race relations.  O'Hara, every bit Wayne's equal in this film, shows her natural fiestiness, and what every woman wants in her man - someone who will pursue her with passion, manliness, and romance.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a pretty good one, with Yvonne D'Carlo, Patrick Wayne, Steffanie Powers, Chill Wills, Jerry Van Dyke (Dick's brother), and Edgar Buchanan (Uncle Joe of Petticoat Junction fame).<br /><br />The film is noted for its unforgetable and oh so fun mud fight, and the grande finale, when Wayne chases down O'Hara on main street at high noon, in order to give her a public spanking, and winning her back to his side in the process.  During the film, O'Hara's character, Katie, says she wants a cultured, sensitive man, yet, what she really wants is Wayne to show her in a demonstrative way that he loves her, is devoted to her, and will still romance her.  Fittingly, the showdown on main street, has Wayne doing just that, although in his unique manly way.<br /><br />There's nothing profound here, no dramatic acting or academy awards, just a fun film with two stars that shine like bright headlights.<br /><br />koneon main street at high noon, in order to give her a public spanking, and winning her back to his side in the process.

B00009P1O2|5.0|I have just about everything Queen has made with Freddie Mercury...they are my absolute favorite band, and have been since I first heard them in 1977 when I was 5.  I certainly do love all their concert DVD's.  However, if you only see one in your life, this is the one to see!  I originally bought this years ago from South America when it was not available in the states.  That DVD did not include all of the songs.  Happily this Wembley concert does contain everything!  Such a great DVD...what an unfortunate loss of one of the greatest singers that ever lived!  Get this DVD to remember him at his best!  Be sure to get the one you see here pictured on Amazon to be sure you are getting the very best, full edition of the DVD.  It is highly recommended!!
B003UESJH4|5.0|Despite my personal distaste for The Anglican Church and It's History founded in Anti-Catholic Bigotry, I was touched by this Film and The King and his impediment and how he overcame it.I thought being that it was British Funded (just as PBS is slanted and Boring most of the time)I was wrong this time,I found the movie at times besides sad and \\"Heartfelt\\",funny as well. Although I don't think Winston Churchill was so,and Neville was mentioned briefly(the Appeaser).
1936719010|2.0|This is the follow up work to Pressfield's championed book on creativity, [[ASIN:0446691437 The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles]]. The purpose for Do The Work is to be a more practical guide to creativity, but it just doesn't work. The best parts of Do The Work are simply rehashed bits from The War of Art. There is value in Do The Work; much value in fact. But, The War of Art is the better book and has 95% of Do the Work's best information in it already, plus much more. Do yourself a favor and pick up The War of Art instead.<br /><br />For a book on the practical aspects of creativity [[ASIN:1580087736 Thinkertoys: A Handbook of Creative-Thinking Techniques (2nd Edition)]] is still far and away the best out there.
B004QIG7CW|3.0|People who have posted reviews here so far are reviewing the movie.  Yes, the movie was a lot of fun.  The tunes were catchy.  My son, wife, and I enjoyed it.  That's why I pre-ordered this from Amazon.  I was lucky and it arrived yesterday (the day before release) and we put it in immediately to check it out.    With all of the recent things the Disney Channel has done with this movie, we were excited to see the extras.  We especially enjoyed when they did the \\"what's what\\" edition where they had popups of jokes and info throughout the movie.  There were tiny videos of cast activities as well and this would lead us to believe that there was quite a bit of extra material to put in the dvd...we were wrong.    The video quality is, of course, fantastic.  I expected this from a dvd over watching it on cable.  Also, the extra \\"High Wire\\" scene is fun and you could see where it would be a nice epilogue to the move.  There was also a karaoke feature that allowed you to have nice big subtitles that only showed up during the songs.  These are some nice bonus features.  The problem is...that's all there was.    All the behind the scenes stuff, the popups, the interviews.  All the stuff they show on the disney channel...not there.  This is what caused me to bump it down to a 3 star review.  The dvd just felt effortless.  We love the movie...but we were disappointed in the dvd release.  Especially with the way disney's been hyping this for the past couple of weeks, I just expected more.  If you like to buy dvd's for the extras, keep your expectations low.
B000UR9QGW|4.0|JUST FINISHED WATCHING EVIL DEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME ON BLU-RAY...AWESOME!!! THE PICTURE IS SO CRISP AND ALL OF THE COLORS ARE SO VIVID. THE BLOOD IS EVEN MORE GORY LOOKING ON THIS VERSION THAN IN THE PAST SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU SEE MORE OF IT! THE ONLY BAD PART IS THAT IT'S SO CLEAR THAT YOU SEE SOME OF THE FLAWS IN THE MOVIE SPECIAL EFFECTS. DON'T GET ME WRONG, I'M NOT PUTTING IT DOWN BUT IT JUST SHOWS HOW PRIMITIVE MAKE-UP STILL WAS @ THE TIME OF FILMING THIS MOVIE.I'M SOOO GLAD THEY PUT THIS ON BLU-RAY IT LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER,IJUST WISH THEY WOULD HAVE PUT MORE EFFORT INTO EXTRAS. ALL WE REALLY GET IS 2 BEHIND THE SCENES FEATURETTES THAT ARE ABOUT 20 MINS EACH AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS WORTH WATCHING THE OTHER IS A SPECIAL EFFECTS GUYS' PHOTO ALBUM WITH HIS THOUGHTS ON THE PICS....SNOOZE!!! ANYWAY GREAT MOVIE,IF YOU HAVE TO BUY IT @ RETIAL PRICE BUY IT HERE BEST BUY WILL CHARGE YOU $18.99!! USED ON AMAZON (THE WAY I GOT MINE) IS EVEN CHEAPER!!! THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEW. L8R!!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|An aggressive dance album full of electronica beats and numerous potential singles is what she gives her fans. This highly anticipated album delivers to the masses the key to Lady Gaga's success, cutting edge production and well crafted songs with memorable hooks. The subject matter much darker and than on her previous CD, exploring politics and religion but that is what artist do with their art, they evolve, grow and create a dialogue for discussion. I am so very relieved she did try to capitalize on her Fame success and release a part 2 like so many other artist would have done. Did we expect anything less from her?
B0000073NC|5.0|If you are looking for the sounds of the Scorpions from the eighties, you need not look here.  Their sound was different in the 70's.  This is a much heavier album.  This is the Scorpions 2nd album effort and a great album it is.  If you are a Scorpions fan, be sure to check out their other albums from the 70's as well which are all great!  My only negative on this album would be that it is short, but still well worth every cent.  Enjoy!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is outstanding.  Jillian gets straight to the point with working out.  It proves that you don't need to workout for hours a day to get results.  Love it.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Well im not a big Lady Gaga fan but i do like some of her songs my mom like her so when i got the email stating i can get the whole album for .99 cent you cant beat that. Even tho i had problems with downloading at first do to the high demand didnt sweat it took a while but i finally got finish downloading the album. For some reason instead of paying the .99 cent i only paid .37 cent for the whole album i guess some other promotion cant beat that Huh. My mom loves it her favorite song is Born This Way.
0920668364|5.0|my mom used to read this book to me when i was little and every time i re-read it i smile and tear up because i remember how my mom meant every word. it's a beautiful story about unconditional, timeless love. how wonderful that 2o years later i remember this book and how much it meant to my mother and i? i cant wait to read it to kids of my own someday soon :)
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Thank you so much for the bargain price on this great album! I had to retry about half the songs, but they downloaded after only a few tries. I am listening to it right now with no problems.
0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss was just as spectacular as everyone says it is! What a way to start off 2011. I stayed up pretty much all night one night reading this book because i simply couldn't put it down!!! Etienne St. Clair made my heart melt and i honestly can say i think i've experienced my first literary crush!<br /><br />Anna is sent off to a boarding school in Paris, and while she is hesistant and not wanting to leave her school back home, her best friend Bridge, and her new boy toy Toph, her parents insist that she needs to go abroad. She immedietly is thrown into a new culture and you follow her journeys and struggles through a different culture. Her life back home moves fast ahead without her, and her friends back home change just as quickly as she is changing abroad.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this book, it could have been predictable and subpar with the storyline, but Stephanie Perkins takes you right along side Anna and her Journey and leaves you at the edge of seat watching her love and life in Paris unfold.
B004N7WJF0|5.0|Just a wonderful DVD full of great Scorpions songs.  Love the small setting acoustic set.  If you love the Scorpions, then you will love this DVD!  Great picture and sound quality as well!
0800184327|5.0|This is the best movie I ever saw.  I watch it 4 to 8 times a day.   I love the music and Chayanne is the bomb.  He's beautiful.  I cry every time I see it .  I know what coming and I still cry.  Why wasn't he in my live a couple years back.  I can't get enough of him.  I look for wallpaper , screensavers, I want to put him in my picture frames If I could I'd put him in my pocket so he could go with me everywhere.  I love him.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I totally agree with the angered Kindle owners.  The ebook price is the same price as the paperback on the Random House website.  Amazon can lower the paperbook price, but not the ebook price, so it's on the publisher to lower the costs.  I thought not having to print, use paper, ship a product, and take up space on a store shelf would mean cheaper prices for ebooks.  Too bad greed once again trumps rational thinking!    Here is the contact page URL for Random House, Inc.  Let them know how you feel.  I just did.    [...]
B0014NDXGA|5.0|A great device.  It's accurate (repeatable to the yard, time after time). It's very easy to use.  It measures distance to objects and land features like creek banks, bunker edges, trees, even a player standing on the green when the flag is pulled.  I really love it.
B0043RT8JU|4.0|first of all let me say that i absolutly loved John Green's writing style, this being my first novel i've read by him and I was blown away. The story itself was even interesting but for me i got annoyed with the story towards the middle to the end. The search for Margo dragged on to a point where I was like come on already and freakin' find her. Also i almost didn't find Margo deserving of being found, she was self-consumed and spacey for her age, and i found her character to not very likeable, but thats my own opinion. I still think it was a good story, but just dragged on a bit for me.<br />  flag
B0041T52S6|5.0|I didn't think many good summer movies came out last year with the exception of a few (specifically, Inception, but that's another story.) Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was an epic conclusion to my summer.<br /><br />Scott Pilgrim is a 23 year old bass playing high schooler dating lazy kind of guy. He lives in an apartment with his gay roommate, Wallace Wells (who is awesome.) Scott dates a 17 year old high schooler (as stated previously) named Knives Chau. Scott then meets Ramona Flowers, otherwise known as his dream girl.<br /><br />The movie is filled with awesome action scenes with Scott vs. the Seven Evil Exes to fight for Ramona's love. Each fight sequence is unique, epic, and very colorful. I love that random blue line that flashes across the screen, mainly in the second evil ex fight.<br /><br />The music is also independent rock, written by Beck (most of it.) It really goes along with the movie, seeing as Scott is in the indie band, The Sex Bob-ombs with his two friends.<br /><br />The movie is based off a graphic novel series by Canadian Brian Lee O'Malley, and Edgar Wright does a wonderful job of adapting such a great series. I suggest both the books and movies to anyone that likes the following: graphic novels, video games, indie rock, an awesome stuff.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the video game No More Heroes, you will most likely love Scott Pilgrim, seeing as the two are very similar.<br /><br />I give the film (and books) 10/10.
1596592834|5.0|Very interesting book with good information that can be used right away. It also helps one to understand how to work with ADHD, anxiety, hormonal changes, etc. We knew exercise was important and now we understand more of the \\"why\\". Now just doing as much exercise as he suggests living the overloaded lives we live today???? As with all recent books on neurobiology we really begin to understand how challenging it is to live in the world we have created with a brain that evolved to survive during our hunter-gather stages......
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|My husband bought this for me. I loved watching it as a kid and now I've got my own copy. I'm excited to hopefully share this with our children in the future.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Bought the album before 9 a.m., now it's 6 p.m. and I still have only four songs downloaded. Sigh ...
B0051QK87S|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I had to try to balance out all of the people who gave album one star because of server problems. If there was a place to review amazon, then I would suggest that you do that. However, giving the album a poor rating because it would not download is very misleading.     I am a recent convert to a Lady Gaga fan. The genre is not my favorite and I had several misconceptions about her as a performer and her character. However, after being persuaded to take my young teen to her concert, I was blown away! Of  all the concerts I have attended, she was one of the best performers I have ever seen or heard.  She also impressed me with her message about being yourself and being strong.     Yes, I too was lucky enough to purchase this album for $.99.  The entire digital album downloaded for me without incident and at lightning fast speeds.  Honestly, there are a 3 or 4 songs that will need to grow on me, but other than those few songs, I am blown away at the number of excellent songs on here!  I generally have a short attention span with music, only listening to about 20-30 seconds of a song and only listening to 2 or 3 songs per album. This is one that I will be glad to put on and listen until the end. I may even have to put \\"Born this Way\\" on the repeat loop!     Anyway, I hope you are able to grab this baby up for $.99.  If you don't, the album is still absolutely worth paying full price. There is not another full length album in this genre filled with as many great songs.
0399230033|5.0|I love this book.<br /><br />I LOVE this book.<br /><br />I LOVE THIS BOOK!<br /><br />Sadly for the poor reptile, this wonderful book has bumped Yertle the Turtle out of the top spot on my list of favorite children's books. I love this book so much that even if my son hated it, I'd probably still make him sit through it every night.<br /><br />Clearly, what sets this book apart from the pack are the oh-so-charming illustrations of the worlds most adorable gorilla and his mousely sidekick. The gorilla's facial expressions had me rolling the first time I read it and still make me chuckle nightly.<br /><br />My son love it, because the story is always different. I have a special place in my heart for stories with little or no text-- it is so much fun to get to tell the story from your own point of view, adding details that the author never intended.<br /><br />I purchased this book on a whim after a co-worker told me that it was her daughter's favorite book when she was small, and I am happy to say that this charming gorilla and his equally huggable animal pals are still putting children to bed happy for another generation.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|It literally took less than a minute to download this the 14 songs and a little longer for the booklet.  Frankly, I would have waited a lot longer for it to download if I had to.  It's 99 cents and I fully expected there to be a ton of people downloading it at that price.  It's common sense.  Thanks Amazon and Gaga for the music.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|Lady Gaga is in a lovefest with Lady Gaga. That was apparent before listeners even got a chance to hear \\"Born This Way\\" as the singer claimed that the album was going to be superior to Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller.\\" In reality, this music is just okay, with most of the songs combining retro melodies with futuristic beats, mixing in the occasional hook. But the big difference is the focus on this album is on image and self-promotion; Lady Gaga is nothing more than a manufactured moneymaker for the industry, and that is apparent by all the professionals who worked on this album. They even trotted out oldfolks Mutt Lange and the guitar player from Queen to enhance the songs.    The lyrics are just plain dumb, both banal and self-absorbed. Gaga herself seems to think that sheer will power will put her atop the charts, when in fact her singles from the album so far have not met sales expectations. Some of the songs are constructed well, while others sound like lame 1980's soundtrack material that could have been sung by Vixen, Lita Ford, or Pat Benatar. And that's not a knock on Pat Benatar by any means. But it does giv one pause when an artist like Gaga, who has not released a good single since \\"Bad Romance,\\" professes to be so inventive and original. If the definition of inventive is to channel your inner 1980's Madonna and Pat Benatar, then that's a problem, because the songs just aren't that good anyways.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I pre-ordered this before the fact i knew it was gonna be 99cents on Amazon Mp3 download haha.. but i like the physical CDs when it comes to buying music.     My personal feelings for this... I love the new sounds that Lady Gaga plays with... with some songs that i TOTALLY love (judas, born this way, bloody mary, americano) and others that i took me a little bit to really get into. I think its not as addicting as the FAME MONSTER album.. but I still really enjoy it!.    LOVE YOU GAGA! man i want to see her in concert! heard it's epic :)
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I really appreciate Gaga's edgy creative style but this is not close to her previous albums. It sounds more like remix disco and doesn't really stand out like her previous songs. The only ones I liked and thought stood out as not just disco were you and I and born this way. I expected more but I guess everyone has their off days.
B0051QK87S|4.0|The album has some great songs on it and Amazon's service is excellent. Yes they were slammed when they offered her whole album for .99 cents, but remember THEY OFFERED THE ALBUM FOR .99 CENTS!!!  Possibly the biggest album of the year as well! Give them a break ... also the album is great. If you like Lady Gaga, you will not be dissapointed.

B0000CDJPQ|5.0|This adapter is great. I needed one to connect devices to my MacBook Pro, which has the 800 port instead of the 400. Cables that do the same thing cost upwards of $40 and made no sense for me to purchase. Why should I be forced to upgrade all my cables when they all work fine? All I needed was the Sonnet at about 1/4 of the price. Fits snugly at both ends and I've never had an issue with it. I'm thinking about buying a second one just to have around. One of the best things I've bought on Amazon. Highly recommended for similar applications.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book got so many good reviews, I couldn't ignore it anymore. For a long time, I tried resisting YA lit, but it's just so impossible. YA has so many amazing titles. This one is no exception, it was amazing. Disturbing, but amazing. As the beginning of a trilogy, this book does not disappoint. It does what the first book in a trilogy should do, make you want more. It's so fantastic, I spend a whole day reading it (from about 10%) and when it was over, I went to Amazon and bought the other two books in the trilogy and immediately started reading Catching Fire when it was delivered to my Kindle. It was that good. I've not done that in a very long time and I would venture to say that this book, The Hunger Games, is the best book I've read for leisure in a very long time. Okay, okay, so, enough gushing.<br /><br />The crew:<br /><br />The characters, I loved them. They're so believable, you can't help but love them--Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Primrose & Rue, Thresh, Cinna & Portia, even Effie and Haymitch!  Katniss Everdeen, the narrator, is a wonderful character. You don't always like her, or her choices, and there are moments when you'll want to scream at her to open her eyes and see what's right in front of her face. The fact that she doesn't always see what's right there, or the subtext going on between the other characters, is what makes her believable. It's what makes her human and likable. She has emotions and you see them clearly in her reactions to what's happening. Suzanne Collins is so good she makes the reader able to see things through Katniss's eyes, and from Katniss's perspective, that Katniss herself is missing. It takes one very capable author, with a clear understanding of what she's doing, to pull that off.<br /><br />The other characters are all fantastic too, but I think I want to talk about Gale and Peeta here. In her interactions and relationships with Gale and Peeta, you can see that Katniss is very much a sixteen year old girls. She misses things, she makes assumptions that someone with more years wouldn't make, she suffers a great deal of conflict where these two guys are concerned. You can't help but root for her, and for them, even though she can't end up with both of them. You feel her attraction to Gale, even if she denies that there's anything romantic between them.  You feel her conflict about Peeta, the boy with the bread. I admit, though, that I love a good love triangle!  This is a good love triangle.  Both Peeta and Gale are desirable, in different ways, and in her feelings about them, the reader is almost as torn as Katniss herself.<br /><br />The Story:<br /><br />Okay, this is where the disturbing comes in. This story is dark. It's not for the faint of heart. It's about children (ages 12-18) killing one another. They're doing it for survival, and for the entertainment of the people in the Capitol of Panem. This is not a feel good, happy-go-lucky book. It's a live or die book. There are some reviewers on Goodreads who took strenuous objection to the whole kids killing kids thing, and while it's very poignant, I agree that it's difficult to stomach. What I don't agree with is that this book should be skipped. This book is great, the setting is dark, but that's what makes it good literature. It has a point. The setting is very well thought out, the actions and reactions are very clear and often unsettling. You see why they're doing it, how it's received in the Districts, and the difference between the people dying to survive in the Districts from those in the Capitol, where there's wealth. This is dystopian and dystopian is not always pretty. As a matter of fact, it's never pretty. That's what makes dystopian what it is. It always has a point. Always. I suppose it comes down to this: If you can't stomach kids killing kids, don't read it. Otherwise, try.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />I loved it and recommend it to anyone.  Not just anyone who enjoys dystopian, but to everyone. I don't generally read dystopian and I loved this book. If you've been on the fence, and think you can deal with the unsettling themes, go get it.  You won't regret it.n the fence, and think you can deal with the unsettling themes, go get it.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Great series! I love it! The shipping was really fast! I couldn't wait to get it! It's not the fault of this site or the person we got it from, but the only problem is that some of the cast changed from the series to the movies.
0060853972|3.0|I read this book months ago and I can't not remember much about it except the end.  Which I do not want to spoil.  There were funny things about about the book like, when the Antichrist wishes for his hell-hound and it turns out to be a small and tiny dog because that is what he wishes for.<br /><br />What is left that I remember is not that great, which could be because of the subject matter. I don't usually read Apocalyptic stuff even if it is tongue in cheek but read this on recommendation of my husband.  I just did not find this one remember-able.  I find similar problems with American Gods as well but enjoyed some of Pratchett's work alone.<br /><br />I think if you like British humor and Monty Python you might grasp the humor better then I did.

0439023513|5.0|**MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS**<br /><br />I really enjoyed Mockingjay, but not as much as I thought I would after the previous two books. It was substantially slower than The Hunger Games and even Catching Fire, but what I did like about it was the scope and the resolution. The scope of this book is ramped so far up from where we began in The Hunger Games it's almost unimaginable. It's not two kids from 12 going to the games anymore, it's a war. Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch and the crew are back, but not in the way anyone expects and there're moments when you worry, or wonder, what might happen next. It's a good book, nearly as good as it's predecessors, but quite different overall.<br /><br />The Story:<br /><br />The plot of this book was obvious from the first pages. If you've read the other two, and you really must to get what's going on in any meaningful way, then the plot of this book will come as no surprise. The way the characters behave, after all they've been through, is likewise no surprise. That's something I really enjoyed about this book overall. Collins keeps pace with what she's been doing all along, making this book the natural progression of events. Things occur just as you would expect them to, Katniss behaves just as you would expect her to, and the plot pushes forward.<br /><br />The Characters:<br /><br />The characters that change most throughout, I think, are Peeta and Gale. I keep coming back to them because they're two of my favorites. Initially, I loved them because of the love triangle aspect, and while I still do, there's so much more to them now. Peeta is missing in the beginning of this book, for reasons I'll not spell out (to avoid as many spoilers as possible) and for me, he was sorely missed. He's one of my favorites, and when he shows back up, it's with a vengeance... but he's different. It made me sad, really, that he was so... un-Peeta-like, but it did make sense. Of Gale, on the other hand, we get to experience two sides of him we haven't completely seen before: his emotional side and his vengeful side. Now, we have seen them, but this book gives us more, more, more of that. Ultimately, both of them are a little more ragged and worse for the wear in the book, but they're still amazing characters.<br /><br />Katniss doesn't change so much as grow and evolve. Good characters should and she's a good character. I could feel what she was going through, how she was going through it, and my heart went out to her on several occasions. Okay, more than several, but I'll get to that.  We also see more of Primrose in this book and she's much more grown-up than she was before. She gives amazing advice, seems to be flourishing in District 13 where they're going to train her to be a doctor, and she puts up a much braver face than I think I could have at any age.  Haymitch is still Haymitch, really.<br /><br />The Feeling:<br /><br />This book was heartbreaking. Not from the very beginning, but as it draws to a close, it becomes so much more difficult. There are things early on, like Peeta, that make it hard, but as the book, and with it the series, draws to a close, the book becomes very emotional. Things happened, people were lost, and I cried. It's been so long since a book has elicited this sort of response from me, I almost forgot it was possible to cry over a book. This one reminded me that it is possible to connect with characters, a plot, a world in a meaningful way.  Even the Epilogue made me cry. I felt like such a basket case when this book ended.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />Again, I enjoyed it but maybe not as much as those that came before it. I was, however, very happy with both the resolution and how that resolution came about. The way she ends up, and with whom, work and make sense. It's a natural progression to the end of Katniss's story and I liked it. I also liked the feeling, and emotion this book elicited, and the plot and scope. I didn't so much enjoy the pace, the loss of some amazing characters, and the fact that some of the characters didn't get a resolution the way they should have. However, this was Katniss's story, and the story of Panem, and on both of those counts, the resolutions were agreeable.on the way they should have. However, this was Katniss's story, and the story of Panem, and on both of those counts, the resolutions were agreeable.
B004V9J3HM|5.0|After several spins, I'd have to say that this album ends up being a strong effort that links his earlier musical styles from his Snow/Testimony era to his latest styles found in his Whirlwind/Lifeline era quite adeptly, though I'd certainly rate Testimony 2 as quite a bit stronger than the very uneven Lifeline. While this album does a nice job of incorporating some of the musical themes of Testimony to really make this new album feel like a very natural continuation of the first Testimony album, he also definitely goes quite a ways beyond that musical template to explore some nice progressive styles that end up being very enjoyable and pretty fresh sounding. In fact, I'd say this is a more \\"progressive\\" sounding effort than either Testimony 1 or Snow.<br /><br />There are the traditional Nealesque type of themes and overtures you'd expect from most of his albums, but for the most part, they are different enough to not sound stale or self-derivative. That being said, there are a few parts of the album are very much \\"been there, done that\\", like the Gentle Giant-type vocal piece in the track \\"Time Changer\\", however in that particular instance I get the sense that it's more an homage to that era of his career with Spock's Beard than a guy running out of new ideas. It's not a \\"perfect\\" album like \\"Bridge Across Forever\\" or \\"The Light\\" and there are a couple of tracks like Jayda that aren't quite on par with the rest of the album, but this is one of Neal's best solo efforts since the One/? albums.<br /><br />I'd rank this album on par with Snow, Testimony and One. I'd also rank this album ahead of Sola Scriptura and his self-titled solo album, definitely ahead of Lifeline, Beware of Darkness and Kindness of Strangers.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommended and some vintage Neal while still managing to sound fresh and exciting.<br /><br />Update (7/14/2011) : Having now listened to the album at least 50 times or more since I got, I have to add a few things. Seeds of Gold is one of Neal's finest single \\"epic\\" pieces from any album he's been a part of. Everything flows beautifully from one section to the next and is very reminiscent of \\"At the end of the day\\" or \\"All of the above\\" which I consider to be 2 of Neal's finest works. Also, other than Jayda which I still consistently skip, the material on the first disk is even stronger than I first thought. Those two things combined have made me reconsider and I'm bumping the rating up to the full 5 stars it deserves. This album will definitely go down as one of Neal's best efforts in a very long time and I can't wait to hear what journey he'll take us on next.ngle \\"epic\\" pieces from any album he's been a part of.

B0051QIGP4|2.0|I loved Fame Monster. It had many great songs with hooks that sank deep on first listen. I listened to the cds for weeks on the way to/from work.    Born This Way, well its totally the opposite. The songs are just seriously weak compared to Gagas first album and if I never hear them again that is perfectly fine.     I am not a Gaga fanboy/girl or what she calls a little monster. So I feel I can give you an \\"unbiased\\" opinion of \\"Born This Way\\". Just an average joe who really enjoyed her first album and really was disappointed in the second.     That's my opionion. You may like it but again I state use the \\"preview all samples\\" button before you make a purchase.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|So, this album is amazing. I had to go buy it at Walmart today, since Amazon does not understand how to let you have it, the day you buy it. I think this was a marketing scheme for Amazon. Not impressed with Amazon. But Gaga does a great job on this album. It has a lot of variety and lots of good dance numbers.    Update: Amazon actually let me download it a day later. My favorites are: Marry the night, Born this way, Judas, Americano, Hair, Scheibe, Bad Kids, and The edge of glory.

0439023491|4.0|Katniss and Peeta are back in the spotlight in Catching Fire, dragged into something they could never have forseen, nor planned for. A rebellion... and Katniss is unwittingly its symbol. Unfortunately, this means death for everyone Katniss and Peeta love. The book unfolds as they go on their victory tour and we learn about the Quarter Quell, an event that happens every 25 years. This time the Quarter Quell means breaking all the rules of the Hunger Games and Katniss and Peeta are tossed right into the middle of it.<br /><br />While we learn a great deal about Panem, and it's people, and start to feel for some of the people who live in the Capitol, this book doesn't have the breakneck pace that The Hunger Games had. It's slower, and more cereberal, but because of this we get to see how Katniss's brain really works, when she has time to think about things completely. We also get a sense that she might be more scarred than she's willing to let on. When the announcement of the Quarter Quell comes, her reaction clues us in on the psychological trauma she's truly feeling about her time in the Arena. I felt for her, my heart went out to her, but it also went out to Peeta, who picked himself--and Katniss and Haymitch--up by the bootstraps.<br /><br />The characters, in Catching Fire, have matured, even little Prim who we can't help but feel sorry for in her immediate loss of innocence through the games and the events thereafter. We feel even more conflicted, right along side Katniss, about Peeta and Gale, particularly because Gale plays a bigger part in this book. Only slightly, but he does. There're also new characters, like Finnick, who I couldn't help but fall for and President Snow, who, while he isn't exactly new, is more present in this book and more hate-able.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the pace of this book, though there were moments when I longed for the action that made The Hunger Games so amazing. I was, however, shocked by the ending, but I also felt it was a little bit too abrupt. Cliffhangers are fine, but this one felt a bit like the rest of the book was just missing. It was too abrupt for my liking. Luckily, I had Mockingjay on my Kindle and was able to start it right away, but had I been reading these books when they were new and the final chapter wasn't yet released, I'd probably have been quite upset at how abruptly the book finishes.  I was also fairly upset about the turn of events where Peeta was concerned, right at the end... I nearly cried, then I got upset, and waited for something more to be said about it but the book ended.little bit too abrupt.

B0051QJ83S|1.0|Lady Gaga, if you really care about your fans like you said you did when I saw you at MSG this past august, DEMAND that amazon get their glitches fixed. I bought the album yesterday for 99c, helping to propel you to number 1. However Amazon is unable to complete the download, the 4 songs I have sound great but amazon is not answering my or your many other fan's emails and I am not able to download the other songs I paid for. I'm pissed off! I'm gonna have to take a Bikram class at LES Bikram 2 blocks away. Hey, maybe we used to be neighbors?
B000002GKT|5.0|I stopped going to rock concerts years ago because they don't do em like this anymore and haven't for years. Back then a concert was where a band would take album material and really experiment with it. Listen to zeppelin's albums 1-2 and then watch the video of their first concert at Royal Albert Hall.   they start off with the opening riff and then REALLY go off with the tunes. You won't listen to the studio album half as much. These guys are the same. damn good on album but OH MY GOD live. Gilded splinters (much apoligies to all you Don't need no doctor fans)is as good a extended version live as it gets, Even the rolling beer bottle is a great touch bringing back memories of so many 70's concerts. This was also when bands did a concert to put on the best damn show they could... not play the tracks everyone wanted to hear the same as the album and get a check for $ 100,000.00 like today. Anybody asks what a top notch 70's rock concert was like just hand them this album, Nuff said.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|All the negative comments you've seen about the first blu-ray release for Sept 2009 are true.  Horrible transfer but they fixed all the problems with the August 2010 release.  All the arrows, crisp colors, etc are there.    Now trying to figure out which blu ray is which is the difficult part as the box, from what I can see, looks the same.  I don't know if you are going to be able to get it right going through Amazon.  No offense to them as I love the company but the only release I see that they are offering is the 2009 edition.  It looks like the 2009 edition is known as the first press and the 2010 edition is known as the remastered edition. blu-ray dott comm has a more extensive review of the better copy if you are looking for specifics.    The makers that be screwed this up big time as I avoided the blu-ray edition like the plague until someone pointed out to me that the true blu-ray for Gladiator was released in August 2010.
B001R1G01O|4.0|I really liked this movie. A lot of critics said Jim Carrey's acting was bad and that he can't play a credible character, I really wonder if they were watching the same film that I was. The issues I found weren't really to do with the acting, that was just fine, the plot was a bit predictable... That being said, it's kind of an interesting what-if about the McCarthy era and someone actually standing up to that congressional witch hunt.

B0042RJWTC|1.0|I watched the first season of The Tudors on the T 101 where I was able to get Close Caption.  I fell in love with the show!  By the time the second season was complete, my daughter purchased it for me as a birthday gift.  I couldn't find on the box where it stated it had \\"close caption\\" but I opened it anyway and to my dismay, there was no close caption. I was unable to watch it because I couldn't hear half of what was being said, even with hearing aids.      Now the series is over and the complete DVD set is available.  I checked all the details and could find nothing about close caption or English SDH.  I went to a couple of different websites and finally on Showtime, found my answer: there is no Close Caption on the DVD series.     For me and many like me, this is an outrage! Close Caption or English SDH should be a standard on all DVD's. The technology has been around since the early 1970's. There is no point in having a clearer sharper picture (Blu-Ray) if I can't \\"hear\\" every soft comment or whisper the characters make.  It should be a complete experience and it's time for industry mandate for close caption or SDH (which applies to HDTV and Blu-Ray) on all DVDs!     This \\"deal of the day\\" is fantastic and I'm sure many Tudor lovers will jump on it in a heartbeat - BUT with no close caption, this is one I will have to pass on.

I  cannot  wait  for  the  finale.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This album is for Lady Gaga fans. (Or her little monsters, if you prefer.) If you're not a fan, don't bother. You don't like her or her music now, so you won't like this. Personally, I think this is even better than her first album. I love Lady Gaga and her music speaks to me. So happy I finally got this album!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|this is the first time i have purchased an album or any music on amazon and i must say what a deal the entire album for 99 cents. UNREAL!!!!  this music is great but i am having trouble putting it on my ipod/itunes.  i was wondering if anyone knew how to do that because it does say it is compatible with ipod's.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|I have been waiting for this album for awhile now, all the songs are fanatical. I think that this album truly shows off Lady GaGa's vocal ability, it has much more meaning and each song seems to have a powerful message being portrayed in the listeners mind. I think this album is 5/5 stars personally. I bought the deluxe edition off iTunes though and I heard the controversies Amazon is experiencing through its super promotional deal for having this album sell at only 99cts. If you are one of the many individuals waiting, please be patient. Quit complaining, you were guaranteed the full album download. Its better to wait for the album knowing it was purchased for that awesome price. Least you didn't pay $13 dollars for it off iTunes or at a retail store.
0756405890|1.0|This book details the life of an extremely talented and precocious little boy, who eventually grows up to be a great hero. I think I would have liked this book if I'd read it before age 15, but as an adult, I reacted strongly against the main character. Because the book heavily details day-to-day activities at wizard school, there isn't much action to distract from the main character. Plus, I like to learn from the books I read (the reason I like fantasy and sci-fi) and the Name of the Wind didn't teach me anything.
B004RRVHCW|2.0|This is the sort of album that a person damns with faint praise.  Thurston Moore working with Beck sounds like a brilliant idea, but the actual product isn't quite exciting as what you imagined.  I expected lots of bold experimentation, raucous tunes, and sublime hooks.  I expected Sgt. Pepper's for the 2010s.  Instead, we have a lushly brooding affair that is high on atmosphere and low on fun.  The record sounds a lot more conventional than you'd expect with its acoustic guitar, harp, and strings.  It's not bad, but nor is it great.  I'm disappointed, much like I was after reading the Wolverine vs. Spiderman crossover, or watching the Flintstones meet the Jetsons.  Or to put it in musical terms, I was hoping for \\"Two Bass Hit\\" and instead I got \\"Ebony and Ivory\\".
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Sure the download was slow, but in the end it worked.   (and 3 tracks needed to be re-downloaded, that's what the amazon downloader is for)    I've already listened to the album 6 times. Good stuff!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Thank you very much for the 0,99 $-deal!!!    It was totally worth it! Okay, the 'Fame Monster' may be waay better than 'Born This Way' but seriously, you coulnd't do anything wrong with this deal!

B001DONA40|5.0|I only recently \\"discovered\\" Norah Jones when I purchased a used CD version of this at a local music/book store. Oh, what I had been missing! This album (and Norah) won eight 'Grammies' eight years ago - and listening to the CD revealed why. It's downright amazing!    There are so many other reviews that already explain all the winning aspects of this album that it's unnecessary for me to explain here. And to spend several times the 'original' price of this vinyl LP record, that is now out-of-print, would seem to be madness to most people, but not to those music-loving \\"audiophiles\\" looking for the VERY BEST sound. This 200 gram vinyl 'audiophile-grade' LP record IS the ultimate version!    I do not know if this was recorded with digital recorders, analog tape machines, tin cans and strings, or 'smoke and mirrors', but the CD version, although impressively good, pales in comparison to this version on 200 grams of premium-grade vinyl. On a high-resolution audio playback system, the sound is absolutely STUNNING!!!!! It simply makes my hairs stand up on end and brings tears of joy to my eyes - yes, it's THAT good!    Usually most 'high-quality' audiophile recordings suffer from less than excellent performances - very good, but not \\"over the edge\\" great. But everything about 'Come Away With Me' was done with such apparent love and care, this record absolutely 'shines' with exuberance that will make it a 'classic' for the years to come. The performances and recording quality make this LP a 'benchmark' recording(and a superb 'demo' record), and a good reason to seek out a copy that will completely gratify the search and outlay of a high price for one of these discs.    Hopefully, there will be another 'audiophile-quality' LP release of this in the future - the music-loving world deserves it - but for now, THIS, sadly out-of-print 200 gram LP record, IS the BEST version yet and very well worth seeking out.    I only 'review' items that I actually own and enjoy and feel deserve five stars - here is another one of them. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED for those with audio systems that will do proper justice to reproducing this superb recording - FIVE STARS!!!!!
B000008LAC|5.0|I just picked this up a week ago and have been listening to it non-stop ever since!  Being such a huge fan of all the Tramp's original musicianship and post work of Rodger's and Rick's i really didnt know what to expect considering the reviews on Amazon.  I must say i absolutely LOVE this album!  So glad i picked it up, from the very start it just literally ropes you in, and you dont wanna leave!  Greatness comes sometimes in somewhat un-noticed and barely mentioned packages!!!  As much as i know of the probs between the two main members i still have to say on their own they are both exceptional artist, and i hope someday they will finally break the chains that bind them.  I know Rodger wanted to be considered a part of the band again, and i hope someday this will happen for everyone sakes.  In the meantime its just so great that this band and these stars continue to shine!!!

B0051QIGP4|5.0|I began downloading this CD yesterday morning at 10:30 am, just when Amazon was almost crashed by this $.99, 14-song CD special sale price hit from the notorious Lady Gaga.  The CD finished downloading at 8 pm last night...and it was well worth the wait!!  I did not even cry for the lost of my laptop for a whole day!!  One listen on my Windows Media Player and I was up late downloading this hit to vinyl--twice--once for the car and, again, for the stereo system at home.  What a great collection!! Gaga at her very best!!  Thanks, Amazon, for the great deal....you are, truly, good to your customers...plus, I understand from today's news that you have, again, made digital history!!  Bravo Amazon and Lady Gaga---Two Class Acts!!
B004UFEJS0|5.0|Pixar and director Brad Bird hits another one out of the park with an entertaining, funny and even informative take on haute cuisine. Ratatouille combines themes such as a rags to riches story, father and son dynamics, living a double life, and of course rats and food. Pixar has always been good with smart family entertainment and this movie is no different. My four year old son loves it. My 20 year old daughter loves it. I love it. This is one of those films that will undoubtedly endure the test of time.     The basic story is a rat with a keen sense of smell and a love for making food gets separated from his family and ends up at the restaurant of his favorite chef. In a strange turn of events Remy (the rat voiced by Patton Oswalt) creates a soup that everybody loves, but credit was given to the garbage boy. Remy and said garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) come up with a plan to keep Remy cooking with Linguini as the cover. From there you get plenty of hijinks, cartoon thrills, a little romance, some character development, and all around fun times.     It doesn't matter how good the animation is on a movie. If the script doesn't deliver the movie won't either (just look at Final Fantasy). Ratatouille's is sharp. It hits all the marks in story development and gives a really nice pacing on events. My only gripe is there was an action scene or two that felt forced just to add some excitement while not really lending to the story very well. Other than that the plot was pitch perfect.     While a great story is the backbone to a good movie good animation doesn't hurt. I can't really say much that most people who watch Pixar movies already know. The animation excels. The fine details from the hairs on the rats and humans to the look of the food to the stylistic backgrounds. It all shows quality. I can't help think a bit of The Incredibles theory is in the design, which would make sense considering Brad Bird directed that one too.      Another thing that can make or breakthe immersion level of an animated movie is the sound and voice acting. Pixar always finds a way to get the best out of their actors and make them sound like professional voice talents. It's all great, but I would like to make note of my personal standouts. Lou Romano as Linguini gives a ton of character for somebody who doesn't have much of a voice acting background (he's a design artist). I didn't recognize comedian Janeane Garofalo as Colette she was so convincing. More so for Ian Holm as the main villain Skinner. He knocked it out of the park for me with that outlandish character. Then you have Peter O'Toole as food critic Anton Ego. This man steals the show with his voice and the subtle intonation in his performance resonates.    This Blu-Ray is a re-release of the 2007 Blu-Ray with an additional DVD version added. The special features are identical to the previous release. Here's what you get(* denotes feature on the DVD as well):    Pixar Shorts*:    Lifted - One of my favorite shorts about an alien abduction... final exam. The human character looks a lot like our human hero Linguini from the movie.     Your Friend the Rat - This is actually a very educational and informative short on the history of rats and their relationship to human society. It's told by Remy and his brother and is very entertaining.     Fine Food & Film* - Interesting featurette with Brad Bird and top chef Thomas Keller on the food designed for the movie.     Cine-Explore - Tons of mini documentaries and interviews can be picked up while watching the movie. Just about everything you wanted to know. I believe you can get this stuff on the main menu as well without using Cine-Explore.     Gusteau's Gourmet Game - Never played it. Supposed to be Linguini making food during an increasingly busy meal rush.     Deleted Scenes* - Three of them, and they are not finished beyond rough animation. Interesting stuff, but nothing you would have missed.     Deleted Scenes R.I.P. - More deleted scenes.I haven't seen them, but I heard they are better than the previous deleted scenes.     I am assuming the Easter Eggs are also still in here. Wait for the rat to appear on the main menu and then hit the left directional key. You get five bonus items on an hidden menu.     Ratatouille is an amazingly entertaining film and this release has a lot of great extras on top of a great movie. If you have one of those households that has both Blu-Ray players and DVD players (maybe in the kids room) this is a good buy as it keeps both version inside one case. If you are a BD or DVD only household it may be better for you to go for the 2007 release if it's cheaper.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|The price was .99 for the album when I bought it, unfortunatly I should have remembered that I don't like Lady Gaga....
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I love it, it's way different then her other stuff. People need to understand this. It's a new page for Gaga. And I think it's stupid to want an Artist to always sound the same. Reinventing yourself with each album should be every artists goal, not a last resort at the end of a career in hopes to smart new attention. If you want your fans to continue with you . . . then you need to evolve with them to.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of Lady Gaga (in the interest of full disclosure).  This album was $0.99 for the MP3 version and I knew my kids would want it. So I got it.<br /><br />Having said that I found many of Lady Gaga's tunes to be catchy and would even say she's this generation's Madonna- socially conscious, fashion forward making great dance tunes.  I've watched a couple of interviews with her and I had heard Judas and Born This Way and found both songs to be pretty good.<br /><br />I put the album on in the background while I was working yesterday.  My thought on the first play through was the album was pretty boring.  Every song is almost exactly the same. There were no real break out songs here-other than the two I had already heard.  The beats are straight-on club beats.<br /><br />Today, I gave the album a second play and it's already growing on me.  I was wrong about all the songs being exactly the same.  Even though they are all pretty much upbeat and loud, there is some good music going on here.  And, I love Lady Gaga's positive message to her \\"little monsters\\" to just be themselves- no matter who they are.<br /><br />So, if you're like  me and don't fall in love with the album on the first play through, give it another chance.
B004LL1HM4|3.0|Enjoyed the new release but nothing really grabs you or sets the hook like Mykonos. The songs are pretty but bleed together. What really ruined the listening experience for me was that unbelievbly annoying sax or clarinet solo in song #10. It doesn't even sound like a musical note. Of all the musical choices to make, they come up with that? Blah!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This provides one more reason do not have to use my computer at home.  The iPad is beginning to rule my life.
B003WMX3SY|5.0|This is probably the 20th or so case model I've worked with and it is by far the most flexible, feature complete and safe case I've used.  Nearly no sharp edges, completely modular, space of SSDs, suspended hard disk mounts and enough room for huge graphics cards.  Excellent product from a quality company.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Just spoke to the people at Amazon.com and immediately after I hung up I got all my songs on my cloud!<br />tHE albun is great!!
1582701709|5.0|My baby sister urged me to read this book-so did my niece for that matter. It is a very satisfying, very enjoyable read, and if one is willing you can certainly take some good lessons away from the book.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|I received this dvd on time and in excellant condition. The movie I would recomend to all action fans and those who especially enjoy martial arts.I give this 5 stars.
B003E1QCLS|1.0|I would not recommend purchasing this pressing! This album is one of my all time favorites and I was replacing my ancient original with this purchase and I am not impressed.  The album arrived in a timely fashion, but the quality is certainly not audiophile.  The pressing was not deburred and so many bits of loose vinyl were present in the jacket that I immediately threw it away and used a fresh one.  After several cleanings to remove the residue, the album was finally playable, but has numerous visible and audible surface defects.   I do not expect perfection in vinyl, but at this price tag, I do expect a much higher level of quality control and workmanship!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Item was a gift for my daughter.  I prefer live performances but this is the closest we're going to get.  I'd prefer different camera angles and timing that would support my interests at a concert, but that's the difference between live and disk.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|This movie never went anyplace and was incredible boring. I sat thru the whole thing waiting for something to happen. Don't waste your time on this lemon. What was C. Eastwood thinking?? Everybody else already covered all other issues, so I leave it as this.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|First let me say I was lucky enough to purchase and download this gem of an album early this morning before all the trouble started...yippee 4 me.    Second...\\"BORN THIS WAY\\" IS THE SHIIIIIIIIIIZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I was not all that impressed with the first couple of singles, but the rest of the album is the work of the \\"GaGa Freak\\" I know and love.    THANK YOU, LADY GAGA, FOR DELIVERING THE GOODS!  YOU ARE A...    SUPER*STAR  POP*GENIUS  ROCK*GODDESS  FREAK*ADVOCATE  DIVA*EXTRAORDINAIRE    ...and I love you.
0515149489|3.0|Haven't we seen this story before? I really have lumped NR in that category of 'formula writer' - as in the mass publishers that have to get X number of books out per year.  I predicted the outcome by the second chapter (that the story would end with a search & rescue) and we have seen this \\"tough\\" female character before (remember the one where she flies planes in Alaska and the one where fights fires?).     I did like the FBI partners involvement and I thought that added some different flavor.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I downloaded the album no problem to my cloud player. People need to quit crying Amazon is giving us a great deal at a $.99. Hello, dont you think that it would get busy and there would be some delays? Go buy the album for $12.00 if it's that serious.    Ok album bought it because it was so cheap lol.    Thanks Amazon. I will continue to buy my music from you and love the great deals we can get!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Great beats, great lyrics, awesome album.  Please don't give this album a bad rating just because Amazon's servers were overloaded.  That has nothing to do with the album itself!
B001AQO3Z6|5.0|While it is true that some shots used in the movie are taken from archives who are under the HD standards, it is certain that the remaining 90% are definitly worth a blu-ray release. And maybe, it also is a great opportunity to provide an almost uncompressed track of the Gigantic Phillip Glass music. This movie is one amazing masterpiece. I would so much enjoy to be able to immerse myself again in it in high-def projection. Please, ++++++++++++
B004K4AVAG|5.0|This is one heck of an album. I admit, it's not for everyone. Even those who loved her first couple of cd's may not completely love this.   Is it overproduced? Sure. But it works.   And it just gets better and better with repeat listenings.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I couldn't sit through one entire song - I'd get bored and skip to the next song.  Thankfully I didn't waste more than 99 cents on this.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is something I can't believe I didn't have before. It's FREE (for now) and it's awesome. If you can get the app then why not. I love that you can control the color text settings and size settings, not to mention glare settings and so many FREE choices.. I love books , but I love this new Kindle app on my android. No complaints at all! Get it. A+
B000ZELISO|5.0|Book 6 of the Harry Potter series, like the others before it, has been turned into a wonderful movie.  Clocking in at over 2.5 hours in length, this movie encompasses many key events such as the death of Dumbeldorff, the romance between Harry and Ginny Weasley, the quest for Voldermort's Horcruxes, and of course new and old romances to make life interesting both day and night.  With all the major events in this movie, it makes the 2.5 hour-length pass by quickly.  The special effects are spot on of course, and the soundtrack is quite good with some new music and some from the previous movies.  Following the trend of the previous 2 movies, this one ends in a tragic death, and is probably the most serious of all the movies.  This is first movie to fully exclude the Dursleys as screen time is reserved exploring Voldermort's past as Tom Riddle, and the fight against him in the present.  Overall, a great movie.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I purchased the album today. The download was a bit slow, but the entire album was downloaded in just under an hour. Not a bad wait for $0.99 and some good songs. No quality issues and I'm able to play them on all my media.    There's a few misses on the album, but overall, I think it's a great listen. Not much out of the way of the usual Gaga-style, but I guess that's why we have to wait for the music videos ;-)
B0051QIGP4|3.0|This album is okay but frankly I was expecting better considering how good her older stuff is.  I'm glad I got a super deal on this because if I paid full price I would really be disappointed.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|i had this app downloaded via the amazon app store for a few weeks and i constantly had issues with it. downloaded from the android market, and it works fine.<br /><br />streaming at times takes just a little bit too long on 3G (as opposed to google music beta. which is nearly instant)
B004PGO25O|5.0|I am glad that I read this great book. Even though I am highly successful as a writer and independent publisher (my books have sold over 675,000 copies worldwide), Pressfield's book got me much more motivated to  work on my new projects.    Here are three of my favorite brief passages that I have liberated from the book.    \\"The three dumbest guys I can think of:  Charles Lindbergh, Steve Jobs, Winston Churchill.  Why? Because any smart person who understood  how impossibly arduous were the tasks they had  set themselves would have pulled the plug  before he even began.\\"    \\"Ignorance and arrogance are the artist's   and entrepreneur's indispensable allies.  She must be clueless enough to have no  idea how difficult her enterprise is going  to be -- and cocky enough to believe she  can pull it off anyway.\\"    \\"A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable,  nor does the genius or the madman. It's only  you and I, with our big brains and our tiny  hearts, who doubt and hesistate [and don't even begin].\\"    In short, this book is metaphysical, inspirational, and motivational. Of course, like most books of this nature, it will help those who least need the advice in it. At the same time, the people who most need to follow the advice in this book will critisize both the author and the book, and continiue on with their lives blaming society, the government, corporations, etc. for their lack of success and satisfaction in their lives.     In short, this world is divided into individuals who talk big about getting things done and those who actually do things in a big way. Ensure, if you can, to belong to the latter. There's far less competition and the rewards are much greater. Steven Pressland's \\"DO THE WORK!\\" will help you join the club who get things done in a big way.    Ernie J.

B004K4AVAG|2.0|Heard of Lady Gaga? She's this loopy pop singer with weird hair and clothes, and most people either love her or hate her. Well, my personal opinion of Lady Gaga's persona won't come into this -- it's all about her new album, \\"Born This Way.\\" Well, brace yourself: It's a bloated mess that rambles on far too long, with too many songs, too much noise, and no unifying style.<br /><br />\\"Born This Way\\" presents itself as a gay anthem, and it does this by thumping you over the head with obvious shout-outs like \\"Don't be a drag/just be a queen\\" and \\"No matter gay, straight or bi/Lesbian, transgendered life.\\" But all Madonna comparisons aside, this song is a mess -- the producers heaped so many layers of sound that it sometimes sounds like Gaga is being smothered.<br /><br />Then there's \\"Judas,\\" the second single of this album. This suffers from the same choking overproduction as \\"Born This Way,\\" with Gaga's voice being smushed down under a thick fog of synthpop. Then again, she spends half the song squawking, \\"Juda-JUDA-AW!\\" like an epileptic goose, so that might be a good thing.<br /><br />But what of the other songs? Well, the album actually starts quite strong with the dark, glittering \\"Marry the Night,\\" and the bleakly desperate sex-with-presidents thumper \\"Government Hooker.\\" But things start going off the rails with the goopy romanticism of the Spanish-flavored \\"Americano,\\" the vaguely Germanic club melody \\"Scheibe,\\" and the cheesy \\"Hair.\\"<br /><br />After that, Gaga just... seems to stop trying, and lets the following songs decay into a soggy mess of mediocre club pop. Some of the songs barely have melodies (\\"Black Jesus - Amen Fashion,\\" \\"Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)\\"), and some are just so bland that it's hard to remember them (\\"The Queen\\"). I like \\"Electric Chapel,\\" but most of these songs could have been cut without anyone noticing.<br /><br />She does rouse herself enough to give distinctive sounds to the last couple songs... but they're AWFUL sounds: \\"You And I\\" sounds like a country singer wandered into a dance club and just started singing, and \\"The Edge of Glory\\" is a horrendously cheesy power ballad, complete with SAXOPHONES.<br /><br />In a nutshell, \\"Born This Way\\" is a huge bloated mess, bogged down with excess and collapsing under its own weight. It feels like Lady Gaga is trying to do EVERYTHING in this album. More sound! More musical genres! More random references to fashion, nightclubs, sex and gay people! More dance songs that nobody can remember when they're over!<br /><br />As for Gaga's lyrics, they have some interesting elements, like the strong undercurrent of Catholic/religious symbolism and the idea that \\"bad kids\\" are just fine because they were \\"born that way.\\" But her writing also tends to be insanely clumsy (\\"You're black, white, beige, chola descent/You're Lebanese, you're Orient\\"), and her symbolism is so obvious that it leaves bruises between your eyes.<br /><br />And her voice? It's the strongest part of any song where she tries, but too often it falls by the wayside in this album. In some songs, it's swamped by all those electronic layers, and in some songs she just sort of croons without putting any effort into it.<br /><br />If they had trimmed off the B-sides and the extra production, \\"Born This Way\\" could have been a pretty decent pop album. But instead, it feels like a collapsing monument to pop excess.red into a dance club and just started singing, and \\"The Edge of Glory\\" is a horrendously cheesy power ballad, complete with SAXOPHONES.

B003VPX5V2|5.0|Although this is spoken in Italian(??) with subtitles, I do believe it's needed for the effect of what and how things are portrayed.  Even if I feel the subtitle sometimes flashed too fast for me to read, I don't think I would want the movie any other way.  Such a touching story.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|This \\"re-boot\\" of Hawaii Five-0 has turned out to be a special jewel in CBS'TV's line-up of shows. For me, admittedly, I am a devoted Alex O'Loughlin fan and was just very happy to see him back on TV in a successful series. He surely deserved it!!  I will admit, however, that it took more than half a season for me to warm up to McGarrett (his character, not his looks, which are stunningly sex-tacular....he's so HOT).    I fell in \\"love\\" with the very passionate, angst-ridden, romantic Mick St. John on Moonlight and really had do to a full circle turn to \\"warm up\\" to Alex as H50's stoic, short-haired military-man McGarrett.  Of course, Alex succeeded in doing this brilliantly - warming me up that is - and there is absolutely no trace of Mick St. John in McGarrett's persona - he really did his homework on this guy.      This show is so beautifully done - scenery, photography, writing, humor (love the banter and looks exchanged between McGarrett and Danno).  Admittedly, some shows were better than others, but all were good. Do we have to suspend reality sometimes??  Of course we do .....this is TV entertainment.....and don't we all have enough reality in our everyday lives!     Now that we have gotten to know the characters better, and can empathize and root for them, the next season should prove very interesting and exciting with some much-anticipated action and answers. I look forward to it every week and DVR it if I'm not going to be home.  I will definitely buy the DVD set - I'll probably enjoy it even better without commercials.    I'm looking forward to Season 2 and I'm happy for cast and crew that we will see more of them.  I only wish CBS/Warner Bros. had given Moonlight half the chance they've given Hawaii Five-0, but that's a whole other story !!    Oh, and please.....let's get some romance into McGarrett's life .... I need to see his beautiful lady-killer smile more often !!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|As always the Foo Fighters never fail to impress. With each album, they change their sound. The first was grunge, the second, punk, the third pop/rock, the fourth hard rock, etc. This one gets back to the hard rock roots Dave Grohl and his boys know well. The first track, Burning Bridges is too awesome, like the first riffs from Stacked Actors or All My Life. The album doesn't let up, either. It's relentless rock, which is what we all deserve from Foo.    I Should Have Known is an epic; it's raw but polished and sticks with you, regardless of his motivations for penning the lyrics. I suspect it's not about Kurt Cobain, but most will probably say I'm wrong. I do think many of Dave's songs are about putting secret pain over Kurt's murder to rest, just not this one.    Anyway, this is a fantastic album and in keeping with everything else Foo has done over the years. I was afraid they were done after releasing their Greatest Hits album and each member doing their own thing. Thankfully they are still going at it. I just have one question:    When are the Foo Fighters coming to Columbus Ohio!?!?!?!
0061743526|5.0|One of the few books I know where the movie lives up to the book and the book lives up to the movie.  Both are flawless classics. Definitely a contender for great American novel, it's hard to believe this was Harper Lee's first and only book. Maybe when you get it right the first time you can let it rest. Everything about it is perfect. Incidentally a great gift for fathers on father's day. (See my discussion on best books for dads for F's Day)
B0051QJ83S|4.0|First off, I did buy this on the original release day to hop on the bandwagon of getting it for $0.99 . I had no intentions of getting the bonus tracks, but after getting the album for so cheap, I listened to the bonus tracks to see if they were worthwhile. To my amazement, they were, and so I bought them as well. The download process took place over a course of 8 hours from the time of hitting the purchase button. Their servers were clogged - what do people expect when an album is the price of a song? It was a great scheme of getting people to try Amazon's MP3 service, but implementation may not have been handled as well as it could have been, but for me, I understand.    From first glance, I was a little skeptical, as it seemed like the tracks were all over the place in their beats and lyrics. However, after listening more closely, I saw the fluid message that flowed from one song to another. The album is about empowerment, self affirmation, and loving yourself (along with elements of knowing God loves you too, only without making it religious-like).    The use of upbeat tempos, along with some slower ballads, were well done. The major difference in this album is that she utilizes synthesizers much more than the 2 previous albums. Also, the piano solos are more scarce than previously; instead, this gets replaced with saxophone and guitar solos - I'm indifferent to this. If I could point out tracks that I will definitely be listening to for a while, they would be: Marry the Night, Government Hooker, Judas, Scheiße, Bloody Mary, and Heavy Metal Lover - the other ones I'll listen to, but I could foresee them falling out of my playlist a lot sooner.    Overall, I'd say it was well done, but the one part that I miss the most were the simple ballads of her singing with just a piano. She sings really well acoustically, and I think that element got left behind. The track \\"You and I\\" does have major elements of piano playing, but it gets lost in certain parts because of the guitar; is it just me, or did this song remind you of a style similar to Shania Twain? This album is certainly more rock-ish than the previous ones, but not too over the top. I gave the album a 4 out of 5 star rating because of the lacking of piano acoustics hurt it in a way to me. However, if she did make an acoustic version of this album, perhaps then I'd be more forgiving and bumping it to 5 stars.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I really like the remastered versions of Star Trek!  I picked up a cheap set from Amazon for Season One of the original series.  The remastering was done from the original 1960s negatives and the original music from Alexander Courage was re-orchestrated!<br /><br />I am kinda glad they got rid of the soprano singing.  The producers say that they wanted to build on the style of the 60s.  They respect the original material and what they have done is to add detail to each episode.<br /><br />You can see a Gorn blink!  The Milky Way looks starry; planets are cloudy and orange or green.  Klingon warships fire awesome torpedoes that bounce off realistic shields.<br /><br />I am an original viewer and have looked forward to this change for years.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|This album is entirely different that The Fame/Fame Monster.  If you come in expecting to hear another \\"Poker Face,\\" you will be disappointed.  Open your mind when you listen to this album.  It's refreshing to hear an artist not repeat herself  -- Listen to the album for what it is...A Lady Gaga masterpiece. Enjoy it and do not be quick to judge whether you like it or not.  Yes, some songs are better than others, but it's totally worth purchasing and listening too multiple times.
0061801313|4.0|This is some serious light reading. The overall plot is completely addicting, however, the characters aren't quite developed enough for the reader to have any sort of real connection.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Really enjoying the tracks. Far too many 1-star ratings from impatient folks who had to wait a few hours for all the songs to download. Really people, rate the artist not Amazon.    I appreciate Lady GaGa's message in many of her songs. Listening to Born that Way on my walk to the bus stop this morning and found a new spring in my step.    All the theatrics aside, she's got an incredible voice and there are some killer lyrics as well.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|In America today all politics in Washington is about greed, and who can make the most money and nothing to do with ethics, health of the citizens or the environment. The CEOs, the lawyers, the greedy owners, the politicians who protect them, should all be treated like the animals at slaughter in Food Inc!<br />This would mean all republicans politicians everywhere, and the many crooked Democrats in politics that can be bribed.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|plastic beach is a great album.  My favorite tracks are stylo, broken, rhinestone eyes, empire ants and melancholy hill.  You cant go wrong with this cd.
0316098329|3.0|I was a little disappointed because I had heard so many wonderful things about this book, however, I enjoyed the perspective it was written from and the mystery throughout, I only wished the story would've unraveled a little faster.
B00015YVD6|5.0|THANK YOU SELLER FOR SENDING THIS SOOOOO FAST!!!! I GOT IT IN 2 DAYS!!!! AMAZING!!! I wasnt sure it would have been here before my dads birthday but you got it here for me to wrap and for him to unwrap....thanks for making him happy on his birthday! oh and the movie is awesome...ton hanks...and daryl hannah.
1439148953|2.0|Incredibly tedious.  I am giving it two stars rather than one because it was decently written and was not horrendous.  However, there is a huge gap between \\"not horrendous\\" and \\"good\\".  I think the author squandered a good opportunity.    This is the story of a young girl leaving her small Irish town for the first time and coming to Brooklyn to live and work.  What a coming of age story that could have made: what did she think about the customs, culture, food, fashions?  What did she think about the way New Yorkers behaved, and what they thought?  We get virtually none of that.  What we get instead is pages and pages about who is going to the dance with whom, who bought what at the nylon sale, what Eilis thought about her new room in the boarding house, etc.  So instead of a coming of age story, we get almost 300 pages of unimportant details.I felt like I was reading someone's phenomenally boring personal diary.    Eilis is a person who takes no proactive action--she lets things happen TO her, but learns nothing from the experiences, and does not reflect on them.  She is not an interesting person, and does not seem to want to grow. So why should I care about her?    Not recommended.
B0051QO4QY|2.0|I really don't know what to say here. I'm a fan of LG's previous attempts and nearly all of her songs on her past albums have made the rotation on my playlists.     How anyone can listen to this entire album and give it more than 1 or 2 stars is beyond me. If you're a fan of doing nothing but clubbing or hitting a Rave, well...maybe you'll enjoy this album.    There is NO CREATIVITY in this album, in fact...after 3 complete listens all the way through I'm removing this album from my playlist. There is only 1 song (very disappointed by this as I said) that I'm going to keep in rotation. That song is YOU AND I, and I did enjoy it as it seemed to have some creativity and a thought out composition.    As for everything else on this album...take 3 or 4 dance beats, 2 or 3 \\"sounds\\"...a ton of digital alteration/autotune effects, MIX it all together and you'll have every repetitive song on this album summed up.    Ugh, I honestly hope people are listening through this album multiple times then writing reviews. DO NOT WRITE A REVIEW ASSUMING THIS IS THE CREATIVE, CRAZY, AND FUN GAGA YOU HAVE LISTENED TO.    Not even close, it sounds like 3 guys got together in a studio, told LG to sing some songs, then they threw a bunch of dance beats and random CRAP mixes together and told her thank you for the lyrics she added to their generic dance album. LG needs to fire the people that headed this one.
0439023521|5.0|I was skeptical to read this trilogy but I have to admit that I was hooked immediately and have now read all 3 books several times (which I rarely do). I understand the controversy regarding children reading these books, however, I highly recommend them.

0061537969|5.0|I loved this book.  While I don't need to restate what other posters have said, I will admit that I teared up more than a few times while reading the book. I especially loved the relationship between Denny and Enzo.  I don't think I'm giving any of the story away by saying that my favorite line was near the end, when Denny says \\"you've always been my Enzo\\".  I was reading the book in the airport lounge and had to put it down at that point so people wouldn't start looking at me.  There is a lot being said in this book-how we approach life, how we behave, how important it is to hold on to what and whom we love.  Not bad for a relatively short paperback.  I would recommend the book to anyone, but if you are an animal lover, and especially a dog lover, I think it's a must.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|First I would like to say that I enjoyed LG's last album. I'm not a huge fan, but her music made a regular rotation in my playlist.    Now to this album. Yes, excellent deal and it's cool of Amazon/LG to give us such a great deal.    HOWEVER...    ...if you took 4 dance beats, 2 or 3 \\"sounds\\"/\\"styles and repeated them across 14 songs... :(  :(    Well, you would have this album. I don't understand how anyone short of a constant attendee of RAVES and non-stop clubbing could care about this album.    It's the same thing, over, and over, and over. I listened through the entire album this evening, TWICE.    I'm not bashing Gaga, I don't hate Gaga....but she needs to look at changing the creative people (or her own direction if she did this (doubt it)) and come up with some interesting/catch music like on her previous efforts.    This really is a...honestly.....irritating album. There's nothing in it outside of a few lines that will add it to my play list in ANY way.    Oh Well.
0374531269|5.0|One of the few stories that makes me feel guilty about not helping out more people in the world. A real eye-opener to stop taking everything for granted.
B000002HMH|4.0|Load (1996) is a cool album by Metallica.  I remember when this album came out in late spring 1996.  I heard \\"Until It Sleeps\\" constantly on the radio.  It's an excellent song.  This album is a huge departure from Metallica had previously done up to that point.  They went from the thrash metal of Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, and ...And Justice For All to the rather bluesy sound of this album.  Metallica seemed to just let loose on this album and did what they felt like doing, rather than trying to please all their fans.  I agree with this approach.  A band shouldn't do the same thing over and over.  Just about every band goes through changes, though some always stick to their guns, like AC/DC.  However, I can see why Metallica's fanbase was at least a little disappointed with this release.  I must say they have a much more commercial sound on this album.<br /><br />Favorite tracks of mine are Until It Sleeps, King Nothing, Ain't My Bitch, and Hero Of The Day, all radio staples from 1996-1997.  There are a lot of other good tracks on this album as well.<br /><br />I recommend this album to open-minded Metallica fans.  My personal favorite Metallica album is ...And Justice For All.  I recommend that one as well.
0307279189|3.0|Most other reviews have touched on the hyperbole and magazine-iness of this book so I won't rehash that again. What I will offer is some advice. When you get this book -- and if you are at all interested in barefoot or minimalist running you should -- just tear it in half so that Chapter 28 is now Chapter 1. You won't know any of the characters but that's okay. Neither did I after reading the first 27 chapters because there are so many new characters introduced and they all have exactly the same personality that you can't tell them apart.    But around Chapter 28 is where the story gets going instead of time jumping back and forth, sometimes from paragraph to paragraph. It really is a good book, but it is a great reminder for writers that after the first drafts, revise, revise and revise. Cut out all the stuff that doesn't need to be there and clean it up. My advice to Mr. McDougall is to edit this book and make it what it really wants to be, not the rush job it currently is.

B0051QIGP4|1.0|$1 is a hell of a deal for any album but honestly how can people say to rate the album and not Amazon? Where else should we voice our dissatisfaction for only 1/2 a download? Servers can't handle the requests? Honestly? From the company that rents out server space to other companies, that handles millions of requests on a daily basis and on major shopping days like black friday? Maybe it's to promote the cloud service because when downloading to your computer it doesn't say you're added to a queue and download will resume when it can. It says that the download has expired and that you have to contact customer service to try and get what you paid for. iTunes may not have deals like this but they have reliable service. If Amazon is saying they can't handle the volume I guess I'll stick with someone who can.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|The DVD arrived very quickly, it was in fairly good shape and plays fine. I bought from a private party through Amazon, who mailed it wrapped in notebook paper, which I thought was too flimsy and cheap for the cost of S & H. The movie was cheap; just hope they use a mailer for other sales.
B004MC0FO8|2.0|I had the full version of Shazam on a previous phone from the Android Market, and it worked flawlessly. The version from the Amazon Appstore constantly has issues on my AT&T Captivate: The widget fails to load and I get authorization errors that tell me to remove and re-install the app. I can only assume it has to do with Amazon's DRM being unable to verify that I purchased it (which I did).  Also, the Android Market version of Shazam works fine on my Captivate, so the app itself is fine.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|Ive been a fan for at least a year before Gaga broke and have import versions of her CDs and remixes.  There was so much hype about this CD and I was worried about the sophomore slump affecting it,  meaning how hard it is for artists to follow up a major success with something equally successful.  I am a fan of 80s music so I was excited to see the original album cover which showed Gaga in a jean jacket with a unicorn on it.  I really love Born This Way, the references are spot on and the production is amazing.  Only a few songs seemed to slow things down a bit...such as 'Bad Kids.'  I would definately recommend the deluxe edition.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I was able to watch this series and absolutely enjoy it without spouting off the inaccuracies (let's face it...all movies take some license to increase the drama).  I felt they completely \\"got\\" that Henry the 8th was not the grotesquely fat, bald man with a turkey leg that we all picture.  He started out as a beloved prince and then a very popular king.  A contemporary description of him as a young man stated, \\"His Majesty is the handsomest potentate I ever set eyes on; above the usual height, with an extremely fine calf to his leg, his complexion very fair and bright, with auburn hair combed straight and short, in the French fashion, his throat being rather long and thick. He speaks French, English, and Latin, and a little Italian, plays well on the lute and harpsichord, sings from books at sight, draws the bow with greater strength than any man in England, and jousts marvelously. Believe me, he is in every respect a most accomplished Prince.\\"      So...in a word, he was good looking (I think the current Prince Harry probably gives a good idea of his looks at that age), intelligent, an avid sportsman, musical...pretty much everything a woman could ask for.  This is where Jonathan Rhys Meyers comes in and plays the headstrong monarch to a \\"T\\".  I had the privilege of seeing King Henry's armor while in England and to see it at different periods of his life; from young, strapping man, to the obese monarch we all picture.  He also was incredibly tall (6 ft 2 inches).  In an age when his contemporaries were on average about 5' 3\\", he must literally have seemed a \\"giant among men.\\"    I also felt that the series captured the actual drama surround his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and subsequent divorce so he could marry Anne Boleyn perfectly.  I also think they caught Mary's devotion to her faith and the conflict she felt at having to deny her mother in order to keep her father's love (a terrifying figure that affected her relationship with men all her life).    So, inshort, I really enjoyed it.  I'm a huge history buff and love anything by Alison Weir, but I was still able to ignore any \\"poetic license\\" the series took and just become completely enveloped by the stories.  I give this series five stars for the wonderful acting, the gorgeous costumes, and all around escapism it provided me!  Watch it, it won't disappoint!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I left the downloader program running ALL DAY yesterday, and I still only got eight songs. I guess eight songs for 99 cents is a good deal, but still, the advertisement was for 14 songs. Now, the downloader is telling me that my order has expired, and that I can no longer get the songs that I have in fact paid for.    Great idea to give it away cheap. Terrible execution. Amazon wasn't prepared to handle it, and the end result is that the customers are treated like dirt.    Surprise me, Amazon. Fix this.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I just purchased the CD and Amazon won't let me log into my Amazon Cloud Drive to download the CD onto my computer. ARG. I though there was something wrong with my password so I reset it three times and it still doesn't let me log in. I guess I have to wait until it's fixed.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I purchased this album almost 10 hours ago, and i knew it was going to take some time to download because of the high demand. But my card was charged and under the amazon orders is says that my order was processed, which means it should be downloading now. Well its not and its not downloading into the cloud player. What a waste of time and a dollar. I was going to have my sisters get the album also because they really wanted it but there is no way i'm going to put them through all this crap.

B004K4AUZW|4.0|Experimental followup to the Fame releases; a wide spectrum of dance subgenre's (electronic, club, synthpop) and 80's (early 90's) pop music. Reading this sounds fascinating and adventurous; how exciting for a young gemale artist to bring back the charm of vintage pop. The main problem I have with born this way is that it's a bit overproduced, too much at one time and the lyrics become less important than the music. Although the package is exploding with imagination and ideas; the production is not strong and will be forgotten. There's no focal point or direction musically or lyrically, the 'throwback sound' on random songs is the album's only leg to stand on; an unorganized production. The ideas are perfect but the arrangements are'nt defining or grate! I also don't approve of the unnecessary references to christianity, the best songs on the album become unlistenable. Now for the good: it's exciting to see an artist experimenting and being imaginitive even if the results aren't all that. It's all trial and error, eventually a true metamorphosis woll finally take place one of these days, but until then, Born this way is just another experiment in this process.<br /><br />Influences:<br />Tiffany, Debbie Gibson, Gillette<br />Diana DeLori, Vixennd song style back in the 80's. I literally feel as if i'm listening to a lost number by her, It's so unbelievably fantastic!    GOTH/ARENA ROCK:    There's even some Goth influence going on (Siouxie Sioux/Marilyn Manson/Garbage). I can also hear some (80's) Arena Rock undertones/inspirations. I can't help but think of VIXEN's (Edge Of A Broken Heart) or Lita Ford's (Kiss Me Deadly). Oh! and how could I ever forget to mention the divine Ms. Cyndi Lauper, She's most definitely an influence here. If you're familiar with her albums and songs outside of her hits you can totally agree 100%.    SLIGHT COMPARISONS:    Although, not an 80's album, Gwen Stefani's L.A.M.B. (2004) also comes to mind when I'm listening to this album because of the 80's obsession on songs like \\"Serious\\" \\"Danger Zone\\" \\"Real Thing\\" & \\"Crash\\". Same can be said for Ashlee Simpson's \\"I AM ME\\" release in 2005 on songs like \\"Dancing Alone\\" and title track \\"I Am Me\\" and Kelly Osbourne's entire 2005 release(Sleeping In The Nothing). I thought I'd mention more current artists and album's for those of my readers who are too young to know who Debbie Gibson & Tiffany are but still wish to know the flavour of BORN THIS WAY. The difference between Lady Gaga's release and the 3 other CD's that I mentioned is that im more intrigued by Lady Gaga's entire album where as I was only alarmed by 2 or 3 songs on the others.    ELECTRONICA:     You'll also notice that while this album is very 80's and 90's inspired musically and melodically, the fun doesn't end with those decades. Lady Gaga also dishes out some electronic forces that better date the album on songs like \\"Bloody Mary\\" \\"Government Hooker\\" and some others such as \\"Electric Chapel\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\". Technically, \\"Electronica\\" still has a connection to \\"Disco\\", Of course we know that's where it all started. However \\"Electronica\\" is rather a more current form of this. Just had to state the obvious for a minute. Therefore, this thoery shows that she's still covering these same decades including the present.     SHORTCOMINGS/DISAPPROVALS:    So many fabulous sensations in a divine package, Yet still dissapointed and annoyed in areas. The leaked track \\"Earthquake\\" isn't featured anywhere on this remarkable release, Not even as a bonus. Only 1/58th of the song exists in a track titled \\"Fashion Of His Love\\" which is a magnificent track with a major 80's influence. I don't even believe the song is \\"influenced\\" by 80's pop. It just \\"is\\" 80's pop (...And that's definitely not a dissapointment btw.)    EDITING:    I'm also annoyed that the curse words are edited. Every curse word is edited, Yet the name JESUS' is as crisp and crystal clear as ever in \\"Black Jesus + Amen Fashion\\" & \\"Bloody Mary\\" which I do not understand or agree with (more on this matter later). The editing in \\"Bad Kids\\" is just ridiculous, Not only does it make the song sound chopped but it also dulls the theme and feel of the song. The *bleeping* in \\"Government Hooker\\" is a much better a effect for editing inappropriate words, Although, I do realize that it was done on purpose to give the song that raunchy appeal, I know. I actually like that. These same outrageous chopped up situations also occured on The Fame Monster -Dance In The Dark- \\"I'm a free Bit\\". It almost puts me out of the mood to even hear that particular song. Everyone else in industry can curse but Lady Gaga is banned from such words with the exception of JESUS. Hmmm...    MORE:    Another dissapointment is the album version of \\"You And I\\", It's terrible and extremely unappealing in comparison to the live version that premiered months before the official first single \\"Born This Way\\". The live version incorporates a piano and other \\"real\\" backing instruments. Unlike the edit that's here on the album which is completely artificial in sound with digital effects and lacks the passion and luster that's found in the live version of the song. The live version is bluesy with a slight Folk or country twang, Much like it's sister songs \\"Speechless\\" and \\"Honest Eyes\\". Points have been taken away for this artificial, 1-dimensional, digitized, solar effect studio version of \\"You And I\\". I hate it, perhaps it shall grow on me but It's not likely at all. It's the major reason I endured the wait for this album's arrival. So the fact that it's not here in the form that I'm most familiar with is completely upsetting and I do not approve of it in any way, shape or form.     JESUS' NAME AS A POP LYRIC?:    I'm also terribly overwhelemd with how loosely Lady Gaga uses the name JESUS in her songs. It's hard to tune into a song while she's using a name so sacred as if it's just another lyric on the track on album filled with such content. I find it disrespectful and offensive. I would love to edit the lyric/name \\"JESUS\\" out of the tracks \\"Bloody Mary\\" and \\"Black Jesus\\" with some type of software (that I'm sure exists) so that the songs are more pleasurable and acceptable to me. I can't help but tense up or feel some kind of 'wrong' or betrayal everytime I hear it. The songs are two of my favorites on the album which makes it even worse.     Nevertheless, I'm still excited about the album and I can't wait to see what her future projects will consist of. Even with some of the albums shortcomings I still gave her the benefit of the doubt by rating five stars. She's delivered the best collection of pop hooks, lyrics, rhtyhms and beats that I've heard in a very long time so It's difficult to complain.    HOPES AFTER THIS ALBUM:    In the future I would love for Lady Gaga to release more odd or bizarre material through extended plays. Things taylored more to her fans (A lot of 90's artists did this type of thing and it's perfect timing, being that the 90's will be making it's way back). Such as Live EP's with basic piano performances, medleys, Caberet or Jazz etc. A More theatrical/Showtuney side, Just more brief EP's to tide us over to the next drama. Something with the title \\"Let Me Entertain You...\\". I would love for her to go Ann Margret, Peggy Lee, Julie London on us all....     ---------Update--------- Friday, June 10, 2011    \\"Bloody Mary\\", the moodiest and most dramatic track on the LP. The vocals in this one are superior. I've been lured in by Lady Gaga's wicked vocal arrangement, Which is remeniscent of the female Jazz vocalists of the late 50's and 60's. Baretoned divas that sound like they sip coffee all day and puff smoke with long silk gloves that stop at the elbow. I'm also enchanted by the chilling background effects, Groups of men chanting like Monks. Very Haunting, It's easy to get lost in your own imagery while this plays...    I've also picked up in some tracks that there are church organs playing in the instrumentals of the songs. I love that! What a way to give it that old grungy haunting sound.
0385523394|3.0|Ten years ago, Piper Kerman was a young reckless, carefree recent college graduate.  Not knowing what else to with her life she made some decisions and those choices have finally caught up to her.  Ten years prior she delivered a suitcase of drug money to Europe never dreaming she'd ever be caught, especially after all this many years.<br /><br />Sentenced to 15-months in the Danbury, Connecticut prison for women she was now prisoner #111187-424, just one of the millions of people incarcerated in the United States each year.<br /><br />On February 4, 2004, 10 years after she committed her crime, Piper's boyfriend, Larry, drove her to the prison and kissed her goodbye for the final time.  Together they walked inside, took a seat and waited.  It wasn't long until a guard with a nasty scar down the side of her face and neck barked out: \\"KERMAN!\\" and thus began Piper's first day of incarceration where she'll meet women from all walks of life, experience her first strip search, and learns how to navigate her strange new world.<br /><br />Heartbreaking, hilarious, and at times enraging, Kerman's story offers a rare look into the lives of women in prison.

0316056863|5.0|My book club is reading this book right now and we couldn't be happier.  Many women had never seen \\"30 Rock\\" (sorry Tina, but you will be happy to know that they netflixed the DVDs and are now all caught up with it)  and were worried they wouldn't \\"get\\" this book.  Happy to report, they did, and they loved it.  Tina is insightful, oddly informative and absolutely hysterical.  I read this while my classroom of kiddos was taking a standardized test and actually laughed out loud in the middle of it, causing them to all look at me funny.  But then I thought, \\"oh that's just something Tina would have done.\\"  Love this book.  She is easy to relate to as a working mom, as a funny woman, and as someone you instantly wish were your friend.  A great, quirky, fun and fast read!!

When i bought it i was ecstatic because it was cheaper and better, adding on Amazon.com is a trustable place to purchase so many items. But the difference is the seller should actually put up what kind of power supply do these electronic items run on. And wether it is ok for asians or singaporeans to buy the item. I bought it without knowing about the power supply and now i cant use the item. I cant even get the power suply wire alone. Im a sitting Duck . So Asians please be aware. Thank you for reading.
0307463745|5.0|True to the spirit of \\"Getting Real\\", the authors divulge unconventional, yet practical, advice based on their own experiences.  Applicable to the small business owner/manager - but out-of-phase with B-school training, thus placing its concepts at odds with the way most of the business world works.  While I wholeheartedly agree with the book's philosophy, putting it into practice at the typical company will get you somewhere between odd looks and a pink slip.  At any rate, this is a quick and pleasurable read - with straight language and a light tone.  I yearn for the day when I can work in a business run the way of 37 Signals.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener is extremely easy to use, and works incredibly well.  I have tried everything from sharpening stones to a similar product with carbide and ceramic rods (rather than trapezoidal blocks as is the case with this sharpener), and nothing works as well.  The instructions are fairly simple to understand, although it was a bit hard to sift through the extraneous material on the back of the packaging (where the instructions are).  The serration sharpening instructions are a bit less clear than straight-blade sharpening, but that is the only downfall of this product.
B004IJZFP4|2.0|I was so looking forward to a remastered Teaser for the longest time, and a disc of outtakes, then I go see this is just alternate versions of a great album. All the numerous Tommy Bolin outtake CD's throughout the years have diluted the work of the great Mr.Bolin. With quantity over quality. Oh well, let me listen to the original Teaser ,make it louder , add bass on my stereo, pretend it sounds the best it can possibly sound.  Like the Cd cover though nice artwork
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Once again Amazon comes thru with a fantastic deal..99 Cents for a full album with no tax it's a beatifull thing!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I asked a few friends for recommendations of books to add to my Kindle. When someone suggested this book, I asked her if it would make me cry, reminding her that I was looking for something lighthearted at the moment. She warned me that I may shed a few tears, and smear some mascara, but she said it was well worth it. I'm 52% of the way through the book, and resent having to put it down! I can see were things are headed, but Enzo is such a great narrator for this story that I'm anxious to get back to reading! This is one of those books that I don't want to end.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Beautiful music! shes evolved so much as a misical artist, i love it,<br />those of you who want the the lady gaga from The Fame<br />please stop
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I don't think this album is the album of the decade or even Gaga's best, but it has fun songs and it is so outrageous and bold I'm hoping a listen (or maybe two) to the whole thing on a long flight coming up will keep me entertained.     I am mostly writing this review to respond to the crazies who are so angry at Amazon for taking longer than they want to more or less buy them what is probably the hottest digital product of the year.    I am perfectly happy to wait longer for the download given the fact that it was cheaper than any ONE of the songs on iTunes--and free 20 gigabytes of cloud storage with an album download is a cool bonus--if it is as easy to back up my music on the cloud as the Amazon MP3 downloader makes downloading music from their store (when the whole world isn't downloading Born This Way, that is) I think it will be useful.    All in all, another bold and useful deal from Amazon that saves me time and money. They are quickly becoming one of my favorite companies :)
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|It's frustrating (not to mention unhelpful) to read reviews written by people who expected this album to sound like another band's work and then were disappointed when it didn't. This album is fun and catchy and listenable all the way through, but none of the other tracks stand out the way \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" does. Neither do many songs written by anyone else, for that matter. That one is definitely something special, but give this album a couple listens and you'll see that all these songs are pretty great. Like anything truly original, it takes a listen or two to really understand, but once you do, you'll see that these guys have serious potential. I look forward to more from this band in the future.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Yesterday was my first day of this work out Level 1.  I was sweating and tired within 3 minutes.  I like her combo of abs, strength training and cardio.  I do find her cardio to be too minimal though, that is why I do an hour cardio at the gym first. I plan to do this work out 6 days a week with a break in between for a month to see the results.  I have 8 more pounds to lose and I will be happy...  People that are complaining that it is too fast that it is too hard - please grow up and stop whining...  If it is too fast for you, there is this small button on the DVD remote that says Pause...you can pause it for 30 secs and take a breather, and then continue on.  Your results won't suffer with your small break, I promise you that. If you cannot do the same squats and lunges, do a modified version and go half way; it is still working out! I have bad knees and bad wrists, and I am doing a modified version of push ups and squats, and still feel my muscles burning.    One thing I do wish for is that the Amazon description of the product would include that the weights are needed. If it weren't for me browsing through the reviews, I would have never known that.  Anyway, good luck!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Got it working with a quick driver download, which Win7 found for me. Now back to my regularly scheduled world domination.
0740797719|5.0|I love this book! I've recommended it all my artistic friends. As a self-taught artist, I tend to collect a lot of art books, and this one has to be the best one I've received!<br />It's incredible how easily I'm able to follow it. There's few technical terms, and their meanings are readily apparent. There's also no complicated formulas or theories that turn the two subjects, color and light, into an intellectual ramble.<br />Every time I cover something new, I get giddy over how I understand it!<br />However, this isn't a how-to book. There's no step-by-steps, or such. This isn't going to teach you how to paint. Rather, it'll teach you how to look at colors and lighting in such a way that you'll see things different, a new way that allows you to observe them properly.<br />As with all learning books, you get as much as you put in. For example:<br />On page 28 you are told, \\"On a clear day...the shadows are darker and bluer relative to the sun. As more clouds appear in the sky, shadows become grayer.\\"<br />Then, \\"The blue sky color gives the top of the shoulder a greenish quality in the shadow. Where the sleeve drops from the shoulder, the yellow shirt picks up warm colors from the ground and appears more orange.\\"<br />Going with the past section of how sunny days have blue shadows, it's like, 'Oh, that makes sense!'<br />Then my mind immediately jumps to, 'Well, if the shadows are greenish on a yellow shirt, they'd be more violet on a red shirt, and possibly more lilac on a cloudy day.'<br />I highly recommend Colors and Light, and it's so affordable, too! There's also a second book by this author, [[ASIN:0740785508 Imaginative Realism: How to Paint What Doesn't Exist]].<br />As for the book itself, it's made really well, with heavy gloss paper that's not too shiny, and very durable. Oh, but don't leave it in a really hot car or place, as this type of paper/material tends to warp if left in such conditions for too long.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|This is a great Cd. I have been waiting months for its release. I've bought six copies so far. Every song is meaningful and great.
1582701709|5.0|The most amazing book I have ever read. Totally absorbing. I have read it twice already. Absolutely compelling. Everyone should read this!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|All I can say is that I cried when I got to the last page because I became so in love with the story and the characters in the book that i did not want it to end.  Please Ms. Grisshom continue on please let us know what happens to Lavinia and all the others in the book. I loved this book, it will be forever a favorite and I read at lest 30 books a year.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|It seems to be Sensationalism for Sensationalism's sake. Boring. And the whole `offensive religious' lyrics thing is not even relevant. I mean, come on, Obama's president now and gay marriage is almost legal. It's not the Reagan/Bush eras anymore. But I guess it goes along with her whole \\"see, I can do anything I want\\" stuff she has been up to lately. This album could have been an evolution of her talent, if only the whole album could have felt like the only 3 good songs on it: Government Hooker, ScheiBe, and Heavy Metal Lover. The other songs sound like very unpleasant noise and are not enjoyable. Lady Gaga is wildly talented and I will watch and wait for her to return to expressing her true talent, instead of asking for attention.
0896762629|5.0|I was very happy with this book as it gave lots of detailed information and had lots of photos of period pieces to really make clear what was important.
0307279189|5.0|This is a very gripping book that will completely change the way you view your body and the sport of running. I recommend it to anyone who even is thinking about running!
B004NCLKJG|5.0|None of the previous reviewers has offered much information to supplement their gushing praise for this broadcast of Die Walkure from Feb. 24, 1968. In small print the booklet informs us that this was part of Herbert von Karajan's ambitious but ill-fated Ring at the Met, which accounts for the presence of great voices in every part. Critics and audiences objected to Karajan's dimly lit, abstract staging, and various conflicts (including a moment in rehearsal when Birgit Nilsson broke a strand of pearls in her frustration with the conductor -- if I remember right) led to its termination of the conductor's participation after the staging of Rheingold and Walkure.<br /><br />But in hindsight one can see what a gigantic leap forward this production represented for the Met, then saddled with routine Wagner conductors (at best), musty staging, and a scrappy orchestra. The Levine era was just around the corner; still, Karajan brought international standards to the pit. there is a broadcast of Walkure from 1969 where he actually conducts. Here we get a serviceable substitute in the Croatian conductor Berislav Klobucar, then in his mid-Forties; he was conducting at Bayreuth during this period, also, but his leadership cannot be said to substitute for Karajan, even though orchestral execution is more secure than the norm for that era at the Met.<br /><br />The sound is goodish mono, with the voices caught close up and realistically. The orchestra isn't too recessive, but they are secondary in the engineering and sound rather dry -- don't expect sumptuousness.  As for the singers, Vickers and Stewart reprise Siegmund and Wotan from Karajan's contemporary Ring cycle on DG; as Brunnhilde and Fricka, Nilsson and Ludwig arrive from Ring cycles under Solti and Bohm. At the time Hans Hotter was nearing the end of his career as a vocally viable Wotan, the other candidate at the time being Theo Adam. As a fan of Stewart's young-sounding, fierce Wotan, I'm grateful that he steps in -- for the 1969 broadcast the Wotan was a more pedestrian Adam, whose reputation in Wagner baffles me. Leonie Rysanek had sung Sieglinde under many conductors, . The Hunding is Karl Ridderbusch, a Karajan favorite who went on to sing Sachs under him; here he is vocally impressive but rather lacking in ferocity. By any standard this is a cast for the ages, and it satisfies old hands who regretted at the time that Karajan and Solti had divvied up the greatest Bayreuth veterans, leaving both their recorded Ring cycles sounding incomplete (but with Solti getting the best of the lot, all told).<br /><br />In the end, if you don't mind monaural sound and Klobucar's fairly ordinary conducting, this historical Walkure is self-recommending and augurs well for all the Met broadcasts that Sony has been allowed to release, after decades when the Met zealously guarded its recording rights in the U.S.ast the Wotan was a more pedestrian Adam, whose reputation in Wagner baffles me. Leonie Rysanek had sung Sieglinde under many conductors, . The Hunding is Karl Ridderbusch, a Karajan favorite who went on to sing Sachs under him; here he is vocally impressive but rather lacking in ferocity.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|On Amazon and the cloud player: I appreciate the great price for the entire album. I am still working with customer support to complete my download but all the songs are in my cloud player now. I love Amazon's website and the idea of the cloud music storage system. Every time I use a horrible storefront website like Dell or bad software like itunes I appreciate Amazon more. However, I bet in a year from now Amazon is going to have a mess with this \\"free\\" year of 20GB turning into a $20/year bill.<br /><br />On Lady Gaga and Born this Way: I really like the song \\"You and I\\".  This is not Madonna like. There is a Queen hook in there but it's not Queen like either.  I understand the comparisons to Madonna but I believe that Lady Gaga is a better musician. I love to hear Lady Gaga sit and play piano and sing. There is a lot of talent beyond her being a student of pop culture.<br /><br />I do not think this idea of Lady Gaga encouraging acceptance of one's genuine self is a little thing.  I think there are obviously lots of young people who long to be accepted as they work to be different. It's a paradox. Ultimately Lady Gaga is a genius. You don't get this popular without a mad plan and a good brain. If part of her evil master plan is to be the champion of a generation of GLBT and otherwise odd ball youth then I say good on her.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|Unique & Original? Not soo much, but its still very watchable and easy to get into. I found the cinematography quite similar to Gaspar Noe's \\"Enter The Void\\" but still not quite as mesmerizing as Noe's work. The colors were bright and quite nice to look at I might add. The zoom motion that the film begins with and continues to do throughout the film is what I found most similar to Enter the Void. Anyone who enjoys watching trippy types of films (i.e. pi, requiem for a dream, eyes wide shut, fight club, donnie darko) I feel you'll enjoy this one as well.<br /><br />Entertaining? Yes, I'd say so..The movie picks right up and does not really let go of you once its started. The story is interesting, the visuals are nice to look at and what Cooper's doing is pretty sweet most of the time. There are thrills, suspense, fights and all. There is a hint of a romantic relationship with Bradley Cooper's girlfriend, but not much side stories in this film, which could do both good and bad to the film. You be the one to decide how you feel about it..<br /><br />Does it leave you hanging? In my opinion, yes. I feel the movie realized it was pushing an hour and forty five minutes and that they should wrap it up soon. I honestly would've rather had an extra ten or fifteen minutes so the story could be cleared up. I felt once De Niro and Cooper were starting to collide, the film was over. I really don't prefer to add spoilers to my reviews therefore I won't start, but if you go see the film after reading my comment I'd say just keep in mind...\\"Does this provide adequate information and answer everything\\" Who cares, Go see the movie..<br /><br />I hope I've been helpful...<br /><br />-Cam
B001P06GX4|5.0|Great game.  Really makes you think.  The kids and the grownups all like it.  Even my kindergarten student can play.  Some pieces seem like they could break rather easily.  Also if you lose 1 piece you are out of luck.
0316069353|3.0|The story starts well but it is a stretch trying to put this story into the perspective of the current mortgage crisis.  After it begins, it is very slow going with very little in surprise twists.
B004K4AVAG|1.0|If I could give this -10 stars, I would.<br /><br />What do we have here? The same old generic beats, same old, same old.<br /><br />In the hard rock/heavy metal world, most people still listen to and talk about Black Sabbath's debut album in reverential tones. It was released FORTY ONE YEARS AGO. Why do we talk about it? Because it was an honest, uncompromising work of unparalleled power and originality. It stands as a relevant moment in music history.<br /><br />The same goes for the jazz masters. The body of work left behind by Ellington, Monk, Coltrane, Jaco, and Miles (to name but a few) is as fresh and relevant today as when they were active.<br /><br />Can the same be said of this repetitive, derivative pile of bubblegum? Hardly.<br /><br />The clock is ticking, Ms. Germanotta. Your 15 minutes are almost up. You WILL fade away soon.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Hi. I just wanted to say that I purchased the full .99 cent album tonight (9pm MST) and it worked beautifully. Don't let the earlier reviews scare you.    By the way folks...I understand your disappointment, but things happen. Systems crash. I'm sure the demand was OVERWHELMING...even more than expected. The best tested systems fail big time.     The CD itself is worth any dilemma. I have no worry that even if my download did not work that amazon.com would've made it right. Why the desire to jump ship after only one error?     All I know is that I am jamming to my new Lady Gaga cd that I only paid LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR for and it is all because of Amazon!
0316056863|3.0|More than anything else, Bossypants suffers from high expectations.  Bossypants is by no means \\"bad\\", it's just not as \\"OMGthisisthefunniestthingi'veeverreadever!\\" good as everyone says it is.  The book is somewhat disjointed and while some of the essays ramble on for too long, others seem to stop abruptly.  It has a memoir-ish quality, but those looking for juicy insights into Fey's personal life will be disappointed.  I found the second half of the book to be more interesting, as that is where she talks about more about SNL, 30 Rock, and her now infamous Sarah Palin impersonation.  Is this book funny?  Sure.  Is it hilarious? Not so much.    3.5/5
0307272702|5.0|This is not another rehash of the low-carb diet. Gary explains why our bodies do what they do to make us fat and how we can healthily overcome it. Once you know what certain foods and sugars are doing to us, it is much, much, easier to avoid them knowing the damage these substances are causing.    I had to re-read some of the info to fix it in my mind & understand it, but well worth it.
0385733577|1.0|I'm a big lover of this genre...and while the overall idea of this book is a good one, reading it made me genuinely upset because the writing is so bad.  Did anyone edit this thing?  He repeats himself constantly, the characters use dialogue that is very VERY unbelievable, he makes endless silly pop culture references (maybe to appeal to teenagers?  I still would have been annoyed with that, even as a teen)...it reads like a book that was written BY a young person and not FOR young people.  I wanted to like it, but in the end it's like a crappy version of American Gods.  Just go read American Gods instead.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Just finished this book Sunday. My full appreciation goes out to Mr. Luttrell for sharing his loss and triumph with those who admire our military heroes.  Our military gets far too much blame and not near enough credit for keeping our country safe and protecting those who can not or will not protect themselves. This book provides great insight into perseverance, hope, faith, and brotherhood.  Thank you for sharing.
B004Q1FDHO|1.0|Having the same problem as others. The game freezes up my phone every time I play it. I hope they release a fix b/c it is a fun game to pass the time but if a fix does not come soon I will need to uninstall. It is not worth the headache of rebooting the phone every 3 minutes.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|The movie was fine but the product overall was disappointing.  I preordered this movie but others had this movie ( that went out and bought) days before I received mine. The price of my preordered movie offset this somewhat, but not enough for the enjoyment and the excitement of the kids who's friends already had and watched. There is more but discussion with Amazon on other issues was taken care of satisfactorily.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I dont watch Dr. Who, but it made my girlfriend happy! I suggest it for anyone who likes the series! Its a cool thing to own.
B004K4AUZW|2.0|Was expecting something different. Whats with all the preachy Jesus stuff? Some of the songs are annoying and don't really go anywhere. Saying random words because they rhymed over disjointed beats isn't much fun in my books.
B001GQ3DXS|1.0|If the main character is a naval officer, then some research into at least -- and   I do mean least -- some understanding of the character's life and profession would be warranted.  A few pages into the book, I became aware the author was taking gross liberties with even the meanest understanding of the profession . By page 25, I knew she had done no research and attempted no understanding of it at all.      How can anyone decide to write from such a character's perspective and make no effort to know the basics of her character?  It's an insult to the reader to make so little effort.
B004OBQDH0|5.0|The DVD is the normal 1-disc version and the Dobby bokend is as pictured.  The bookend is not very heavy, so it would be fine to use with DVDs (as shown) or lighter books.  The black base he stands on does not go far under in the back, so it would probably not be suitable for use with heavier books.  Dobby is probably about 6\\" tall.  I am very satisfied with this purchase as it was only a few bucks more than the DVD alone & I love the little house elf.  If you want all the extra interview stuff or bluray go with another version, but the extra novelty was worth it to me.  The special features on this DVD include additional scenes and language subtitles only, and it is in widescreen format.  Frankly I would anticipate some sort of collector pack being released when the last movie(deathly Hallows part II) comes out, so I will likely get all the years on bluray then.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I'm really enjoying Lady Gaga's new album, and am grateful for the $0.99 deal that Amazon.com offered us!  I cannot believe how some people act over the download issues.  Amazon.com probably did not anticipate such large demand for this album.  We're all human and make mistakes.  Calm down.  If Amazon.com honors your $0.99 purchase and you get it in a reasonable amount of time (tomorrow even), then I don't see what the big deal is.  People amaze me these days. >.>    Anyway, I especially love Born This Way, Judas, Edge of Glory, Highway Unicorn, and Fashion of His Love! Those are my favorite songs from this album. ^^y
1439107955|2.0|This book takes a fantastic approach to cancer and muddles it with painfully verbose prose and lack of structure. This book was one of the most painful reads I have come across in a long time. It isn't worth it.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|This two disc album is just great music and presentation. Disc one approximately 2 hours is slower paced with great music and performances. Disc two is phenominal with audience participation upbeat and fast past. You will not be disappointed in this purchase.
B002ZG974W|5.0|Watching how babies around the world interact with ther families   you learn that they all need care and love no matter where they   are from.  Great DVD to show even in different cultures babies  are all the same.
B003UESJHO|1.0|In order to download the movie I had to buy the movie first.  Seemed odd.  Then when I tried to download it, AMAZON told me they could not dowload it because I was not in a country that AMAZON was permitted to dowload to my machine (I was in my apartment in Paris).  So I was charged anyway, with an incipid apology.    By the way, after this awful experience I tried iTunes.  They didnt have that prohibition.  Score:  Amazon 0 iTunes 1
B004E2XAFW|3.0|I'm a huge fan of WT. Love their previous albums, especially Mother Earth. But this album comes nothing close to their previous albums. A few good tracks but that's about it. I was bored after 15 minutes. And Fire and Ice is by far their worst song.
B001DHXT1G|1.0|So why would you sell the game \\"New\\" if someone clearly opened it and took the digital copy and put a poor excuse for plastic wrapping on it? Should've just bought it at target. Jokes on me I guess.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I grew up watching \\"The Sound of Music\\" at least once a year on television.  It was one of our family traditions to watch it together, and we soon learned the songs by heart.  When storms would roll in, we would sing \\"My Favorite Things\\" together.  When we saw beautiful scenery while traveling, we would sing \\"The Hills Are Alive...\\", and when we said goodbye and felt silly, we would sing \\"So Long, Farewell\\" to one another.  Yes, the songs are great, and this musical as a whole is wonderful!  The Easter Bunny just delivered this DVD to our house last month, and I can't wait to sit down with my your family of three kids and share with them the joy that comes from watching this movie.  Hopefully they will have some of the same great memories of this film that I have in my heart.  This is a perfect addition to your movie collection!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Thank you so much for such Amazon for an incredible vaule and thank you GAGA for such an awesome album!!
0345529057|1.0|Just throwing in my $0.02. It's reduculous that the paperback edition (which costs money to manufacture/ship/etc) is almost half the price of the electronic edition.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|The best Fast Five movie since the original.  I've never seen so many car crashes in my life.  Loved seeing all the original cast members and some new additions.  It was a thrill ride from beginning to end and then some.  It wasn't just action and no substance either.  The story was well thought out and very original for being the fifth movie in the series.  I didn't go in expecting but more of the same from before but I got much more.  Go see this movie or at least buy it on DVD when it comes out.  You'll be kicking yourself later if you don't.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I had seen trailers and was expecting some garbage, boring movie. Even the cover for the movie didn't catch me. Anyway, somehow I added it to my wishlist. I got the movie and months later finally decided to try it. I had been expecting worse, so when I saw that it was almost two hours long, I sighed. I wanted to make it quick and watch some other movie. I had been skipping a first few parts in the movie, because I found them uninteresting, boring. Because of pathetic little boy and his miserable life. Anyway I skipped a little in the movie. Until the girl came into the picture. Then it just caught me. I was watching it with questions on my mind, I was hooked by how good the movie actually was. It was thrilling and entertaining and bit of drama as well. I was  upset when it actually ended. I wanted to see a little more. But I am amazed and surprised and pleased by the whole plot of the movie. I didn't expect to see that, but that was just wow, nice work!
B004A7OQKY|5.0|I really like this workout.  My endurance while pregnant is somewhat less than before and this was just right for me - moderately paced but definitely still a real workout.  It's a comfort knowing that all of it is safe and not having to skip any sections as I've been doing when using non-pregnancy workouts.  Great for both toning and stretching and has built in water and pee breaks. :)
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I initially missed this show and later followed season 1 and 2 via netflix and I was hooked to this show. In 3 days I watched season 1 & 2 and another 2 days and 2 more seasons were done. I really loved this series!! Great acting, grand sets and grand costumes. Probably this was the only show which kept me interested during the whole time and not to mention reading of wiki pages. It is not that accurate (as per wiki) but damn close.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I don't think I could add anything to Jon Broxton's excellent review if I sat in front of the computer for a month.  So let me just add my name to those who think this is one of the finest scores ever written for an animated movie.  Maybe the best I've ever heard.  A good friend of mine, a bona fide movie soundtrack dweeb (and I mean that as a high compliment), told me he did something last year he hadn't done in eons.  Immediately after seeing the movie, he went straight to the nearest music store and purchased the soundtrack.  I bought it a short time later based solely on his recommendation - I hadn't seen the movie yet - and I can only say his glowing review of the music was an understatement.  It's magnificent, the best score I've heard since Howard Shore's work for the LOTR trilogy.  I wasn't surprised HTTYD didn't win the Oscar for best original score - they hardly ever get it right.  But I have no qualms saying it was far superior to anything else from 2010.    One more thought:  I'm glad this is on CD.  Had it been on vinyl I would have worn it out several times.
B00005M989|4.0|Back in the `80s and `90s Prince was number 1. And this proves it. Absolutely great music from a great artist.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I know many of us had some technical difficulties in being able to download the album.  However, as someone who finally had success, I can now review the actual album.    This is a great album, with a lot of different types of sound.  There's something for everyone on this album.
B00005QDW5|4.0|I have never been a Pink Floyd fan. Actually their only songs I have liked this far are Another brick in the wall and Money. I think it takes probably more than a few times to listen this album before I can really say what I like about it. But it sounds interesting.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Nothing in this sales experiment worked.  I had partial fail messages all day long on my hardwired 100M Ethernet connection.  I may have bought the album for $0.99 but spent the $12.00 savings relaunching the mp3 downloader time and time again. At the end of the day, the songs aren't visible in iTunes though I seem to be able to get them to play one by one by doing a hard drive search for them.  Not exactly Internet Age.
B002BW6S7Y|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorite albums. Every song on here makes one want to ride into battle.  And for those interested in Norse mythology, it follows the great story of Oden or Odin.  Must have for Epic metal fans and viking lovers.
B000W74EQC|2.0|I saw Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at the movies.  I bought the DVD as soon as it was released and watched it a couple of times before loaning it out.  The DVD was lost so I ordered one from Amazon.  I looked forward to receiving it and was anxious to sit down and watch this much-enjoyed movie.  I was sadly disappointed to note that several scenes were missing.  It became apparent that the video I got from Amazon was an edited version.  The Amazon description of the movie did indicate that it was an edited version.  If so, I wouldn't have purchased it.  I have since researched other stores and found the full length movie.[[ASIN:B000W74EQC Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Widescreen Edition)]]
B004MYOX9E|4.0|Amon Amarth is my favorite band so I have conflicting views on this album. Though there are the same basic foundations, there are some new elements to this album.  For instance, some riffs that sound like they have been influenced by Dethklok.  Another new element to accentuate their epic form, is a new symphonic intro to a song, with violins and such. And a third element is a couple songs almost have a \\"bro down\\" hardcore style breakdowns.  You interpret for yourself whether or not those are good changes, I myself find the first and third iritating, but the second was a welcomed change.
B0034G4ORM|1.0|Total Independance Day rip-off, short on Aliens and why do we have to feel we are riding on the shoulders of the people in the movie? Set the camera down and let me see what's going on!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I was actually a bit unsure about this album, as I wasn't too into \\"Born this way\\" when it was first released. I decided to give it a try anyway, and I'm actually glad I did. It seems like a combination between '80s pop, lots of techno, and a wee bit of eurotrash. It's censored, of course, although there isn't much cursing in this album so it's not distracting--or, perhaps, Lady GaGa decided to exploit the censor beep into her techno beats, but I think maybe I'm being too hopeful with that. It's definitely different in sound from her previous albums, although I think it's a logical next step in the progression her music seems to be making, so if you're expecting the same-ol'-same-ol', you may be disappointed. Approach it with an open mind, however, and I think you may like it, too. This is really a pretty enjoyable album, especially if you like electronic music.    The digital booklet, by the way, is really neat. It's basically just the insert that comes with when you buy a CD, so I really appreciate that she thought to include that with her MP3 release when she didn't have to.    ETA: Now that I've listened to the album a good dozen or so times, I LOVE it! I have also thought of a good taste gauge: if you like the music used for DDR games, especially the older ones, you will probably love this album also. (Not that you won't like it if you don't like DDR, but that's what it reminds me of a little.)
B000A6T1JU|1.0|I love The Warriors. I hate this cut. As many have mentioned in great detail, the \\"Ultimate Director's Cut\\" includes idiotic comic book cutting/editing/graphics. It ads nothing to the original version and takes much away. Therefore, if you want to buy The Warriors, do not buy this version.  I'm going to have to buy this movie again b/c I hate this DVD that much.
0142410322|4.0|Overall Review:  \\"Great  whistling whangdoodles!\\"  What do you do when you find yourself staring down a Vermicious Knid? Or you've taken too much Wonka-Vite and ended up in Minusland?  Or perhaps you just want to have a little chat in Martian with the President of the United States while standing in a giant Space Hotel?  You call up Willy Wonka, of course!  Who else can think of these things but Roald Dahl?  In this second installment of his famous Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, we get to ride along with Charlie and his whole family (including the bed!) as Mr. Wonka gives them the ride of their lives in his amazing Glass Elevator!  Roald Dahl's humor and imagination are magnificently twisted and appeal to children and adults alike.  You can't help but laugh out loud at times and ask yourself, \\"Where did he come up with this???\\"  I love the Oompa Loompa songs that are funny and still teach a lesson.  And if my children were excited and decided to copy Mr. Wonka's exclamations of joy, I would be ok with that!  Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />Content Review:<br /><br />PROFANITY: few mild instances<br /><br />VIOLENCE: one mild instance<br /><br />SEXUAL CONTENT: None<br /><br />MATURE THEMES: Mild<br /><br />RECOMMENDED AGE GROUP: 9+<br /><br />There were a few minor swear words.  Less than 5, I think.  Some characters are pretty cranky and call others many creative names, but mostly it was funny and didn't involve crude `potty' humor.  The only violence had to do with some space creatures eating people and attacking ships, but it wasn't graphic.  There is no sexual content at all.  As far as mature themes, the segments with the space creatures may be frightening and intense to younger people (although, my four year old thought that was his favorite part).  Really quite an enjoyable book and clean enough to read out loud with my kids!  `Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator' is a Squeaky Clean read for Ages 9+!<br /><br />This review was written by Emily<br />A Squeaky Clean Reads Book Reviewer<br /><br />To see more fantastic books on review, visit us at squeakycleanreads!stic books on review, visit us at squeakycleanreads!
B004SQS9FA|5.0|Surely the best thing I've heard so far in 2011. When it finished the first time, I had to start it over.     The album builds unlike any other I've heard. It was almost a shock to hear Bloom the second time because I had been moved so far away from it for what seemed like an eternity by the time I got thru Separator. Of course, I will admit that I had to listen to Give Up the Ghost 3 times on my \\"first\\" trip through the songs. After that, I was certain that Separator would be a disappointment. Well...I've been wrong before and will again.     I've read a few reviews that talk about listening to it hundreds of times. I can see that's where I am headed also.     going to go listen now.     EXCELLENT ALBUM.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Beyotch can pen a hook, that's all I can say. I listened to it once and wasn't blown away. Five minutes later I was in the bathroom singing \\"Americano.\\" What's up with that? I don't like four on the floor dance music but gave it a .99 cent chance and now I see she does have talent and is quite cleverly tapping into our cultural zeitgeist with baby talk choruses and over the top social commentary using her body as a part of the art. Rock on, Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I haven't actually read the book yet - just downloaded it on the Kindle. I debated whether to get the Kindle version because I have heard there is a full chapter done in \\"PowerPoint\\" which was almost impossible to read on the Kindle. I decided to risk downloading it because I found that that full chapter is also available on the author's website, so I figured I'd just read it there if needed. I skipped ahead immediately to chapter 12 on the Kindle to see how bad it is, and it's actually completely fine. It's not even the slightest bit difficult to read. Maybe this was a recent change made my the publisher -- I'm not sure. So, if you were scared off by the bad reviews of the Kindle version, it appears to no longer be a problem.
B004SQS9FA|5.0|I don't get what so many are griping about. This is exactly what I need from Radiohead right now. I heard it once, and wanted to hear it again. With a good set of headphones you can really appreciate all the layers, stereo separation and almost inaudible noises in the background. I don't know, it transports me to somewhere else. I love it.
0307454541|2.0|Not as good as advertised. Took too long to get into characters. Didn't really care about what happened to any of them!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|It took 5 hours to download the album.  I guess I should be thrilled that Amazon downloaded three mp3s of each song to my iTunes library.
B004K4AUZW|2.0|Upon first listen, I found myself hitting the forward button on to the next song.  The cd contains songs which are loud on production and offer little in the form of memorable, sing-a-long pop lyrics.  This is dissappointing because we associate Gaga with fun, danceable, sing-a-long hits.  She has suddenly gone Euro-Underground with heavy 80s synths reminescent of Pet Shop Boys, The Cure, Blue Oyster, and a little religious iconography and references ala Madonna.  She even goes worldly on us by singing a chorus in German on \\"Scheiss\\", and a little bit of Romania-Gypsy-Spanish on \\"Americano\\".  I struggle to find one song on the disc which will be an instant hit.  Even the lead single, \\"Born this Way\\" has taken some time to grow on listeners merely by the heavy airplay it receives.  And \\"Judas\\" - while appropriate for an underground club with its driving bassline - is difficult to sing along to.  I think my favorite song is \\"Government Hooker\\" - it contains a little bit of that Gaga sassiness and would play well in the clubs.      All in all, I'm afraid Gaga is experimenting here just to experiment and say to the world, I've made it and I can do what I want - perhaps at the expense of losing a certain fanbase.  I would compare this CD to what Alanis Morrissette did when she began her experimental phase and lost her fans.  Sometimes fame makes artists experiement too much in the name of \\"growing artistically.\\"  Hopefully, the remixes will come out soon and make these songs more radio friendly.     I still respect Gaga as an artist and performer and agree she's one of the best out there right now.  I enjoy how she changes the live versions of these songs for performances, and often enjoy the live version better.  I guess I'll wait for the next disc!
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I really would like a serious stabilizer like a GlideCam or a Steadicam and don't be fooled -- this product won't offer a stabilizing effect approaching those products.        However the good news is that this is an excellent product for the price.  Much higher quality than I expected (nice packaging, nice finish).  It is made primarily of plastic so I certainly wouldn't be particularly comfortable using this with larger and heavier SLR & lens combinations like a Canon 5dMKII w/ a 70-200 F/2.8 lens.  However I've used this with a high-end consumer Panasonic camcorder as well as a Canon 7D w/ 17-50 F/2.8 lens (moderately heavy) and had no problems or concerns whatsoever.      For lots of video shooting situations I'm finding that this is a handy way to wield a camera/camcorder.  Lots of creative possibilities, etc.  It's also sometimes just very convenient to be able to put a nice camera down on the ground without it actually touching the ground.  Kind of like a mini-tripod on the go.  Handy and useful accessory!!!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I would love to listen to this album I ordered 10 hours ago, but it still hasn't downloaded and I have yet to listen to it.      Add to this, that Amazon has yet to reach out to the affected buyers.    Amazon, if you don't have the infrastructure to support the high demand a deal like this creates, then don't offer the deal.  I'll think twice before purchasing music from you again.      This entire situation has been a total customer service failure.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I cant believe she put her CD on sale for 99 cents!  The only reason I'm rating this a 4 is because its not uncensored :/  The album is different(STILL AWESOME) but it wouldn't be gaga if it wasn't.
B002ZG994U|5.0|I loved this movie, perfect mix of action, suspense and humor.  Everything is over the top, but that is what I wanted.
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|It's been over a year since \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" was first playing on a few of the stations I listen to, and it's finally a part of an album. You have no idea how happy I am about that.  What's even better is that the whole album is pure *awesome*. If I were a more musically-minded reviewer, I'd go into detail of each song's sound and the overall effect of the album, but I'm the other kind of artist and mostly my opinion condenses down to \\"amazing.\\" I've been listening to this on repeat all day, and I've yet to get bored. I initially tried to list the particular songs I loved, but it soon became clear that I enjoy the entire album in a way I very seldom do.  If you liked \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" and/or \\"Helena Beats\\" & \\"Houdini\\" from the EP, you definitely want to download the rest of the songs.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|What is wrong with some of you? This is an incredible deal, a fun album, and a great experiment. Rating this poorly ONLY reflects on you. Here we have Amazon trying to give you something cool and because you can't wait a few moments you get pissy? Yet, some of you same people are willing to stand in an iPhone line for a few days (you know who you are).
B0041TM5OU|5.0|This 180g version of Kind of Blue is my new reference disc. It is dead quiet on my system and truly taxes my gear. Imaging is great, allowing you to pin point where the individual musicians are. Cymbals sound great. This is a must buy for Miles Davis fans.
0345529057|1.0|I bought the paperback set because of the low price, but will have to re-purchase these books in Kindle form. This many words should never be packed in a volume this small.  Don't waste your money.  Go ahead and buy the Kindle version or a hardcover edition.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I'll preface this review by saying that this is the first Lady Gaga album I purchased.  I've followed her singles releases with some interest; this is rare, as I don't care much for modern pop/dance music.  But Lady Gaga's songs had a spark of originality, a creative passion that was intoxicating.<br /><br />I'd heard both \\"Born This Way\\" and \\"Judas\\" before purchasing this album.  Both songs are enjoyable, though the title track's up-front message kind of undermines its honesty; there's a lot to be said for subtlety.  Which, granted, isn't exactly a trait we associate with Lady Gaga.  Still, the majority of the songs on this album are forgettable--they blend into the milieu of pop/dance music.  Even when she reaches for something new and original, we end up underwhelmed: there's supposed to be deeper meaning in the phrase \\"I am my hair,\\" but for the life of me, I don't associate philosophy with highlights.<br /><br />Not to say there aren't a few standouts.  \\"Marry the Night\\" is almost operatic.  \\"ScheiBe\\" is interesting, if only because I like hearing people rap in languages they can't speak.  \\"Bloody Mary\\" is a slow-burning gem, easily one of the best here; think of all the connotations of the phrase \\"Bloody Mary\\" (religious, historical, alcoholic), and combine them together.  \\"Bad Kids\\" is kind of nice, if not mind-blowing.  My personal favorite would have to be \\"You and I,\\" the Gaga self-penned tribute to both Nebraska and power ballads.  It's perhaps the one song on here where she doesn't try to hard, and just lets the music take her where it wants.<br /><br />This isn't to say that BORN THIS WAY is without merits.  It's a catchy pop album; note the three stars.  But it's not as creatively brilliant as some of her earlier stuff.  Nor, honestly, as danceable or memorable.  It's Gaga watered down, which is still worth a listen or two.
0545123291|4.0|This book didn't grab me like the first in the series, but it was still really good.  I have to agree with the other reviewers, the extra characters POV did take away from Sam and Grace.  The story was still really good and very well written.  I can't wait to read Forever.
B0051QJ83S|3.0|I love Gaga, I really do. Her breakthrough album was great pop music, and the Fame Monster tracks featured one of the best pop tracks of all time: Bad Romance.    Having said that, this album falls a bit short. It's worth a listen, there are glimmers of Gaga definitely maturing as an artist and experimenting. In fact, one or two albums from now will probably be out-of-sight.    High points: Some interesting vocal choices, some cool instrument arrangements, occasional flashes of lyrical brilliance.  Low points: The other 90% of the lyrics, and the fact some of it was clearly recorded on a Casio keyboard from 1984.    Looking forward to future attempts!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|All you people who say she's not good anymore, try really listening to her music! And you must STOP saying it's made to be commercially successful! I mean have you heard Katy Perry, Rihanna, Britney Spears and Justin Bieber songs? They're disgusting and yet you buy them!
0316069353|4.0|I must admit, I didn't realize that Connelly had developed a series of the Mickey Haller character until I cam across this book - having missed the two in between this and The Lincoln Lawyer.    But since LL in my opinion was his best book since The Poet, I can easily see why he's been keen to develop the character. A good solid effort all round. Connelly in fact made it into my top ten all time best legal/crime thrillers list with The Poet, but maybe I need to do another list covering the past 5 years.    I share one past reader's concerns about the Kindle pricing: far too high, and obviously just there to protect the hardback pricing. This becomes all the more accute when you realize that some in my top-ten all time best are on Kindle at a fraction of that price. And Past Imperfect, because it's never appeared to a US audience before, is in essence like a brand new read for them.     1. To Kill a Mocking Bird - Harper Lee. 2. Past Imperfect - John Matthews. 3. Mystic River - Dennis Lehane. 4. Presumed Innocent - Scott Turow. 5. The Client - John Grisham. 6. Tell No One - Harlan Coben. 7. Silence of the Lambs - Thomas Harris. 8. The Emperor of Ocean Park - Stephen L. Carter. 9. No Time for Goodbye - Linwood Barclay. 10. The Poet - Michael Connelly.

B004KWVDWI|4.0|Papillon (drama, biography, crime)<br />Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner<br />Starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman<br /><br />Warner Bros.   1973   151 min   Rated PG   Released May 24, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />Papillon is a film I hadn't seen for approximately 30 years, so I was eagerly awaiting this Blu-ray release. I was a different person back then and my tastes have evolved a great deal since first seeing the film. What was a masterpiece in my memory is now simply a good film.<br /><br />The story is set in a prison in French Guiana and is based on the true story of Henri Charriere. He was known as Papillon because of the butterfly tattooed on his chest. Steve McQueen plays the role and does an excellent job.<br /><br />The other key character is Louis Dega (Hoffman), who is a forger and not well-equipped to fend for himself in prison. He hires Papillon for protection and promises to finance Papillon's escape attempt. It proves to be a wise decision.<br /><br />On reaching the prison, the new inmates are given a welcome speech. They are told that their first escape attempt would result in two years of solitary confinement being added to their sentence. A second attempt would mean five more years in solitary. Extreme cases would result in death by guillotine.<br /><br />Nearby islands contain prison work camps and Dega and Papillon are sent there. The swampy conditions are full of natural dangers such as crocodiles and snakes. Any escapees are hunted by former prisoners for a reward. Papillon makes an early attempt and is quickly recaptured, resulting in the promised two years in solitary confinement.<br /><br />The rations in solitary are barely enough to support human life and Dega bribes guards to smuggle Papillon extra food. When this is discovered, the warden wants the name of the person sending him food. Papillon refuses and is put on half rations. This is equivalent to a death sentence, but Papillon eats whatever creatures stray into his cell and manages to survive the two-year ordeal.<br /><br />When he recovers his strength, Papillon makes another escape attempt. Dega and another prisoner join him and they arrange to leave the swamp by boat. The three set sail for Honduras. On reaching land they eventually become separated and Papillon is forced to fend for himself. This leads to an extended sequence, largely without dialogue, where Papillon lives with some of the indigenous population. It's a happy time for him and is a stark contrast to his life in prison.<br /><br />I won't reveal any more of the story, but there are a few more twists and turns before it ends.<br /><br />The story is essentially about the strength of the human spirit and the desire to be free. Papillon has to endure harsh conditions, but something inside him makes him go on. It also shows that some criminals are not all bad. The friendship between Papillon and Dega is powerful and lasting. The final sequence shows both the friendship and Papillon's determination to live as a free man.<br /><br />Video Quality 3.5/5<br />The opening scene contains heavy grain and looks terrible, but isn't representative of the remainder of the film. It soon settles down and delivers a fairly pleasing transfer. The film is nearly 40 years old and doesn't look like a recent release, but the Blu-ray offers a big upgrade over previous releases. Just take a look at the trailer to see how the original film must have looked. Although the detail isn't as strong as I would have liked, it's adequate. Brighter outdoor scenes benefit the most. Colors are strong and accurate and the print looks fairly clean.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />An early conversation between Papillon and Dega aboard the prison ship is problematic. The dialogue appears rather distant and there are minor synchronization issues. This is an isolated incident and the quality quickly improves. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix does a good job of adding to the brooding atmosphere of the film. Heavy rain sounds like it's supposed to and jungle sounds come across in the rear speakers. The Oscar-nominated score sounds impressive and it's a good presentation overall.<br /><br />Special Features 2/5<br /><br />Aside from a trailer, there's only one additional feature:<br /><br />The Magnificent Rebel (12:19) is brief and shot in SD, but explains some of the problems involved in shooting the film. Some of the locations were hard to reach and had never been seen on camera before. There's also a sequence showing the reaction of the real Papillon, Henri Charriere, visiting the set and talking about how authentic it was.<br /><br />34-page digibook<br /><br />Papillon is a long film at 151 minutes, and some of it isn't pleasant to watch. It's not supposed to be. If you have seen Midnight Express, you'll have some idea of what to expect. The story takes its time to develop, but the payoff is worth it. McQueen may have been chosen because of his character in The Great Escape, but he has to show more range here and pulls it off well. Hoffman is familiar as the nervous Dega and the friendship is believable. While imperfect, the Blu-ray presentation offers a considerable upgrade and the digibook looks great. Fans of the film shouldn't hesitate to pick it up.<br /><br />Overall score 4/5DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix does a good job of adding to the brooding atmosphere of the film.

B0051QIGP4|1.0|Ive never heard music by such a mainstream artist in recent times that is just so painfully bad. Everthing about this album is designed to draw you in; from the crazy, titillating artwork to the interesting song names. But dont be fooled, upon first listen you will realize how crappy this music is. Dont be surprised if your ears bleed. This album literally is garbage. Its production is over-produced and its lyrics are fetid. The main regret I have is not having purchased the physical copy of this album, so I could've at least thrown in in the dumpster where it belongs. Absolute Filth.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I love Gilmour's contribution to the Floyd and there is much of this to enjoy in this live performance. Splendid almost studio-like in its quality of sound. I thought 'Echoes' was paticularly wonderful but they all are...

B0006A9FMI|3.0|I watched this movie & was in awe of the incredible computer graphics, the artwork, that appears during the monumental festival parade.    The story line was not new, one of the series episodes featured a similiar them of personal androids killing their masters.    It was an interesting movie, but it left a void.  Where was the rest of section 9 characters?    The first movie, the anime series worked as the cast of characters from section 9 worked together as each character added their expertise towards their objective.  It was fascinating to see them in action.    Questions about this movie still remain:   Why was Togusa's hair black?  He has appeared,previously, with dirty blonde hair.  His hair color & style set him a part from the others.    Why would the \\"Major\\" lose her android body & disappear into the net?    It makes no sense as she was attached to her specific body & wouldn't change to a new body type.
0316056863|2.0|Although I'm a huge fan, this book just wasn't that funny.  I kept thinking that if I could see her face, it would be funnier, but not so much in print.  Much of it was pretty mundane, and the writing just seemed like she was trying too hard.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|First of all, yes this may not be Lady Gaga's best music. Part of that is because she released good singles. Born This Way (the song) is amazing. Bloody Mary is one of my new favorites. Judas, Hair, and The Edge of Glory are all pretty good as well. But guys...this was 99 CENTS yesterday! I'm sorry but I will now look to AMAZON not iTunes to buy music. That price is simply ridiculous. But now I'm a happy camper!!
0670022411|4.0|A Guilty Pleasure  I've read some of the reviews for A Discovery of Witches, and have to admit that they are all correct.  Farfetched?  Certainly.  A page turner? Definitely.  The heroine, Diana, comes from a long line of witches.  For most of her life, she has shunned her abilities, except for a few things here and there (you don't want the washing machine to overflow), until her power begins to spill out of her.  Not surprisingly, she is the most powerful witch in a very long time, a scholar, and a stunner with a hearty appetite.  Matthew, her lover/vampire, is no \\"ordinary\\" vampire.  He has corresponded with Darwin, mastered multiple scientific fields, and is the leader of a secret order of knights and, if that weren't enough, he is rich and easy on the eyes.  The fact that both Diana and Matthew are talented, smart, attractive and powerful most definitely adds to the story.  A story about a couple of average creatures living a quiet life is suburban Albany could be very entertaining, but the elements that went into this story were enjoyable.  However, it kind of hits me like stories of reincarnation.  No one is ever the scullery maid living in the basement of a mansion.  Instead, we are all Elizabeth I.  But, I'll buy it.  When we first meet Diana, she is an independent spit-fire.  She rows in the mist with her eyes closed and won't be intimidated by the witches, daemons and vampires who are threatening her.  When she is whisked away to the French countryside, she suddenly becomes a damsel!  There is a point in the story where Diana is awaiting Matthew's return from Oxford.  She is so eager to greet him at the door, she quickly showers and runs to wait for him even though she knows that he is hours away from arrival.  She even refuses to take the time to towel dry her hair, leaving Marthe to take care of the task.  We have now ventured into bodice ripper territory.  In spite of it all, I simply loved this book.  The story had elements of historical fiction, romance and adventure which reminded me very much of the Diana Gabaldon Outlander Series.  This book sucked me in and wouldn't let go.  It was smart, romantic and definitely a guilty pleasure.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|I bought this album yesterday and downloaded the songs in the evening. It took all of 5 minutes to download. Amazon must have fixed the server issues because I didn't see what other downloaders were complaining about. Great deal. Happy camper.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Very well done.  I was born in 1939 and grew up in the '40s and well remember the beloved King George VI and his connection to the real people, especially during 'The War'.  Thoroughly enjoyed it but the sets, especially the Dr's office were quite depressing but also quite authentic for that time period including looking very cold.  I noticed that the boys were wearing their coats indoors which was typical in those days.  I remember wearing my coat to class during my early years in school.  Loved it.
B004TRKHSK|4.0|Just a warning that the vinyl is definitely not 180 gram like the packaging states, which is a disappointment, and it doesn't include the hidden track \\"Damone\\".  Still its great to finally have this on vinyl but I really hope they reissue this in the future with everything included and a gatefold cover.  Fingers Crossed.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Man was I disappointed in this album.  The first album is so diverse and has great pop hooks.  This album is the exact opposite.  I knew Lady Gaga was obviously pretentious as her last cd was getting bigger, but this is nothing like that.  I wanted to like it, but if you want anything like The Fame, just save your dollar and listen to the first one.  This one has too many religious overtones, too much dance electronic pop, and just a bizarre choice.

B004K4AUZW|4.0|This is an amazing example of how an artist can do 30 different genres in a single album. Some songs are just pure dance-pop records, and others are revolutionary anthems that are ment to make a statement. People might hate this album because they cant handle the agressive truth it contains. It is really amazing how Gaga keeps pushing it and pushing it. Can't choose a favorite song because they are all so different, they are all perfect in their way, just like Lady Gaga!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|The Fame Monster was surprisingly good for me, but this has just blown me away.  So many different ideas and sounds, such a positive message.  Congratulations Lady Gaga, I am officially a fan.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Bought it for .99 and I LOVE 10/13 songs. Keep up the great work GAGA. Agree with the comment about techno disco ish... It's very forward thinking so have an open mind.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I already bought this on an actual CD, but then I saw I can get the entire album in MP3 form for only 99 cents AND an upgrade to a year free of 20 GB Cloud Storage on RELEASE DAY.  Not only is this promotion/price amazing on Amazon's part, Born This Way is an amazing, catchy album.  Lady Gaga has a lot of important things to say in some of the songs, such as Born This Way, but what impressed me even more was just how catchy and fun some of the songs were.  I'm not one to claim myself as a \\"Monster\\" but I will gladly put my \\"Paws Up\\" for this one.  Great job Lady Gaga, great price Amazon!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Lots of content.  lots of features and options that I have not tried yet, but I love being able to listen to the NBA playoffs.   Finding the game are easy and both teams' stations are available.  Hopefully, NFL games are available too.  I did not see any baseball games though.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this could replace satellite radio.  Get a car adapter and plug it in to the car's aux port.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|There's an unnerving moment that occurs when hearing Lady Gaga's second album, Born This Way, for the first time. It comes as soon as the plodding keyboard chords ring out on opening track Marry the Night and you wonder if the stage is set for this to be the first of several self-indulgent ballads. It will be a fear familiar to anyone who tuned into Radio 1's Big Weekend expecting a rapid-fire run through her storming pop hits and was met inexplicably with several minutes of jazz trumpet. Among the madness, the Madonna-comparisons and the meat dresses has Lady Gaga lost track of what made her little monsters fall in love with her in the first place? The answer is NO.    The album is a roaring success in my eyes and in the eyes of many critics today. It may not be the best album out their, but it really is a great follow-up album to the fame, that was filled with pop tunes, that were fresh and original. BORN THIS WAY doe's exactly the same, it's original and it breathes new life into the pop genre!  Her third studio album (counting The Fame Monster as an album here) really is worthy of the hype its been given and I think GaGa deserves all the credit and praise she is going to get in the coming months for this album, and she really is an inspiration for us all.
0307887960|5.0|This is a good diet after the first section of the diet. The first section is hard to stay on for older people. When you can get to the second section it is much easier for older people to follow. Older people need some vegetables in their diet. Young people can use the diet much better. I have changed my view of this died since I wrote this commit. It is a diet for everyone. It is the only diet that I have every followed that has worked for me. Since I have been on it I have lost over 130 lbs. You see I am only 5 feet tall, and I weighted 260 lbs. I am now down to my correct weight. I was so heavy that I could not play with my great-grandchildren like they wanted me to. I am 77 years old, and now I can get down on the floor with them and play games, and with their toys. It is wonderful. I can walk as long as I desire shopping, ride my bike, and ride a horse again. It is the only diet that I have found that works for me. You have to start it, and be committed to it, and it will work. I do not desire anything any longer that I should not eat. Believe me it is wonderful. I feel great, and I am looking forward to a good and health life for as long as I remain here on earth. I hope any of you that have the problem that I have had will try it. I have tried them all, and this one<br />works for me. Billie Marie Simons --- Pasadena, Texas
B002ZG98LO|2.0|This film took one bug step backwards.  The original one was the best and they began going downhill from there.  This was no better.  Yes, some cool FX, but story was pretty much idiotic and too far out there to even be believable.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Life is an amazing series highlighting how different animals live in some of the farthest reaches of the globe. The episodes are very captivating and look amazing. If you have any friends that don't appreciate the higher quality associated with Blu-rays, Life is a perfect example of vivid detail and color. The episodes are interesting enough that you wouldn't mind going back and watching them again, which is a plus. You can tell from the overall quality that many years of work went into this series. The only negative is that the special features are very simple, they took the segments at the end of each episode on how they got certain shots and just put them together into an extra episode. In addition to Life I have also seen \\"Human Planet\\" and can recommend that series as well.

Well, this book is \\"general\\".<br />It is well presented, well written, and is perfectly suited to be used as a \\"reference\\" for beginners, intermediates and even advanced Object-Oriented programmers. It could be considered as a dictionnary for most common design patterns. Not much detailed, but very good as a standard.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was in the market for a new bag for my new Nikon D7000 camera, as I wanted a bit more room than my sling bag could hold. I liked the look of this bag as well as, and I have to be honest here the great Amazon price.<br />I was very pleasantly surprised by the fast delivery and high quality of this camera bag. My sling style bag was a fairly expensive name brand model and this Amazon &#34;generic&#34; model was just as well made!!<br />It has a good amount of storage and pockets for several lenses, my flash unit, and many small items. It apparently is available in any color you want as long as you want black. I really like the place to attach my travel tripod to the side of the bag too, my other bag didn't have that.<br />While not indicated to be able to carry a computer, my iPad fits fine in the larger front pocket (wrapped in a little extra bubble wrap, just in case!!)<br />My only problem is that some of the straps to secure the bag in backpack mode don't quite fit me. I'm six feet tall and a big guy and the straps, even adjusted as far out as they'll go are a little short for me, tight or just not long enough. A minor inconvenience and not a deal breaker, plus my wife will be replacing the straps to lengths that will fit.<br /><br />Would I recommend this bag? YES!!! Cameras and so much of the photographic accessories are SO expensive it was great to find a well-made bag at a best in class price as far as I'm concerned!<br /><br />2017 update. I bought another Amazon Basics DSLR Bag for my DJI Mavic.<br />I recently bought a DJI Mavic and while it came with a small storage bag, the &#34;fly more&#34; kit, It is still too small for everything to comfortably fit inside. So, I shopped for a couple of weeks for Mavic specific storage bags, with prices from thirty to almost two hundred dollars! Then I saw where some people were using Loewe Pro camera bags for Mavics. I had that sling bag for a camera, but I didn't like the way to fit the components so I tried the camera bag I reviewed above for my Nikon D7000.<br />Everything fit perfectly and fit securely in the bag.<br />So I looked online and found another Amazon Basics Bag for just twenty dollars. A bag I like this at a bargain basement price too! I got another bag just for the Mavic.<br />Everything fits perfectly in the bag, all equipment is secure and safe for travel.

B0034G4P8A|3.0|solid film. decent acting, beautiful effects and fairly funny at times. my one gripe about this movie without any spoilers are the main action scenes. they moved too fast, no focus and too short.     Thor compared to recent comic movies fail to live up to the level that the first iron man brought or the dark knight. this movie could've been great, had all the potential but wasn't quite sure what it wanted to be. still looking forward to captain amereica and the avengers though.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|In many crime novels you can usually spot the perp about halfway through.  Not this bad boy!!  I never saw this coming until the very end.  Suspenseful doesn't really cover it, even Harry Hole doesn't figure this one out until the end. Extremely well written, shocking, complex, interesting, unique.  I just don't know how else to describe it.Hats off to Nesbo, this one's a stunner. Loved it Loved it loved it.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Love this album! Such a great mix of different genres, but sounding completely GaGa the whole time. While The Fame was quite uneven, GaGa improved tremendously with The Fame Monster, which didn't have one bad song. She continues the trend with Born This Way, which feels more like a focused album instead of just a collection of great songs.     Unfortunately, she also continues the trend of allowing her record company to censor her lyrics for more sales (by not having to include a parental advisory sticker). I find this to be quite hypocritical, but whatever. The word \\"b!tch\\" is censored in two songs, though it is most noticeable/ offensive on The Queen. Why is this word constantly censored on her albums (it became \\"bit\\" on The Fame Monster)? It isn't censored on the radio, or TV. There was even a hit song by that name in the 90's. ANYWAY. It's a fantastic album. I first downloaded the regular edition, and now that I have the special edition, I can say that the bonus songs should have been added to the bonus disc. They are not as strong and kind of mess up the flow of an otherwise perfect album.     That said, great job GaGa! If you're a 'mo like me, you'll be working out to these songs for years!
B004K4AUZW|1.0|I have been a fan for many years, but I am quite disappointed by the release from GAGA. I listened through the music twice and hear quite a lot of repetition between this album and her other released music.  This time it wasn't just a plethora of useless remixes. There really are only 3 tracks on this new release that stand out as being different from her past recordings, but there is clearly sampling (intentional or not) of music from other well known artists. On CD 1 there are 3 songs in a row that cannot be differentiated from each other.  It was extremely boring to listen to that section. Let's see if some innovative videos can add life to this album. Doubtful.<br /><br />  I've returned to listening to Monster instead of this DEAD ON ARRIVAL GAGA release.<br /><br />July 15th, 2011:  2 months have passed since I received the CD.  Haven't been inclined to play it again.  GAGA missed with this CD and her videos to try and support this CD are quite poor.  Back to MONSTER if I need to listen to GAGA.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I heard that the album would be sold for $.99 and was so excited to buy it. When i went to buy it however it said it was only for people residing in the United States. I don't understand why it would say that seeing as i live in New York. I checked back multiple times and every time it said i couldn't buy it because I apparently don't live in the United States. I really wish they would make this CD available for $.99 again for those who experienced problems with purchasing it.
1593272839|5.0|I received this book as review copy and ended up reading it cover to cover. I have few other books on Haskell and made few attempts to read them, but I ended up getting lost along the way. Not this time though. The book builds up material in a nice gradual way, so that towards the end when I was reading Monads, it was no longer that dense. Author has done a good job in explaining things and concepts in a simple way. I still need to write few Haskell programs to absorb everything, but I feel lot more comfortable now than I was just a month back.     The examples in the book are nicely picked. Not only they explain the concept clearly, but they also lead up to material on which a next section or chapter is based. A discussion about Random numbers in Chapter 9 sets things up nicely for State Monad in Chapter 14. Build up from Functors (Chapter 7) to Applicative Functors (Chapter 11) to Monads (chapter 13 and 14) is done nicely. The book title mentions that its \\"A Beginners Guide\\", but I think by the end of this book the reader will be have a middle level Haskell understanding.    In terms of cons, I think there were couple of places where I felt discussion could have gone deeper into why things are the way they are. Probably they were omitted to keep the material interesting and not too dense. Also, I have been reading the book almost every day for a month and the back cover came out. But depending on how much I gained from the book, I would not rate this book any less.
0756404738|3.0|Did I devour this book with the same insatiable hunger that was brought to life with The Name of the Wind? Yes. Was I on the edge of my seat from cover to cover? No.  In fact there was a large chunk of this book that I seriously considered skipping, but didn't, just in case I missed some important information. For the record, you can fairly safely skip from whenever you get bored wandering wandering around the woods looking for bandits, right up until after Kvothe leaves Ademre. You'll miss one good battle, but this will save you more than 300 pages of meaningless meandering and waxing philosophical. Any important information you miss will be recapped before the end of the book.  I actually praised Rothfuss earlier in the book as he clearly deliberately took a couple of opportunities to gloss over certain events  in favour of keeping the page number manageable and focussing on more important things. Until, that is, I discovered what it was that he had made room for. In hindsight, I want less Fae, and more courtroom oratory and storm-swept ships!  While I realise that it would be literary suicide to stick to paths already trodden, I found myself craving more of Kvothe's University antics.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a good book, just don't be surprised if you get a bit bored in the middle. And let's keep our fingers crossed that after this slump, day three delivers everything we expected after reading day one!

1596680296|5.0|I am just \\"Getting Started knitting socks,\\" and have not yet used any of the patterns in this book, but..... I know I will! Already, I've found extremely useful information like how to wet felt to splice two strands of yarn together. What a great technique when you're trying to avoid seams in a sock! Also, there is a huge long section of ribbing, cable, and lace patterns which can be used as part of the sock you're knitting. This modular approach makes the possibilities endless.    The book arrived in perfect condition and, although I never planned to knit more than one pair of socks (for my granddaughter), I can see that I'm going to have to reevaluate that. I am hooked- or should I say \\"needled?\\" This book is a valuable investment.
1401923127|2.0|As happens with virtually every New Age writer that I've read (and every New Age believer I've encountered), Bruce Lipton presents a confusing and hard to pin down philosophy that seems to obscure any attempt to rationally evaluate what is being said.  As you read, you find yourself begging silently for some clarification of how he is defining terms, and what it is that he's really trying to advocate.   An example would be his use of the word `behavior.'  He claims that behavior is determined by environment, but this conclusion comes following an elaborate (and nicely written) description of how cells test and respond to their environment.  But what he is describing is the mechanics of animation within the cell the automatic responses to the environment of the various cellular proteins.  This is not even \\"behavior\\" on the cellular level.  It certainly can't be expanded to imply anything meaningful for a staggeringly-complex organism like the human being.  Behavior is chosen by a sentient being.  It is not stimulus-response, it is thought-choice.   Another would be the way he defines `spirit.'  He says, \\"We are all imbued with a spirit, the invisible energy.\\"  This comes after a long (and again, well written) discussion of basic quantum physics, which tell us that all matter, at the quantum level, is really energy.  The argument goes that since matter is energy and we are made of matter, we are energy.  That's no problem so far, but suddenly in the discussion this energy is renamed spirit.  So because all matter is energy, all matter is imbued with a spirit.  God is in everything, everything is God.   This category confusion permeates Lipton's book.  In one place he claims that since cell receptors can respond to resonant energy, such as light, sound and radio waves, \\"...biological behavior can be controlled by invisible forces, including thought...\\"  Here he is implying (I think) that we can will ourselves to better health.  This is flawed logic.  In essence, he isbuilding this pair of syllogisms:    Syllogism One:  Light, sound and radio wave energy have been shown to affect cell behavior.  Wave energy is invisible.  Therefore:  invisible forces can affect cell behavior.    No problem so far.  This is both valid and true.    Syllogism Two:  Invisible forces can affect cell behavior (taken from the conclusion above).  Thought is an invisible force.  Therefore:  thought can affect cell behavior.    It's not hard to see the logical error here when you lay it out this way.  The second premise is unsubstantiated and debatable (whether or not thought is a force).  But more importantly, the reasoning is fallacious.  It commits the fallacy of hasty generalization by assuming that all invisible forces, including thought, can affect cell behavior.  This is not at all established in his reasoning.     This is the kind of thing that permeates Lipton's book.  In many of his claims, he assumes the validity of Darwinian evolution and then uses it to explain his claims.  This is classically circular.   Ultimately, Lipton launches into a dissertation on human-caused global climate change, claiming that we are killing our species by changing the environment with which we are so finely attuned.  Again here, Lipton assumes the truth of his claim in order to support his claim.  So again he begs the question.   In places, Lipton's facts are somewhat iffy, which makes one wonder whether he can be trusted on matters strictly related to biology.  For instance, he laments the treatment of Jean-Baptiste Lamark, who Lipton claims was abused because he understood the effect of the environment on cells.  As far as I know, and a quick Wikipedia search will verify this, Lamark was ridiculed for his belief that traits acquired in an organism's lifetime could be passed on to offspring.  For instance, he supposed that the Giraffe's neck became long because over time, Giraffes stretched and strained their necks to reach higher branches.  This would create minute changes in the length of their necks during their lifetimes, and that these traits were heritable.  So although Lamark seems to have had a good understanding that environment effects gene expression and other cell behavior, he was not ostracized for that belief, as Lipton claims.   Finally, I question that Mr. Lipton's great epiphany; the insight that the cell nucleus and its DNA are not the \\"brain\\" of the cell, is the breakthrough that he claims it to be.  I don't recall any scientist making the claim that DNA \\"decides\\" anything for the cell.  It has always been thought of as the blueprint for cellular activities.  The fact that Lipton thinks of the cell membrane as the \\"brain\\" of the cell is very instructive and an interesting way to look at it, but I don't see how it is quite the amazing insight he seems to believe it is.   Lipton is quite masterful at explaining the complicated workings of the cell so that lay readers can understand and appreciate the wonders and complexity of our bodies.  That is where his talent lies, and I would enjoy reading a book by Mr. Lipton that sticks to shedding light on the intricacies of biological life.  But when he ventures into mysticism based on the mere fact that matter is energy and energy resonates, so obviously everything has a spirit, I have to look elsewhere for insight.
0345529057|5.0|A. At start I didn't understand why so many rated those amazing books as 1/5, but then I noticed they were rating the kindle version and not the actual books...    B. The books are well written and give the bigger picture of the story that cannot be understood by watching only the TV show (for example - Daenerys at the beginning of \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is only 13 years old! they never said it on the TV show and because of the sexual content they never will).

0307887960|3.0|Eating only lean protein for a prolonged period of time is not good for anyone's health...sure you can do it but is that the balance of nutrition your body needs?  Most definitely it is not.  If you eat like this, you will overtax your kidneys and cause all sorts of problems.  When I tried this, I ate nothing but protein for a week and I felt horrible.  Sure I felt full but I had no energy at all, terrible headaches and then I ended up with a UTI and way too much protein in my urine as a result.  This is a stupid and dangerous diet -- why I gave it a try I really don't know!!  I do agree with including healthy proteins with lots of veggies and moderate fruit and moderate carbs for a balanced diet.  But eating nothing but protein is a really stupid thing to do and very unhealthy even if it's only for a few days.  I would highly recommend staying away from this diet.  If you want great nutrition advice, go to Jillian Michaels or Denise Austin.  Denise is one of my favorites -- sure it is slower weight loss but it's safe weight loss and that is what you want -- not some stupid quick fix.

B003U0I9TQ|5.0|...a band that quotes Shakespeare and writes music based on Steinbeck novels?  But more than they appeal to the intellect, it is the rawness of emotion that keeps me hitting the \\"replay\\" button.  The lead singer has this edge to his voice, and he is well backed by the instrumentals as the songs become more frenzied. There isn't a bad song on this album, although there are some  I hit listen to more often than others.    The lyrics evoke powerful images, and straddle the line between love songs and religious transcendence.  There have been very few rock bands over the years that have intrigued and excited me to the level that this band has.  The only problem?  I want more!  More songs, more albums...  I've found a few songs on Youtube that don't seem to be available on CD or even MP3 (Like \\"Liar\\")and I want them! The funny thing is, I was never a fan of the banjo until I heard \\"Little Lion Man\\" on the radio late one night when I was driving home.      If you're on the fence, just buy the album.  It's worth every penny, and then some.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|\\"Scott Pilgrim\\" gets off to a confusing start, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  It's not clear if some or all of the action is taking place inside Scott Pilgrim's head.  The superimposed 60s' style Batman comic book graphics start off annoying and twee rather than creative.  But there's enough good stuff to keep the movie going.<br /><br />Then, when the first ex appeared, an Indian-Canadian named Matthew Patel, the penny dropped and I understood exactly what this movie was: Bollywood crossed with old Nintendo games, for American audiences.  In Bollywood world, you don't worry so much about whether anything makes sense; you just roll with it.  Once I stopped wondering whether the action was all in Scott's head or not, I enjoyed the movie a lot more.  Plus, we discover shortly afterward that in Scott Pilgrim World, these epic fights with the 7 Evil Ex's are all real.  How much you can buy into this will determine how much you like this movie.  It's a similar thing as \\"Angel World\\" in the Charlies' Angels movies.  If you can suspend your disbelief about what's going on, you will love it, but if you can't overcome that hurdle, you won't.<br /><br />\\"Scott Pilgrim\\" also does a nice job of giving its title character some self-awareness.  Geeks can be jerks like anyone else, and we often don't see it because geeks are used to feeling like victims.  Part of his gaining the self-respect power-up was realizing that he hadn't treated others as well as he wished he would be treated himself.<br /><br />Let's not forget Vegan Academy or the Vegan Police, which alone are worth watching this entire movie.  Michael Cera doing wire-fu is also worth the price of admission.<br /><br />As usual, the deleted scenes were deleted for a reason, and the alternate ending was the alternate ending for a reason as well.  I will not provide spoilers, but it's obvious from a handful of short deleted scenes and the alternate ending that they were playing with this wrapping up in a different way.

B00002SWEM|5.0|The music in this film is spectacular and the stories told by these musical marvels is even more amazing.  These men and women are over 80 years old and yet they are performing and traveling throughout the world to showcase their music.  Above all, it's a humbling story of life growing up in Cuba.  It illustrates how financial wealth comes last in the waterfall of the important things in life.  Making music and enjoying friendship is what it's all about.  It's impossible not to be enchanted by the scenery in Cuba.  This is definitely worth owning and if you like their music there are several musical albums worth owning as well.
0553577123|5.0|This is one of those books I 'always meant to read'.  I've gotta say, I'm SO GLAD I wasn't forced to read this in school, since that seems to leave people with bad memories of great books due to difficult/tedious/trivial homework assignments.  I couldn't put this book down, and it was so heartbreaking to read Anne's account of D-Day, realizing just two months later the Gestapo would get her.  The book was just wonderful, and so very sad.  I'm sure Anne would have made a great journalist had she lived!
B004PHE9F6|5.0|(I viewed this film on the HD-DVD format).     This film is the most incredible visual experience you can ever imagine!   The racing scenes around Monaco at the begining of the film makes the best  Hollywood car chases look like a family drive to Sunday church.  One advantage they have over Hollywood car chases is that they can have a cameras located on the front of the car so you really get a feeling of speed. They can sustain the forward looking view for several minutes (entire laps) to give you the sense you are in the driver seat.  It is almost liked being in a roller coaster ride. A continous front camera views are much  harder to do in Hollywood films as they can only film in very short takes!    Amazingly innovative direction with very bold clever camera angles and special effects.      An intelligent plot and a charming love story between two intelligent people binds the film togeather.      But the car chases are the real star!!!      On HD this film is stunning!  I saw on HD-DVD and the transfer was amazing. I used the disc to demo my projector set up.  So I expect the Blu Transfer to be better!!!x
B002UXRGM0|5.0|The documentary Life marks another great milestone in nature documentaries.  The cinematography is amazing, narration is not overwrought, but still has enough presence to be informative and accentuate the action.  David Attenborough is still the best at what he does, and this version is far far superior to the lifeless and fairly limp narration provided by Oprah Winfrey.    The multi-disk documentary is perfect for anyone that loves nature and has a passion for the natural world around them.
0141439513|5.0|This story is one of the greatest pieces of English literature to ever be written. It may take some time to actually get hooked to the book, but once you do, don't count on putting it down. The tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy leave you wanting more. The love in the story leaves you speechless. It's a battle between the rich families and the poor families. I loved the book because it is a beautiful story that deals with tension, love, heartbreak and so much more! Also, the version of this book is easy to understand. The book is amusing, well written and I highly recommend it!
0439023491|5.0|I'm not sure where to start. This book was, in my opinion, one of the best sequels I've ever read. There was far more suspense and a lot more guessing to figure out what in the world was going on. By the first page I was hooked and there was never a moment while reading this that I ever wanted to put it down -- and in fact, I don't think I did. Everything that the first book did, this book did better. And just when you thought Katniss was safe from the Capitol by winning the last Hunger Games, she isn't.<br /><br />In a bizarre -- or rather, not so bizarre -- twist of fate Katniss has to return to the Hunger Games and Peeta volunteers to go with her. The stakes are even higher as other previous Victors are thrust into the mix and Katniss and Peeta find themselves to be the center of attention for a group of rebels. There are moments where everything seems to slow down so that we can breathe before it picks right back up again.<br /><br />There's more emphasis on the love triangle, but not annoyingly so. You don't have both Peeta and Gale breathing down her neck for an answer and Katniss, thankfully, isn't constantly going through a pros/cons list every time she thinks of them. There's just enough of the romance to make one wonder who she really has feelings for and swoon, but it never ever overshadows the plot that keeps you guessing. During most of the book you're kept in the dark as much as Katniss and yes, it's frustrating. But everything comes to a a big reveal at the end that leaves you begging for more.

0439023513|5.0|The summary doesn't lie: The final installment to the Hunger Games is an action packed thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Katniss takes about a good portion of the book deciding on whether or not she really wants to be the Mockingjay -- the symbol and hope for the rebels. She goes out on these little promotional type visits to get a feel of what she's supposed to do and to see the damage first hand. Her first time in a combat zone is life changing, possibly far more so than being in the Games themselves.<br /><br />Peeta is out of the picture, for the most part, because he's been taking by President Snow and is being used to speak out against Katniss. Katniss is devastated and makes demands that everyone she cares about is safe if she takes on the role as Mockingjay. Her and Gale begin to get close, but there's always a certain gap between them that they can't quite cross.  In short: the love triangle gets more intense, but I don't think it overshadowed what was really going on with rebellion. Katniss isn't the type of girl who is busy dwelling on her love life either, so it was refreshing that she wasn't spending pages upon pages trying to figure out which guy was the better guy.<br /><br />Somewhere near the middle the pace of the book changes and picks up speed when Katniss goes with a group of people to the Capitol where she's thrust straight into the heart of the war. There are many deaths -- some seem to be unnecessary and cruel, but when I thought back on it, that's exactly what war is. War isn't a pretty picture where every death has some sort of meaning and everyone goes down in a heroic death like you would see in a movie. This was raw. This was gruesome. This was set up as another Hunger Games from President Snow's point of view. Everything just kept building and building until the inevitable assassination and then you were left breathless. The last chapter and epilogue was beautiful and depressing, but it showed that you can pick yourself back up again when everything that you once knew is lost.gain when everything that you once knew is lost.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|It's AWESOME headset! Easy installed and never think it is so great sounds output. When I used it in chat room, all my friends ask me why my voice so clear looks like sitting next to him.    When my kids are study or sleep, I can turn OFF tv volume and still can hear game sound or chatting from headset, no worry to disturb them.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|Having read the rather long Rolling Stone interview with Lady Gaga, a twenty-four-year-old, new pop celebrity-singer-performance artist, who has transcended entirely previous standards of taste, I am constrained to offer a few comments, given that this troubled young woman is influencing millions of her fans (whom she calls \\"her monsters\\").<br /><br />The interview is littered with vulgarity, with the f-word used almost as punctuation repeatedly. Gaga reveals her family background and broken heart over an unrequited romance. The interviewer tries to psychoanalyze her, and she goes along with it to some extent. She is driven to perform, having been touring for nearly four years straight. Her stage routine is heavy-laden with sex and violence, augmented by special effects and outrageous costumes that highlight her feminine distinctives (to put it tamely). Gaga shows concern for her fans, recognizing that nine-year-old girls listen to her music. But the altruism is twisted, since her music is laced with obscenity, describing lurid lives with no sense of restraint. There is nothing of virtue to offer her adoring audience. One might say she makes Madonna look shy and modest. (I could not find an even remotely modest photograph of her to post here, although I admit that I did not look too hard for one.)<br /><br />Yet Gaga is a theist, who believes that God \\"watches out for her.\\" This is so American. A comparable European performer of such perversities would likely have no such sentiment. Yet the vast majority of Americans remain theists, however little they adhere to any biblical worldview or pattern of behavior.<br /><br />Remarkably, Gaga says she does not want to appear to be a human being on stage. She will not even drink water in front of her audience. She says that her art is a lie that she wants people to believe. She is consumed with making art (as she understands it). This, apparently, is her chosen vehicle for salvation, given that her life is in tatters otherwise. She projects an in-human persona to escape her very human laments. Gaga has a pre-lupus condition (lupus is a very serious chronic illness) and sometimes passes out on stage. She admits to illegal drug use. Without any sense of secrecy or shame, admits to numerous sexual escapades. The interviewer refers to these (interestingly) as \\"sexual conquests\\"--a term once reserved for men seducing women. Gaga also claims she is a \\"feminist,\\" but how is acting like a prostitute or sex monster in any way advancing the cause of women's dignity or abilities?<br /><br />Pop culture has come a long way (down) in recent years. Lady Gaga is pornographic much of the time. Her lyrics are often perverse and sordid. Yet she is a teen idol, whose recordings are best-sellers. Of course, many will defend her as energetic, transgressive, dynamic, and more. But this only indicates that art has been separated from goodness--alienated from any pattern of life that conduces to virtue and moves away from vice. Lady Gaga shows us the sordid side of life (in larger than life ways); and she may invoke our compassion for the abused, tormented, and demented. But I see her as a tragic figure. I fear she is headed in the same direction that Jimi Hendrix was when he was the same age. He was died at twenty-seven in 1970, from an accidental drug overdose.<br /><br />I hope not and pray not. God have mercy on Lady Gaga--and her fans. I hope Christians will exhibit the same concern (as well as critique) as modeled by Francis Schaeffer in 1968, who wrote in The God Who is There:<br /><br />These paintings, these poems and these demonstrations which we have been talking bout are the expression of men who are struggling with their appalling lostness. Dare we laugh at such things? Dare we feel superior when we view their tortured expressions in their art? Christians should stop laughing and take such men seriously. Then we shall have the right to speak again to our generation. These men are dying while they live, yet where is our compassion for them? There is nothing more ugly than an orthodoxy without understanding or without compassion.y live, yet where is our compassion for them? There is nothing more ugly than an orthodoxy without understanding or without compassion.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Disappointed in the album. Sounds like remixed hits from the 80's and 90's. Nothing new or innovative. Not willing to waste even $.99 for this recycled garbage
B0031ES8P6|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my friend and I was pretty happy when I found it on Amazon. These Hello Kitty toys can be pricey at the Sanrio store, so finding this for 6 bucks seemed like a catch. When it came into the mail, however, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed in the size. The product dimensions said that it was 3X4X8 inches, but it was actually 6 inches tall. It's only two inches, but now it's around the same size of my hand. Nonetheless, it's still a cute plushie.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|The story revolves around 3 brothers who go to India on a \\"spiritual journey\\" one year after their father has died.  However, the trip doesn't really pan out how Owen Wilson's character planned it.<br /><br />I really like Wes Anderson films, but there's something about this one that especially clicks with me.  The location shooting in India is really visually pleasing, and you really get sucked into the \\"journey\\" of the movie.  Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and Jason Schwartzman, are just hilarious to me.  The dialogue is great, and in keeping with Anderson's style, there are some really great montage moments, featuring some great tracks by the Kinks.  I connected well with this movie emotionally as well.  Great job, Mr. Anderson.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I have not stopped listening to this album since I bought it yesterday. I wouldn't say its the best album of the decade but I would say its the best Pop Album on the Decade, right there with The E.N.D. by the Black Eyed Peas! Lady Gaga deserves much praise because she really goes all out on this album and puts all of herself into it. I pretty much love all the songs and love the bonus tracks as well. My faves on the album are Government Hooker, The Edge Of Glory, Hair, and Scheide. There really is something for everyone on this album and I'm sure the hits from this album will be coming all year long. I loved The Fame but I believe this album exceeds it. Great Dance album!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Now that it has downloaded, I love it!    Added 4 of the tracks to my exercise playlist.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I can't believe how many negative reviews there are for this album due to Amazon server issues. What do you expect when they offer one of the most highly anticipated albums in years for $.99 on the date of its release? Of course there are going to be server problems when millions of user are downloading the same album all at once. But anyone who's ever downloaded an MP3 off of Amazon knows that MP3 downloader keeps track of failed downloads and allows users to try again later. Folks need to relax and wait for traffic to die down, and then try again. Don't blast Amazon for practically giving this album away. Consider how much of a hit Amazon is taking in lost revenue. Learn patience and gratitude, folks!    As for the album itself, it's excellent. I'm not a huge fan Lady Gaga or her genre, but this is definitely one of the best albums I've heard in awhile. Every song makes me want to get up and shake my booty. \\"The Edge Of Glory\\" is particularly powerful and hypnotic. \\"Poker Face\\" fans will especially enjoy \\"Highway Unicorn\\", which shares Gaga's famous hook.    How long did it take me to download the album? About 20 minutes and 3 \\"Retries\\".
B004SCI9BS|5.0|9/10 songs in this album are great. Now in days most albums have more than 12 tracks and only about 4 of the tracks are good. Brilliant album!!
B004QKNXIQ|3.0|Fantastic character animation, mostly due to Pixar, and despite the Menken soundtrack, the songs were really forgettable.  I will probably never think of this movie again.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|For 99 cents, the album is a great deal. Definitely worth it. I purchased before everybody else noticed this, at 6:30 am. At this time, Amazon's service was awesome. The album downloaded in less than 2 minutes. Thank you Amazon.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I have all Josh's music and have been a fan for years.  This was disappointing.  Choices were wrong, and his usually strong voice seemed weak to me like he wasn't giving it his all.  I have listened to it a few times and each time went away feeling the same.  I'm not even going to keep this one!  It just wasn't up to his usual standard that I expected.
B00428ZRFE|2.0|This album was disappointing to me.  The only good songs are the ones on the radio - the others to me are just filler.  Instead of buying the album, just download your favorites.  My pics:    S&M  Whats My Name  Only Girl In The World  Love the Way You Lie
0670022411|5.0|Criminy! I wish I'd known I'd have to wait for a sequel! Ah well, I can re-read it before the next one comes out, and I'll enjoy it just as much again, I'm sure. Good stuff.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Excellent film all round -- but Dr. McCoy is the best I've ever seen.  They couldn't have done better.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Yes, when the Lady herself provoked the thought that Alexander Mcqueen was looking down on her, pulling her strings of artistry - she wasn't kidding.     Every song is a an ocean expanded on something so common place or trivial that is amplified to be thought provoking and thirst-quenching. In an industry of bland personalities, poor dance style and terrible music - This one DELIVERS !!!    I cant explain enough that the album is not a running theme thats recycled throughout with different measures of the beat. rather each song is a shock to the ears, something different something new, that skews to directions you cant predict.     All I can say gagaloo is Mcqueen would be proud. and I know that means a lot to her and many people.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|She knows how to get attention, but not how to make good music. This album might have been overpriced at 99 cents.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|i fell in love with this story because its basically a family film. all generations of 1 family coming 2gethr 2 rid the world of an internet threat. think facebook getting hacked by an evil program. this is the same thing and u'll understand where this story comes from because u can relate to it n a way. characters are all very comical, and u'll care what happens 2 them. i love it, and i know u'll luv it 2.
0670022411|4.0|I really liked this book once I got accustomed to the writing style and foreign words.  The research must have been mind boggling.  And the ending is one I would call very \\"comfortable\\".   Now if only the 2nd book was ready?   Recommended only for readers who prefer the intellectual side of things.   Nice characters, but agree there is a bit too much repetition.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|this show is the most realistic zombie show/film ever made n tv form. u'll care about each character as the story progresses. worth a buy and in ur collection.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Only Gaga and take Pop and turn it into the masterpiece that is \\"Born This Way\\". This is an album truly for her fans. Best 99 cents I've ever spent.     Favorite songs: Marry the Night, Government Hooker, You and I, The Edge of Glory
B0032UYFA6|5.0|theres soo much 2 say about this show bcause its soo damnn good and well written. since season 1 ive been glued 2 the screen bcause this show will grab u n the storyline. no other show evr did that 2 me. trust me u'll want this n ur collection. highly recommended!!!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Lady Gaga...The woman who became the most famous artist in the world in 3 years. The woman who shocked people, with her music, fashion, dance and stage persona. Born This Way is an example for that. Comparing to The Fame it is much more darker, edgier and real...    Marry The Night 8/10: A fine dance song. Great for intro...  Born This Way 9/10: Sorry haters but this track is an anthem even without It's lyrics. With It's message Born This Ways deserves the attention.  Government Hooker 8/10: Government Hooker is a haunting dance track with in-your-face lyrics, and Madonna inspired melody.  Judas 9/10: The most mainstream track on the cd. I might call it Bad Romance part 2. But somehow, I find this track more addictive.  Americano 10/10: It's fun, hot, sexy and probably the most listened track on my I-pod this summer.  Hair 10/10: Great lyrics with 80s brat pack style melody. A combo!  Scheisse 10000/10: OH MY GOD. MY FAVORTE FAVORTE FAVORTE track on the cd. Catchy and dark. I mean Gaga even made german sexy :D  Bloody Mary 9/10: It's pop, and Gaga sings the hell of it.  Black Jesus/Amen Fashion 8/10: A solid dance track. Not my favorite, not my least favorite.  Bad Kids 7/10: Love It but this doesn't stand on it's own. Really love the beginning though.  Fashion Of Love 9/10: Just 2 words. LOVE IT.  Highway Unicorn 8/10: Love the title, love chorus.  Heavy Metal Lover 4/10: I just hate this track. It's a mess and it doesn't show any singing abilities of Gaga.  Electric Chapel 9/10: Addictive.  The Queen 8/10: 80s power track with relative lyrics.  You And I 10/10: The live version would ultimately be my favorite. But this a masterpiece on It's own too.  Edge Of Glory 10/10: 90s dance track that made me love Gaga once again. Solid closure.
B0046MOVD0|4.0|many have dofferent views about this movie franchise, but i must say its one of the well made parts of this series. milla kicks major zombie butt n this film just like the rest. worth a buy, or at least a rent.
6305327041|5.0|I have loved this movie for a very long time. I just recently bought it on DVD. It makes me laugh every time I watch it. You have to have a specific sense of humor for this flick. Quentin is quite bizarre himself, but if you are into that type of thing like I am, you will enjoy this movie.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I have the HP series in books (preferred) and in dvds. I loved this movie in the theater and saw it a couple of times (having learned to not compare the movies to the depth of the books). It was probably my favorite to date if I thought of ranking the movies. The dvd is a disgrace as WB seems to have eliminated scenes and definitely transfered data so poorly that the viewing is riddled with visual pauses, jumps and distortions. All prior dvds had two discs with nice extras. The prior dvd versions were true to the theater versions and were decent quality for viewing. WB execs who authorized putting out a shortened, cheaply and badly transferred video single disc dvd should be shamed and reprimanded/fired. This reflects poorly on WB's greed overcoming their pride in quality and it is insulting to JKRowling who entrusted her series to them.     Do they expect all of the HP fans, who've already spent good money on the entire collection of HP dvds to date to now, at the final year's movies, run out and buy a Blue-Ray player and re-buy the prior years in Blue-Ray version??? Of course, I'm reading reviews that, while the blue-ray version does include more of the theater movie without glitchy distortions, they also received no new extras.     As another reviewer stated, WB is obviously saving up extras now to get us to buy the ultimate editions. I recommend most everything that is authorized HP, but feel WB owes JKR and the fans an apology...and a replacement dvd worth the price. I find myself wondering if the ultimate edition dvd's will also be short-changed?? I'll wait for reviews before considering buying.
0441018866|1.0|(recommendations on what to read instead of this book at the bottom of my review)    This book doesn't qualify as science fiction.  Science fiction introduces a technological/scientific development and imagines what would happen to human beings as a result.  This book is a fantasy whodunnit - not a really good one - that uses stolen scifi concepts as a backdrop.     The story starts off using Wil McCarthy's concept from The Collapsium, of \\"planettes\\": asteroids with a semisafe black hole core, giving them earthlike gravity.  Not that Reynolds makes much use of it - he just throws it out there as a by-the-by sort of thing and moves on with... whatever it was he thought he was doing.    The story moves on to copying practically every concept from Vernor Vinge's Qeng Ho novels:  A widespread galactic civilization knit together by slow-moving traders who use suspended animation while in flight, living essentially on a different time scale than people living on planets, organized into \\"trading families\\" that synchronize reunions every few thousand years or so.    Having chosen some excellent scifi concepts to work with, Reynolds essentially ignores them.  The litmus test for a story claiming to be scifi is - if you replace the spaceships with horses, can you make a western out of this book?  Yes you can, and that's how you can tell it isn't true science fiction - with a real scifi novel, the science or tech is integral - remove the science fiction element from it and it doesn't work.      The ships in House of Suns ARE used just like horses in a western.  Near the end, there is a fast pursuit chase that lasts for THOUSANDS of years - the pursued and the pursuers both have to do the thing in suspended animation - and there isn't a single mention of how the ships keep going for longer than the Roman Empire existed with no refueling, repairs, overhaul, etc.  For an adventure story, that's fine - you don't worry all that much about making sure the horse is fed, sheltered, orthe finer points of hoof care in a western.  But in a scifi novel, how things work does matter.    There are even specific scenes within the novel that seem \\"lifted\\" - at one point they are in a ship dodging a powerful but slow beam weapon.  It reads VERY much like a scene straight out of Wil McCarthy's Collapsium in which the main character is attempting to avoid a nasen beam.  It's hard to tell the full extent of the \\"lifting\\" of materials because things keep occurring to me... those things I don't recognize are probably from books I haven't read yet or things in them I've forgotten.  For instance there's a scene in which a bad guy's ship is blown up... and a smaller, scary/evil/cool looking ship emerges from the wreckage.  That seemed so familiar to me when I read it but I couldn't place it - and it just occurred to me, I actually saw that scene in my youth watching an Americanized anime called Star Blazers (Space Battleship Yamoto), EXACTLY that scene.  (Edit: and I just remembered another thing - he lifts, lock stock and barrel, the way space combat is conducted from Vinge's Fire Upon the Deep - he is very ballsy, considering he copied from a Hugo award winnner and Nebula nominee)    But the problem isn't merely that Alastair Reynolds uses other peoples' ideas, it's that he fumbles every opportunity to write scifi - borrowed or not.  An interesting concept is mentioned and he simply does not develop it or study its effect on humans.  For instance, his little \\"wrinkle\\" in Vinge's trading family concept was that they are clones and all share the same memory - and two of them are in a relationship together.  That's an interesting concept, one worth exploring - how would that change the interactions between all the clones at the reunion, how would that relationship work?  But it's just a by-the-by thing - the clones are said to be clones, but sameness and shared memories never really come up, there isn't anything interesting, unusual or different about how they deal with each other or their society.  Had Reynolds explored the concept at all, it might have been science fiction.  Instead, the opposite is true throughout the book - things that SHOULD make life different for people are there, but over and over again these things are of no consequence, they affect nothing.    ...So it's an adventure tale using mostly borrowed scifi concepts.  Having gotten its concepts from elsewhere, an adventure book could STILL be a cracking good read.  Sadly it was not.  A well-written story gives you at least somewhat vivid characterization... the two main characters are virtually interchangable and both barely discernable - not for lack of space or time to develop them, this is a thick book at 565 pages.  While the 2 main characters have that wishy-washy interchangeable Rozencranz & Guildenstern-like quality, the other characters are even more washed-out.  One is missing an eye - that's the only really distinguishing feature I can remember - but generally Reynolds' attempts at times of giving these other characters some character is to have them all take turns being sort of... bitchy, all of them in the same way.  Needless to say, this is not enough to establish characterization.  Characterization is a skill simply lacking in Alastair Reynold's toolkit, judging from this book.    As a mystery, it is fairly ham-handed.  I will restrain from going into the dreary details but if you want a mystery - or if you want a scifi mystery - you can do a lot better.  Having failed to be a science fiction novel, it isn't a rousing mystery either.  Many alternatives are available that will engage you, get you involved in the mystery, the characters, and so on.      If you're looking for space-opera-y scifi, try the guys he is stealing from:    Vernor Vinge  [[ASIN:0812536355 A Deepness in the Sky]]  [[ASIN:0812515285 A Fire Upon The Deep]]    Wil McCarthy  [[ASIN:055358443X The Collapsium]]  [[ASIN:0553584464 The Wellstone]]  [[ASIN:0553584472 Lost in Transmission]]  [[ASIN:055358717X To Crush the Moon]]    ...or if you want an engaging space-opera mystery/adventure that ranges all over, try James Alan Gardner  [[ASIN:038079439X Expendable (League of Peoples, Bk. 1)]]  [[ASIN:0380813297 Ascending]]  [[ASIN:0380802090 Hunted (League of Peoples, Bk. 4)]]  [[ASIN:B000BOB2ZW Radiant]]    Or if you want more of a sci-fi noir type mystery  Gun, with Occasional Music by Johnathan Lethem  -  ASIN:0156028972   Only Forward by Micheal Marshall Smith  -  ASIN:0553579703  (you can only put so many links in a review or I'd link these too)    Oh and I almost forgot to mention, the pivotal \\"thing\\" in the mystery/tale ends up being sentient humanoid robots.  This is a sort of old-fashioned concept - most scifi writers now seem to be aware of the concept of the tech singularity and now take it into account.  There's probably no way you would end up with anthropomorphic humanlike robot AI, but if you DID want to take that as a premise for a story, then you could go back to 1953 for Asimov's various robot mystery books starting with Caves of Steel.  Reynolds had 55 years of actual advancement - over half a century - since Asimov wrote that robot mystery scifi book, but couldn't think of any interesting, stimulating, or even entertaining ideas having to do with anthropomorphic robots.  He had no new concepts nor did he revisit the old ones.  So if you're looking for a book about intelligent robots involved in a scifi mystery, read Caves of Steel and its sequels - much better writing and ideas in that book.  Oddly, more seems to happen and the characters seem more vivid even though it is less than half the length of House of Suns - as are, I believe, all of the recommendations above.    Any of the books I've mentioned will be infinitely better than House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds.  I use my copy as kindling when I camp rather than selling it to a used bookstore - it would hurt me to know it was out there.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Even though there are some average bummer tracks, collectively this is an interesting album by LG.  It's definately a dance affair, like Britney's new album.  The beats are thumping, hot and fresh like dance beats should b.  Lyrically it is a creative set, so it's not ooh baby I love you on every song.  I think writing music is one of LG's stronger qualities.  LG is a true talent and I give her praise that she maintanes a level of artistic originality.  Here is my personal rundown of every track:    Marry The Night: 5/5  Born This Way: 4/5  Government Hooker: 5/5  Judas: 5/5  Americano: 4/5  Hair: 3/5  Sheibe: 5/5  Bloody Mary: 5/5  Black Jesus Amen Fashion: 3/5  Bad Kidz: 5/5  Fashion of His Love: 4/5  Highway Unicorn (Road 2 Love): 2/5  Heavy Metal Lover: 4/5  Electric Chapel: 2/5  The Queen: 5/5  U and I: 2/5  The Edge of Glory: 2/5
0307887960|5.0|I have tried many weight loss programs in the past.  I do not like writing a lot of things down, thinking about what I have to combine, counting how much I need in a day, etc.  (don't want to mention any other programs I have been on by name, but you get the idea ;) )  I like that I know there is a list of things I can eat, and that is all.  Very simple, you just have to have willpower.  I went to Dukan's online website to calculate my ideal weight, which told me I needed to lose 40 pounds (I will be 40 in August, and wanted to lose 40 by 40 anyway!) I began the diet on May 1st, and have (as of today May 24th) lost 17 pounds!  I feel amazing, am not as tired as I was, and work out everyday on my eliptical machine.  I think what the diet does initially is wean your body off of sugar and your dependence on it.  I can understand how it is meant to \\"re-design your eating habits and help you permanently stabilize your weigh\\" (quote from the Dukan website).  After only 3 1/2 weeks, I am not craving junk like I did before, and have stopped snacking as I am not as hungry.  One of my difficulties with many weight loss programs is that I cannot have any sugar substitute products because they give me very bad migraines.  Dukan allows these, but I just go without the sweet at all, and have been doing fine.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is finally tired of thinking and calculating how to achieve weight loss, and wants results.      I have bought both the Kindle addition and the actual book. I would agree that the book can sometimes be repetitious, but the information is very easy to understand and implement.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I hate to say it since I love Lady Gaga but this album is very disappointing. I loved just about every single track that came from her first 2 albums, but with this one she's changing her sound and I just don't care for the change, at all. I actually bought the \\"Special Edition\\" 2 CD set and out of 17 songs (not counting the remixes on the second disk) there's only 1 song I love and then 2 others that I just like. \\"Scheibe\\" is the one song that sounds like something from her earlier 2 albums and I love it! Great dance song with a funky sound and some fun lyrics. \\"Americano\\" and \\"Government Hooker\\" are the other 2 that I just like. They're good-but-not-great songs.    And that's it. The rest of the album is just \\"eh\\". This new sound is a little harsher and more rock-oriented, to my ears anyway, and that is not what I want to hear from \\"Mother Monster\\". It's her career and her choice, obviously, and if this is the way she wants to go now, so be it. I'll just be very sad to lose what was once a great artist for some very fun and different dance-oriented music.
0132350882|5.0|Reading this book will demonstrate just how bad your current code-writing is.  Then you will start making small improvements, such as clean, understandable function and variable names (it may take you several iterations to get it right!)  At that point, re-read the book again and again until you write clean code.    It is definitely worth it.  As the book states, it will take sweat to learn to write clean code.  This wasn't taught when I went to college.  It may not even be taught now.    Following the precepts in this book will put you in the top 1/10 of 1% of coders.    There is no magic here.  Just guidance to lead you into hard work, that will eventually lead you into writing clean code.  Sorry, no magic formula.  Just numerous simple techniques, that if followed will turn you into a clean coder.    The code examples are in Java, but you can follow it if you know C#.    If you follow these techniques, you will have job security (as much as that is possible).
B0051QIGP4|5.0|There are a lot of Lady Gaga haters.  I'm not a star struck person but I not only like her music but what she stands for.  She stands up for what she believes.  There are actually a lot of great songs on this album and all for .99.. awesome!
B004IFYMYI|5.0|Much has been said about this groundbreaking film, and it would be hard to add anything new. It's an American masterpiece from a long-gone era. Anyone who has experienced the loneliness and isolation that Travis Buckle lives with in this film is bound to find something to connect to.     The Blu-ray is simply astounding. I've pirchased this on DVD twice before; the original 1999 Columbia release and the 2006(?) 2-disc release. The latter was a vast improvement on an already decent transfer, but the Blu-ray bests any and all previous formats. The colors are bold and strong, the grain is beautiful, and the detail is right in your face. If you want to see what 1970's NYC looked like, this is a must buy.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|One of the best books I have read lately. I listened to the book on tape in my car and frequently found myself in my driveway listening well past my arrival at home. Truly enjoyable.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I just wanted to write a review of Amazon MP3 store and the new Cloud player.  I read a lot of negative reviews due to the fact that it was difficult to download Born This Way yesterday for $.99.  I also had difficulty but it wasn't because Amazon isn't a good place to get music.  What did people expect when they offered the new Lady Gaga album for 99 cents!?  I waited patiently and the whole album finally downloaded.  I also bought a couple of other songs with no problems.  This was my first Amazon music experience and I love it!  Way better than iTunes when it comes to price and selection.  My sister has used Amazon to download music for sometime and has had no problems.  I would ask those who had a bad experience yesterday to give Amazon music another try.  It's totally worth it and not only could I add my new music to my iPod, I can also access my cloud player with all my Amazon music from any computer, anywhere!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|If you are going to offer a special it would be nice if it was delivered. Yes it was only 99 cents, but how many customer's 99 cents were collected and still have not received the download. Try contacting Amazon, it's impossible. I would suggest to any one else who has not received the download to write your local authorities. Maybe it would prompt Amazon to put up a real contact point.
0061537969|3.0|The book would never rank with \\"must reads\\". It's a good book around a fireplace and then it's over. It is an interesting perspective to see life through the eyes and heart of a dog and it is well written.
B002JVWRAO|1.0|This was the season where Kripke chickened out and reversed himself in order to deal with the fact that there would be more seasons than planned.  Too afraid to send both brothers to Hell or kill one off permanently, and too scared of the public to go with the fact that like 90% of Lucifer's criticisms of his universe's angelic hierarchy were 100% true, he invented a third brother we never heard of before so that we would have a spare floating around.  He decided that Kali needed a human to rescue her, even the good gods in other religions are all demons who all like to eat humans, and killed off almost every interesting supporting character except Bobby.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have been listening to this for almost two days now and it is addicting.  She has a voice that is so unique and colorful.  She can touch your soul if you let her. There is a depth there that is not heard [Set Fire to the Rain] very often by current artists.  I look forward to her next set of songs.  Keep up the GREAT work Adele ~~
1400052181|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It held my attention from beginning to end.  The author did such justice to Henrietta's family with patient compassion for over a decade.  Thinking back to 1951, when Henrietta died of cervical cancer and the fact that we knew so little and how much we have overcome.  It is unbelievable that HeLa, Henrietta's cells, are all over the world now and have done such great things. This was a very captivating read.
006112429X|4.0|Yes, there are plot holes! Yes, the forshadowing is heavy-handed!  And yes, I'll admit, I did roll my eyes at the predictability of events...and I still enjoyed reading this novel! The narrator's character is so perfectly crafted, her voice so compelling and sympathetic, I had to keep reading, in spite of the big-time flaws in this novel.      So, here are just a few of my gripes:  A man so eager to be a father would NEVER reject his daughter; Franklin would have been overjoyed to have a little Celia. A woman as intelligent as Kevin's mother would NEVER let things get so bad before seeking professional help; she suspected Kevin felt no empathy from the time he was little, and didn't feel a dog would be safe in the family.  But she let Celia stay at home alone with him?  Not likely.  A person capable of Kevin's actions would NEVER express regret or remorse, so the ending was a little disappointing for me.    And--oh, my Gosh--do you think little Kevin is going to mess up those maps during that conveniently-timed phone call?  There were way too many moments like this.      Yup, lots of flaws, way-too-predictable moments, and unbelievable actions on the part of the characters.  And I STILL couldn't stop reading, and I STILL ate up the story and was wishing for more, because the writing is so well-crafted and Mrs. Khatchadourian is so genuine and fascinating.  I liked hearing her story set against the backdrop of real events, I was interested in her opinions about modern life in America, and I truly felt for her as she spoke of her many losses.      Sometimes, it's OK to just enjoy a book because it's a great read.  This was my first Lionel Shriver novel and I plan to read more.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|The album definitely exceeded my expectations and the fact that it was only $0.99 made it even cooler! I think everyone should buy this album, even if you're not a Lady Gaga fan! Chances are, you'll like at least one song on this album and the price for one song on iTunes is as much as $1.29!    At first I was a bit cautious about purchasing this because I knew that it was going to be in the Cloud. In other words, the music would be available on the internet and it wouldn't be on your computer taking up space (like your iTune's Library). After pressing the purchase button I realized that I could have just added all of the songs to my YouTube playlist and saved a dollar. However, Amazon's Downloader allows for us to download the songs onto our computers and into our iTunes library, which can later be placed on portable devices!     This is not a gimmick! Buy it while the offer lasts!
0374531269|5.0|The book that I read is called \\"A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier,\\" by Ishmeal Beah. I can honestly say that I like this book. This is one of four books that I've read in my life (not counting the Dr. Seuss-type books). I am the type of person who is not interested in reading at all. The main thing that sticks out to me about this book is the fact that it is an autobiography, and that it is reality. In my life, I have only read about three and a half books (excluding this one). Those books are Bud, Not Buddy by Christopher Paul Curtis, The Rose That Grew From Concrete by Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre: The Biography by Ronin Ro, and half of The Measure Of A Man by Sidney Poitier. I would also recommend these books as well, but that is beside the topic. The point I wanted to prove with that was that not many books interest me, but this one did.<br /><br />As I stated before, the thing that kept me interested about this book was the fact that it was reality. I don't really like fake things in general, so the fact that this book was non-fiction was a positive. I also like how Beah used such detail when describing events that went on in his life, from how things looked, to how it made him feel. It really makes imagery pop up, and makes you imagine how he felt and the pain he was going through. The environment Beah grew up in became a crucial place to live. \\"People stopped trusting each other, and every stranger became an enemy. This was one of the causes of the Civil War.\\" This book was about how he fled rebels attacking his hometown in Sierra Leone when he was twelve. By thirteen, the government army had picked Beah up and he became one of an estimated 300,000 soldiers. When he was sixteen he was removed from war by UNICEF (an organization that provides developmental assistance to families in developing countries). The UNICEF people and staff at his rehabilitation center helped Beah regain his humanity.<br /><br />Lastly to sum the book up, Beah discusses what war and death looked like through his eyes. He tells the whole entire book from a first-person point of view. Throughout the book, he goes into some gruesome details, but the book is still interesting.<br /><br />I read about four reviews on Amazon.com and all of them had the same opinion as me, so yes, I agree with them. I recommend this book to anybody fourteen and up who enjoys autobiographies or is just looking for an interesting read. The book is kind of slow, but if you stick with it you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Senior English Student 2011ke through his eyes.

0439023513|1.0|I've waited for this book for a year and immediately after I read it, I wished I hadn't. I know some people like it and I'm glad they are able to appreciated it. To me it feels like an entirely different book from the last two as if it was written by a ghost writer. Details are the same but the tone is shockingly different. It's like the writer got really depressed and changed the ending. I'm not opposed to darker books, but you have to feel what it is from the very beginning. The first two books seemed to be about finding beauty, bravery, and humanity even in the worst of people and circumstances. Katniss and Peeta seemed to be really coming into their own and when they got knocked down they found ways to cope, like with Peeta's painting and the way they learned to lean on each other and comfort each other because of their shared experiences. I thought that would continue. I thought Katniss and Peeta would be the frontrunners in the revolution and use all of their gifts and charisma to help create a different world and then spend their lives making sure it continued to progress.<br /><br /> What happened was........not that. Everything I loved about the books was systematically destroyed. In the first two books Peeta and Prim work as the sort of moral center and balance out the cynicism. In this book both character are destroyed and cynicism reigns. The character of Peeta is practically gone. His love for Katniss and most of his other good qualities are perverted by the brainwashing and never return to their original state. Katniss pretty much abandons him for little or no reason even though he seems to be the main reason she is so out of it at first. Their reunion at the end is so disappointing that I almost wish they had just stayed apart. Katniss does nothing, is nothing, and the whole reason that the revolution started ( Katniss's sacrifice to save her sister) is made completely meaningless. The whole ending would be about 50% more satisfying if that one detailhad been changed. Prim's death is the reason her mother and gal desert her in despair and most of the reason why she looses all hope for life in the end, not the war or the hunger games. It also seemed like a bit of a cop out because Kat never had to choose between Gale and Peeta. She never really made any kind of choice at all. Gale left and Peeta refused to leave.<br /><br />  The whole message seems completely different from the first two books. If anything is nihilistic, this is. If you want to write something like that, fine. But don't put it in a children's book and don't make it seem at first to be a different kind of book than it is. I don't need a triumphant fairytale ending from every book I read but When I pick up a children's book or young adult novel, that usually is what I'm looking for. It almost feels like a joke. You thought there could be true healing and personal triumph after trauma. Well, there can't. You though downtrodden people could unite and change things for the better, mostly they can't. You thought that the lives of individuals could be meaningful and noble even in the face of war, they can't. What's the point of telling this to children? What was the point of the false wind up? Ugh, it reminds me of the end of A Series of Unfortunate Events. How can people that depressed even get enough motivation to write books.<br /><br />Despite what I've said, I think the first two books are lovely and it is a good series. I probably would like Mockingjay better if I'd read it without reading the first two books. It's just way different than I expected and hoped. I hope others will find more to appreciate in it than I did.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Lets be serious here, the rating system here is for the album, NOT for the technical difficulty, so all yall 1 star giver needs to chill out!    I myself only have 2 songs showing up in my cloud downloader, but for 99 cents, you can't complain...     Just think about it, it cost $1.29 alone for one song at iTunes, you get the whole album for less than the cost of one song!    Of course its amazon's fault for not being ready for such a massive volume of download.     Review:  Much different from that of other gaga's song. This album is more dance oriented and has some very catchy beats(ke$ha). A lot of the songs sound very much like Madonna's, but with gaga's own twist. I still personally like her first and second album more, but I like her new approach and her experiments. The only thing I really dislike about this album is the freaky looking album cover.
0792165020|3.0|I preferred Purple Noon better, the French adaptation. Purple Noon is not as long and it has a different unsuspected ending. I was also surprised that homosexuality was heavily injected into Ripley for it did nothing to further the story or heighten the thrill??
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Took me almost an hour of retrying to get the whole album downloaded.  I got so fed up I didn't even have time to listen because it took so long to get it completed. Not a very good showing for my 1st try at the Amazon service.
0300169787|5.0|This book is quite big - a perfect coffee table book. The paper is good quality, the picture on the front is really cool. Now for the inside - there are many close up and full length photos of McQueen's work, alongside many quotes from him. There are a couple of forewords, and there's a quite long and very decent interview with Sarah Burton. SO worth the money, seriously. If you love fashion and/or McQueen, you'll love this.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Yes, it took over two hours and 3 tries to get all of the songs downloaded, but overall worth the frustation for the great price!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Great album! It's too bad that people are giving it lower ratings due to downloading issues, not based on the quality of the music. Take a listen -- you won't be able to keep from dancing!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I had the opportunity to hear clips of all the songs late last week and I could not wait for the release of this album. Thanks to Amazon for the opportunity to purchase at such a low price. Technology can fail us, and I am grateful for the good deal! Even if I had to wait for the kinks to be ironed out. It was worth the wait. This is one album, in its entirety, that will be played again and again.

B0051QIGP4|3.0|I have listened to it. It is alright. For a dollar I can only complain so much. The only thing that irks me is amazon selling the edited versions of things and not letting us all know they are edited. It may be a ploy for more money. It may just be ignorance. The one thing it is not is fair and right to the consumer.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I woke up at 6:30 this morning and did the same thing I always do, grabbed my Android powered HTC EVO and downloaded my Free App of the Day from the amazon Android Market, then used the amazon mp3 app to get the free song of the day, and there it was... $.99 for the Born This Way Album! A-mazing, hit the button to buy, a few minutes later, turned on my computer went to amazon, launched my cloud player, the whole album was there, sent it to windows media player, then synced with my mp3 player, listened to Lady Ga Ga all day! No problems at all. And oh, the album is everything I expected it to be, A-mazing!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Bought the album.  Six of the tracks appeared in my Cloud Drive music collection within a minute.  After more than 8 hours the others still aren't available to me, even for download.  Recommend not buying with the Cloud Drive option!
0811870413|5.0|I have been working on trying to bake really good artisan style bread for years and I've bought several excellent books to help me get there.  This one is the best!  I've had limited success using a combination of a baking stone, pouring water in a heated pan underneath the baking loaves and spraying the sides of the oven.  Tarntine adopts a much easier and incredibly consistent and successful process.  With a fairly wet dough and a combo cooker, the steam created by the bread dough creates the perfect environment to create that wonderful crusty crust we love.  I've made over a dozen loaves of bread over the past few weeks and they have all been delicious.  I also love the detailed explanation of how things work so the recipes can be changed slightly for different results.  My family loves sourdough bread and as explained in the book, leaving the dough for a day or so in the refrigerator, then finishing the proofing process create a more sour loaf.  I've recommended this book or bought copies for several friends.  If you only buy one bread book, this is the one to get.  1/1/12 Updating this review:  I've continued to make bread at least weekly using the recipe from this book.  My starter has gotten more stable with age and it only takes one loaf given to a friend to convince them to buy the book and start making their own bread.  The only downside is that it's turned me into a total bread \\"snob\\".  I go to restaurants which are \\"known\\" for making their bread and think, \\"my bread is better than this\\".  I won't even bother with grocery store french bread.  There are only a few bakeries which make better bread than I can make at home and the closest one is 50 miles away.  I also find the recipes for using \\"leftover bread\\" almost laughable.  I'd probably have to make it every other day to have bread leftover and working fulltime makes that difficult.  If you love making delicious bread, get this book!
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Why are so many of the critical reviews comparing this to Independence Day?  Here is the similarity.   ALIENS ATTACK.     Here are the POSITIVE differences.  More comprehensible plot.  No Will Smith.  No Jeff Goldblum.  No Randy Quaid.  AND NO BILL PULLMAN!!!!!  No crappy acting.  No lame casting.  No campy story line with heroes toasting cigars.  Etc.  Etc.   Etc.    This movie was not a cinematic lobotomy like Indepence Day.   And thank God.   It was just a simple, well paced, marines v. Aliens battle.  The only thing unbelievable about it was that the aliens actually showed up here.   But if you accept that premise as fiction...which is what the movie is...and don't look at it like a pretentious film critic, Oscar snob, wannabe...you may actually like it.  That is if you like action.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|The server issues on amazon shouldn't affect the quality of the review for this album. We love Lady Gaga, and are enjoying this album. It did take hours to download, but it was worth it for the $.99 price!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|First run through of the album and there certainly are some very different sounds on it.  Can see why some people don't like it - but I think it's great. Can even stomach \\"You and I\\" even though it's certainly NOT my kind of music.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|For years, I have heard people say, \\"If Lady Gaga is as 'different' as she claims to be, why is her music so mainstream?\\" Finally, I can point them to Born This Way. It highlights everything great about Gaga. Every song on the CD lets you hear the different sides of her and the emotions she deals with. She sounds so real and easy to identify with. Like other reviewers have said before me, don't expect the Fame or the Fame Monster. She has really laid it all out for people to hear, and you either appreciate it or you don't. I would honestly give this more than 5 stars if I could, so I'm definitely recommending it.
B001UFQNF0|2.0|I had high hopes for this toy...but I ended up getting two things instead.  1. A time machine that doesn't work. 2. Not the time machine I ordered.  Instead of the BTTF 2 time machine that flies, (in the movie), I received an inoperable time machine from BTTF 1.  I will say that the detail was great..and I would have kept it except for that it didnt work.  It doesn't help that the box the car is packed in...not the shipping box..but the actual toy box....looks like it has been sitting on a dusty shelf since 1985.  Sorry...sending back for a refund.
B00026WU82|5.0|Scorned by his politically-conscious faction, who'd initially pinned him as their idol, for going electric and becoming a renegade. Their disdain did nothing to derail Dylan's intent and herein lies the album where he met a critical challenge. As a linguistics enthusiast he built the template and opened up the world of potential in songwriting, making it as viable as poetry. On musical grounds, the other great boast he can claim his own is the invention of Rock. It's here that he perfected his electric Chicago blues using rock aesthetic to fit into the mold of his wordplay. This realization would have been inconceivable without the contributions of lead guitarist and comrade Mike Bloomfield. Part of Dylan's genius is he knew instinctively that this was the man to commission.<br /><br />Never more in his career did Bob capture the tenor of the times than on \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", the most intuitive anthem in rock that was completed in a one-day session. Each time the verses and the chorus of \\"How does it feel?\\" arrived, they unearthed the deepest sources of his indictment of elitism. Generations later, this anthem of all anthems remains as bracing and as relevant as ever. His cynicism surfaced again in \\"Ballad of A Thin Man\\" whose opaque references darted at a journalist were darn near impossible to decode. Because the banging piano chords were so apt in driving the contents of its message, it eventually clicked.<br /><br />The Dylan-Bloomfield axis attained its summit on the blues shuffle \\"It Takes A Lot to Laugh, It Takes A Train to Cry\\" and on two briskly-paced blues \\"From A Buick 6\\" and \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\". The frisson in Dylan's vocals on his literary surrealism and Bloomfield's blistering axe solos made these positively intoxicating.<br /><br />But it's the last track, \\"Desolation Row\\", that was so terminal that in no way could it have been slotted elsewhere. Arguably (or not), this could be the greatest song in his entire canon in which he easily headed that list of greatest songwriters. Dylan painted abstract moods of numerous characters in a sonic Wasteland that was enormous in its scope. T.S. Eliot received special mention here as part of his intrepid Beat concept of the apocalypse. Dylan was ably backed by Nashville guitarist Charlie McCoy on acoustic who provided an addicting counterpoint to his own acoustic strumming.<br /><br />Hook-by-hook and line-by-line, every song resonates to this day. As usual he took a right at the light and took off with his own unfettered instincts to find personal freedom. This rationale secured his status as the catalyst of the rock album becoming an artistic entity and the birth of its consciousness.

B004YM67TI|2.0|I would have watched Twilight. Not only is this not a \\"Twilight\\" version of Red Riding Hood, it's really.. just a bunch of ideas thrust together in an attempt to make a Twilight version of Red Riding Hood.<br /><br />There were probably a dozen ways to make this movie better, and the writer didn't bother. It's one of those movies where the story absolutely sucks, and no matter how many great actors you have in it, they can't save what they're in.<br /><br />Don't bother buying. If you must, rent it through netflix or redbox.

B001HBYHFA|5.0|this series was amazing- great writing, acting, and a cool concept. however, the networks choose, over and over again, shows about fat people getting yelled at, people airing all (and i mean all) of their dirty laundry for some screen time, and self involved celebrities-for-no-reason blathering on and on about minutiae in their lives and trying to make it sound important and noteworthy.<br /><br />what came first- did the TV viewer become stupider or did stupid TV make him that way?<br /><br />anyway, Firefly/Serenity will live on. in DVDs.
B004V7EW66|5.0|I've been listening to this album for about 6 weeks, now, and I've reached my conclusion: A classic. Probably Simon's best. Better even than Graceland. I've learned from listening to the songs written by my singer, songwriter son that a song doesn't necessarily tell you what the writer believes; it tells you what they were feeling at the time they wrote the song. Still, Simon expresses amazement at the beauty of life, the gift of love, and, yes, the grace of God. It's hard to say which are my favorite songs, but \\"Rewrite\\" moves me every time I hear it: 'I said, \\"Help me! Help me! Help me! Thank you! I had no idea that you were there. I said \\"Help me! Help me! Help me! Thank you, for answering my prayer.\\"' \\"Afterlife\\" is both hilarious (heaven organized like the DMV) and heartbreaking (Why does God make it so hard to find Him?). But almost every song is amazing and worth multiple hearings. Just wishing that I'd been able to make one of the concerts that have been getting such great reveiws. Maybe he'll extend the tour. If you buy the album it's a good idea to read a bio of Simon's life. It's impossible not to see both the heatbreak and the redemption in the music and the lyrics.
B004IFYN2Y|1.0|NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER<br />This is one of the worst BluRays I've ever bought.<br />The movie is boring, it could had been much better with the plot they had, it's slow and confusing.<br />What I hated the most was the audio, the special effects are way too loud and the dialoge is not loud enough as to understand.<br />I understand why Sean Penn and Naomi Watts took this movie, there was a lot to be done with the plot but in the end between the editor and the sound engineers managed to come up with PURE CRAP.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|I think the X Grip is a useful device that allows you to comfortably change the grip of your camera.  The implication of increased stability in the product description and related reviews may indicate to some that there is some sort of passive or active stabilization effect introduced by the X-Grip.  There is nothing that adds stability in this device except that it sometimes may reduce the shake of an awkward position.  The X-Grip is a hard plastic C-shaped grip with a padded handle to which you attach your camera in variable places that may allow you to hold your camera at a different angle or position than what is normally your comfortable vertical or horizintal position.  If you are a photographer of some experience, you have already figured out how to grip your camera and place your body in ways that best capture your subject, even if it is uncomfortable for a period of time.  The X-Grip is a device that requires one to learn how to use changes in grip.  But, when you experiment with different positions afforded by the X-Grip, the shutter button and other controls on your camera which were designed to be ergonomic and within the reach of certain fingers when the camera is held in a normal fashion, may not be positioned in a practical place when the X-Grip is used.  So while I think the X-Grip may bring improved camera holding positions with respect to the lens and its relationship with the subject, those positions may make adjustments to the camera very difficult.  I have found that there are some positions that give a better perspective of the subject, but such framing takes additional time to adjust your camera because the controls are in an relatively unfamiliar location.  Overall, I have to rate the X-Grip with 3 stars because it is not an improvement in the process of all the pictures you take, and the time it may take to change your camera to the X-Grip mount could cause you to lose a great image.  But, its grip is capable of holding the camera in a position that would be very difficult to do manually and could make some pictures better because of the unusual possibilities of placing the lens in relation to the subject at an angle or position that would be difficult manually.  I think that the grip and control access issue means that you have to make a decision as to whether to incorporate the X-Grip in all of your pictures, or none of your pictures.  Shifting back and forth is time consuming, from the mechanical change in mount and the required change in camera adjustment.  I have decided to use it on my various cameras for a few months and then make a decision which is best for me.  So I believe I owe an update because I have not taken a stronger position on the value of this product.ion that would be very difficult to do manually and could make some pictures better because of the unusual possibilities of placing the lens in relation to the subject at an angle or position that would be difficult manually.

B001AQMBNC|5.0|THIS IS WHAT A MOVIE FROM THE 80's SHOULD LOOK LIKE ON BLURAY<br />The audio is amazing, beats a lot of the audio in recent movies made for BluRay.<br />The image is flawless.<br />The DTS 5.1 HD (feels like 7.1) comes in English, French and Portuguese but it also has 5.1 Standard in Spanish.<br />Subtitles in a variety of Languages.<br />CONGRATULATIONS!<br />I think this should be the standard for old movies brought to High Definition.<br /><br />By the way, the movie is pretty good too.
B003YBUSMW|5.0|I am blown away with how awesome this racing wheel is.  I've used a couple of different racing wheels for plain X-box, Playstation, and Wii.  I decided it was time to get one for the X-box 360.  This is by far the nicest racing wheel I've ever seen.  It's very sturdy and just feels great to use.  It does not have feedback, but I hate feedback in any gaming device and always try to turn them off, so that is a plus for me.  The pedals are spring-loaded and have a very realistic feel.  The wheel itself has the substantial feel I wanted.  There are so many buttons and options.  It feels fancy and nice.  The only part I'm not too fond of is the gear shift.  It seems too simple and a little off compared to the rest of the wheel. Still this is so much fun, and I would definitely recommend it.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Thank you Amazon for the amazing deal!!  Wow, I can't believe Lady Gaga's entire new album was $.99.  Yes, it took one day to get everthing to download  but it was well worth the wait.  Thanks everyone for the reviews yesterday so I knew why this wasn't downloading.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|The idiots cancelled Stargate Atlantis for this cheap, poorly written, poorly acted, poorly filmed rip-off of Battlestar Galactica. Okay, Atlantis wasn't great, I even hated it at first, but I got around to watching it, and it was 10 times better than this shaky-cam soap opera which stole the brand name of 'Stargate.' It has nothing to do with either series which came before it, nor the movie. It is full of utter stupidity, and they wasted time, talent and money making this crap. I hope to god this isn't the end of Stargate, but thank god it is the end of Stargate SGU.  I've never been more pissed off about a sci-fi franchise in my life, this idiotic mess was doomed from the beginning, and the appearance of Jackon, RDA, and Carter are nothing short of disturbing and bizarre...as if they'd re-written their characters in order to stick them in this crapfest.     Lost was better than this idiocy.
0679805273|5.0|I sent a card with lines from the Suess book when my grandson graduated from high school; - this year he graduated with honors from college so I gave him the whole book and he difinetly \\"got it\\".  I saw him go through the pages at least twice during the evening.  He worked very hard in high school and college and he just was awarded a fellowship to study further.  It's the greatest way to tell someone if they work hard, greater things that you can imagine will happen.
B0042LJTQO|5.0|If you are considering this set, be aware that the same works are available in Brendel's 1970s classic recordings on another fairly cheap box set, this from 2008, which you can find e.g. on German Amazon: [...]. This seems to be more or less the same as the 1996 \\"The Art of Alfred Brendel\\" release.  Some Brendel fans will prefer the earlier set (which does also include one CD from the digital versions). If you're not familiar with the pianist, maybe you should do some comparative listening before you buy. Some people appear to find A.B. dour, grey, even boring, whereas followers appreciate how he takes e.g. Schubert every bit as seriously as he does Beethoven, thereby perhaps missing out on some of the \\"Viennese charm\\" that some people don't want to be without, but gaining so much more in other respects.    I heartily recommend Brendel, this or the older version, and Kempff, and Uchida.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|The releases of Hair and Edge of Glory as singles almost had me convinced that Born This Way would disappoint, but I'm very impressed now that the entire album is out.  Unlike The Fame, I feel like I can appreciate nearly every song on the album.  Although I don't expect any of the songs to be as big of a hit as Bad Romance, I feel like several of them (Bloody Mary and Scheiße especially) are nearly just as good as Bad Romance, only lacking qualities that would make them ideal candidates for singles.  Hope she keeps up the good work.  Absolutely worth even regular price.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|There are a few select movies that I add to my collection to have on hand. This is one. Nelson Mandella is so inspiring as he leads South Africa out of difficult times and unites them as a nation. The subject matter is thought provoking and the acting is excellent. Thumbs up!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Am loving the album so far! Lots of high energy songs in a variety of musical styles and all of them typical, danceable Gaga. I love the mariachi style of Americano, the rock edge of Electric Chapel, the country twang of You and I. They're all excellent. Highly recommended.

B0051QJ83S|1.0|for 0.99 cents that is paying 0.98 more cents more than what it is worth!!! TERRRIBLE AND CHEESY SONGS. do not buy. not worth it if it was FREE. such and untalented copycat she is. do not buy this garbage.  I had NO TROUBLE downloading this mess, the ALBUM is Simply HORRIBLE.  I had the entire mess of 'work\\" or copies of other people's work that she did in less than 5 minutes..it's a CRAPPY album with a lot of CRAPPY hype. the production is terrible, the lyrics are terrible. she is terrible..so it all goes hand in hand.YUCK.

0316098329|5.0|ROOM is an uncomfortable, heartbreaking, wonderful book.  It's one of those books that I picked up expecting one thing, but got something completely different.  I did not expect a five year old narrator throughout the entire story and, frankly, it took some time to get past the narrator's voice and sentence structure, etc., but once past the first twenty pages, the book simply flew by.  I literally could not put it down.    There were a few areas that drew me out of the book - the fact that a five year old manages to outwit an adult and escape into a world he never knew existed was one of those areas, but it needed to happen to move the story forward.  The other area that made me wonder was how easily Jack was sent to live with the grandparents while Ma was recovering - I'm not sure that would actually happen in real life, but the story didn't suffer because of it.    I think that the author did a terrific job of seeing the world through the eyes of a five year old captive. I think she also did a wonderful job of giving us insight into what Ma's life was like before and after with just a few brush strokes in her writing.  The biggest drawback to me for this book was the breastfeeding - I literally became queasy each time it was mentioned after the first two or three times, and I'm not sure if that was the intention of the author.  It was such a huge part of the book, so that would be the only negative (IMHO).    But overall, I think ROOM was a wonderful story told with tenderness and love and it shows how strong the bonds of love and family are, even in the most horrific of circumstances.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|This was a boring book, something I've never said about other Connelly novels.  He even found a way to insert McConaghy's name into the text.  I prefer to see McConaghy in Dolce Gabbana ads.  I can't see him as Mickey Haller.  Haller loves his first ex-wife.  McConaghy?  He loves himself, especially his bare chest.    It looks like Connelly got to the end and didn't know how to finish, so he came up with a McGuffin--the absent husband.    Furthermore this book was loaded with cliches and details about courtroom procedure.  I don't knpw if I can believe Haller as a prosecutor.  Maybe Connelly decided he'd also rather see McConaghy as a Dolce Gabbana model.

B0039UTDA6|1.0|Great photography and, I suppose, interesting information.  However, I cannot listen to Oprah's dialogue very long.  It's like she's talking to a first-grade class.  Just whose idea was that?
0763644765|3.0|This is a cute book and my 18 mo son loves it. But the language is also pretty vague and in reading the book I have to fill in a lot of blanks. For example, throughout the book it refers to \\"I have to go\\" rather than \\"I have to pee\\"... Where does he have to go? I have to do a lot of translating that go means pee, and what the meaning of the cat and dog are. It's a nice book but think of it more as a potty-comic than a potty-book.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|Lady Gaga is 'family friendly' controversy ... so people can feel edgy while still feeding the pop megamachine ...    I grabbed this for my kids, and we got 8 songs (more than many) and they like a couple of songs so it was worth $1.  But on whole it is pop trash - her earlier stuff showed some spark, but this is all safe and same-sounding.

0345529057|5.0|I am always hesitant when it comes to reading fantasy...Tolkien is my favorite author of all time, and so many books fall short of being even remotely entertaining when compared against his work.  That said, this is one of the best written, most addictive series I have ever read.  I borrowed the first book from a friend and finished it in days.  I was so ethralled I went ordered the last two from Amazon and picked book 2 up (Clash of Kings) from my local bookstore.  The downside is that these books were so good that I have finished them, and now find myself wanting more.  Pre-order Martin's next book coming out this summer!  Plot twists, deep character development, political intrigue, and bloody battles are just a few of the surprises that await the reader.  If you enjoy the books, HBO has also started a series based on the first book, with a second season for the second book in the works.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I was surprised when I got a notification via email from Amazon that they would exclusively be selling Lady Gaga's album for 99 cents for one day only. I like Gaga as an artist, and I especially like a lot of her earlier songs, but I would not have ever pictured myself ordering her album. Though I do not buy a lot of albums, I always like having the physical disc, especially since I have a car now. I still did not consider it until I spoke with my older sister, and knowing that I could not resist a good bargain, it was a 'why the hell not' situation.<br /><br />I have to say that there are a lot of singles in this album that I enjoyed. Since a lot of reviewers have already individually critiqued each song, I'm just going to scan most and speak of which ones I enjoyed the most. The first track was Americano. I loved it right away. I've always loved Latin/Spanish music, though mostly in the Afro-Cuban or salsa genre, but this song was fun and reminiscent of some of the authentic Spanish style music. When I listen to this song, I could picture a Flamenco or Paso Doble performance to this song. It's a really fun song.<br /><br />I also like Marry the Night. The ending is the best part for me.<br />The only ones that I could say that I am not hot over at the moment are highway unicorn and Schei&szlig;e. Hair is a song I could get used to, and although I did NOT like Edge of Glory, it has definitely grown on me, considering it's constant airplay on the radio.<br /><br />You and I is a pretty good song as well, and an excellent track to end the cd to. I could see her doing a mellow video to this, at least for her fans, that is reminiscent of her journey in music before she became Lady Gaga. I could see her singing this in a bar somewhere.<br /><br />Overall I think this was a solid album. There are not a lot of songs that I would skip at all, and I think regardless of those who want to not like her or whatever, this album will be plenty for those who are her target audience, and for those of whom will appreciate her. I'm honestly just glad I got it for a great price. Can't beat that :)<br /><br />I also want to say that Amazon did a great job on this promotion. I don't know the specifics on how they in fact got it done, but they allowed a lot of people to buy this album that otherwise may not have (like myself) and it was great strategy on their part. It also opened people up to the cloud, which I was not familiar on, and will still need to learn on how to use.<br /><br />Favs: Americano, Marry the Night, Bloody Mary<br />Songs I could do without: Schei&szlig;e, Highway Unicornte her.

B0051QIGP4|2.0|I downloaded this album very fast without any delays. I love the album, I can't stop listening to it. I was afraid that this album would not be as good as her previous work, but I love the rich blend of sounds and for 99 cents I am not complaining. Where will you get such a great deal? Apple? I am going to download more music from Amazon I believe this is a far better alternative to the Itunes Store. Prices are cheaper and its the same music.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|All the 1 star reviews are from the server going down. Rating her album 1 star, doesnt hurt Amazon, it hurts Gaga's review of her album, making her album look bad.  So don't rate the 1 star if Amazon pissed you off, rate it for the music if you liked or not.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Great tunes, Gaga!  Very catchy!    (Also loving Amazon Mp3 and CloudPlayer, but that's not what the 5 star rating is all about)
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Thank you so much to Amazon for listing this at 99 cents yesterday.  I must admit, I was getting worried that I would only have 3 songs, but you know what, 3 for 99 cents is still a deal.  I woke up today and 24 hours later, I have the whole album, which is surprising and awesome considering how many people were having trouble yesterday.  Still, the product is out of this world. It took me a long time to get to Gaga, and now that I'm in it, I can't stop. She is on top of her game, passionate, creative, and a wonderful artist.  This album is blowing my mind.
0875428940|5.0|The Robin Wood Tarot is a more than a redressing of the Rider Tarot into the pagan tradition.  It's one of those classic decks that deserves at least a second look, and should not be avoided by tarot collectors.<br /><br />The back of these cards are decorated with a celtic knot work in white and green over a black background.  These cards are bordered white, most of the time numbered and labeled at the bottom.  The imagery in these cards is realistic, but a bit cartoony at times.  Also, beware that a few of these cards show nudity, but this is done tastefully.<br /><br />The Major Arcana are mostly numbered and labeled at the bottom, often within a scroll.  The imagery in these cards follows a more pagan tradition.  For example, usually in many pagan/celtic oriented tarots, the devil is replaced with chains.  This tarot is no exception, where the standard imagery has been replaced with two naked people pulling a chained treasure toward the end of a tunnel.  In a twist, the chains form an upside-down pentagram.<br /><br />The pips in the Minor Arcana are numbered at the bottom within a white circle.  These cards integrate the standard imagery of swords, wands, cups or pentacles, but include no label as none is needed.  The court cards follow the standard labels of knave, knight, queen, or king also at the bottom.<br /><br />I recommend for beginners that favor Pagan over Christian imagery; and without a doubt, this is a must have for tarot collectors.  These cards come in a box which opens at the side like a chest, and includes a little white book.

B0030T1NAO|5.0|I am so into Breaking Bad.     I used to be entranced by the likes of Dexter and True Blood, but they were so fantastical that they were hard to believe. I guess Dexter MAYBE could possibly happen, but not TB of course. Breaking Bad is so much better. This could maybe even happen in real life. Some of the scenes are difficult to watch as they portray violent drug life, but are necessary to the plot and make it seem real. I can't wait for my Netflix to come in the mail now...the Blu-Rays are really fabulous.

0674057929|5.0|This book contains the story 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - in original typescript form.  This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it.  There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form.  After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down.  The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story.  There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes.  It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it.  If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I just bought the album and didn't have a single problem downloading it to Cloud or to my computer.  I don't know if this helps but maybe Amazon has fixed whatever issue there was.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|First and foremost - Shout out to Amazon & Lady Gaga for a \\"monsterific\\" deal.      I am not an official \\"little monster\\" but really enjoy her music.  I happened to stumble upon this deal when I was on Amazon for another purchase.  I couldn't pass it up!!    I bought it and got back to work - I know good things take time...  Thanks again - Amazon & Lady Gaga rock on!
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I've always been a lady gaga supporter and really loved her Monster album along w/ other tracks she came out with. After hearing Born this way and Judas, I realize I was no longer such a big supporter. I think the message for born this way is great, but the video freaked me out. Not liking the songs coming out from her, I decided it was not worth getting the album (even though I had anticipated it for months!). I even listened to the samples and decided,\\"yeh, for sure I'm not getting it.\\"    Anyways, long story short, I got it anyways b/c hello, it was selling for $0.99! I'm not going to say the album is amazing b/c I'm not in love w/ all the tracks. They all start to sound the same--very trance + pop. There are a few favorites like:     -you and I (the closest slow, piano song)  -electric chapel (slow rockish)  -Marry the night (pop and trance; very catchy)  -bad kids     I wish she added some slow, piano songs to make the album more diverse. I was able to download the entire album for $0.99 even though people were complaining about how this is a jip. Although, it didn't download properly like most times. In fact, the album kept downloading itself for at least 3x so now I have copies of the same songs 3x.     Anyway, I think this is a great deal for $0.99 cents. I don't know how she plans to make money selling like this but it was a great gift to give to her supporters/fans. Business-wise, pretty smart to allow the product to be super affordable so that it sells enough to make it to the charts.     And Lady GaGa fans need to chill out about commenting on people who give this album a one star. Some people love it, some people like it, some people don't. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|The album downloaded VERY quickly, and I had no problems. The only thing I had to figure out, was how to get it from Amazon Cloud to my iTunes, but even that went smoothly after some researching. 99 cents is definitely a bargain for a brand new, complete album, whether you think this is good album or not.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|Really good stuff, on first listen.  Lots of variety, Gaga isn't to be put in a box, stylistically.  She really does seem to have a magic touch and at this point in her career there hasn't been a single misstep.  Above and beyond the fashion, the outrage and the expert use of the media, Gaga will be around for a long time, because she knows how to write a very catchy song.  There are plenty of them here.
0439321603|5.0|It is every bit as interesting as a Harry Potter book mixed with a textbook. I found it a great fanciful read.
0877180121|5.0|I used to teach Piano based on this book.  Now many years after still is a great book for the kids to start with.  I highly recommand it!
B002ZG980U|5.0|Although the plot is somewhat complex at points, the entire movie comes together in the end to make a brilliant story. Each time I watch this movie, I pick up on new things I didn't catch the last time. I would highly recommend this movie!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|it had to grow on me like most of her music, but boy it has grown, i love the whole album.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Well after so many books and movie releases we Harry Potter freaks are almost at the end of our tither. Like any series the movies are always catching up with the book so there is always the unknown expectation that the movie will miss the mark as far as the story goes. Deathly Hallows however follows reasonably close to the book which I think is made easier because the producers could stretch it out over two movies, thus capture more closely to the story line then the other HP movies.  I still think however that given the intensity of the final book that part 1 missed some opportunities to nail it by digressing a little from the book and that was a bit disappointing.  The telling will be in part 2 when all the action really starts and if the producers don't capture it well then it will ruin the whole lot. Of all the movies in the series I rate this my favourite at this point.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was worried when i saw that this book was for grade 7 and up that it would be a bit young for my liking, however I really enjoyed this book!  I was able to read it in 3 days and did not want my bus ride to work in the morning to end so that I could keep on reading. An action packed book that does not leave any section dragging to long so that you get bored. I have already recommended this book to many other readers!
B004289ZW0|5.0|Works perfectly with the iPad. Easy to pair. GPS just as accurate as my panel mount. I have not found any issues turning it in and off. Read the directions. It helps.
B0000TB03W|4.0|Shania Twain is clearly an amazing entertainer who has accomplished so much throughout her career. She was the first person who changed country music, and she seems proud of the fact that she is quite different from a lot of the performers in country music history. This is a great concert film for any Shania fan or music lover, but I did notice there were some missing elements in this concert film. If you watch other concert films like \\"Tina Turner: One Last Time\\" or \\"AC/DC: Live at Donnington\\" you will notice there were quite a few bonus features. It could have been a nice touch to see some bonus interviews with the band or behind the scenes footage. I am surprised they didn't put the names of the band & crew members on the end credits, they were included in the original TV broadcast on NBC. All in all, I think Shania is a great performer, and this is the next best thing to experiencing a Shania concert. I hope to get my hands on tickets to her Caesars Palace concert in December 2012!
B0051QJ83S|5.0|Dear Amazon / Lady GaGa,  Thank you so much for the price break on the album.  After finding out that my debit card information was skimmed & I have charges that are not mine, I will have to fill out & file an affidavit of fraudulent charges before I can recover my funds, it was not looking like a good day.  But then I cruised into Amazon, lo and behold they have a brand new release for $0.99 for the entire album.  I found enough change in the cushions of the couch & was able to buy something that cheered me up.  Thanks for a great surprise ~ I sure did appreciate it.  The album is great.  Thanks to everyone that had a part in the price break for a great, brand new, hot off the presses tunes that I am enjoying as I write this!  This is the greatest thing that has happened all day, and very appreciated in the current economy!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I wasn't a Lady GaGa fan at first. But when I heard Bad Romance I was hooked. In my opinion this release is even better than her first cd. I can't get enough of Bloody Mary.    To all those that keep posting \\"1 star\\" reviews because of a donwload issue - I purchased and downloaded all songs to completion without any issue at all. Try to separate computer/download issues from what is intended for review here: the song & music content. Additionally, even if you only got 5 of 14 songs, isn't that still a great deal for only $0.99? A single download on iTunes is $1.29.
0439023521|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, after having had it recommended to me repeatedly over the last year.  Quick, but interesting read
B001RQ0SJO|2.0|I came to Bat For Lashes' album TWO SUNS because of the guest appearance by Scott Walker, one of my favourite musicians, as well as the praise given to Natasha Khan's project by innovative artists like Thom Yorke. I was deeply disappointed. Now before you vote that this review was unhelpful, consider that I believe that this album does have an audience and will make many people happy. But there may be others out there who, like I did, have certain expectations that won't be met.<br /><br />The bulk of the music is highly reminiscent of artists like Enya, Loreena McKennitt and, at the more upbeat moments, Stevie Nicks: it looks back to the 1980s more than it sounds like the future. While a touch of unusual electronic effects are used here and there, they take a back seat to Natasha Khan's storytelling (the singer has a double personality named Pearl, who dies at the end). The flow of TWO SUNS feels like a fairly conventional rock opera. Scott Walker's contribution is only a couple of lines of vocals on \\"The Big Sleep\\" that back Natasha Kahn's main vocals and aren't so audible in the mix. If you're expecting the bleak artistic vision of recent Scott Walker albums, well, there's none of that here.<br /><br />For me, with my particular tastes, TWO SUNS was very meh. If you think you share my tastes, caveat emptor.
B004SQS9FA|4.0|Just listened to this work for the first time. Not what I expected, so I was a bit thrown off. Having said that, I feel this body of work will grow on me.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|The music is and always will be as divisive as the talent. In this case Lady Gaga has people who react in one of two ways, either she's horrible or they respect her and enjoy her music. I love how reviews are saying it's a step backwards. A step backward from what? The lady is 25 and has 1 1/2 albums under her belt. Love or hate her the music is what's most important and this album shows it. I think a major problem people are having with this album is the sheer scale of sound. Unfortunately most casual listeners these days are listening to music through subpar methods such as unfortunate car stereos or even worse, the speaker of their cell phones. This album needs a soundsystem equipped to deal with noises of every possible octave and scale so those reading this review and for some reason hate this album, hit me up, I'll let you borrow a pair of headphones and you can take this album for a real spin. To all the other little monsters keep inspiring each other and to all the haters, thanks for not coming to the next show and ruining it for everyone else. PEACE!
B004NS710C|3.0|This was a okay rental. Glad I waited until then to see it. Very typical. The woman that plays Connie wasn't a beleivable actor. She loves playing with her hair...up & Down, Up & down. I wouldn't have gotten the HD version ether.
1439102724|4.0|I love this book! I think it has many lessons to be learned for people. Everybody should read this. I think it does a good job showing many different viewpoints on many different situations. It includes topics including but not limited to bisexual couples, music, embryo custody, court, family, love, parenthood (somewhat), growing into who you are, helping others, depression, religion, miscarriages, and so much more. It really shows how mean some Christians can get too (like somebody else said, they're the minority with the largest voice~ I'm a Christian, but I have the same idea as Zoe in that people should be able to all believe in what they want and not be judged) I also think it shows how emotionally hurtful so many things can be.    Quotes I liked:    \\"Sometimes when I sing, I close my eyes. There's harmony in every breath I take; the drums become my pulse, the melody is the flow of my blood. This is what it means to loose yourself in music, to become a symphony of notes and rests and measures.\\" (P.37)    \\"Some cognitive scientists believe human response to music provides evidence that we are more than just flesh and blood- that we also have souls.\\" (P. 18)    \\"No man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another, and thsi is all from which the laws ought to restrain him.\\" (Thomas Jefferson, featured in the book)    \\"Sometimes it's easier to speak to a stranger. The problem is that, once you turn your heart inside out for someone to see, the other person loses her anonymity.\\" (P.9-10)    \\"Isn't it a little upsetting that doctors call what they do \\"practice\\"?\\" (P.97)    \\"The music we listen to may not define who we are. But it's a damn good start.\\" (P.136)    \\"I'm not thinking, period. I'm just letting the music carry me, be me. I'm a thread of sound that slips like a stitch through every single person in this room, binding us tightly together.\\" (P. 147)    \\"Imagine if there was a pentatonic scale for life: if no matter what step you took, you could not strike a wrong not.\\" (P.159)    \\"The only difference between a wish and a prayer is that you're at the mercy of the universe for the first, and you've got some help with the second.\\" (P.296)    \\"When I reeled in , the bait was gone, and so was the striper. I was utterly deflated, and in that moment I understood why fishermen would wait all day to catch something: you have to understand what you're missing before you can really feel loss.\\" (P.327)    \\"Safety is relative. You can be so close to shore that you can practically feel it under your feet, when you suddenly find yourself breaking apart on the rocks.\\" (P.453)
0316069884|5.0|I became a vegetarian as a young child out of a black and white moral view of the world - causing pain was bad and how could eating an animal not be bad? I have recently been questioning whether or not eating eat was right for me. I no longer believe that animals straight up should never die to be eaten. After all, everything dies. But there are still the moral questions of whether or not they should die for human consumption when we can fairly easily survive eating things other than meat. And of course the environmental impact of raising so many animals for the increasing human population. Of course I think about the question of how these animals are raised and if it is in complete misery then of course I think they shouldn't be alive at all - afterall, most everyone believes in humane euthanasia. After struggling with these questions among others I bought \\"Eating Animals\\" on a whim at an airport one day and I am so glad I did. Jonathan Foer intelligently discusses (from a lay person's point of view) the moral dilemmas that arise from eating meat and whether or not they should stop us from doing so. The book provided me with researched answers to the questions I had been wondering about myself for some time. I thought this book was great and highly recommend it to anyone who just doesn't really know on which side of the fence they should fall.
0393327345|4.0|Not the best book, but I say to put down the bookmark because this book is best read in one sitting.  It doesn't work quite as well if you have to read it in smaller chunks.    Characters    The book focuses on two characters, the Narrator (whose name is never given) and Tyler Durden.  The book is told from the first-person view of the Narrator who hates his life and ultimately starts an underground club where two men fight \\"as long as they have to.\\"  Knowing the twist of the book from having seen the movie before didn't make it any less fun, but it was neat knowing what to watch for and focusing on the character.  The character is very believable even as things get completely out of hand later in the novel.    Setting    I don't think the exact city is ever mentioned, but it's a larger city somewhere in America.    Plot    The Narrator hates his job, hates his life, and suffers from insomnia.  He remedies this by going to meetings for those who suffer from various incurable diseases, which lets him sleep.  Eventually, he meets Tyler Durden and the two start Fight Club, which remedies the Narrators problem and gives him a sense of control over his life even though in reality it is falling apart around him.  The book ultimately expands this theme to Durden fighting against the established community trying to destroy the current society to create anarchy.    Enjoyment    I watched the movie a couple years ago, so I knew what the main plot twist was going to be.  Even knowing it, the book was still enjoyable.  My only complaint about the book is that it was very much a \\"stream of conscientiousness\\" type of read.  What I mean by this is that the book is best read in one sitting.  I started reading it yesterday and had to stop about halfway through the book, and it was difficult to get back into the book.  This is a slight weakness of the book, but it's not that much of a problem as the book is short enough to be realistically read in one sitting, which is what I'd suggest doing.    Overall Grade    Well written, but it should be read in one sitting, it falls apart a little if you have to read it in smaller chunks.    7/10    This and all of my reviews are available on my blog, check out my profile page for a link to my blog.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|The HBO / BBC TV series Rome, in two seasons, covers the behind the scenes events of the Roman Civil War. Act I brought Julius Caesar to power as dictator for life of the Republic, only to be assassinated on the senate floor. Act II is the alliance of Caesar's appointed heir, Octavian, with Caesar's former general and loyal ally, Mark Antony to defeat Pompey Maximus and the Senators. Act Three is when Mark Antony travels to his eastern half of the empire, becomes the lover of Cleopatra, and is finally defeated by Octavian and Marcus Agrippa.<br /><br />The obvious comparison of this series is with the famed series, I Claudius, which played on Masterpiece Theatre. The two series meld together perfectly, since Rome ends shortly after the battle of Actium, and I, Claudius opens with the celebration, 7 years later, of the victory at Actium by Augustus (nee Octavian), his wife Olivia, his daughter and son in law, and Marcus Agrippa. I, Claudius covers a period of unprecedented peace, often called Pax Augustus. \\"Rome\\" covers a period of almost constant civil war.<br /><br />Another big difference is that there are at least three intertwined circles where the action take place. The first is in the politics of the leaders, Caesar, Antony, Cicero, Cato, Pompey, Brutus, and Octavian. The second is between the houses of Caesar's niece, Atia of the Julii, and mother to Octavian versus Servilia, Caesar's lover, and mother of Marcus Brutus, one of Caesar's assassins. The third is in the lives of two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus, a centurion (lieutenant) and Titus Pullo, a legionnaire (private) in Caesar's elite 13th legion. These two men are actually mentioned in Caesar's books on the Gallic wars, but just barely mentioned, giving their characters a slim basis in history. Their lives weave in and out of the lives of the major players cited above. The most important connection is forged when \\"retired\\" legionnaire Pullo is hired by Atia to teach young Octavian how to fight. The two close friends set the scene in season one for the season two climax when they accompany Caesar to Alexandria and succeed in sneaking the \\"exiled\\" Cleopatra into the camp of Caesar, whereby Caesar deposes her younger brother and places her on the throne of Egypt.<br /><br />What may surprise us is what is missing. This history has been covered by both the greatest playwrights (Shakespeare, \\"Julius Caesar\\" and \\"Antony and Cleopatra\\" and George Bernard Shaw's \\"Caesar and Cleopatra\\", plus the Hollywood extravaganzas such as Burton and Taylor's \\"Cleopatra\\") Thus, we immediately miss the famous oration (I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him...) which Shakespeare puts into the mouth of Mark Antony, which is credited with turning the people against the assassins. There is also virtually no large scale combat. All the great battles of the Civil war, including the spectacular naval battle at Actium (shown in the film \\"Cleopatra\\") all happens in the background.<br /><br />The writers claim they have aimed less for historical accuracy than for \\"authenticity\\". I suspect they have been very successful in achieving that effect. This is not the Rome of \\"Cleopatra\\" or \\"Gladiator\\" or even \\"The Robe\\" and \\"Ben-Hur\\". This is a dirty city where the populace was always one step away from starvation if any  twist of the civil war interrupted the grain shipments from Egypt. The streets seem to be ruled by \\"collegia\\", which appears to our eyes as an exact replica of Mafia families, run by graft, extortion, and murder. Except that their \\"product\\" was not primarily drugs, gambling, and prostitution (although there was lots of that to go around). It was primarily the staples of life, grain, olive oil, wine, and pork. Sometimes these collegia worked with the government, and sometimes they didn't.<br />One dreadfully realistic aspect of ancient Roman politics is that political assassination was accepted as simply one of many tools for doing business. This is another way in which the ancient Romangovernment seems to have been run like the Corleone family in \\"The Godfather\\".<br /><br />A big similarity between \\"Rome\\" and \\"I, Claudius\\" was the presence of slaves at every level, even at the highest. Caesar's most trusted advisor was a slave, probably Greek, named Posca. He plays a key role at several turn, yet the pamphlet of principle characters is so full, they don't even list him. This highlights one of the weaknesses in the overall structure of the series. There are so many minor and intermediate characters, it is hard to keep them all straight, especially Atia, Servilia, and their households. Oddly enough, even second ranked male characters such as Cato, Cicero, Timon, and Pompey are easier to tell apart by both dress and manner. I found that the underlying source of antagonism between the two principle women was never really brought out. One is unsure whether the primary reason is sexual or political. There may be one or two side stories, such as the fortunes of Atia's Jewish mercenary, who is urged to join his older brother to assassinate Herod the Great when he comes to court favor with the new triumvirate, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus.  Lepidus is another unfortunate loose end, but the writers are stuck with him, since he was a loose end in the actual history of the Civil War.<br /><br />These may interwoven threads with their loose ends is the one area where \\"Rome\\" suffers most in comparison to \\"I, Claudius\\". Another is in the quality of the acting and directing. \\"I, Claudius\\" had several important, recognizable actors such as John Hurt, Sian Phillips, Patrick Stewart, John Rhys-Davies, Derek Jacobi, and Brian Blessed. Most of \\"Rome\\" actors are unfamiliar to us, although the four most important parts, Ciarin Hinds as Caesar, James Purefoy as Mark Antony,  Kevin McKidd as Vorenus, and Ray Stevenson as Pullo carry off their roles quite well, especially Stevenson, who may actually be familiar to American viewers for his roles in American movies such as \\"The Book of Eli\\" and \\"King Arthur\\".<br /><br />In case you didn't notice the content rating, this series would easily rate an R rating if it were shown in theatres. Every episode has one or more soft core porn scenes. To be sure, sexual passions were one of the driving motivations for the characters, especially Mark Antony and the two lead women, but one does get the sense that these scenes are added as eye candy and less for their dramatic importance. One almost prefers \\"I, Claudius\\", with its one very short scene, and ambitions driven by power, to the testosterone drenched atmosphere of \\"Rome\\".<br /><br />\\"Rome\\" is very high quality entertainment. If I were to give \\"I, Claudius\\" an A, \\"Rome\\" would get a \\"B+\\".ike the Corleone family in \\"The Godfather\\".

0880796863|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for a friend who was into reading tarot cards.  He loved the set and uses it all the time.  Definitely recommend it as a set.

0393068382|4.0|Details at 11!      Oh, wait.  They won't be, because providing citations and scientific stucdies which seem to indicate something as boring (and frankly, a little embarrassing) as socially-induced neurological and behavioral differences between the sexes isn't nearly exciting enough to broadcast on the newsmedia.      We'd rather use our shiny new technological advances to prove that really, we're all doing all that we can, and honestly, the fact that women have advanced as far as they have shows how GOOD we are at counteracting their natural tendencies to be weak-willed passive little vacuum-pushers who live to cook nice roasts for their alpha-male husbands to devour on their way to the den to watch the big game.    Yeesh.  On the one hand, I'm really glad I read this, because it's nice to know that my niggling suspicion about \\"too neatly drawn\\" biological differences was correct, but at the same time, I'm a lot more depressed about the advances of culture and society to actually regard people as equal, regardless of the particular format of their genitals.    Some really depressing standouts:      Even if parents verbally espouse egalitarianism and racial/gender equality, their unconscious selves more easily pair sets of words such as woman/house instead of woman/job, or man/power instead of man/infant.  Even worse, small children base THEIR understanding of the world (and their behavior patterns) on those unconscious preferences of the adults around them, not their consciously held beliefs.  Therefore, you get Jennifer stating that her four year old son Aiden can play with dolls if he wants to, but when you ask Aiden himself, he states that his mommy would NOT want him to play with dolls.  *sigh*     Women and men with identical resumes get treated quite differently when hiring, promotions, and raises are considered.  Men are lauded if they are agressive and \\"go-getters\\" while an identical applicant with a female name is considered a bossy \\"ball-buster\\" or an \\"ice-queen\\" and their recompense for their work (both financially and in the sense of support and friendliness with co-workers) suffers dramatically in contrast to men.  And don't even get started on the poor women with kids.  If you add a fictional reference to a child on her resume, she gets it even worse than a childless identical female.      But really, it's all because of those brain differences, right?  Right?    The lack of a star is simply because I thought that the time she spent establishing how much mental \\"hardwiring\\" is changed by life itself was a little lacking.  As the major thrust of her argument against far-reaching inherent neurological differences (please note the use of the word far-reaching) it falls on her to establish (with as much authority as can be mustered) the amount and extent to which infant, child, teen, and ADULT brains can have their \\"hardwiring\\" altered based on experiences and patterns of behavior.      Overall a very enjoyable and necessary book.  To really appreciate some of the pointed sarcasm, you may also enjoy thumbing through some of the titles she gleefully eviscerates on her jaunt through the scientific literature.
1936719010|5.0|I suggest this book to anyone who is stuck in anything that need action in life. It will particularly be much more powerful if you also read the books \\"The War of Art\\" from the same author and \\"Poke the Box\\" from Seth Godin.<br /><br />On Domino's Project homepage you'll also find valuable free companions to this books to download.<br /><br />It's impossible to not feel empowered to act if you read these books.

B004K4AUZW|4.0|Ok, I know all the Little Monsters will hate me for saying it, but it's true.  Don't look for anything new here.  Actually, it sounds kinda retro.  Not dated, just retro.  Which isn't a bad thing.  If you are like me, and are a sucker for a good dance album, this one is for you.  Look past her weirdness and trying to push buttons and get your butt out to the dancefloor.  One thing I do like about this album is that her vocals aren't constantly distorted.  You can actually hear what she is singing.  I wouldn't say that songs are deep either, but they are well written.  She sounds kinda like a pop-diva in love on the song Fashion of His Love.  Bad Kids is another sugar coated pop song as well, but still flows great and makes you wanna dance and sing along with it.  Marry the Night and Edge of Glory sound like they could be remixes of 80's songs from Heart or Roxette with a modern twist.   Not a total flop of an album.  Just doesn't really live up to the hype that it's going to be a breakthrough album or anything.  Pure dance-pop fun is what is contained on these discs.  Not a bad thing...just not what we were told it was going to be.

0375842209|1.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" has been on my library shelf for sometime now just waiting for me to peruse the pages.  Finally, I chose to make it my selection and began reading yesterday. Today I made it to page 195.  Very rarely do I not finish a book but this novel is so painfully slow that forcing myself to continue is out of the question.  In reading the many reviews again, with an overall 4 1/2 star rating, I'm baffled by their positive comments.  Most books have a least some redeeming value but the only one I can find for this book is the credit I will get at the used book store.
B000SO7OMA|1.0|I must have been confused, because I thought I'd be getting a DVD of the concert plus a couple of audio CD's.  When the shipment arrived, I opened the standard DVD case and found only a single disc.  There was, however, an offer to sell me the two CD's for a mere $20.  I've never had a problem with any of my previous orders, but this one leaves me less than thrilled.  I've searched the web site for help with this, but just keep running into dead ends.  How do I get a hold of amazon's customer service to sort this out?
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This was a wonderfully written in a time where so much death, hate, and uglies could come about.  A young girl writes to tell the world about what was going on for her family, another family and one other person.  If she had lived she would have been a great writer or journalest.
B003UESJ9W|4.0|I wouldn't consider this the best movie ever made, however I would say it's a very good movie and Ms Paltrow put in a great performance.  Tim McGraw's performance was decent also!  This had good music (Gwyneth Paltrow, if you're not aware, has an excellent voice and does her own singing in this movie, just like she did in the movie Duets) and was not the normal everything ends happily ever after type movie.  I don't really want to give anything away, so that's all I'm going to say.  If you like country music, a decent storyline and some really great acting by Gwyneth, give this movie a shot!
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Anthony Bourdain is a favorite on the Travel Chanel--I look forward to his glib sense of humor.  Got a little old in the book.  I get it already...you were a bad guy.  I appreciate that he loves his wife and child, however.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|I would liked to have bought this full series boxed set, but the comments that it lacked closed captions stopped me.  I checked some of the individual season sets and found some that said they had closed captions and others where it wasn't listed in the info.  So that had me confused wondering if \\"CC\\" had been forgotten in the description of the boxed set ... or what?  I could not enjoy it without so no purchase and THIS review comment.    With so many of us \\"baby boomers\\" getting to the age of poorer hearing I'd think the folks that want to sell to this HUGE and growing market would be accommodating.  SHAME ON THEM!
1586487981|1.0|The subtitle to Poor Economics: 'A radical rethinking of the way to fight global poverty', is a complete overstatement. There is nothing radical about this book, and it offers NO new insight on the global fight against poverty.     Initially I was skeptical from the mere usage of the term- poverty alleviation, but given the authors' academic placements, as well as the reviews on the book, I decided to give it a chance. It appears that the back cover was a bunch of back scratching.     This is a great book to provoke thoughts on how to think about poverty, IF it is the FIRST book you have read about poverty. Although I agree with most points made in the book, frankly it is a superficial and idealistic survey of anti-poverty policies and the poverty dimension implicit in EVERY society.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Great tool for finding WIFI signals that are available.  I use the signal meter all the time to find the strongest location.
0312600844|1.0|I got this book based on a review and what a waste of time.  After I'd read half the book I came to the realization that I just didn't care about any of the pathetic whiny characters so I slammed it shut and moved on to a much more interesting book 'In the Sanctuary of Outcasts: A Memoir'.
044024367X|3.0|I don't know why this book was rated so low. From some of the reviews I can see that the story was spun around religion and politics. The book was as exciting as all other Reacher novels. It tended to drag a bit in the middle. There were a bit too many plots going on at once. That was why I didn't rate it higher. the storylines were intersecting but didn't go all the way to making-sense.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Who knew Gwyneth Paltrow could sing?  She was amazing in this, not just with the singing and performing, but acting too.  I forgot I was watching her.  She had some help of course with an incredibly talented supporting cast that included Garrett Hedlund who just came off his high on Tron.  He plays a very different guy here, so much so that you barely recognize him.  Newcomer, Leighton Meester, does a splendid job as the green ingenue.  And of course who can forget real life country singer, Tim McGraw who plays Gwyneth's husband.  I didn't even realize I was watching the famous country singer until the credits rolled.  This is a great movie about overcoming addiction and coming out on top.  The country singing performances are in abundance throughout and are fantastic.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I highly recommend The Name of the Wind. I'm incredibly pleased with it's length, as I can't pace myself reading it. This book would be especially suited for those who would like a fantasy novel that doesn't go to far. The magical elements of this story are interesting and exciting without requiring a major suspension of disbelief. The book was very well written and kept me interested throughout the entire story.
0307266303|5.0|Who knew that a book about running could be so captivating! If there is a book that has made a profound and instant impact in my life, I would have to credit this one. It has changed my perspective as well as how I run. I just wish I had read this book BEFORE I went out and spent a ton of money on shoes that account for my running style. You do not need to be a superathlete or a full-time fanatic runner to enjoy this book (I sure am not even close to being either).
B00003CXUM|5.0|The  music is superb. The acting is superb. The plot is superb! It's one the best love story films you can dream of!
B003UESJH4|3.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this movie, but I was very disappointed.  There was good acting, but the story didn't go far enough.  I wanted to see more of his reign as King.  Just a little more, at least.  It is not the kind of DVD that I would like to see again, nor would I recommend it to my friends.
B00005QXDD|3.0|After listening to Tenacious D's videos, and really liking the group, I expected a similar audio experience.  I can't put my finger on why this CD was so disappointing, perhaps it was poorly reproduced... I don't know.  All I can say is, I listened to this CD once and was completely uninspired and will not likely play it again.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Pros:<br />+ Affordable<br />+ Decent 7.1 surround<br />+ Can be quite loud if needed<br />+ Clear and sharp sound quality<br />+ Wireless<br />+ Great battery life<br />+ Customizable G-keys (Can be set to do pretty much anything with a plugin)<br />+ Discrete channel volume control and full equalizer<br /><br />Cons:<br />- 7.1 could be more discernible as far as each channel is concerned<br />- Bass in certain situations is abysmal (Crysis 2's armor mode switching sound causes massive distortion, which is only remedied by lowering bass levels)<br />- Headphone joints could be a bit sturdier, the creaking and feel of them worries me about longevity<br /><br />Closing: Great buy, would definitely recommend. The problems are largely ignorable when compared to the advantages. I hope to see a software update that gives more bass fidelity. In the meantime, turning on the \\"Bass Management\\" feature in Window's playback device settings actually helps a lot.

0756951410|1.0|Lovely Bones(Book Review)  Author of Book: Alice Sebold     The book  \\"The lovely Bones\\" by Alice Sebold was a very interesting and discomforting book to read. The book was about a very typical and  loving family who lived every day with a smile on their face. The main characters were Jack(father), Angela(Mother), Susie(Oldest Sister), Lindsey( Susie younger sister), and Buckley ( Youngest sibling). The story takes place in a small rural community where everyone  knew everyone and lived in peaceful harmony. Yet through  out the story this changed due to the murder of Susie by a character named Mr. Harvey. Mr. Harvey was a very weird character who lived across the street from  the  Samon  residence, which was Susie's family. He was a man that was kept to himself and had killed several women and children due to past experience of  his childhood. This summary of the book may interest you to want to read it, but I wouldn't recommend such book to anyone.   The book discussed me with the description of the murder and rap. I don't know how anyone could find  pleasure in reading details of a rap and murder that occurs on a regular basis in the world today.   It also speaks about Heaven and some waiting room one is in before they are accepted  into heaven. I think this book touches on religion and  is not a neutral book to read because it goes against the believes of certain religions. Therefore I would also not recommend this book for public reading.  Also the sexual contexts are just terrible, the image this book puts in one's mind is like watching a rated MA video. I just can't believe they allow such context in schools. The immorality in  this book,  especially Susie's sex scene with Ray is just atrocious. I personally believe the author of this book and the publishers have serious problems and need to see a psychiatrist for allowing such publication to hit the streets where it is accessible to people of all ages. Think about how would you feel if you found out your son/daughter was reading a book with such context.    Overall I would give this book half a star because whatever is in Alice Sebolds's head she did a good job putting it in others. The book show amazing descriptive talent. I just wish that talent would have been  used for a better production. One we could all enjoy and feel free to share with the young ones. I was told to write five paragraphs for this review, but I despise this novel so much I just can't bare to dedicate more time than what I already have on this thing that apparently has been award a best seller. If I was you I would take the money for this book and donate it to a charity, or buy the book because you're eventually going to need wood for the fire.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I'm not generally a fan of pop, but when Lady Gaga hit the music scene a couple years ago, I was absolutely captivated.  She had a way of delivering tracks that were powerful and catchy, while also being edgy and mature at the same time.  I absolutely loved her music, even though it isn't the sort of music I normally listen to at all.    But with \\"Born This Way,\\" pretty much everything I originally loved about her music was gone.  When I first heard the titular single, my thoughts were, \\"Eh.  The rest of the album might be better.\\"  The I heard \\"Judas,\\" and while not quite as strong as some of her previous work, it at least captures the same style and feel and it actually is a pretty good track.  So when I saw \\"Born This Way\\" on Amazon for $0.99, I jumped on it.  It downloaded fine, no problems whatsoever, and I hit the \\"play\\" button...and I was completely let down.    It seems that in many tracks she is trying way to hard to send a positive message, generally along the lines of \\"Feel Good About Yourself!\\" and \\"Yeah, Girl Power!\\" often expressed in lyrics of comparable levels of artistry and subtlety (or lack thereof).    Furthermore, the songs sound as if she's trying to catch the 6-8 year old age bracket.  The musical style on many tracks is the musical equivalent of the Simple English language setting on Wikipedia.  It doesn't challenge the listener, and while technically well-produced, lacks the daring and maturity of her earlier work.  It's almost like her producers told her, \\"Listen, that Bieber kid has the six year old market nailed down, why don't we try to get into that too.\\"    I absolutely loved Gaga's earlier work, and I really wanted to like this album, but it was painful to listen to.  Judas is a good track, and others are bearable to decent, which is why the review got two stars (although the horrendous \\"You and I\\" nearly dragged it down to one star on its own).    But the edge is gone, the artistry is gone, the daring is gone, and all that's left iswhat Thomas Pynchon would call Muzak.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I love this product, it does exactly what they say it does, very easy to configure, Mac helps a lot in the process so there's nothing to worry about.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|To start with the obvious, every track on Abbey Road is a great listen in and of itself, but the album truly shines when heard in its entirety. Its ability to flow so effortlessly is a nice contrast to its predecessors, Let It Be and The White Album, which both seemed like mini solo projects wrapped up together in an album. Abbey Road displays that even though The Beatles' tastes were going in different directions, they still meshed perfectly and complimented each other.     As for the remastering, I feel that it's superb. The bass is more prominent than ever and the harmonies are crystal clear. If there were ever any doubts that McCartney is one of music's greatest bass players, Abbey Road puts them to rest. \\"Something,\\" one of the 20th century's loveliest songs, wouldn't be nearly as magical without its signature bass line, nor would \\"Come Together,\\" which rests on Paul and Ringo's rhythm section. The three part harmony in \\"Because\\" lends the song a transcendent feel while the remastering makes you think you can separate the voices only to realize that it's impossible since John, Paul, and George's harmonies are so tight (and not to mention they overdubbed 3 times, so it's a total of nine harmonies! Sheer geniuses). Ultimately, everything sounds louder, clearer, and fresher; all the grand little details pop out.      Thoughtful bass lines, lush guitars, thumping drums, and intricate melodies are present throughout the entire album, along with lyrics that range from humorous and childlike (\\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer,\\" \\"Octopus's Garden\\") to sweet and romantic (\\"Something,\\" \\"Oh! Darling\\"). The Beatles even manage to throw in rock music's most philosophical line, a line that easily sums up the entire point of their career and of the sixties: \\"And in the end, the love you take is equal is equal to the love you make.\\" Straightforward and heartfelt, it remains The Beatles' most enduring message.     All in all, there's not much to say about Abbey Road that hasn't alreadybeen said. Is it one of the finest records in existence? Yes. Was it ridiculously revolutionary for its time? Yes. Do John, Paul, George, and Ringo sound closer than ever even though that was hardly the reality? Yes. Is it a marvelous finish to the Beatles' already unbelievably amazing career? Absolutely.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I have this for one reason only. Amazon was selling it for 99 cents and I had some store credit, so I paid zero for it.  Zero is the amount of stars I'd give it if Amazon allowed that.<br /><br />Anyway, I was curious to see if she really was as bad as I thought she was, and therefore mouthing off about her. I was right. It's crap.<br /><br />But still, the 99 cent/free purchase gave me a free 20GB Digital Locker at Amazon's Cloud Player service, so what the hell. :)<br /><br />Even at 99 cents, it was definitely overpriced.
B003YMNVCA|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read as a Systems Administrator. I recommend it to anyone and everyone that has questions about managing Linux systems.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I watched both versions, starting with the Bronson one. At that time it was really good and still is. The Statham version is new, gritty, refreshing, very well acted and filmed. All in all, I loved both versions, believing that each has its place in a definite time frame.
B0041B4H1M|4.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who have done this.<br /><br />The video quality is great, although I did not see it as perfect.  I would give it a 9.7 on a 10 point scale.  Audio, which was DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, was great also.  Lots of surround sound and sub-woofer bass.<br /><br />The movie was pretty good, not great.
0385342047|5.0|Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loved it.  She is a big fan of Sophie Kinsella and this one was right on par with her writings.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I was really impressed with the video quality of this Blu-Ray.  It wasn't perfect, but it was better than I expected.  I give it a 9.3 on a 10 point scale.<br /><br />There just wasn't anything special about the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio.  Maybe I was too into the movie to notice, but I wasn't aware of much sound coming from the surround speakers or sub-woofer.  Sound was satisfactory.<br /><br />I am glad I bought this movie on Blu-Ray.  Video is much better than the DVD, and the Blu-Ray has movie credits at the end, and I remember the DVD did not.  It was nice to know which actor played each part.<br /><br />This movie is really good, with many memorable parts.
0321525655|5.0|I hardly rate a book 5 stars but Garr Reynolds has impressed me that to rate otherwise will not be doing myself justice.    Garr Reynolds has done a terrific work here - introducing the art of presentation. Without being condescending to the readers, some of whom are established presentors, he highlighted the principles of good presentation using ample slides to \\"amplify\\" the content.    Many of us are lost in our intent to impress the audience with features available in Powerpoint and Keynote, or with the knowledge that we possessed and Forget the main purpose of a presentation; the audience wants the presentor to relate the facts to them in a memorable and useful way, to inspire and intrigue them. No one is there for great details that they could read up at their leisure from \\"takeaway\\" documents.    Anyone can make presentation but there are only a handful of good presentors, and even rarer to come across wonderful presentator.    If you are looking for detailed step by step guidebook, this is not the book.    If you are looking for great insight, inspiration, and guidance to enhance your presentation skills or to push your presentation to a higher level, then I strongly recommend this book. It introduces you to an artistic form of presentation, which presentation should be in the first place.    Garr Reynolds must have thought hard on how to provide guidance, like a virtuso master to his talented students, such that he does not impose his own style and ways on the readers but to open new doors for them to innovate!    This book is light and to the point and serve as a easy to carry guide where the presentor could run through all pointers within a span of minutes!

B004D0YB4Y|5.0|I can't believe how few reviews there are on Amazon for this fantastic CD.  Real, authentic soul. Gets better with each listen.  You can hear the trials of Bradley's life in every note. This surpasses anything by James Brown in my opinion.  There's Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Al Green and now Charles Bradley is ready to take his place alongside them.  Buy this and you will not regret it.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|The songs that you hear on the radio are the best on the album.  I love to turn up the volume on the first half of the album, but often find myself skipping the rest. There are some great collaborations on the album, Jay Z and Nicky Minaj are awesome.  I think his lyrics are less clever than previous albums, more random rhymes and less storytelling. It is well produced and has some great references to older songs.
B004HO6HWA|2.0|I really like Jason as an actor but he is cranking out \\"C\\" movies like Van Damme did. Don't they have any better blockbuster scripts? This will be in the $5 movie bin in a year. Wait to buy.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele's voice and musicianship is incredible.  The pieces are not as varied as her more current album, but every song is great, very easy to listen to the whole album.  I think this is an album that could span generations.  Good singing and songwriting never gets old.  I highly recommend this album.
B00333NCTM|5.0|Most Rock and Roll, lead singer auto-biog books are all the same.  Stories about unfortunate upbringings, sex, drugs, alcohol, getting into trouble with the law, failed marriages, highs and lows... But Ozzy's is different.  Well, it's the same but it's HILARIOUS!  You can actually hear his voice as you read the book.  His honesty and wit make this book a fantastic read.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I began watching the Vampire Diaries because I was looking for a new show to watch I was instantly hooked.  I watched the first season in a few days it, each episodes made me want to see more.  The Vampire Diaries is different from the other shows on the CW this one is pretty dark and the writing is more mature so anyone could watch the show, not just young girls.  The acting is great, the lead stars are phenomenal as well as the co-stars.  I have become a huge fan of Vampire Diaries and will continue to watch!!!
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Hawke and Deply's conversation contains all the hopes and fears we all have concerning love: Is it real? Can I receive it? Can I give it? Has it been abused to badly that we don't really know what it is anymore? Does a love exist that can truly satisfy us?
B004SIP7XK|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite movies Ed Harris and Casey Affleck are just great in this movie but pretty much all the actors are as well including Michelle Monaghan and Amy Ryan. some of the differences in the book include Cheese in the book he is a huge white guy in the movie he is a small Haitian guy also Kenzie and Gennaro are more cocky in the book which i liked and Bubba is more present in the book as well the book series from Dennis Lehane on Kenzie and Gennaro is one of the best i have ever read and are a must read all of them but still this is a great movie and a must buy get this
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I actually bought this as a gift since we had one for my daughter when she was growing up and she loved it! What is funny she actually didn't use the pacifier part, all she cared about was the animal. ANd if we forgot it at home and didn't take it with us on a trip we had hell to pay for it!!    So it is a winner in our eyes!
B003L20IJM|2.0|Bought it for the kids for Christmas, not anywhere near as good, not as funny, not as entertaining, as the first.  The characters don't ring true, and the antics are just too out there.  The kids watched it once and haven't picked it up since.
1416550550|3.0|I checked this book out of the library and it's a great read so far (I've read 225 pages).  The characters are well developed and the story line intriguing. I would recommend it.  So you ask why the 3 star rating.  The price that's why.  I will be going away for a week and I didn't want to take the library copy with me so I thought I would download the book to my kindle but then I saw the $11.99! price tag.  Really? I don't think so.  This is not a new release and even the Amazon site sells this book NEW for $5.00 plus $3.99 shipping. Still that's a $3.00 savings plus I can sell, donate or give the book to a friend.  If you don't have a kindle don't get one.  They are much to expensive for the minor convenience.  The only reason I have a kindle is because it was a gift.   I figure since the kindle costs $$ you should be able to save $$$$ on books but so far I have been disappointed.  The small if any savings aren't worth the initial investment of the kindle.  Get with it Amazon.  Demand more reasonable prices from the publishers.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Pros:  1) Wireless  2) Battery Life  3) Style / Design  4) 7.1 surround gaming works very well  5) Noise cancellation    Cons:  1) Intermittent Connectivity Issues - The surround sound software randomly reports that there is a connectivity issue for the wired station. The solution has generally been to change the USB port. Minor issue but for a luxury product like this???  2) BASS BASS BASS - WTH? I mean there is almost no bass. I have tried mucking around as much as possible with the EQ but it doesn't deliver. IMHO, its good for gaming but not to listen to ur fave music. My Logitech Z5500 is the choice for that  3) Feels kinda heavy and sometimes its uncomfortable after a while
B00110K62U|5.0|[[ASIN:B00110K62U Les Miserables: The 10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall]]  Since I listened the music for the first time I loved it. First I bought the CD a few years ago and recently decided to buy a DVD, had to chose for the 10th or 25th Anniversary. I picked the end of the first act, where all the characters participated and watched it in YouTube, I selected the 10th because I liked the singers who played Cossete,Marius and Eponine more.  After I ordered the 10th I had the opportunity to see the 25th and I also liked this one.  It is difficult for me to decide which the best is, I said before I like more those three characters and the story was more explicit very dramatic for instance the scene of the barricades as well as others.  I liked more the singers playing Javert and Fantine in the 25th Anniversary, also the characters of Eponine in the 10th was the same as Fantine in the 25th and she is very good.  The end of the show was very emotional when some of the actors who played Vajean around the world sang.  This is one of my favorite musical and it captures the story of Victor Hugo masterpiece very well.

B00005B4GT|4.0|Although the packaging was not as shown on the screenshot, it was very close and just as great-looking. Amnesiac is my favorite album and the quality of this record justified the great music on it. I found almost no scratches on it and the audio quality was one the the best I've heard. The shipping was about four days late but  that's not a big deal considering it was shipped over the may long weekend. I think I'll be ordering from these guys for a while now.
B004K4AVAG|3.0|You wont be running out and telling your friends that \\"they must listen\\" to this album. That pretty much tells you that this album is not horrible but it's not great. There isn't a single song on here as good as her smash singles from her last album (which was only good for those said singles). The tracks just sounds the same as you move down the LP and I found myself singing the lyrics and melodies of her past smash singles over these new tracks except for the fact that these new tracks arent as good as those past singles. Her fans will be loyally blind to her I am sure but for anyone with objective taste, you can't say that this album has anything truly memorable like her past two projects. There's a reason why her singles aren't charting and running the Hot 100 like Just Dance, Poker Face, etc...
B000066744|5.0|The Legend of 1900 is one of the best movies that I have come across in the last twenty years.  I went looking for this locally and found out that it was out of print.

B001R4CKGU|2.0|I am really trying to figure out how this won an award.  The whole reason why I bought it.  I had been seeing it everywhere and finally bought it.  I am truly disappointed.  It is just all over the place.  I never know which character that is doing the \\"talking.\\"  It is very disjointed.  Highly doubtful that I will finish it.  I will probably delete it from  my kindle.  Glad I only spent $5 and that was really too much.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This movie was a delight. A movie for all ages. I am a college student and all of my roommates and friends watched it and absolutely loved it. The movie uses so many allusions to other movies and literary works it is hard to count. The lines are unforgettable. Megamind's unique pronunciation of certain words is certainly enjoyable. Overall, this movie has turned out to be among my top movies, and my top animated movie. A great cinematic adventure!
0060837020|5.0|I've never been good with my words, so I will try my best to review it.  The Bell Jar gave me a familar feeling when reading it.  We follow Esther's slow decent into insanity, and we feel for her as we helplessly tell her that everything is going to be okay.  I love that the book ends bitter sweet, that it's not a feel-good ending but it does wring out whatever hope the book may have possessed (which isn't much).  Whether it was Plath's memoir or not, the fact remains that we see a tortured artists' view point onto what the world really looked like to her, through Esther.  I will never get rid of this book.
1596912863|3.0|This (rather short) novel reads a lot like a chick flick - and not a super awesome one. The general concept is that Jane (get it...wink wink.....nudge nudge) is obsessed with Mr. Darcy. But not Mr. Darcy in the novel. It's more accurate to say she's in love with Colin Firth's portrayal of Darcy. Longish story short she goes to a cheesy secret camp for Austen enthusiasts to pretend they live in Regency times where they get to interact with Regency gentlemen and pretend to be courted by them. The whole thing has many flaws in it. Our heroine is clearly meant to be like Elizabeth Bennett, but really she just can't seem to settle on who she really is as a character. The plot is a little fun, but does get a little tired after a while.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I was one of those fans that blazed through the first two books over 5 times while waiting for Mockingjay to come out. The Hunger Games, which is really nothing new in concept, is compellingly written. Though the prose is not perfect, the author captures the hearts of readers everywhere with her convincing portrayal of the protagonist Katniss. The changes and growth of character she goes through, the false facades and pretentiousness of the Capitol, and the broken society are all things teens and young adults can easily relate to and understand.     The second book, Catching Fire, is even more compelling, because Katniss is much more focused and motivated throughout the book. Somehow the horrors of the Hunger Games are much, much worse the second time. This was my favorite of the three as I felt like Katniss's voice as a character was at its most compelling and well-written climax here.     Mockingjay falls short of the standards of the other two books. I've heard from one of the producers of the film personally that the publishers had tried to get Collins to split it into two books, but she was adamant that she was done with it. It shows. The entire book felt rushed, like Collins just wanted to get it out and over with. There are some gem moments in here, but overall it was a terrible, unsatisfying read. Yet, the reader feels like he/she HAS to finish reading it since he/she has already invested so much time in this series, in these characters. The characterizations were lazy and cheap, and Suzanne Collins abuses the \\"knock Katniss out and then explain everything to her in long pages of exposition later\\" device so often that all the important action of the entire book happens off-page.     It's a very frustrating book, and for this unfortunate \\"last 1/3\\" of this box set, I must give this item 3 stars.     The first two books average about 4.5 stars for me, but the last was so disappointing that as a whole, the trilogy is much less for it.
B0051MKNV8|2.0|This is a drug film. It came across as a not even thinly veiled ode to the greatness of Methamphedamine (Speed) and/or Cocaine. Its compleatly unashamed in its message and it doesn't take one step back from it all the way to the end. The message is that drugs are great and that all the risks can be managed by a smart addict. All the scifi aspects of the film do is serve to exaggerate the real-world boost of drugs.     All the hallmarks are here. The world becomes brighter when the drug is taken. He goes and parties continuously for days. He can crank out work. He suddenly starts cleaning his apartment compulsively in the middle of the night. he forgets to eat. He does damage to his body. He has blackouts. His woman friend who was on the drug for a long time is now prematurely aged. We even get the guys drug dealer disguised as a high-interest loan shark. And you get large numbers of contemporaries dying. There is even all the addict paranoia about hiding and losing a pile of drugs. They also have him so in love with his drugs that he literally licks them off the floor.     And best of all, they use two professions in the film where drug use is rather common (wall street and writers).     But what the film gets wrong is that drugs don't make people smarter or teach them foreign languages instantly. They speed you up and give you limitless energy and make you more confident. You can get more done, but not because your smarter. But because you can work 2x to 3x longer.     Where the film falls down is in showing the long-term price. It didn't show his body wearing out. It didn't show the paranoia or the teeth falling out. It didn't show that as drug use goes on you get diminishing returns. You may be able to crank out pages in a book, but they cease to be good pages. They also miss the costs of not being able to properly sleep.     On the positive side, right up to the happy ending its probably one of the best films I can think of in capturing the deluded mentality ofa new heavy drug addict. But its not generally a good message to be out pushing. And the film doesn't capture at all what happens in the long term.     The plans of the main character are fairly lame. He wants to get rich on wall street and the become president. Why? He has a plan to make everything better. And typical of drug logic, we never find out what that plan is. I also don't remember if we ever found out if he had or had not killed a woman during a blackout. But he clearly is involved in the murder of a lawyer for messing with his stash.     I could have lived with the film minus the happy ending. But ending it in the way they did made a pro-drug film.     Robert De Niro is in the film basically doing a character actor role as the big man on wall street. Its a completely workmanlike performance. His name on a film still sells tickets but you really wonder how many times can get away with it putting his name on something he has no personal investment in.     Somebody came up with a new continous zoom effect for the film. Its an interesting effect and it communicates well to the viewer the sense of being trapping at full speed thats at the heart of the film. Its maybe used a little too much and they pulled it out way too early. But it was a nice original touch.     The film is essentially told from the narrative point of view of the main character. Bradley Cooper pulls it off well. His girlfriend is basically a prop character.     Technically and in terms of acting, its a good film. But the script and its message are rather questionable.    -----  Postscript:    The alternate ending available on the DVD/BD is an improvement on the original. Rather than having him get everything for *free*, the alternate ending makes it clear that nothing has changed and he is still ruled by drug logic. As he himself says at one point, the answer to the drug is the drug. the drug will tell him how to get better or get off the drug. To me the ending as much as says that the spiral downward he has been on in the second half of the film will only continue. The alternate ending seems much truer to the overall concept of the film.    The audio commentary is interesting. The final ending was apparently supposed to present more ambiguity than IMO it did. We were supposed to wonder if all his talk at the end was an enormous bluff. Though that seems to have been the intentions, what they did ultimately in my opinion didn't push that message. And the \\"dinner\\" ending undercut any ambiguous ending.    The extras are not all that interesting. There is a uesless thing which seemed to be about how great Bradley Cooper is. Its only virtue was that it was short. The \\"making of\\" extra was rather odd in that while it talked about some effects, it had nothing at all to say about the infinite zoom effect which was one the signiture bits in the film. There is some interesting stuff about how the shot different parts of the film on different film stock (before and after the drug). But it could have been better.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Great, exciting movie for all ages! my 13 year old son was riveted to the screen as well as my 82 year old mother.
B004WCTLNY|3.0|This was a very average film. The premise was interesting, but nothing was really done with it. It had the potential to be something like \\"Dark City\\" but it wasn't. What I really can't figure out is how this film could possibly have had a budget of 50 million dollars. That seems like a whole lot for so little.     Matt Daemon uses the film to play around with his fantasies of being a politican and to preach. And according to the old formula, that requires that he be the good working-class kid from the old neighborhood in Brooklyn who suddenly rises to the top of New York politics. But no matter how many times he tries and how bad he wants it, Daemon can't come across as working class. His entire family is conveiently dead at the start of the film which further reduces him to something like a cipher. He seems to be either fantastically rich in the film or a sponge supported by his childhood friend become venture capitalist. But thats all noble because they talk about investing money in alternative energy. Alternative energy investment has become the magic water in popular culture that washes away all moral problems from characters that would otherwise be seen as greedy wall street hustlers.     Daemon's political delusions run all the way up to being president. He is such a great guy that god himself has picked him to inevitably lead the country in the film. Daemon's egotism run amok weighs really heavy against the film. Its difficult to find any redeeming features in the character he plays.     The heart of the film is basically a frustrated love story. He meets a dancer and its love at first sight. But they can't be together because of the effect it would have on their careers. The unintentional unexplored irony in the story is that either of them could have had love if one or the other had been willing to sacrifice their career ambitions for love. But egos being what they are, sacrifice is an alien concept. They want it all and if they have to resort to a childishtantrum to get it all, so be it. In the end, Daemon is willing to storm the gates of heaven for love but he isn't willing to give up being President to do it. Its a weakness in the film's plot and a rather nasty comment on modern culture.     To work, the love story in the film has to work. But it doesn't. Its all really shallow like both of their characters.     The film is also supposed to be a study of free will in life. But the film lacks any subtilty in the examining that. Every manipulation is blindingly obvious to both the characters and to the viewer. There are no real surprises to speak of with it. Nothing clever done with it.     For costing 50 million dollars, this was a remarkably simple film. There appeared to be no sets to speak of. I think there was all of two effects in the film. And the speaking cast was remarkably small. John Slattery does a good job with his part. Terence Stamp delivers whats expected of him.     If your looking for two hours of entertainment, its better than most. But there is nothing special or great about it.    ------------------------  The DVD is a bit odd in that the shot alternate ending was not included. The commentary doesn't even seem to admit that the ending was changed.
B000AM6OQ2|3.0|This is an elaborate production of a pretty basic ghost story.  The plot aside, it never got past the point of disbelief for me:  while watching it, I constantly felt that someone was just making it up.  It simply did not sweep me into the narrative and get me to forget real life for a minute, it never scared me.  Nonetheless, the images are vivid, the actors are good, etc.  There just wasn't anything about it that struck me as original or worth the price.  Recommended tepidly.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Though I used to be a great Dennis Price fan, Laurie and Fry have me completely hooked. That Bertie and Jeeves can play piano together is just an added bonus--but not to be missed!
B004VQK9XW|5.0|After reading the heroine diaries it is hard to imagine that the same person wrote this album or even the book by the same name. The songs are very diverse and really do work well together. Hard to compare to their previous album. If you liked the heroine diaries you will like this album.
0785151303|3.0|Very 'Baroky' design for the costumes and sets, almost too much,(for sure the helmets),  a design  a bit too X-Men and Star Trek like, ..., too futuristic and complicated, just not heraldic, basic enough,  The book ain't bad but Iron Mans 2 art books are better.    It's a very nice set of books Marvel is coming out with, extremely well presented  I'm waiting for the CapAm one and hopefully there will be a Hulk one in a near future.

B00003CX5P|5.0|That is truly the only reason to enjoy or watch the three prequel sequels.  Basic plot is they discover young Darth Vadar and nurture him for his hidden talents, until he becomes betrayed by circumstance mainly due to his mother's death, and the impending doom of his betrothed wife.  His utter frustration at not being able to save his mother, and then trying to find ways to divert his true love from dying, takes him over the edge to the dark side, in order to find untapped power that the Jedi shun.<br />Being this is the first installment of all that, it's about the very young Skywalker.  I disagree that the young boy should have shown traits of evil at an early stage to prove his ability to become Darth Vadar, as his experience in life at this point is limited to his good upbringing, with a loving caring thoughtful mother, even in unusual circumstance.  Gifted children don't have to come from unbalanced homes, but a swift kick of betrayal in spite of his early blessings, might just change his mind to continue being goody two shoes. All in all, these three movies do little more to explain anything about the Star Wars world, other than spotlight young Skywalker falling from grace as he ages to a young man.  The rest is all gibberish, to say the least. The true highlight here is the pod race, in second, concluding battle in the ring, and third, well, it's all about noise.

0470932139|5.0|This is the best food photography book I have read. It is thorough, easy to read, has plenty of pictures and easy to understand explanations. As an amateur photographer with an interest in food photography I had plenty of doubts and this book has answered them all.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|Wow, there are so many positive reviews on this knife, I feel a little silly adding another gleaming gem of a review, but I will. When I say it is the black beauty, you will understand after you buy it and its left on your front door stoop. Open the package and there is a handsome black box, and in it is the black beauty. This knife is the right size, not to big and not to small. The blade shape has a pure design that screams functionality. I would feel very confident only having this knife and being left in some uncharted region of the planet and knowing I could survive. OK, maybe the knife might. Don't let the naysayers tell you that it is a little to heavy or it is not sharp enough, because that is not true. You know because of its thickness you are not going to break it, and the steal is 1095 which can be easily sharpened. So if you truly need a knife to take with you in to the backwoods or on your next camping trip, you can not beat this knife and its price.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Completely unrealistic and over- board . . . but I don't care . . . I loved it!!  This movie is relentless from beginning to end.
B004RC8NUQ|4.0|I actually enjoyed this movie. I guess I have a thing for predictable romantic films. They all end the same. I loved the dialogue. I especially loved the character of the production assistant. Her personality was like OCD meets quirky. Natalie and Ashton did a good job on this. They meshed well together. I could have done without the father and ex-girlfriend. They were an unnecessary plot. 4 stars because ... well ... it's exactly like all the other romantic films out there. predictable. I would recommend this to anyone that has an open mind and doesn't mind knowing how the movie ends within the first 5 minutes.
B004SIP7F8|1.0|I'm a huge movie buff and enjoy everything from action to lengthy epics.  Perhaps I expected too much of this movie with all of the hype.  I knew it wouldn't be an action film that would keep me on the edge of my seat but I at least expected to like some of the characters and the story.   To me, there was nothing remotely interesting about this movie or the characters portrayed in this movie.  Complete and utter waste of two and a half hours for me.  I really don't understand how people like this movie.  I'd rank it as the most overrated movie ever made -- hands down.
044654146X|3.0|This book is much more a journalist's story that an analysis of entrepreneurship in Israel. Around 100 people have been interviewed, mostly people that have been successful. These interview transcripts form the basis of the book. The book contains many interesting factoids, but overall the message is weak, because the authors' don't try to address the question in a structured way. I always think about alternative explanations, for instance the strong link between Israel and the US. Sadly, alternative explanations do not exist in the book at all. The authors report the findings of their interviews and then the book ends. Still the book is worth three stars because it does tell a story that is interesting. However, based on reading this book it is impossible to really understand what is going on in Isreal.
B004MNVKVO|5.0|I have loved this album for some 25 years and been playing it regularly, but getting the DTS-HD 5.1 mix blew my mind. The surround mix is very tastefully done - it is not all over the place distracting you from the original feel of the songs, but opens up the sound on the tracks in a beautiful way, while still giving you some of the exciting thrills of surround mixing. All the tracks get new life, but for me I have to say the biggest change is for the final track \\"Vital Signs\\". The sound of the bass and synth driving this tune is given a new dynamic through excellent surround mixing. This new mix lifts this song in an awesome way. The Camera Eye also gets a very nice treatment in the new mix, and the great drums on Witch Hunt is given proper and exciting surround feel. But all the songs are mixed with care, taste and love for the music and original album.     The 30 year old recording sounds crisp and fresh with the excellent treatment it has gotten on this Blu-Ray. If you prefer a tighter sound more reminiscent of the original but with an overall better sound, you can chose the stereo mix, but the exciting new experience is definitely the DTS-HD mix opening up the sound totally and letting you hear all the details in the songs with such clarity. If you do not have a surround system - now is the time to get one!
6301247485|4.0|This film is an especially good representation of the novel, far superior in its veritas to the novel than the vast majority of other novel adaptations.  It's worth showing to high school students if they're studying the novel.
B000G759LW|5.0|23 songs ,two cd's, one great voice. That's what 'Back to Basics' is. One of my favorites cds. Thank you Christina, that's how music should sound.
B004PA50JM|4.0|This is a very solid album. It doesn't feel forced like some of their recent efforts, and its tracks contain a bunch of variation. Most of what the band tries here works, though there are one or two songs that don't quite hit the mark.    I would rate this on a level with Up. For what it's worth, my favorite R.E.M. album is New Adventures in Hi-Fi.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Even though this documentary doesn't reveal anything shocking or controversial about the man, it is still a decent look at the man who was blamed for the Vietnam War.  But is this a just and fair assessment of the man who for seven years was the Secretary of Defense?<br /><br />Robert S McNamara sat down in 2003 to talk about his life lessons during such a crucual time in American history.  And even though viewers were hoping to hear regret come out of his mouth reference the Vietnam War, he made this documentary not so much as repentance, but as a warning to the new generation not to get too hopeful with the war in Iraq which by then had already started.  He was 85 years old at the time this was made, and a staunch opponent to the Iraq War only because he knew early on in this war that this war would bog down the administration and become a very unpopular war.<br /><br />The first 45 minutes are basically McNamara talking about his earlier life and his early time with JFK and the Cuban Missle Crisis, although it skips around after the introduction with snippets of his life before he became SecDef.  His first experience following unpopular orders was his bombing raid over Japan in WWII under the command of General LeMay, who later became a commander in Vietnam.  I get the feeling from watching this that even McNamara himself felt he was not qualified to be JFK's SecDef.  Sure, he had served three years in WWII but when he was picked to be SecDef he was an executive at Ford Motor Company.  He doesn't blame anyone for the disaster that became Vietnam; the country was sucked into it as a result of the Cold War.<br /><br />There is some archival video here, but most of the time we see the aging man sitting facing the camera delivering a monologue.  A few times Errol Morris, the producer, intercepts him with a question, but it's mostly just one man recounting history. The viewer has a hard time feeling empathy for him because even at his age he is still a confident, perhaps arrogant man.  But there are a few moments around the 1:00 hour mark that his eyes swell up with tears when talking about JFK and his chosen spot in Arlington Cemetery, \\"The most beautiful spot of DC.\\"<br /><br />This sometimes choppy documentary is clearly McNamara's view of the Vietnam War.  He evades all questions he feels are inflamatory or controversial; that's perhaps from experience and his recall of how he was lambasted by the media in the late 1960s. Despite the lack of any new material, this is still a worthwhile documentary about one man who sent 58,000 American warriors to their deaths and who was loathed for a time being as much as Rumsfeld was in more recent times. Ironically, his voice sounds like that of Rumsfeld and he even resembles him in his younger days.<br /><br />McNamara died in 2009 and in many ways this production is his swan song.  However, his memoir \\"In Retrospect\\" may be a bit more satisfying for anyone who wants to understand the deeper anguish of this man during seven very turbulent years of our history. Still, this is a must-view for all who were affected by the Vietnam War.there are a few moments around the 1:00 hour mark that his eyes swell up with tears when talking about JFK and his chosen spot in Arlington Cemetery, \\"The most beautiful spot of DC.\\"    This sometimes choppy documentary is clearly McNamara's view of the Vietnam War.

0553582038|3.0|I loved the first two of the game of thrones books, I had somehow come to the conclusion that there were four books in the series and that it would end there. Now it seems there is no end in sight and I wonder if this is Terry Goodkind all over again. A genius writer who starts out flooring everyone with his story weave but simply refuses to end the tale. Perhaps they have publishers telling them that ten books is a good idea for a series or maybe it is their own folly but either way I find it a shame that they would rather make more money then end it well and in a reasonable amount of books (3-4) and go down in history for it. I suffered through at least 8 unnecessary books from Goodkind that left a sour taste in my mouth I will not be repeating that mistake.
B004QIG7CW|4.0|In 2007, Mark Peter Hughes wrote a fictional novel titled \\"Lemonade Mouth\\" about five teenagers who meet in detention and form a band despite the personal problems that these kids are experiencing in their personal lives.<br /><br />Sure enough, a loosely-based film adaptation in 2011 was written by April Blair (\\"Monte Carlo\\", \\"Christmas Caper\\") and directed by Patricia Riggen (\\"Under the Same Moon\\") and premiered on the Disney Channel on April 15, 2011.<br /><br />The film was watched by 5.7 million viewers and the soundtrack for the film debuted at #18 on the Billboard 200 chart and the following week, jumping up to #4.<br /><br />\\"Lemonade Mouth\\" is a film that revolves around five teenagers, each with their own personal quirks and have their own issues that they are trying to overcome.  One day, each of them got into trouble and had to serve a day in detention.  While together in detention, Miss Reznick (played by Tisha Campbell-Martin, \\"Martin\\", \\"My Wife and Kids\\", \\"Rita Rocks\\"), she has the kids cleaning the basement in order to make it a music room.<br /><br />While she gives principal Brenigan (played by Christopher McDonald, \\"Thelma & Louise\\", \\"Happy Gilmore\\", \\"Requiem for a Dream\\") a piece of her mind, for moving extracurricular activities (such as clubs, music and art) tot he basement of the school in order to make room for a gymnasium.<br /><br />While the kids are cleaning up the music room, sure enough, the five start playing their instruments and perform with each other.  Each do a magnificent job that Mizz Reznick wants them to continue their music and form a band.<br /><br />These five individuals at first are reluctant but because they all have their own personal issues, they all become good friends and form the band known as Lemonade Mouth.<br /><br />But while they try to make Lemonade Mouth a success, the popular band in school, Mudslide Crush want to make sure there is no room for another band on campus.  How will the members of Lemonade Mouth respond?<br /><br />\\"Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition\\" will be released on DVD and will come with a DVD and digital copy version of the film.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Lemonade Mouth\\" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1 - enhanced for 16×9 televisions).  The picture quality of the DVD is very good.  As expected with DVD, you can see some artifacting but for the most part, picture quality is good.<br /><br />As for audio, \\"Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition\\" is presented in English and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1.  The soundtrack features a front and center-channel driven soundtrack with crowd ambiance being utilized through the surround channels.  While the dialogue is clear, the highlight of \\"Lemonade Mouth\\" is the film's music.<br /><br />As one would expect from a Disney Channel film driven by its musical soundtrack, you can definitely expect catchy pop tunes, especially the song \\"Determinate\\" which is a pretty solid song and I don't know of which members really did sing for the soundtrack but if it was the actual cast, especially the female members of the group, they did a pretty solid job.  Also, for the guys of Mudslide Crush.<br /><br />Once again, another Disney Channel film with a pretty solid musical soundtrack!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Rock-Along - Rock with the band to all your favorite songs while watching the film.  During the music scenes, karaoke style subtitles are displayed on screen.<br />  Exclusive Scene - (5:31) The band members of Lemonade Mouth is interviewed for a television show.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition\\" comes with a slipover cover case and a digital copy of the feature film which works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Lemonade Mouth\\" is another exciting and catchy Disney Channel film that showcases teenagers and music.<br /><br />While the novelfocused on a story told by a freshman and some storylines being changed for the film adaptation, for the majority of the story, \\"Lemonade Mouth\\" still manages to contain the positive vibe of the film.  What one can expect is a group of friends taking on their own personal problems.  At first, these individuals had issues but when they get to know each other, they realized that they all have issues and together they manage to grow, become friends and each of them are able to take on their own personal challenges.<br /><br />And these are stories that can easily relate to teens.  With Stella, being an activist and trying to fit in; Mo, is a girl who has a strict father and because of culture, she is unable to do the things that she wants to do; Charlie is a guy who constantly gets compared to his athletic brother and is expected to perform at that same level, even if he's not athletic; Olivia, being the shy girl who doesn't have her parents around and struggles with that, while Wen does have a family but can't stand his father dating a young woman.  These are problems that teenagers face and the film does take on themes of honesty, empowerment and expressionism but most of all, each of them overcoming adversity.<br /><br />Sure, it's a musically-driven film like many Disney Channel teen films that came out but in this case, it was fun to have this \\"Breakfast Club\\" type of storyline  but to see these teens form a band and have fun together.  The musical soundtrack is very good and if there is one thing that I wished was included on the \\"Extended Edition\\", was the fact that it should have come out with a soundtrack like last year's Disney Channel film \\"StarStruck\\".  But you do get a digital copy of the film which you can watch on your laptop, iPhone, iPod or iPad via iTunes or Windows Media Player.<br /><br />I do feel that \\"Lemonade Mouth\\", similar to \\"High School Musical\\" has the potential to grow and have its own sequel.  It's a fun series and because there are a good amount of characters to focus on, it would be cool to see the group move on to the next level and performing for larger audiences (as hinted on the \\"extended music scene\\" that was featured at the end of the credits and on the special features) and tackling a whole new set of fears and challenges.  And also, there are potential romantic situations that can easily be focused on in this film.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition\\" is another solid Disney Channel music-driven teen film.  The story was good, characters were fun and I enjoyed the musical soundtrack.<br /><br />If you loved the film  or you missed it on the Disney Channel, definitely give it a chance!ain the positive vibe of the film.  What one can expect is a group of friends taking on their own personal problems.  At first, these individuals had issues but when they get to know each other, they realized that they all have issues and together they manage to grow, become friends and each of them are able to take on their own personal challenges.    And these are stories that can easily relate to teens.  With Stella, being an activist and trying to fit in; Mo, is a girl who has a strict father and because of culture, she is unable to do the things that she wants to do; Charlie is a guy who constantly gets compared to his athletic brother and is expected to perform at that same level, even if he's not athletic; Olivia, being the shy girl who doesn't have her parents around and struggles with that, while Wen does have a family but can't stand his father dating a young woman.   These are problems that teenagers face and the film does take on themes of honesty, empowerment and expressionism but most of all, each of them overcoming adversity.    Sure, it's a musically-driven film like many Disney Channel teen films that came out but in this case, it was fun to have this \\"Breakfast Club\\" type of storyline  but to see these teens form a band and have fun together.  The musical soundtrack is very good and if there is one thing that I wished was included on the \\"Extended Edition\\", was the fact that it should have come out with a soundtrack like last year's Disney Channel film \\"StarStruck\\".  But you do get a digital copy of the film which you can watch on your laptop, iPhone, iPod or iPad via iTunes or Windows Media Player.

0375826726|5.0|I received my used book, if the outside color cover was there, I would have swore that it was brand new, for less than a dollar!!!!! WOW, i am enjoying reading, and the hard cover will keep my book safe, thank you very much.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|I've seen some of her videos and heard the singles, but I must admit I never paid much attention to Lady Gaga. Curious, I took the bite on the 99 cent deal (by the way, no problems with the download and the Cloud Player is great). Wow, am I impressed! This is an excellent collection of songs - with influences from rock, country, pop, electronica, club - it's all in there and expertly produced. My favorites are \\"Electric Chapel\\", which flat out rocks, \\"The Edge of Glory\\", a power pop song with a great beat and Gaga's super vocal performance (sure to be a single), \\"Judas\\", \\"Americano\\" with the Spanish/calypso influence, \\"Hair\\" and its piano/organ/sax/synth sounds (very unexpected), \\"Born This Way\\", a new arena anthem if there ever was one. Not only everything musically interesting, Lady Gaga sounds like she is having a lot of fun. There are many comparisons to draw to Madonna, but Gaga's sound is distinctly hers and thoroughly modern. Put aside the meat dress and listen for the music. It's the best album I've heard all year... and I'm 57 years old. Does this make me a little monster? Yikes...

B004QIG7CW|5.0|My original review was placed under the CD for this movie.  Not sure how that happend so thought I would try again. As a counselor who works with adolescents I usually end up watching certain movies because the kids in my office are raving about them. In order to converse at least somewhat intelligently, I figure I should view what they are so excited about.  Most of the time I understand the appeal simply because the movie in question plays to the tween or teen mindset.  This movie is a bit different.  It definitly plays to the tween/teen age group but it also has a more mature feel that is really engaging.  It is a movie the whole family can sit down and not only enjoy together but should also be able to initate a good family discussion around such important topics as self esteem, growing up, being true to yourself,and not having to be follow everyone else. Sure there are holes in the plot (hey its a movie; it's Disney)but the general theme is so well blended into the entire movie that certain plot twist that may not be plausible will be forgiven easily. Very few things bring families together on several different positive levels anymore.  This movie has that potential--a mature theme, a great soundtrack with upbeatand positive lyrics, enterainment that plays on young and older levels alike, and entertainment that gives families an opportunity to initate discussions that all famlies should conduct.  My only hope is that Disney does not burn out this cast. I work with teens so I get concerned for them. The teen cast appears to be a pretty nice and fun group of individuals. I hope the fame this is going to catapult them into does not go to the ego--which unfortunately has happened to many of Disney stars. (Teen actors' problems are legendary and well documented) Let's hope Disney and the families can keep everything in balance because these kids could be genuine long term stars and not fade as many teen actors do. I am sure a sequel and a tour will be in the works so I hope there are those who will help these young adults get through it all \\"head wise\\" and remain in tacked emotionally. Sorry--just the counselor in me.
0783233477|5.0|I'm putting this in for my wife Diane: \\"One of the best stories she has ever seen.\\" I agree - relax and let the story come to you. I'm not ashamed to say that I cry at the end. And hope that my end is half as dignified. No religious review here. Just the belief that justice should prevail in a world where that so often fails. A beautiful job by Brad, Sir Anthony, Claire and the entire cast. This is a sleeper that found its audience on DVD. Watch it and see if you don't agree - justice is served. Bravo!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I usually read murder mysteries.  This book caught me by surprise and didn't let go.  I could hardly put it down.  The characters were brilliant and the story fantastic.
0374530718|5.0|It's a great introductory book for people interested on Philosophy. I read it years ago. This purchase was a birthday gift for my 15 year-old cousin. She loved it! Delivery was faster that expected.
B002W5UVSM|3.0|A very amusing read. I enjoyed following Ignatius Reilly, pedantic blowhard par excellence, blunder through one madcap caper after another. My main criticism of the book is that it relies too heavily on stereotypes as the main source of comedy. That said, I was impressed with Toole's ability to write a variety of different dialects for the characters' dialogue. I also greatly enjoyed how closely Toole refers to the city of New Orleans, its street names, landmarks, culture, etc.    By the end of the novel, I had grown rather fond of Mrs. Reilly, Jones, Santa Battaglia, Myrna \\"the minx\\" Minkoff, Patrolman Mancuso, Lana Lee and Darlene. May they live on in the pages of this epic, absurd, oddly charming satire forever.
B00006L6YH|5.0|Diana's recordings are always done so well.  This SACD is no exception, and is a must have for her fans.  I own all of her SACD's and they are all impressive.
B00005N6KG|5.0|This headphones were made of pure awesomeness!<br />I always use my iPod for the gym, on the go, to classes and almost everywhere i am always running around. This headphones are like having a home theater in your head, the bass is really good and no matter how high you put the volume, sound quality is excellent.<br />I have always been fan of Sony Stuffs, playing PSP games with this little fellas is just amazing! They are very very comfortable, you can even forget they are there. the material is very flexible so unless you force it like a gorilla it will bend but not break. The cable is the perfect length, not to short so you dont have to keep your mp3 almost in your mouth and now so long that you will trip on em and break your nose. Mo matter what you do they will not fell so you dont have to stop every 0.5 secs to put em back in.<br />overall: Awesome!
B004KSQN7C|1.0|This is the worst album i've ever heard this year!! Generic music, stupid childish lyrics, no artistic developement at all and the same producers all the time. I would never pay for that.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|Despite all the artifice attributed to Lady Gaga and there is quite a bit,it is undeniable that she is a gifted artist and not simply a prefab pop confection. This new album demonstrates that Lady Gaga has no intention on resting on her laurels and she is definitely going for the glory. This album is much heavier,denser and darker in sound and vibe. The three singles released from this album really did not peak my interest however within the context of the album the songs not only make sense they sound better.<br /><br />This album is the special edition which has 22 tracks which includes remixes. Overall this a good album however there is no less than eight throwaway tracks<br /><br />1. Fashion of His love (insipid)<br />2. Highway Unicorn(The title alone makes me gag , this track is totally forgettable)<br />3. Electric Chapel (monotonous)<br />4. The Queen (despite an interesting musical shift toward the end of the song the beginning of the  track is generic,& cliche<br />5. All the remixes except Scheibe. the remixes drone on and are not that much fun.<br /><br />You are left with 14 tracks of adventurous solid pop & dance with catchy beats and lyrics. I have no doubt that Lady Gaga is on her way to fulfilling her loftiest of goals and I'm looking forward to seeing her journey continue. Mazel Gaga!!
B0042RUMH8|5.0|fter her Rendition of the Top Lambada sounding Single On The Floor here is the New Album \\"Love\\" first time I put this into the player! Aw wow really Dancy the album is the songs sound nearly the same as each other but they are really good and lots of Energy in them. There are a couple of slowish types with good beats to them.      Check out: \\"Papi\\", \\"Until it beats no more\\", \\"Hypnotico\\", \\"(What Is) Love?\\" and the new single \\"I'm Into You\\"    It's a fun album! i strongly suggest you to listen to it and of course buy it, it's the ultimate summer album so get ready!
B003WTE886|4.0|Taylor Swift's lyrics go straight to the heart of her listeners. I enjoy all of the songs on this CD, but right now my favorite is \\"Mean.\\"
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Simply put, the minute I heard this album, it instantly became one of my most favorite soundtracks ever.  For me, it joins the ranks of Goldenthal's Alien 3, Pouledoris' Conan The Barbarian, Vangelis' Cosmos, Toto's Dune, Kilar's Bram Stoker's Dracula and Goldsmith's Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  In many cases, as with TRON: Legacy, I'd say the soundtracks are better than the movies they accompany.  When I first saw the trailers for TRON: Legacy, the music appealed to me, but I figured that was just trailer music.  When I saw the movie, I was pleased by the music but more involved in the movie.  But when I finally listened to the soundtrack alone, I enjoyed it even more.  Almost as if the movie lessened my enjoyment of the music.  Definitely a rare treat.<br /><br />As for Amazon's soundtrack not being complete - that's true, but I don't know of any one place you can get the entire soundtrack.  I've managed to piece together a 31-track version from digging around the Internet, adding 9 tracks to the one I bought from Amazon.  I think the best tracks are included on the album offered here, I just liked the music so much I tracked down the other pieces and put them altogether on one playlist on my mp3 player.
0439023491|5.0|This is a great series! I actually think the 2nd book, Catching Fire, is better than the original Hunger Games book! Read them!
031261246X|5.0|This book has compelling action in realistic scenarios. I think it does a great job of portraying what is possible in light of what's happening now in cybersecurity, and it is fun to read.     You don't need any particular technical or infosec knowledge to enjoy the book, but if you are part of those industries, you'll appreciate it even more.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|For all the Little Monsters around the world May, 23, 2011 couldn't arrive soon enough. Yes, kids Lady GaGa's full length CD \\"Born This Way,\\" has finally hit the shelves of your record retail store.   The fix is in. I have to admit I am one of the Little Monsters who has been waiting for this release. That being said, the journalist in me did remain a bit skeptical on how good the CD would really turn out to be. Would it exceed all expectations and become an even bigger success than her \\"Fame Monster?\\" Yes the answer is a resounding, it just might. Though I'm not a mind reader or fortune teller I'll go out on a limb and say \\"Born This Way,\\" will enter the Billboard Chart next week at Number 1. I would be shocked if this isn't the case.    There are two versions of \\"Born This Way.\\" The first release is a Special Edition 2 disc set. The first CD contains 17 tracks. Disc two boasts 5 remixes including 'Born This Way,' 'Judas,'   'Marry The Night,' 'Schdibe,\\" and 'Fashion Of His Love.' Don't worry I'm not going to bore you with a lengthily song by song synopsis. What I will say is \\"Born This Way,\\" is an excellent release; doesn't have one bad or mediorchior song in the bunch. It is a strong dance release that contains endless hit single releases. Still a rocker until the end I have not thrown in the towel and joined the high energy dance club. Give me an electric guitar over a sync drum anytime. There is something here for everyone. Turn up the volume to 10. I'm sure even the health clubs will be cranked into this release so get ready spinning and cardio classes. GaGa's voice is a natural wonder. No studio magic here on the vocals. I should know, I've seen her live. The woman CAN sing. Co-writing all 17 tracks she showcases more of her talent on this release. She's not merely a one-trick-pony. There's a lot more here than meets the eye or ears. Is she the greatest songwriter ever to grace the blank page? Of course not. Is she imaginative to come up with infectious hooks and choruses; absolutely. This release is proof positive she's not just another pop star who wears outrageous clothes, steals the spotlight, and basks in all the hoopla she's surrounded with.        'Born This Way,' starts out incredibly strong with \\"Marry The Night,\\" and never lets up until the very last chord is played 17 tracks later. Of course the singles \\"Born This Way,\\" and \\"Judas,\\" resound with incredible sound and passion. There are other gems in the fold. \\"Hair,\\" \\"Bloody Mary,\\" (a great Goth-esque tune), \\"You And I,\\" (produced by \\"Mutt\\" Lange, guitar solo by Queen's Brian May) and the \\"Edge Of Glory,\\" (Clarence Clemmons sax solo is right on target) are all superb. \\"Americano,\\" with its LA/Mexican influence is great and sure to light a fire in your local dance club. \\" ScheiYe,\\" is without a doubt one of the most unusual songs on the CD. Starting out in German (who knew GaGa spoke a bit of the language) still turns the corner into a groove that is undeniable. One might be surprised at the religious undertone of a number of the tracks on the release. I don't find anything inflammatory here. In fact the imagery is wonderful and the church choir chorus effects are inspiring. Perhaps that's just my perspective. Those detractors will always find what they wish to find and make mountains out of molehills. It's just Entertainment folks. Back to the review: I do have to say in regards to the second disc, I really would have loved GaGa to include the acoustic versions (solo piano) of \\"You And I,\\" and \\"The Edge Of Glory.\\" Seeing her perform these live I can honestly say they were highlights of the show and very moving.    I guess the ultimate question remains: Will 'Born The Way,' surpass the mega colossal selling \\"Fame Monster?\\" If the initial buzz and publicity is any indication the answer without a doubt is YES. It is impossible to miss GaGa is week. Just turn on your television, she's on every show imaginable. From Oprah, The View, David Letterman,SNL, Good Morning America, possibly the finale of American Idol (right now that's a strong rumor) and countless others, the promo train keeps on a rolling. Little Monsters take heed, \\"Born This Way,\\" is truly the release we've all been waiting for. This release is going to be around and running strong for a long time to come. I can't wait for the follow-up videos certain to come.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|For anyone who hasn't seen this movie-you are missing out.  Every time I watch it, it gets better.  I love screwball comedies, and Cary Grant is the best actor of all time.  His performance is phenomenal, and Kate Hepburn isn't bad either.  The copy is great, the features are good. Highly recommend.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is the best of the bird games! I love the latest level. :-) keep them coming! the dog in the last game is adorable!
B00454U1NS|5.0|This really is a great CD it has all the classics from various albums combined on one disc.  Plus her latest ones as well.  I am happy that I purchased this cd eventhough I already have all of her other ones.  With this one I don't have to change the disc when I want to hear something from another album it's already on there!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|If you've never seen Evangelion before and you're wondering if you should watch it, you definitely should, and this is the release to get. If you're wondering if you should upgrade to this from previous releases, you need only know this is hands down better than all previous Evangelion releases! So much so, in fact, that this is worth the fee for the upgrade if you \\"already have it\\". As you can tell by the product description all the video (now 1080p) and audio (now Dolby TrueHD 6.1 for both EN and JA) has been redone. The result with regards to that is not just everything looking and sounding better, but it also packing more of a punch every step of the way throughout. Another nice improvement here is that it is much more seamless than it was originally. The disks are running at about 100 minutes in length - and it isn't butchered into 20 minute episodes padded with superfluous openings and endings - instead it's presented in one fluid piece of anime goodness.
B000EGCITG|5.0|OK, I'm a late bloomer. But ppl are finding her everyday, right? LOL...<br />Well, this album I streamed here, and FELL IN LOVE with it. Then FunHouse. And after those 2 purchases, I am now an official P!nk junkie! LOL...<br />By far, Stupid Girls, Who Knew, Crystal Ball, I Don't Believe You, and more, are just phenon!<br />I watched the Stupid Girls vid, and Who Knew, and both were SOOO incredible!!! It's amazing how she can transform herself. Just a little makeup, and wahla!!! She's a completly different person!!!<br />God, she's amazing!!!<br />If you haven't, watch \\"Stupid Girls\\" vid. On YouTube, somewhere!<br />I was just hooked on that. She's SOOOO hilarius in that!!! Poking fun at the \\"Paris\\" types, and mimicking them in the vid, oh God, she's so hilarious in that.<br />And \\"Who Knew\\", oh, god, I cried in that video.<br /><br />She is SOOO amazing!!!
0670022411|1.0|I have never written a review for anything before, but this book was so bad I felt I should warn people. First off, I was so excited to read this book I couldn't wait to download it. Soon I realized I should have just waited for the new Charline Harris to come out. It was such a painful read for the first 400 pages that I wanted to just delete it off my iPad altogether, but I hung in there. Then just as I started to see a glimmer of hope the book abruptly ends with, well, no real ending. I went back and read the last pages thinking I had to have missed something, but no that's really how it ends. And with not even a glimpse into the next book in the series. Frankly I could care less now what happens. I feel cheated, I want my $13 and all the time I wasted reading The Discover of Witches back. You will not find a review for her next book from me because I wont bother reading it!
B004SCN2F6|1.0|it lacks vital trading information, too many variables and complications make it a waste of time, I miss the palm original...might uninstall
B004JN1D2I|1.0|If you don't agree with a review, stop reading it and move on. As much as i want to buy this compilation, the other reviews regarding the pricing were highly informative. i am grateful that i didn't get hosed by a greedy publisher. so i'm adding my two cents... typed directly on my kindle.my pricing gripe is actually objective and addressable by the publisher. if you got a book printed in a series of  mini pamphlets or on paper where the words literally blend together because the quality control cheaped out on materials you would write it here. At these prices the author's mother wouldn't buy this. a publisher knows people's tastes vary. so while they know they have a good product in the series, the dept that monitors sales volume is learning a lot more from the pricing complaints than someone unqualified and totally subjective literary &#34;analysis&#34;. if Amazon wanted differentiation in reviews for quality or even for Kindle users, AmaZon could manage. This isnt like finding a crappy seller of a toy when you could user a different seller to get the same thing. Maybe you don't know that Amazon states the publisher controls content pricing. There is a good reason Amazon makes that known: apportioning blame. i doubt my personal feelings about the flaws of the novels will send Mr. Martin in a different direction. i fit the trend: like thousands and thousands of other avid readers, since purchasing my kindle i purchase more books. this is data publishing groups are using. make them hear us.
0439023521|5.0|Suzanna Collins has proven to be an excellent story teller with this book! The Hunger Games is a well constructed story with a very unique and believable setting in the near futuristic world of post-democratic North America. The plot is a rich one and clearly well thought through by the author.     The story itself is based around teenage \\"tributes\\" which are forced to be donated by lottery to compete in a game of survival. What an addictive story idea! This book was so addictive and fun to read! The violence is probably on a PG-13 level and there are no sexual themes or language problems so it remains relatively clean. Truly a fun book to read!
B00138EVJO|3.0|It's ridiculous to attempt any kind of sensible overview of Dylan's art with anything less than 5 or even 10 CDs, so with only 2 discs this collection is pitiful. No Greatest Hits collection ever accurately reflects an artist's body of work, especially when it's someone so prolific and long lived as Dylan. Much of Dylan's music can only be appreciated after repeated listenings over a considerable period of time, and so much of his catalog has evaded \\"Hit\\" status but is non-the-less essential for any true fan of superior musical art. Even his offhand throw-away tunes tower over 99.99% of the tedious forgettable crap that populates the Charts. So on these two CDs you'll find plenty of obvious choices, and a few odd ones, but there's no reason not to start at his first album in 1962 and work your way through the decades, and experience how a true artist meets the challenges of remaining creative and relevant in a shallow, fickle, declining society. Bob never blinked and almost never missed a beat.(Well truthfully, in the late 70s, and 80s there was SOME questionable stuff.) But for a newcomer, a tender wide eyed newbie, this ain't a bad place to start, so long as you then immediately embark on a true, worthwhile quest to unravel the eternal mystery that is Bob Dylan. Also, Jimi Hendrix's version of All Along the Watchtower is the greatest cover song in the history of recorded music, which Dylan actually preferred to his own.
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown has written another great book! It reads fast, has a great pace with plenty of action and thrill. He keeps you intrigued all the way. My only criticism would be his extreme similarities to previous plots.     1. It's about a secret society  2. It has a weird/crazy guy as an antagonist  3. Langdon works with a girl    Have we seen this before? Pretty much every Dan Brown book ever written. However, it's a fun read with a new story. Just told using the same literary devices. I still give it 4 stars because I just love Robert Langdon as a character and I can't wait for the next book.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I've owned the video for years, but i wanted the dvd...finally sprung for it and i'm so glad i did.  I teach, and once in a blue moon my kids earn a good guys party and we watch a video.  This movie is always loved.

B003XDXMO2|3.0|Cute shoes, love my original crocs, but these are very narrow and definitely don't run true to size. I ordered a size 8, but they fit my daughter better with her at a size 6.  Debating reordering, but I think I'll just go back to originals.

B004ZISVWC|5.0|This was the perfect (troll) movie. Dry humor, great characters, excellently acted, plenty-good special effects, and beautiful cinematography. I'm going to watch it again tonight if I can make the 48 hour window.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This was a very interesting book...one of the ones you just can't put down.  Can't wait to start the second in the series!
B001DPHDCY|3.0|Horton hears a who is a cute family film but it also has a serious underlying message a few don't pressure your children to follow in your foot steps and listen to their desires realise the world may be bigger then you think and never think you always know best. See this film and you will enjoy it Steven Carell and Jim Carry give great performances and it provides a good family comedy.
1439102724|4.0|In Sing You Home, Jodi Picoult writes about a multitude of controversial issues, she doesn't just stick to one like in the others, and I think that gave this book a lot of depth.  The issues were quite topical and immediately drew you in.  Her characterization was excellent, and complimented her tricky plot.  The ending was completely predictable, but because she got everything else right, that was okay.  There was a certain comfort in what you expected was going to happen at the end, happening.<br />I liked the way she didn't stereotype the two lesbians in the story, and didn't paint them to be freaks of nature as some other authors might have done, she let them keep their femininity.<br />I wonder though, how some churchgoers will react to her descriptions of the born-again Christians portrayed in the story, as they are not shown in a very good light.  I do think some might take offence at that.<br />For me there was just one loose end - Lucy.  I really wanted that to be resolved and Zoe to be applauded for the good work she did with her, and for Lucy to turn against her fanatical parents and go over to Zoe's side and support Zoe.  But things don't always work out the way you want in real life and Picoult does write realistic fiction.<br />Jodi Picoult does need to be commended for her bravery in tackling contentious issues, and sparking plenty of heated debates in book clubs.  Her research is also always top drawer.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|highly recommended it's a very humbling of this former secretary of Defence during the Vietnam era who is very humbled. highly recommended for private viewing history of film classes.
B004LE7PCM|3.0|I am amazed that no one, absolutely no one has mentioned that this item has several mistakes. There are typos, punctuation errors, formatting errors, and errors in the table of contents and even in the order of some of the stories. One of the short story collections, \\"[[ASIN:B004UJHLV8 The Return of Sherlock Holmes]],\\" has the stories arranged in alphabetical order, rather than the proper order, which is something one can observe by simply reviewing the TOC included on this Amazon page. (Plus this particular section should really be in true order, as \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\" is the one which is first, bringing Holmes back, after his supposed death.)  If I am going to pay anything for any Kindle item, I expect it to be done better than the free Kindle classics. I was comparing one of the sections in this item to the free version of that section available on Amazon, [[ASIN:B000JQU1VS The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]], and the free version was more accurate.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Decaprio blows me away plus in this film you really have to pay attention because you never can tell what is real what is imagined and what is a dream this film takes several viewings to wrap your mind around the story of what's real and what isn't strap in for a heart pounding ride.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I've only watched disc 1 so far, but I found it hard to stop watching.  It's packed full of amazing footage that made Planet Earth so popular.  And oh, watching it in high definition is pretty easy on the eyes.  You feel like you enter a whole new world with every camera take.  Sorry if there are any Oprah fans reading this, but a HUGE and I mean HUGE bonus for me was that Oprah does not narrate.  It's just nice having a naturalist narrate a nature series.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|East Wood in his latest film strikes gold portraying a old retired loner who is tough and grizzled he quickly develops a soft side and becomes sort of a gentle giant and mentor to a troubled youth who is a neighbour. Very good film
B00012QM8G|2.0|This movie wasn't anything like I expected it to be.  We didn't even completely finish watching it.  For years, I didn't want to see this movie because of what I thought the content was.  My family lived during this period of time and it wasn't pleasant.
B002GSXKN8|2.0|because i am a hard core comic book fan i love these films but i realise the acting in all of them is corny and pretty terrible i would say buy this product if you are really into the comic super hero films and you will probably enjoy them every once in a while. Plus given how good the new batman films are i can not rate these films any higher.
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|We all have films we call, \\"must see\\".  \\"Network\\" is one of those films.  It's message remains fresh, it's performance only dated by fashion, still crisp and wonderful, and the collective that together made this film may have never known that it would be a crown in their careers.  William Holden is never better.  Faye Dunnaway is sensational.  Ned Beatty gives the performance of his life.    There are many truths in the dialogue of \\"Network\\" and it behoves one to pay attention to it rather than simply be amused with it.  When I first saw this film, I thought it was \\"great\\" but, \\"way out there\\" for the time.  Surely it was farce, beyond any ideas of reality.  Yet today, it is life that imitates art and it is those comments I made that have become the folly or farce.  Peter Finch would die following this film and I have to wonder if he ever thought that the body of his life's work would boil down to a crazy man in rain soaked pajamas and a trench coat would be what he was remembered for.  To have played a part in this film is something anyone should be proud to be remembered for.    \\"Network\\" has out lived William Holden and Peter Finch.  It will out live us all.  It has a right to.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|from stock cooler, dropped my Phenom x2 (unlocked to 4) from 43 to 29 idle temp.  Its a fairly tall fan, so you may need to move around some case fans if they are directly above the processor.    Setting up was tedious but straightforward, and easier than installing the stock fan because you didn't have to shove your hand into small spaces.    You DO have to remove your motherboard to install this fan.    I had previously used only all copper heatsinks, but this one is just as good or better than the V1 cooler i purchased on a previous build.    Absolutely recommend this product.
B000A2IPP0|1.0|The makers of this film believe that an 11-year-old calling his brother \\"penis-breath\\" is funny. For that alone this movie is loathsome. Add in the fact that it is relentlessly dull and shamelessly plays for pathos at every opportunity, and it is just about as revolting as you can imagine a film to be.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|As someone who climbed a mountain or two and dived into some unspeakably beautiful oceanic worlds, watched dolphins at play in their own habitat and spent a few days walking through what we used to call 'jungles' I know that no television experience can possibly replace actually being there. I also know that no human on Earth can possibly be to all the places the BBC crews covered in these series. And, thanks to their hard work, passion and BBC's equipping with the latest in HD gear, what came out is as close to 'being there' as today's technology allows it.<br /><br />'Life' kept me and the rest of the family captivated often in awe for the four days we spent watching the series, limiting ourselves to one disc per evening to allow ourselves sufficient time to talk about what we were watching and to go back from time to time and replay some of the more stunning takes. I'm not going to say what 'Life' is about because it's not a story. The series was produced by a number of BBC crews who went all over the world to capture so that they could show the rest of us some of the more extreme, more beautiful, more striking and lesser known ways life forms on our Earth act in order to survive as individuals or as species, raise and take care of their offspring, hunt for prey, hide from predators, fight and sometimes cooperate in order to stay alive.<br /><br />Except for the first episode which is a summary of what the rest of the series is about to present, each individual episode of 'Life' covers one specific theme, usually a broad class of life forms - birds, mammals - showing their specific characteristic, adaptations, some of their lesser known forms and behaviors and so forth. The last few minutes of each episode breaks the spell to some degree by showing us what the crew had to do in order to be able to show us the beautiful images we just watched.<br /><br />This is what 'Life' presents:<br /><br />DISC ONE:<br />- Challenges of Life<br />- Reptiles and Amphibians<br />- Mammals<br /><br />DISC TWO:<br />- Fish<br />- Birds<br /><br />DISC THREE<br />- Insects<br />- Hunters and Hunted<br /><br />DISC FOUR<br />- Creatures of the Deep<br />- Plants<br />- Primates<br /><br />'Life' does not cover everything but what is presented is beautiful and brilliant and it is so because the crews sometimes spent weeks and sometimes expose themselves to great risks just to capture some extraordinary few minutes and sometimes few seconds of 'never seen before' footage. Try to imagine diving without oxygen tanks in the middle of several 40-ton male whales engaged engaged in fight to the death for the right to mate, or spending three weeks following half a dozen hungry Komodo Dragons following a buffalo they've poisoned and waiting for it to die, or covering a lions vs. hyenas war. It's all awesome and informative.<br /><br />Children will learn from watching this but I suggest that the younger ones don't watch it alone because life keeps itself going through an endless cycle of feeding which necessarily involves death. Yes, in many instances we see how well adapted organisms escape their predators but everyone needs to eat and not all the actors in these series are vegetarians. It would probably help if parents were around when seals feast on penguins or when the lovely killer whales are trying to turn a frightened seal into lunch.<br /><br />Life shows extraordinary adaptations, the length to which some parents sacrifice to ensure that their offspring have a chance at their own life and the extreme risks the young adults take for a chance of becoming parents themselves. It's about feeding, surviving, seeking the next meal, taking care of the young and sometimes relaxing and having a little fun. It's fascinating, colorful, action-packed, incredibly beautiful and it's for almost everyone.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;DISC THREE  - Insects  - Hunters and Hunted    DISC FOUR  - Creatures of the Deep  - Plants  - Primates    'Life' does not cover everything but what is presented is beautiful and brilliant and it is so because the crews sometimes spent weeks and sometimes expose themselves to great risks just to capture some extraordinary few minutes and sometimes few seconds of 'never seen before' footage.

B001TOD9VI|4.0|I really dislike Professional Wrestling.  None of it appeals to me.  I can think of thousands of things I'd rather do than watch big sweaty guys pretend to pretend to beat up on eachother.    BUT that said, people need to realize that this work is NOT all about Pro-Wrestling, and does not really glorify it.  If anything it shows a lot of the truth about some of these \\"actors\\" and thier struggles.    I mainly gave this film a chance because I've become a big Darren Aronofsky fan, and I'm glad I did.  It tells the gritty story of what happens near the end of a Wrestlers career.  What happens to these poor guys when the spotlight has all but completely gone away.  How do they survive and make a living when the years of a rockstar life in the ring start to catch up in health.      There is as at least as much (probably more) drama in a story where you feel for the personal life struggles as there is any in a Ring.  The film also has back burning themes of being who you are and going where you're accepted for it, no matter the costs.    Maybe not everyone will get the same out of it, but I really Enjoyed the film despite what one might think form the title.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|Very good product. I do recommend it until a better option available. 4 stars because I would like it to have these features too;  - support for ipod remote and mic integrated cables from input to output.  - smaller form factor  - better sound quality at max volume since the sound is not satisfying at ipod's max and max-1 volume levels.    Bass boost funtion is also ver satisfying for bass lovers like me.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Good cd but pricy to just get a couple tunes you want but   that's the way all music is unless you download them one at a time !
B000PMLFRA|1.0|It's very simple.  The special editions/alterations of the original trilogy are not the real Star Wars films.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is not a TRUE fan.
0812550706|3.0|I suppose that since this was written in the 80s, I should give credit to the author for his imagination when it came to the internet and laptops (called \\"desks\\" in the book). Other than that, he didn't come up with anything I haven't already come across in other scifi books...which is saying something. I'm not even a huge scifi fan.    I might have forgiven the disappointing lack of mind-blowing technology if I hadn't read the 1991 introduction to the novel. This intro was so defensive, so amazingly ungracious, that it quite turned me off the book before I even started reading it. The author basically recited why his book is wonderful and belittled those who DARED hate it. I mean, come on! Why the bitterness? He's obviously struck gold with Ender's Game, he's made a ton of money and a name for himself, so why the attack on readers who just don't like it? Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and the fact that the author sounds like a snobby prick really didn't do much for me.    Going back to the novel itself, the writing is concise, which is fine. I do agree with the author's opinion that good writing doesn't always have to mean convoluted, heavy prose. But in order to survive with such straightforward writing, the plot needs to be stellar, the characters have to be so vivid that the reader would not need paragraph after paragraph of descriptive prose. Ender himself is fine as a character. He is a genius, but a flawed one at that, and therefore quite believable. The problem lies with the side characters, who come off as pretty one-dimensional and flat. I had a hard time believing in Valentine as a character. She seems prescribed, as though the author thought, \\"Okay, now we need a loving character, one who tethers Ender to humanity.\\"    The author is also very fond of \\"telling\\". I don't need him to tell me over and over how smart Ender is, I need him to SHOW me how smart Ender is. And to be honest, the scenes depicting Ender's genius aren't that awe-inspiring.For example, Ender plays a fantasy game where he comes across a giant who forces him to choose between two liquids, both of which are poisonous. After failing the test numerous times, he finally has enough and kills the giant. The two army officers watching footage of the game are astounded. Umm, really? Was that so mind-numbingly hard to figure out?? I could've told him that from the time the author first mentioned the game.    Another instance is the battleroom itself. Ender is in a school full of other genius kids...and yet none of them figured out that they should reorient themselves so that the soles of their feet are facing the enemy door? It seems pretty obvious to me that by doing so you'd make yourself a smaller target, and I'm certainly no genius, just an average reader with an average brain. So no, I don't find the side characters compelling or even believable. I feel that they've been dumbed down to make Ender look smarter.    As far as themes go, the book is quite predictable. The Chosen One overcomes trials and tribulations and saves the world. Yaaaay...there were no twists in the book that made me go \\"Whoa! Did not see THAT coming!\\"    Despite all these shortcomings, I have given Ender's Game three stars because it was interesting enough to keep me reading, although it did not, as the author intoned in his obnoxious introduction, blow my mind and make me think, \\"Omg I can SOOO relate to Ender.\\" I liked Ender, not because I can relate to him, but because he's so flawed, and therefore complex. I like that he makes mistakes, that he doubts and even hates himself, all things that we go through in life. I thought it fell short in most other aspects, but having a believable protagonist whose enemy is as much as himself as it is \\"the bad guys\\" is worthy enough to garner 3 stars. It wouldn't be the first book I'd recommend to a friend to read, but it'll be on my list of books to recommend...maybe...in 57th place or something.
B00007BKVC|5.0|This is a great movie!  Must see.    Amazon should create a different comment thread for each ASIN (bar code).  These are the same comments as the blue ray.  Same with music albums.  A newer version with additional songs on it has the same comments as the older version.  There is a blu ray version of Thelma and Louise with multiple endings on it, but it has the same comments as this, older version.
0439023521|5.0|When I first read the premise of the story, I immediately thought, Battle Royale rip-off! Certainly there are parallels between the two stories that are hard to ignore, namely teenagers being taken to an isolated space and forced to kill each other in a last-on-standing match that is aired on TV. I still find it hard to believe that Collins hadn't come across BR and been inspired by it, but despite the suspicious origins of THG, I am still taking my hat off and giving the book 5 stars, and here's why.    1. It takes the basic idea of Battle Royale and runs off in a different direction. It explores plenty other aspects aside from the Hunger Games itself, and the actual act of kids killing other kids isn't the core part of the book. Those who are turned off simply because of this fact really baffle me. Nowhere does the book make killing other teens something positive. In fact, everything about the book is about rebelling against a totalitarian government that sees nothing wrong with forcing its children to kill each other. I don't get how this book is an advocate of violence. Yes, bad things happen in the book. Yes, the main characters are forced to harm other people to protect themselves and their loved ones, yes, puppies grow old and die. Deal with it.    2. The characters are complex and flawed. There is nothing I hate more than one-dimensional, flawless characters (cough Twilight cough, cough). Katniss, the protagonist, is headstrong, brash, and sometimes irrational. She makes many mistakes and in doing so she is so completely human that I can't help but think of her as an actual person. Throughout the book she is surrounded by other characters who are equally flawed: her mother who refuses to let go of the past, her hot-headed friend Gale, alcoholic Haymitch, her stylists from the Capitol...I would say that the only characters that I found somewhat lacking are Prim, who is portrayed as a perfect little angel throughout the trilogy, and Peeta, who doesn't ever show a selfish side to him, which come on, I get that he's in love with her etc, but everybody has limits.    3. The writing is smooth and descriptive without becoming tiresome. Collins does a wonderful job building a vivid world, and what descriptive text there is is broken up enough so that you have a decent idea of what the setting looks like and yet are still able to put your own imagination to good use. The dialogue is believable, the characters truly sound like real people talking.    --WARNING: SPOILERS--    4. The plot itself isn't as straightforward as one might think at first glance. I'd thought that this was going to be yet another Harry Potter-esque good vs evil thing, and the first book might seem that way, but Collins throws yet another curve ball in the second and third books and shows us that whoa, the good isn't all that good, and the bad people miiiiight not be so bad after all! I hate stories where you don't get a chance to empathize with the \\"bad\\" guy and understand that from his point of view, he was completely justified in doing bad things, and although Collins doesn't quite do that with President Snow, she certainly does that with Coin. She shows how Coin, having faced so much anguish in her life, feels justified to deal out harsh revenge to her oppressors, not realizing that she herself is turning into President Snow. Ah, irony, so beautifully woven in by Collins!    All in all, do I believe that Collins got the idea for THG while channel surfing? Umm, no. I wasn't born yesterday. But she did take the idea, no matter how unoriginal, and made it truly hers, and I can't find fault with that.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|My favorite artists are The Smiths, Radiohead, Pet Shop Boys, Manic Street Preachers, etc...    I'm 32 years old and have a collection of 3.000+ cds. I never thought I would feel like this again... but, after 7 years (since The Killers' debut) I'm truly in love with an artist.    I used to think that Lady Gaga was in the same league as Britney Spears and Cristina Aguilera, so I never really gave her much attention.     After hearing \\"The Fame Monster\\" and especially now with \\"Born This Way\\", I think she should not be compared to Madonna, she's already better than her.     She should be compared to Michael Jackson from now on.    I think \\"Born This Way\\" will be seen as a landmark in pop music, like \\"Thriller\\" or \\"Bad\\".    Track-by track (Special Edition):    1- \\"Marry the Night\\" - Touching, beautiful, heartbreaking, perfect. Deserves to be a HUGE hit and a pop classic! 10/10    2- \\"Born this way\\" - The worst song on the cd, but still good. I don't need to describe it to you. 7/10    3- \\"Governement Hooker\\" - The introduction sends shivers down my spine. Very seductive and original in its own way. 9/10    4- \\"Judas\\" - You probabbly know this one too. It restored my faith in her work after the release of the \\"Born this way\\" single. Its structure is similar to \\"Bad Romance\\", but with a harder edge. It's great live. I love it! 10/10    5- \\"Americano\\" - One of the most original songs of the album. As a brazilian, I'm really fond of its latin flavour. It reminds me of \\"La Gloria\\" by Erasure. 9,5/10    6 - \\"Hair\\" - A more conventional song, but a very good one. As a songwriter, I feel the urge to edit it to avoid the repetition of the first verse of the chorus. In my opinion, it would make the song even better. 8,5/10    7- \\"Scheibe\\" - This is fantastic. Takes me inside a Berlin club. Again, I would edit this track by letting the spetacular background music shine a little bit more. The german verses are repeated too much. Besides that, it has an excellent chorus. 9/10    8-\\"Blood Mary\\" - If Gaga releases this as a single I'm sure a lot of people who thinks she's just an ordinary pop singer, would change their opinions, like I changed mine. It's an absolute success. The gregorian chants and the bridge are awesome. It deserves a video. One of the best here (with \\"The Queen\\"). 10/10    9 - \\"Black Jesus Amen Fashion\\" - It grew on me. \\"Jesus is the new black!\\". Sounds like it was written in the early 90's. 9/10    10- \\"Bad Kids\\" - Guitars on the verses. Synths on the chorus. I think it will be great when played live. Lovely hooks. 9,5/10    11- \\"Fashion of his love\\" - Dedicated to Alexander Mcqueen. There's a clear nod to Madonna in this. It's a lovely pop song. 9/10    12- \\"Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) - Pure Pop Art. Great chorus. 9,5/10    13- \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" - Experimental Art Pop. It has \\"New York club scene\\" written all over it. Very important in the album context. 9/10    14- \\"Eletric Chapel\\" - Guitar Intro. Ends the \\"Art Pop Trilogy\\" of the album. By this track, I started asking myself: \\"Is there any bad song on this album\\"? 9/10    15- \\"The Queen\\" - It's a mystery why this song is a bonus track. It´s my favorite. Two songs in one. I can't decide if I prefer the PERFECT POP of the first part or the beautiful and emotional vocals and guitar solo in the second part. In a perfect world, it should be a number one single. 10/10    16- \\"You and I\\" - It got soul. Not my cup of tea, but still very good. 7,5/10    17- \\"Edge of Glory\\" - A perfect way to end a classic album. 10/10    Thank you Gaga, for making me feel excited about music again!
B0006GANN2|5.0|One of the absolutely best, original, action hero(s) movies, with a chase scene(still considered one of the best in cinema history) that is only comparable, to me at least, to the chase scene at the start of the new Casino Royale movie with Daniel Craig.  I own the dvd, saw the orig in theaters when first released, one of the best movies of it's genre in the business.  Recommend, 2 thumbs up, action never stops.... but it's not all bang/crash/boom action, that goes too fast, like today's action films  (computer generated),  for eyes to follow (at least my eyes). It's not full of graphic sex, has great scenes from late 60's early 70's NY. I can't see anyone not liking this movie except those simply uninterested in cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, good guys and bad guy type movies.  A little bit of France is thrown in, on location...this is an exciting, interesting, tough flic.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Awesome movie to watch, with humor, poignant moments, the pain of prejudice, and the triumph of the spirit of one terrific woman.  It was a clear presentation of what if FEELS like to be autistic. I felt the sensations of sight, sound, sensory input, and emotions that overwhelmed Temple Grandin into a panic attack. The visual images of the way Temple's mind works were both amazing and funny. I have personally met Temple Grandin, and Claire Danes was just like her: down to the way she walks, talks, and acts. She is so similar to many other people with autism, whom I have known.   I work with autistic children and I can hardly wait to share this movie with the parents and children I work with, to help further their education about autism and the impact that one person can make on society, autistic or not.
0307279189|1.0|This guy was on peyote when he wrote this.     The Lieutenant that I work with is reading this, now he thinks he can run 50 miles in 120 degree heat over here in Afghanistan. This is going to be fun! I can't wait to see him doing the funky chicken on the ground with his eye rolled in the back of his head puking on him self.     It should be against Marine Corps Orders for Lieutenats to buy running books, plus he has already spent over $350 on running shoes in 3 months.    He trys claiming every morning when we go to PT (Pyhsical Training) that \\"we were born to run\\". I say he was born to run just because he is trying to hold on to his lunch money.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I loved Lady Gaga's \\"The Fame\\" album because the songs were so unique! This album is so \\"blah\\" to me. Seems like every song is the same tempo, all thump-thump-thump clun inspired beats that get really boring after the second song.... or actually even halfway through the first song.
B000SEI230|4.0|I haven't seen the movie, but I know that someone died.  Even if I had this one big spoiler, I still wanted to read the book.  Having read all but two (including this) of Nicholas Sparks' novels, I could somehow predict what would happen (other than the dying part).  But knowing what was coming didn't rob me of the jumble of emotions I always feel when reading his works.  A Walk To Remember evoked all kinds of emotion; it was funny and sad, promising and depressing, youthful and mature, all at the same time.  The story flowed seamlessly like a reckless youth becoming a mature, stable and fulfilled adult.    Here is my favorite line:  \\"Jamie was more than just the woman I loved.  In that year Jamie helped me become the man I am today.\\"  I never knew what the title meant before, until the passages leading to its mention gave the meaning away...True to the title, this story will stay with me, and will always be remembered.
B003UESJF6|4.0|Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, and Tina Fey provide all-star voices in this clever superhero and supervillain combination. Viewers follow Megamind (super villain) and Metro Man (superhero) from 'birth' in space through their accidental assignment of roles (Metro Man lands near a mansion, while Megamind finds growing up in a prison) and subsequent adult struggles. Unfortunately, Megamind succeeds in one of his plots to kill Metro Man and then finds himself bored, with nothing to do.<br /><br />Megamind then creates a new adversary - Titan, while continuing his on-going struggle for beautiful reporter Roxanne Ritchie's attention and favor. Interesting play on both comic-book 'Superman' and the movie 'Night at the Museum' roles.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|The Foo Fighters outdid themselves with their latest CD. From what I can tell, they opened up the CD case and began putting rocks in and didn't stop. When people were like \\"Hey, that's too much rock\\" they were like \\"Hell no!\\". Then when most bands stop putting rock in, the Foo kept on going. From what I can tell, they must have leveled the ROCKy mountains and pulled down vast portions of the moon to have this much rock in one CD.
0553582038|4.0|George, This series has become so much, so much more than what has been published.  This is a good book from a great series.  I simply love it!  1 question thought George! Are you committed to seeing this through to the end of the story.  There are too many factions and too many possibilities, Will this Stark reunion ever come full circle?  I feel as though this story might later be \\"Thrust under the rug\\" for the Targaryns' story.  Don't disappoint us readers.
B004G600A4|5.0|I received the video and I automatically love it. Of course there were a few scratches but that didn't ruin the movie at all. It was as if I had just bought it new!  If you want a used movie that is in good condition. This is a great choice.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|If you are a Paul Simon fan, you couldn't ask for more in a new music project.  Play it over and over and let it sink into your heart.  I recommend it highly.

B004132HZS|5.0|I liked this version from the first time I saw it on Masterpiece Mystery.  It is my second all time favorite version of Sherlock Holmes;  my first starred Jeremy Brent.
B004KA9MQO|3.0|Worthwhile CD, entertaining and sets the mood I was looking for when purchased. Glad to have added this one to my collection
B004K4AVAG|4.0|I am not really crazy about mainstream pop music but I have to admit I am rather fond of Lady Gaga. I have been fan since Lady G burst out on the music scene in 2008. Her songs are ridiculously catchy. As a fan of synthpop/new wave music, Lady G's music definitely have a synthpop/new wave flavor.<br /><br />I recently bought her new album Born This Way today. I have yet to stop listening to it today. The music is addictive to say the very least with its infectious pop hooks and club friendly beats. I have to admit I wasn't really wild about the title track (the first single) when it first came out but after many listens, the song has really grown on me. The second single \\"Judas\\" is okay but lacks the punch and energy of its predecessor. The melodies just didn't do much for me. It's not a bad song especially compared to duds like \\"Government Hooker\\" (my least favorite track on the album) and \\"You and I\\". The tracks that really stood out with me is \\"Marry the Night\\", \\"Americano\\" and \\"Hair\\". Those songs have a ton of energy and just drowning in catchy pop hooks. I really love \\"Hair\\" which has a glam rock flavor.<br /><br />I think this album could have been flawless had it been under an hour. I wasn't too crazy about 2-3 tracks. Overall Born This Way is an immensely fun pop album.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I am not a sci fi fan at all. But this movie has awesome speical effects and is action packed. Has a decent story and is entertaining. I thought the movie was awesome!
B003097ABA|4.0|If you are a Cars fan you are familiar with the music herein.  I just wanted to write a quick review to let buyers know which versions (remastered or not) are contained in this box.      The first three albums (The Cars, Candy-o, and Panorama) are the HDCD encoded remasters that first issued in the mid/late '90s.  These were remastered by Joe Gastwirt for those who care about such things.  Another reviewer here implied that Candy-O and Panorama were not remastered in this box set, but he is incorrect.  Just play them in your Windows Media Player and you'll see they are both HDCD encoded.    The remaining two discs (Shake It Up, and Heartbeat City) contain presumably original '80s unremastered sound.  WEA has never issued remastered versions of these two albums.  They have only been remastered by small audiophile labels: Mobile Fidelity for Shake It Up, and Audio Fidelity for Heartbeat City.    If you can get this at a good price, say under $20, it's a good value.  Sometimes you can get better deals by buying directly from Amazon.co.UK.
B004S5D3B6|5.0|Greating acting, great story! And if you like boxing it's a must to see! And even if you don't like boxing check it out! Unbelieveable preformance by Christian Bale! Fantastic movie!
B0051QJ83S|3.0|I don't usually listen to the radio stations that play Lady GaGa type music, so this .99 cent trial for the whole album was $ well spent. While not something I will play every single day, this is easy to listen to. The .99 cent promo was a great idea to get new listeners & reward the loyal fan base.
B000IJ7J1Q|4.0|Just a quick note to let those shoppers wondering about the sound quality of this 2006 Japanese version of \\"Heartbeat City\\" know that it is, in fact, remastered, even though Amazon does not explicitly list it as such.  The packaging is no different than the original Elektra release--except for an external cardboard sleeve in Japanese--but the sound is amazingly crisp, clear, deep, and free of any tape hiss.  Also, this import is significantly cheaper than the controversial Gold HD CD.  Worth snagging at $25 if you want to replace your flat-sounding American CD or download version.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Basically I thought it was a OK Harry Potter movie but was disappointed by the lack of lighting. Much of the movie was filmed in poor dark lighting and it made it very difficult to watch the movie.
B0051QO4QY|2.0|If you heard beeps and skips in certain songs (namely Government Hooker), its because this is the clean version of the album.<br /><br />This is the second album of LG that Amazon has put out without specifying that its a clean version.<br /><br />Go on itunes and pay the extra dollar or two.

0811826848|5.0|I've been following the Beatles since I was sixteen  back in 1964.  Wow, after 47 years of collecting books,  magazines, newspaper articles, buying all their music on  records, cassettes, cds, etc., if I was to recommend one   item to purchase besides their music, this book would   definitely be at the top of this list. It's absolutely   the very best!!
0060853964|5.0|I read this book after borrowing it from a friend and now I'm a huge Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett fan. I immediately bought the hardcover copy so that I wouldn't again have to borrow to reread it. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B003E8AF5U|5.0|I admit. I hated this album at first. I remember listening to the tracks on their website when they were leaked, and I was so disappointed. This wasn't the MGMT I knew.<br /><br />When I bought it, I listened to the whole thing again. I realized how this is MGMT's Dark Side of the Moon, or Abbey Road. This album is beautiful. From the 80's ridden \\"It's Working\\" to the amazing \\"Congratulations\\"... I would like to say I would want this to play at my funeral. Beautiful.
B002ZG976U|2.0|A movie like Burlesque is so utterly and predictably bad that only those who are really predisposed to tolerate (and perhaps enjoy) this kind of thing will even bother to see it.  So you get the kind of ratings pattern you'd expect for a true classic.  Tons of five star reviews, with but a few discouraging words.  We saw it for laughs, thinking it would be good camp fun...not really.  But it was somewhat better than I expected, perhaps because I had seen the true crap-fest known as Country Strong only a week earlier.  Burlesque isn't that bad, mainly because it has no illusions about being anything but a homage to vastly better films.  But, jeesh, an average rating near 5...people, see some real movies.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Just don't expect a reply for support within the 12 hours like it states here on Amazon.  A few tracks didn't download with their \\"Amazon Downloader\\" software.  After less than 24hrs the links to retry downloading expire (50+ tries and I kept getting the \\"download failed\\" error).      If you buy the whole album, don't be surprised if you don't get all the tracks.  Check the other reviews, Amazon sucks.
0064400557|5.0|I loved this book when our teacher read it to us in second grade back in the late 1960s. I've read it regularly ever since and loved it every time. The only thing I can't do is read it aloud to my own child, because it annoys him when I laugh so hard I stop reading, and this book makes me laugh that hard a lot. I also know from experience that he does not like it when I cry at the end of a book, and I always cry at the end of \\"Charlotte's Web.\\"     E.B. White's elegantly economical style and gifts for characterization, dialogue and carefully selected detail provide exactly the counterpoint necessary to ground his fantasy about Wilbur, a pig, and the little girl Fern and the literary spider Charlotte who become his friends and save his life. In \\"Charlotte's Web,\\" animals talk, an observant child hears them, a spider embarks on a marketing campaign so effective as to turn Madison Avenue green with envy, and the adults look on, bewildered but fascinated. Garth Williams' detailed, lively, but not over-fancy pen-and-ink drawings suit the story beautifully. The picture of Fern pushing Wilbur and her doll in her doll carriage is a stand-out.     \\"Charlotte's Web\\" is about compassion, friendship, loyalty, problem-solving, growing up, letting go, and small miracles we might notice if we only took the time t0 look.     Remember that Modern Library list of the best 100 novels of the 20th century that came out a few years back and caused such a stir? I've read most of the books on that list (the editors' list, not the reader's list, just to clarify where I'm coming from). I like a lot of them and love some of them to pieces. If it were up to me, though, I'd rank the terrific, radiant, timelessly delightful \\"Charlotte's Web\\" in the top 20. Buy it, read it, wear it out, buy another copy. Every home library, with or without children in the house, should have \\"Charlotte's Web.\\"
1592332803|5.0|This is the best cookbook I've bought in a long time because the recipes are easy with no crazy ingredients and they all come out so good.  The chocolate chip banana nut bread is so delicious I make it at least once a week, and I am the only vegan in the entire family on both sides.  Everyone loves these recipes and I can easily flip the book open and land on a page that I have every ingredient for.  The chocolate chip cookies on the cover are, just as she says, so delicious that people say \\"I wouldn't know this was vegan.\\"  They've said that about every recipe I've made!
B000J5XS3C|4.0|I use it for home karaoke. Sound is much better than the DVD karaoke I used before. If it come with a power on/off switch, it should has 5 star.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Beach Boys, CCR, and CSNY all easily come to mind when trying to think of influences and similar sounds.  This is an excellent follow-up to their S/T.  It took me a few listens to really get into it, and then I was completely hooked-- I couldn't take it out of my car's CD player.  Compared to their S/T, this album has less moments of up-tempo/upbeat 'rockers' keeping the album invigorated and more moments of careful arrangements with a more diverse set of instruments and closer-knit(with computer help? I only ask because there were some memorable slightly-flat moments on last album  ) harmonies.  These guys have a knack for hooks and excellent harmonies and songwriting.  More critical reviews have complained about the lack of originality in their work.  To that end I would say that I doubt anyone- especially the band- is unaware of the shoulders of the giants that they stand upon.  At the same time, Brian Wilson and CSNY didn't invent four-part harmonies, nor Dylan musical-storytelling. Highly recommended for fans of the West-coast tradition of pyschedelic/folk/pop music, this is an excellent new chapter in that story for 2011.
B0047LN5YQ|5.0|This is a review of the UK box set of Doctor Who Series 1-4. The contents of the box contain the 4 dvd box sets and an episode guide. The dvd sets differ only in the casing from the original releases. They did away with the fancy fold out dvd cases and replaced them with simple plastic cases. The episode guide contains all the pictures and information found in the original releases but obviously put together in a handsome book (plus some extra pictures and episode reviews).<br /><br /> The UK versions of the discs differ from the US releases only in providing audio commentary for the visually impaired on each episode and on menus if selected. The price of the set is excellent and far below the price of purchasing each series individually. The only concern for US buyers would be the region code but don't fear. if you simply google the model of your dvd player with the term \\"region free code\\" it will provide you a site to make your dvd player region free usually with no more effort than a few button pushes of your remote. You may want to do this before purchase just to make sure your dvd player is compatible.
B0002DB52M|4.0|Spoiler alert!    This film transposes the concept of ignored transparency beautifully.  It is something we all engage in, rather egregiously, yet it is difficult to see if portrayed so vividly.  There is indeed destruction behind beauty, and despite conscious efforts and wishes to see something modified into a supposedly \\"better\\" condition, it becomes clear that the unconscious desire will ultimately wreak havoc, especially when aided by a dysfunctional and envious mass mentality.  Unintegration prevailed, and when a unifying force showed up in Dogville, one that could make the town actually unite in something positive (the admiration and appreciation of Grace's presence), the threat of disintegration ensued, and she needed to be destroyed and incorporated into the unintegrated structure.  There truly are no walls to hold us in, we are all very knowing and aware of what goes on in the minds and bodies of our fellow man, and truly the structures we edify are illusory and used as defense mechanisms so as to not have to identify with the perverse nature of others we see in ourselves.  This movie begets the question alluded to at the end, which I interpreted as \\"is this town real?\\" (reinforced by the drawing of the dog becoming real at that moment), and truly it is, real in every individual psychic microcosm as an intolerable reality; one may even sympathize with the murderous mobsters at the end wiping out the hapless people.  There really is no escape from this labyrinth of twisted logic, we really are primitive beings.
0763650447|5.0|My daughter is almost 2 and loves this book.  We have read it every night for a few months. She loves finding certain fish and counting them too! Great book. Good oppurtunity to teach counting and colors. I am not sick of it yet either... always a plus!
B0007OCG4W|4.0|In this film, the overarching story is one of futile sexuality, a sexuality that is used in a counter-intuitively destructive manner.  Consummation is procured not with the intention of creating life, but of harming another person.  And, as much as animalistic allusions are referred to and this seemingly incessant drive to reach a state of primitive ecstasy is echoed time and again, whenever sexual acts are described, they are done so in a dehumanized, emotionless manner, as if to say that they can only exist as an abstraction.  This is reinforced by the fact that the acts are never actually shown, only talked about.  Julia Roberts portrays perhaps the most tragic character of all, as she becomes the \\"sad stranger\\" in an ever-changing partner merry-go-round, yet, as Larry put it, she does not want to be happy, and has to compromise in order to avoid being swallowed by uncertainty.  As she kisses Dan at the beginning of the film, her camera goes off, and she immediately stops... she makes sad strangers look beautiful in photographs, and when her picture is taken, she runs the risk of looking beautiful, a threat which proves too big.    Equally living in a psychogenic vortex is Dan himself, who pines for his mother every night and tries to sublimate this by engaging in intercourse with unknown women, he cannot risk becoming dependent on someone who may ultimately leave him (as parents almost inexorably do).  He desires Anna \\"because she doesn't need\\" him.  When he's on the computer talking to Larry, he personifies his conflict well.  He cannot have the desired object, thus he must become the object, and control her fate... he pretends to have an orgasm as Anna, yet says it was not good, closing in the fantasy that he is the only man who can provide Anna with a pleasurable sexual experience, he controls her orgasmic thrill, as it was.  The movie's title tantalizingly denotes how at so many different points in the film one character is longing for a holding, comforting\\"other\\", yet this other is never in the same place.  Scene after scene we observe one person crying and begging for some sign of mirroring affection, but crying is reproached by the detached party, in a sick fourth-dimensional mockery of human relations, yet one that is very accurate in showing that when one succumbs to the desire of the other (showing vulnerability, devotion, commitment), desire is killed.  They are all spheres in themselves who are too afraid to touch because they may fuse, so an intellectualized verbal experience of intimacy is all they can hope for.
B000003H3M|1.0|I've heard a couple/few songs throughout Testament's albums where the lead singer uses a growly/death metal voice, but this album is ridiculous. The whole album is death metal. I've very glad this was just a one album thing, cuz this was horrible.
0143034901|5.0|I really am not much of a reader at all, but this book was captivating.  It was gripping from the beginning and written in a style so fluid that made it impossible to put down.  Actually, several times I had to put the book down in amazement at how well-crafted the story was.  Zaf&oacute;n's European writing style could only be described as \\"beautiful,\\" a word I seldom use to describe literature.  Do yourself a favor and don't let the opportunity to read this book slip away.
B001P829VY|5.0|\\"Treasures\\" has long been one of my FAV Films. The Ansel Adams photography, the classical greed plot, the marvelous dialogue, the swift, sharp lines from Bogey--all thing these things embraced with Max Steiner's score and you have a masterpiece. My favorite lines are Howard's warning about what gold can do to a man's soul, and then later, when he finds traces of the evil stuff, he himself is the first to spin out of control as he dances his famous jig.<br />Even so, this particular album includes a spellbinding story of John Huston's career as a director. His forte involved going to remote locations like jungles, mountain sides, the great plains, even the ocean. His cast and his crew even his friends went on these rigorous expeditions sometimes lasting for weeks or months. Huston seemed to enjoy these parties even as he scrutinized every detail.<br />Of special interest to me was the interview with Arthur Miller, the famed playwriter and sometime husband to Marilyn Monroe. Here he expounds on Huston's  belief that Humanity does not fit into this hostile universe. The powers that be have created a world that engulfs and destroy's people without mercy. He then goes on to explain how (after shooting \\"The Misfits\\") Gable dies of a heart attack, and Marilyn OD's.<br />There is even a lingering suggestion that Huston's passion for rugged action killed both of them even as it gave them a measure of immortality. Helluva a price to pay just to star in a movie! All serious students of great film should study this entire album, a Treasure extracted from Terror with a delicate touch.<br />Remember Howard's line,\\"You gotta tickle her.\\"
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This album kicks ASS. It is pure fun. Anyone who takes it too seriously is missing the point. This will definitely be nominated for Album of the Year and Gaga has created a modern self-love pop masterpiece. Obviously it borrows heavily from musical history, but that's the point. I can't stop playing it.
B00164CM46|5.0|This may be one of the funniest and canniest movies ever. I've seen it maybe a dozen times and everytime I enjoy it and find new things. For those who saw it, follow the conversation in the beginning at the Jewelry heist, about Mary..and there is another mention by Brick-top when he says (blasphemy...come again!). Anyway, there is lots of cogney accent, so turn on the subtitiles to understand what the \\"pikeys\\" are saying. The characters are all well picked from Turkish, to Tommy Gunn, to brick Top and even Tyrone (Ahh Tyrone..you silly fat..). Brad Pitt..hilarious. Vinnie Jones (you can call me Suzan if you want!). Doug the Head a jewish wannabe.  Benecio \\"Frankie Four Fingers\\" changes dozen outfit while over the phone.<br />Get it now on Blu-Ray..Before \\"Zee Germans\\" get it!
0756404738|5.0|I disagree with many of the negative reviews of Wise Man's Fear. If you loved the first book, don't hesitate to lose yourself in Wise Man's Fear. I listened to both of the books on audible and am suffering Kingkiller withdrawal after finishing the last few minutes of Wise Man's Fear.
0316044938|1.0|14-year-old Susie Salmon, a sweet, naïve girl from a loving family, is raped and murdered by a serial child-killer. Granted new omniscient vision, she narrates the rest of the story from heaven, offering details of her short life and death to the reader while watching the activities of her family, friends, and the man who took her life. Sebold's novel is dissatisfying for a number of reasons. Her version of heaven is stereotypical, being a kind of mundane consolation prize for murder victims. A wonderland of one's own design, Susie's heaven is where she plays soccer, reads fashion magazines, and can have everything except what she truly wants, her life. This in itself is depressing. Her family never finds her body, nor is her killer brought to proper justice (though he does meet some form of punishment). When Susie is given a chance to temporarily return to Earth by possessing one of her former classmates, she choses not to immediately run home to her folks, but go have sex with her high school crush. Lastly, the killer's punishment, when it finally comes, is so mundane and random as to be positively infuriating, and turns out to be as random as Susie's decision. Sorry to say that the interesting and original premise is the only thing this reviewer has come to admire in a book that some people might find unsettling and disturbing (or \\"triumphant\\" and \\"stunning,\\" according to Time and The New Yorker). If you have the gumption and fortitude to read past the first chapter (which describes Susie's untimely demise) without throwing the book at the wall, then this book may be for you. It certainly isn't for everyone.
0345522478|3.0|Hounded wasn't exactly what I expected. In all honesty the synopsis gives most of the plot of the book. Usually that bothers me because I like the suspense of not necessarily knowing what's going to happen next. For this book that didn't matter. There is still so much to enjoy while reading. The characters are well developed and well written.<br /><br />Atticus- I loved him. He is a Druid and isn't afraid to fight. He's not afraid to face danger head on and from the beginning that's what he does. There are multiple action scenes, and even though they aren't intense they are described with such great narration you don't want to put the book down. I'm eager to see the relationship develop between Atticus and his apprentice (I won't tell you who it is since it's a bit spoilery).<br /><br />Oberon- Oberon is Atticus' Irish wolfhound and my favorite character. He and Atticus speak telepathically and he's more or less a sidekick. Thanks to Oberon's one liners I laughed out loud more than once. My husband got a laugh or two from them as well. The French poodles are my favorite.<br /><br />Morrigan-  She's my second favorite character. Her snarky attitude without a fear in the world was a great balance to Atticus. We don't get to see much of her, but when she's there you don't forget it. I hope in future books we will get to see more from the Morrigan.<br /><br />Kevin Hearne is a great addition to Urban Fantasy. I will be honesty with you, there isn't any romance...and if that's what you are looking for this isn't the book for you. If you want a fun, somewhat lighthearted with great action then I recommend you go get the book now. I wanted a fresh take on Urban Fantasy and Hounded was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />My favorite quote: \\"He has a revolting citrus air freshener in here. Do you know when his birthday is? We should get him one that smells like steak or Italian sausage.\\" -Oberon, pg 179<br /><br />Look for Hexed on June 7th and Hammered on July 5th.
0385523394|3.0|Piper Kerman had a devoted boyfriend and a promising career when she was arrested in 2003 on a 10-year-old drug trafficking offense, the product of a brief post-college fling with the world of drug smuggling. Her intriguing memoir illustrates prison life in a minimum-security facility over the course of her 13 month sentence. Interesting and often insightful, Orange covers daily interactions with other prisoners and guards, prison food, and the surprising sense of community maintained by her fellow inmates. On the downside, however, the book's episodic nature sets it at a slow pace, often making it a chore to slog through.
B004RRVHCW|2.0|Hey, to each their own, it's important to realize that everything is great to someone. I've been a major Sonic Youth fan since the days of old (I'm almost as old as they are) and have long enjoyed their extended rock and roll variation on the old Glenn Branca routine. Their music has to be almost felt to really be appreciated fully. In concert, Sonic Youth is like experiencing the formation of the planet in hyper time. So if you're like me and you love Sonic Youth - you might find this disk a bit less interesting. Thurston, the lanky, poetic front man of the aforementioned band, has tapped into his folk style and hired on some fiddle, strums an acoustic guitar and doesn't play with an amplified electric drill. Drat!<br />If you like that sort of thing! ENJOY. I felt a bit misled, I noticed the New Yorker was tauting a concert of his with a lovely drawing of him hunched over an electric guitar, effects pedals, and amp - and thought, very nice! That's what I need- a nice sonic blast from one of my favorite noisy musicians. But alas, the recent Neal Young album (Le Noise) is actually far more experimental and palette expanding. Imagine that? Perhaps they've decided to change places.  Who knows!
0312600844|4.0|Patty and Walter Berglund, dedicated Democrats and devoted parents, seem to have the perfect suburban lifestyle: a nice house, two kids, and a bright outlook on the future. But all is not well in the Berglund household. After relations with their right-wing neighbors, the Monaghans, go sour, Patty and Walter are dismayed when their rebellious son, Joey--who is dating the Monaghans' daughter--allies himself with the Republican cause and moves in next door. This act of filial defiance causes long-buried regrets to appear and threatens to destroy Patty and Walter's marriage. Franzen's intriguing portrait of the Berglund clan explores concepts of personal freedoms, marriage, and family in a post-9/11 America. A well-written novel that manages to be both comic and tragic at the same time, Freedom is not without its flaws. This otherwise enlightening story is marred by its gratuitous and unnecessary descriptions of sexual acts, including a rather graphic sex phone conversation between Joey and his girlfriend. This aside, the Berglunds' story is a very human one that will appeal to left- and right-wingers alike.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Great product - the revised music issue affects the commercial bumps and whatever was played over the credits at the end of each episode.  Maybe that's important to some people but definitely not me.  I graduated from high school in 1979 and I just can't empathize with being that invested in 1990s pop music context.      Most significantly, there was a \\"bootleg\\" Daria set several years ago that had all original music, but in that set the video and audio quality was uneven and at times really bad, there was no \\"Play All\\" option, and above all I'm sure there weren't any royalties that made it back to the series creators.  This new set solves all of those concerns - money well spent.
1439107955|4.0|Cancer is one of America's most feared illnesses. It attacks suddenly and indiscriminately, and many of the treatments for it are just as deadly as the affliction itself. Mukherjee covers both the social and medical history of this subject. Up until the latter half of the twentieth century, cancer survival was seen as a battle to be fought in private. During the 1950s, as the author informs us, the very word \\"cancer\\" was considered too indecent to appear in print. A cancer physician himself, Mukherjee examines the illness not so much from a clinical perspective, but from a \\"human\\" one. How long has it been around? More importantly, how can it be cured? These are only a few of the questions that the author tackles in language that is both informative and easy to understand.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I've never reviewed a record (or anything) on Amazon, but having read numerous reviews (by critics, fans, and haters), I, for reasons unknown to me, feel inspired/compelled to comment.     The Gaga discussion/debate seems to revolve around three central elements: the music, the message, and the hype. I admit to being tired of the publicity/hype (an egg? eating note cards on Letterman? really?), but as a music fan I try to separate the hype from the music. As for a record's \\"message,\\" it's a turn off if it's offensive or trite, but for me the song writing, the music, the arrangements, and the production are what matter.     As for the music, the quality of this album IMHO is undeniable. On the first listen, the diversity of sound and themes is a bit overwhelming and perhaps off-putting. Upon further listening, you see Gaga's growth as a song-writer, musician, and vocalist. She has never sounded better. My only real complaint about the music is that some songs are a bit overproduced, but even so her voice still rings true.     A predominant topic in discussions of this great record has been her musical influences. She has been accused of ripping off or overly copying everyone from Madonna (Born This Way) to Queen (You and I) to Depeche Mode (Heavy Metal Lover) to Bon Jovi (Edge of Glory) to herself (Bad Romance), with generic comparisons to Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Tyler, Pat Benator, and David Bowie. Taken individually these comparisons might give rise to the common claim of unorginality. Taken in total, if accepted, they demonstrate a truism of great music: great artists are inspired by the music of others and that inspiration is inevitably reflected in their music. (Personally, I find the predominant influence to be Queen/Freddie Mercury...over the top performance mixed with an undeniable earnestness.) From my perspective she has fused classic rock with modern dance music in a way that is both original, inspiring, and utterly original.     I could do a track-by-track analysis, but others have done a good job of that already. To me, one of the most lightweight of the tracks, Hair, illustrates the glory of Gaga. She takes lyrics that could be construed as completely juvenile (even infantile) and transforms them into something incredibly catchy and even quasi-profound. While a stronger song, the same could be said of Scheisse. Even when she's lyrically inane, she soars musically. I'm not sure about album of the decade, but when was the last time you saw track-by-track reviews by critics? It's interesting to me that even the hyper-critical critics admit an affection for a few songs...and the songs vary from critic to critic. There's obviously something here for most everyone, and isn't that, rather than a universally cohesive and laudable message or \\"living up to the hype,\\" what music is all about?
0307454541|3.0|Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are two of the unlikeliest partners you will ever read about. One is a muck-raking journalist down on his luck; the other is a social reject and computer hacker. Together, they team up to assist an elderly industrialist, Henrik Vanger, who harbors a suspicion that his long-lost niece, Harriet, was murdered decades ago by one of their relatives. This is a bizarre, gruesome work that will either traumatize or intrigue the reader, depending on individual taste. The plot that Larsson has cooked up is far from predictable. The novel begins with Blomkvist's public disgrace after he is sued by a local corporation for slander, then pursues the \\"Harriet\\" storyline for several hundred pages before taking an sudden, unexpected detour into serial killer territory. Complete with horrifying backstories of rape, incest, Nazism, women-haters, murder, and brutality, this is a combo will no doubt be the deal-breaker for more sensitive readers. The novel's biggest flaw is that Larsson tries to cram too much into one book. He feels compelled to follow every subplot and backstory to its fullest potential, a habit that brings him in serious danger of boring the reader to tears. This is unfortunate, because the novel is otherwise hard to put down. The suspense alone is enough to propel the reader through Blomkvist and Salander's grim, rambling investigation of the severely dysfunctional Vanger clan. As is the rule with most bestsellers, there's no fence-sitting for this one. You'll either love it or hate it.
0800141660|5.0|I love this movie. Unlike the romance Hollywood of today tries to get you to buy into, this is fresh and full of hope and love even after a seeming loss. And no one needs to get naked or suffer from potty-mouth! A timeless classic our writers of today need to use as an example. You can keep it clean, people, and still tell a great story!
0316098329|3.0|All his life, Jack has lived in the peace and solitude of Room, a place with no windows but the one skylight in the roof, and no doors except the one with a keypad that requires a code in order for it to open. His constant companion is his mother, known to the reader as \\"Ma.\\" To him, their life is a perfect one. They pass the time with domestic routines, games, and telling stories. All they need is each other, he thinks. That and Old Nick, of course. He's the one who brings them food and clothes when they need them. But he only comes at night. Then one day, Ma tells Jack a new story, one about herself, explaining how she was brought against her will to Room by Old Nick seven years ago. The novel isn't about their captivity, however, so much as it's a story about a mother and son. Donoghue uses this situation to highlight their relationship by using five-year-old Jack as the narrator. His innocent child's voice rings true throughout the novel, though due to the rambling, distracted nature of the prose, it can be hard to plow through at times. The author also presents an interesting dilemma: when Jack finally does encounter the outside world, he finds it confusing and unpleasant. He wants to stay in Room where it's \\"safe,\\" despite the reality that his mother has been held against her will. In this case, is more harm done than good? The answer is entirely up to the reader.
0156027321|5.0|I have never read anything quite like this book before.  On the surface it's a very simple story, but underneath it digs much deeper.    This is more than just a story of a boy and some zoo animals on a lifeboat.  It's a great story of survival but also goes far beyond that.    The pacing of the book is fairly slow.  The prep work and detail before Pi makes it onto the boat takes about 100 pages, and the bulk of the book takes place on the lifeboat.  The pacing doesn't make it boring, the book held my interest, but I will call it an investment.    I don't want to ruin anything in the story.  I thought the ending was amazing, and made the rest of the book that much more powerful.    Although the book didn't make me \\"believe in God,\\" I won't be forgetting it anytime soon.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am not a pop music fan. I have over 3000 CDs and 99% are heavy metal but this woman caught my attention with \\"Bad Romance\\" and I have been a fan ever since. I find her image a bit forced but I can't deny that this album is some of the best pop I have heard. There are no songs I want to skip and I can't get it out of my CD player. Truly a brilliant pop album and I can't wait to see what she does next.    Highlights for me are: Marry The Night, Hair, Scheisse, Bloody Mary, Highway Unicorn, Heavy Metal Lover, Electric Chapel, Edge of Glory. However you know its a great album when favorites vary depending on who you ask. Well done!
1400032717|4.0|This book was definitely not what I expected.    I didn't know I was about to read Christopher's (a 15 year of boy with autism) story.    That being said we follow Christopher on his adventure as he tries to figure out who killed the neighbors dog.  The book is written from his point of view and seems very simplistic but helps greatly with character development.  Although Christopher lacks basic \\"emotions\\", the book allows the reader to feel the emotions for him, and it works quite well.  The book has many heartfelt moments and a few good twists.    Christopher is very good at 'maths' and includes diagrams and mathematical examples throughout his book.  Some of which are quite interesting.    All in all an entertaining quick read.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />In \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\" the penultimate entry in the decade-long \\"Harry Potter\\" movie series (it covers only one-half of the final novel with the second half due out at a later time), things are going from bad to worse for our intrepid little band of wand-waving heroes and the people who have taught and raised them.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is running for his life from the evil Lord Voldemort, who's made it his life's mission to personally finish off the young lad, and the Ministry of Magic has been taken over by Death Eaters, who have begun a wave of persecution against all Muggle-born witches and wizards.<br /><br />For those who are diehard devotees of the \\"Potter\\" series and who have literally grown up with these characters, watching \\"Deathly Hallows\\" must feel a bit like going to the prom in the run-up to senior graduation (an apt comparison since Harry, Hermione and Ron are now all well into their adolescence with all the teen-drama and angst that that inevitably entails).  For those of us who are but casual observers of the tales, the movie feels muddled and poky, its storytelling much too esoteric and confusing and its pacing much too slow.  The latter may be attributed to the fact that this is only one-half of the story, with the promise of a tighter resolution to come in the final installment.  Still, that doesn't make sitting through this film any more palatable or entertaining.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|You did it again Gaga!!  Thanks for inspiring us all.<br /><br />With love always...<br />little monster
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Hi, I'm Jimmi and I am a Little Monster.  I was blown away when I had heard a promo version of this album.  How many albums have songs that stay with you and that you find yourself listening to over and over again? I find myself going back again and again to \\"Marry the Night\\", \\"Born This Way\\", \\"Judas\\", \\"Government Hooker\\", \\"Schei&szlig;e\\", well, you get the idea.  The album is filled with songs that are all worthy of single status.  Lady Gaga does go overboard, pulling out all stops with operatic vocals, songs worthy of meatloaf in his hey-dey, Clarence Clemens sax and Brian May's Guitar.  The album is distinctly American with its love of the open road, wild nights fueled by whiskey and cigarettes from the open world, to Nebraska to the steamy streets of NYC.  The album is grand yet accessible.  It grabs your ears and never lets go.  There are some people who are too cool for school and dis the Lady and her music--time will show them up.  Get your paws on this one!
B0021L8V0M|2.0|...I saw it the first time, when it was called NO WAY OUT, except Kevin Costner was prettier, or at least his lips didn't look so weird. Did the producers think we wouldn't notice it was a rip off?
B0049PBO66|5.0|So I purchased this CD set without no expectation at all. I have heard of Ke$ha on the radio and was somewhat indifferent about her. However when I listened her CDs, they were amazing! Animal had a variety of great songs and some of these songs are quite catchy (especially the ones that weren't her singles!). Cannibal is one of my favorite albums of this year! Every song on Cannibal was worth listening to! In Harold's Song, Ke$ha proved to us that she can sing with very minimal autotuning! Overall, this CD set is worth purchasing. However, the CD set doesn't have a cover booklet. I buy all my CDs because I love collecting these booklets! This set was short of that! :(
0307272702|5.0|After being intrigued by the unrelenting claims of a low-carbohydrate diet and reference's to Gary Taubes' books and his NYT article from 2002 I began to undertake my own research. I watched the documentary response to Super Size Me called [[ASIN:B001NRY6R2 Fat Head]] by Tom Naughton I was beyond intrigued.    So I ordered Why We Get Fat.    Gary Tabues convincingly destroys the traditional knowledge of what constitutes a 'well balanced diet'. Ever since the US government started it's unrelenting campaign, based on fraudulent science, back in the 60s and 70s for us to reduce our amounts of fats and meats and increase our consumption of fruits and grains we as a nation have gotten sicker and fatter. We are suffering now more than ever from maladies such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's, depression, ADHD, etc.    Why We Get Fat outlines how we are starving our bodies of its most essential nutrient, fatty meat, and replace it with a poor substitute, carbohydrates. It is also important to know that more and more research is finally breaking through the establishment that carbohydrates are an addictive substance.    For me this book is a call to war against the current nutritional guidelines that are causing us to lose our health. This is a war to demand honesty from the researches that ignore mountains of data that contradict their recommendations.    In the back of General Taubes' book lists a litany of references for anyone wishing to deconstruct or criticize his conclusions. The few references I've looked into are quite compelling, such as the A TO Z: A Comparative Weight Loss Study.    If you're overweight or diabetic it's not your fault.

B004WJV6OY|5.0|Very nice mix of tunes from Ukulele Songs and Into the Wild.  Just Eddie and his guitar.  What can be better than that?  Really crisp audio and video.

B004K4AUZW|4.0|Let's face it...the album has been SO incredibly hyped up over the past few months that, I think, anything she put out would have been HIGHLY criticized and really wouldn't have lived up to most people's expectations. If anything, it was definitely overkill and it probably hurt the album more than it helped it.<br /><br />The album, as others have mentioned, is quite different from The Fame, even The Fame Monster in a lot of ways. She's going for a darker pop/dance/electro sound with a bit of retro 80's pop mixed in...which is fine with me. I'm not gonna sit here and dissect and over analyze every song as others have already done a much better job at that than I ever could. I personally think the majority of the tracks are awesome. Some are, of course, better than others...personally, the standouts for me are Marry the Night, Born This Way, Hair, Schei&szlig;e, Bloody Mary, Bad Kids, Heavy Metal Lover and The Edge of Glory. It's difficult to pick favorites though as I love pretty much all of them. However, I think we can all do without the grating, over the top mariachi sounds of Americano.<br /><br />The bonus tracks, for those of you who bought the expanded edition (and why wouldn't you?) aren't bad...my personal favorite is Fashion of His Love as it's definitely a throw back to early Madonna, she even sounds like her. The others are fine but you can really tell why they're bonuses. I'm actually a little frustrated with the other 2 bonuses (Black Jesus + Amen Fashion and The Queen) as I can just imagine how they SHOULD have sounded, they could have been great with just a bit of tweaking and perhaps a bit of restraint. As far as the remixes go, the only, even slightly enjoyable, ones are Born This Way (The Country Road Version) and Fashion of His Love (Fernando Garibay Remix)...the others are basically not even worth a listen, in my opinion.<br /><br />My only real complaint is the production...this is what lead to my 4 star rating as opposed to 5. I DO think SO much was put into almost every song that her vocals tend to get lost at times. Gaga is definitely an \\"everything but the kitchen sink\\" kinda girl when it comes to her music and this sometimes leads it to feel like a bit of a mess. So yes, I think a major flaw in the album is that it's a bit overproduced. A lot of the time it doesn't appear to have a very clean, clear sound.<br /><br />I think it's a great album. Album of the decade? Definitely not. But I think that was probably a statement that should have been taken with a grain of salt to begin with as every artist would probably love to look at their efforts in that way. If they don't believe in it, why should we? The Madonna comparisons, in my opinion, are ridiculous. Nothing is ever going to be truly original. Something is almost always going to sound like something else. I think Gaga has done an amazing job at weaving together several of her different musical influences. You can see that she pulls from so many different artists and genres and she does it ALMOST flawlessly.<br /><br />In the end, what we have here is an awesome sophomore effort from one of the most outrageously, rawly talented performers and singers ever. A true artist who is very much an inspiration on a personal, social and musical level who has a vision that always commands attention. And I truly believe she does it all just by genuinely being herself. Sadly, as I said before, the album will be overlooked by a lot of people based on too much hype. I don't think she's gaining many NEW fans from this. It's never going to live up to everyone's expectations at this point. However, Gaga has enough of her hardcore \\"little monsters\\" out there to make it a highly deserved success.ry song that her vocals tend to get lost at times.

B004I11VZA|1.0|For those who watched the spectacular Ip Man, the first movie, this is going to be a great disappointment.  From the beginning to the end of the movie it cannot compete with the first one.  This movie was miserably directed and I feel for Donnie Yen who had to read the script and act accordingly.    The Character of Ip Man is made too weak as well as Sammo Hung who plays his adversary for most of the movie but then suddenly he gives Ip Man tickets to a boxing match one day and just like that they become fast friends--yeah right.  Unbelievable and it shows just how much respect the director has for the intelligence of the audience...absolutely none.    Ip Man first opens a martial arts studio on a roof of a business building and a whose-school-is-best fight breaks out between Ip Man's students and Sammo Hungs shortly thereafter.  Ip Man gets evicted from the place where he was teaching because of it and ends up teaching inside his own apartment.      In the first movie Ip Man fights the second best and beats him.  Then, a rogue tough guy martial artist comes into town and fights every single martial arts master in Ip Man's town and beats them all.  Finally, he learns of Ip Man and challenges him.  Ip Man readily hands him his backside in a hand basket.  I don't think he ever touches Ip Man in that awesome indoor fight.    Now, we go back to Ip Man 2.  The same rogue is in the movie and it's as if they castrated him, gave him a new hair style and took away all the toughness he had in the first one and becomes Ip Man's friend.  Becoming Ip Man's friend was great but giving him the new girly look was not.  Near the end of the movie Ip Man does something which is very unprofessional--he begins bragging about how he beat up the rogue who had helped him so much in this movie and had become his friend.  You don't talk bad about your friends--you just don't.    In Ip Man 2 there's a fight in the market where he and his best student fight off an army of Sammo Hung's studentsand friends--I'm talking about a massive amount of people.  That's where the rogue comes to the rescue, when things are just beginning to look hopeless.    Now, at this boxing match the true villain of the film is an English boxer--a real tough customer.  He insults the Chinese fighting style so Sammo Hung gets in there and gets killed by this boxer--who the hell is going to believe that after the fight he had with Ip Man which was deemed a stalemate.  No boxer, regardless of his skill, should have even been able to touch Sammo Hung if he's as good as Ip Man.  It defies reason.    Yep, you guessed it, Ip Man gets angry and picks up the gauntlet.  The fight between the boxer and Ip Man is the biggest most ludicrous fight I have ever seen based on what happened in the first film where Ip Man beat the intestinal fortitude out of 10 Japanese black belts simultaneously (without being touched).  Later he beat the Ultimate Japanese fighter in one of the best fight sequences on film.     He does all this in the first film, fights an army at the market in the Ip Man 2 and yet he can barely beat a single boxer with muscles.  Shameful!    I can't emphasize just how bogus, unrealistic and stupid this movie was.  Poor Grand Master Ip Man is probably turning in his grave.    Perhaps if it would have been directed by Sylvester Stallone, it may have been better--but I doubt it.  When any caliber of boxer meets a true Grand Master of Wing Chun--the boxer doesn't have a chance--period.    At best the movie was an abysmal disappointment.  Do yourself, your family, and friends a favor and just watch the first film of Ip Man and bypass Ip Man 2; you'll be glad you did.
1400079144|2.0|When Dan Brown provocatively asked \\"Is there no help for the widows son?\\" in the dust jacket of the DaVinci code, my curiosity was up.  And when I first heard that this book would be titled \\"The Solomon Key,\\" I was under the impression things were heading in the right direction.  While I find Brown's writing much too formulaic, I was curious about what Masonic secrets he might reveal and how he might go about doing that.  It was all downhill from there.    This book is pretty weak.  The story is essentially an exact replica of \\"Angles\\" and \\"DaVinci\\" but in Washington instead of Rome or Paris.  And his really bad attempts at giving us some secrets about our favorite not-so-secret society came up waaaaaaaaaay short!  All I got from this book is that there are Aliens looking over us and that the buildings in Washington provide the evidence.  Is that what you were saying Dan?  Maybe you're the alien?!
0439023521|5.0|I have to admit that I bought this book about a month ago and it took me a while to get around to reading it. Now I'm upset I didn't read it earlier! I absolutely LOVED this book despite the fact that it was written for the young adult (it's also much better than the mediocre Twilight series). The book had me on the edge with its riveting hunger games...the games that were devised to keep the working masses in check. The setting is America (I believe in Colorado or thereabouts) many years from now. The new nation (Panem) was divided into 13 districts and on capitol. After a revolt by the masses that occurred largely in the 13th district, the President devised the Hunger games to remind the masses who is in charge (the capitol/president). The hunger games involves each district (except for the 13th which was destroyed after the revolution was halted) \\"randomly\\" selecting one female and one male child into an Arena where the kids fight to the death. Despite the seriousness of the hunger games, the author managed to get in some funny parts that had me laugh aloud. I also liked the love triangle between Gale, Katniss and Peeta (I especially &lt;3 Peeta). I can't wait for the movie to come out... Go read this book! It's the best book I've read in a LONG time.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|I love this album, has a mix of sounds and lots of great club tracks.  She really is the best popstar out right now.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I've waited for \\"Born This Way\\" ever since GaGa announced she was recording material for a new album, even when she didn't release a title. I kept listening to more and more singles right when they come out and now we finally have Born This Way, a brilliant album! I got the album yesterday (the day it came out) and I heard it the same day. I couldn't be more impressed. The lyrics, production, and everything is AMAZING! This album is on fire!       It begins with the opening track \\"Marry the Night\\" (my favorite). It's very soft and wedding-like in it's first 30 seconds and turns into a thumping electronic songs with great lyrics. Great way to begin the album! Then, the next track is \\"Born This Way\\", and of course everyone's heard it, but it's still a hot song with phenomenal lyrics and production. I was excited to hear the actual version of \\"Government Hooker\\" (the 2 1/2 minute Mugler version was already on fire when it was released to the internet), and it was awesome! The chorus and that thumping beat is amazing. \\"Judas\\" is fourth track and it's an awesome song. I heard it when it premiered on the radio and I obviously loved it.It's one of those GaGa songs that have a certain message, so nobody should be thrown off by the title.       Lady GaGa shows some diversity on \\"Americano\\" where she speaks some Spanish lyrics over a Latin-electronic beat. It reminds me of the song \\"Desnudate\\" from the latest Christina Aguilera album. \\"Hair\\" is an amazing track. It has fantastic lyrics and everything about it fits perfectly. It was definitely promo-single worthy. \\"Schiesse\\" was also a song I couldn't wait to hear the real version of. (The DJ White Shadow Mugler remix that's also on the Disc 2 of this album was released on GaGa Daily in February and ever since, I've been dying to hear the real version and I'm so impressed! She managed to pull off a thumping German-electro song, showing even more diversity (and languages) on BTW. \\"Bloody Mary\\" is one of my favorites. It'sone of those spiritual GaGa songs (that still throw you off with the title). I love the verses and those thumping drums are awesome.       \\"Black Jesus + Amen Fashion\\" is yet another spiritual GaGa song with a throw-off title, but it's awesome! I love the lyrics and production. \\"Bad Kids\\" is a great song, too. The lyrics and chorus are my favorite parts of the song. \\"Fashion of His Love\\" is a great 80s throwback and it's a pretty cute song. It's great. \\"Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)\\" shows a bit of drama and I love it! It's a standout on the album.       \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" is definitely one of my favorites! I love the chorus and that beat is amazing! \\"Electric Chapel\\" is the next track and it gets a bit mellow in the chorus with a nice electronic beat. \\"The Queen\\" is one of my definite favorites, also. I absolutely love the meaningful lyrics and everything is done extremely well. \\"You and I\\" is the first song that GaGa released, so it definitely is important. The lyrics (that always mention Nebraska) are amazing and it works well as the second-to-last song. \\"The Edge of Glory\\" is my 2nd favorite. It's dedicated to her late granfather and it's beautiful. Everything is wonderful and it's the perfect fit for the closing song.       The Disc 2 with 5 remixes is absolutely awesome! It starts with the Contry Road Version of \\"Born This Way\\", and I absolutely love it. It's the only country song I like (I absolutely HATE country by the way). It's the best version of BTW. The \\"Judas (DJ White Shadow Remix)\\" is another great and thumping remix dub from DJ White Shadow (his BTW remix was amazing). \\"Marry the Night (Zedd Remix)\\" only includes my favoitee part of the song (the chorus) once, but I still love the zippery synths and loud beat. The \\"Scheisse (DJ White Shadow Mugler)\\" is a great 9 1/2 minute remix that I first heard in February and I realized the kinda remixed the remix itself. It sounds PHENOMENAL! It closes with the amazing \\"Fashion of His Love (Fernando Garibay Remix)\\". A great dance remix to a great song and a crazy good way to end the remix disc.        Born This Way is an applause-worthy winner of an album! It's one of my favorite albums ever! It showcases GaGa's extreme talent (and diversity of languages like Italian, German, Spanish) along with crazy vocal talent and it's truly an amazing album. Can't wait for more GaGa! Paws up!
B00466HM28|5.0|I use this with an iPad 2, controlling Garageband and the Korg iMS-20. Both the keyboard and pad controls work flawlessly. The Akai editor program is simple to use, and it's the most portable controller I think possible for the features. 100% compatible with iPad, which I was unsure of before ordering, but I've never once received an \\"insufficient power\\" dialog. Highly recommended!
0670022411|4.0|A Discovery of Witches is a romance novel above all else. THe emphasis on the characters' emotions and feelings is the heart of the book, with the fantasy and historical elements added to push the storyline along. Yes, the whole vampire thing is way overdone these days, but Harkness's vampires have a softness and- dare I say0 a humanity to them, which makes the novel very enjoyable. The mix of the fantasy and historical elements is done extremely well, and the science fiction elements with the DNA testing bring it forth as a modern novel, and intrigue me as an aspiring scientist.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I really liked this book and totally understand where she's coming from. I'm not Chinese but I'm Asian and I was raised in a similar manner. I totally get it although my family was never into tons of practice and no play, there was definitely only one direction that we could go in. People may ridicule her parenting but let me tell you, it works. Perhaps the asian culture lacks the lovey dovey feeling you get from western parenting but there's definitely no lack in intelligence, ability and success.
B0036T31YY|5.0|Excellent film, if you are into mind trips like david lynch films and love lucid dreaming because this movie puts you there!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I really don't care about the video transfer rate and all that.  And I realize this hasn't come out yet.  But I can't stomach the idea of watching the series, coming to the end, and seeing a holographic Hayden Christensen.  I bought the last DVD versions that came out.  The whole time I'm getting more and more annoyed, not just by the random CGI dinosaurs wandering around, but by things that were changed seemingly with no other reason than to mess with fans of the original series.  George Lucas can say what he wants about \\"this was how I originally wanted to do the series, but we didn't have the technology, and now we do, so here's some dinosaurs!\\"  But he changes other things inexplicably.  For example, the song that the band is playing at Jabba's palace, and the \\"ewok celebration\\" song at the end of the movie are both changed.  Why?  Who knows.  I'm pretty sure that if he wanted to have different music in the original versions, that was technologically possible at the time.  And then when you get to the end of the whole series, you're sitting there wondering what happened to the happy ewok nub nub song and then you have to look at Jar Jar's BFF, Hayden Christensen.  And why is he there?  Who knows.  They didn't replace Alec Guiness with Ewan McGregor.  They didn't replace old yoda with some sort of younger, 200 year old version of yoda.  I was so disappointed I had to put in the original version and rewatch the whole last scene, which sucked because it was the laser disc transfer.  But I guess that's all we're getting.  Hence the one star review.  On a side note, I also give Phantom menace a one star review.  Those of you who buy this set, look out.  I recently rewatched the Phantom Menace, and there's SO much more Jar Jar in there than I remembered.  Meesa no likee George Lucas.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I really, really enjoyed the earlier movie versions of Harry Potter but this one wasn't my cuppa tea. The earlier ones seemed to be \\"action pack\\" from start to finish while I found myself going to the refrigerator a lot with \\"Deathly Hallows.\\" Just wanted it as an addition to my collections. Not one to watch more than twice.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I've never really listened to GaGa extensively, and I really am not familiar with alot of her tracks. I don't own her first CD, and I've only heard the radio singles, Teeth, and Speechless before this album.    However, I kinda liked what I heard, but never got the album. However, I noticed Amazon was selling this album for 99 cents, and I told myself to just buy it. I did. I was shocked.    The album was really quite good. It wasn't *amazing*, but I'm now alot more interested in Gaga's music then I was beforehand. The songs were strong, catchy, and dark. Being a fan of rock, this album quite pleased me.    Anyway, I'm gonna do a short track-by-track of the normal version of the album.    Marry the Night - 6/10  I found it a rather odd song, and I liked the beginning, but about midway through it just seemed like the title was being repeated over and over and over again... Her voice is good, but the song got a little dull.    Born This Way - 7.5/10  Being the lead single, I wasn't terribly impressed, however, I found that the song stuck in my head for *forever*... Then Glee did a cover, and I liked it even more. The song grew on me, and it got better in my head. I'd not be shocked if this is sitting at a 9/10 in a few weeks, in my mind.    Government Hooker - 8/10  The beginning was just damn weird. And somehow I found it fascinating. I loved the voice mix, and once it got into the song I loved it even more. It was dark, creepy, and so interesting to listen to. The lyrics were dark, but extremely clever. (i.e. \\"Come on touch me, John F. Kennedy\\" made me grin)    Judas - 9/10  A brilliant song. The lyrics was smart, the song isn't terribly overwhelming, in terms of sound, and Gaga's voice shines. The music is fun, and the blending of the voice and music was great. I really liked this one :)    Americano - 9/10  Such a strange song, and seems inspired by the \\"I Speak No Americano\\" song by... erm... whoever sang that song >.> But it was a cool song, and I liked hearingGaga sing in spanish. It was also a really dark song, for some odd reason. The music just keep it so dark and mysterious that I was drawn in.    Hair - 8.5/10  I liked it, but at the same time I didn't. It was a really strange song, and the lyrics were also pretty weird. However, it just got better as it went on, and grew into a really nice ballad in the middle of the album.    Scheiße - 10/10  I love this song. I have no real reason why. I just do. The start is just so creepy, and music is dark and sleek, and pulls the song into a very strange dark and romantic feel.    Bloody Mary - 8.5/10  I liked the start alot, loved the opening verse, but the chorus killed it for me. I didn't like it very much, and I felt like the feelings invoked in the chorus stray from the song. It goes from a dark song about refusal and love, to a sort of solemn song about acceptance once it hits the chorus, and then strays back again. I love the screams from Gaga though. Amazing.    Bad Kids - 7/10  A loud one that I kinda like, but honestly, it can get a little annoying and dull after a few plays in a row. However, it's not a bad song overall, and I like it enough.    Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) - 9/10  It gets an extra point for being called \\"Highway Unicorn\\". That just made me laugh out loud. Hard. Anyway, the song... It's quite a good song. I love the lyrics, and the music is really fun. It sounds like something I'd listen to when in a bad mood to channel my fury or so. I can't really explain that, but I just like the emotions I get from it.    Heavy Metal Lover - 8/10  I actually really liked this one, though I was kinda annoyed it was called \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\", and then didn't actually go very heavy. It just uses Bass. Alot of it. Which was pretty awesome anyway. A bit sexual, but I care not.    Electric Chapel - 8/10  Cool song, right off the bat. I love the riff from the guitar and the swelling orchestral accompaniment at the start, and enjoyed the song alot. It's a mid-tempobeat, which makes it pretty fun to hear, and it's, per usual, for this album, nicely dark.    Yoü And I - 6/10  I really didn't like this one much. It's a ballad, but the music didn't fit it well. I honestly think it would have sounded a bit better without the bass twangs in the background. An acoustic guitar would have been nice, as that would have fit the drums better. I love the lyrics and Gaga's voice however.    The Edge of Glory - 9/10  Good song - no! great song. Edgy, dark, fun, and exciting. Gaga's voice is strong, the lyrics are clever, and the chorus is just begging to be screamed along with. Really great song.      Overall - 8/10  A strong album with a good beat, good singing, and good lyrics. It's not *amazing* per-say, but it's definently worth buying. I greatly enjoyed it.
0375842209|4.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" by Marcus Zusak can be considered young-adult, historical fiction written to appeal to adolescents but appropriate for everyone. In the novel, Zusak uses the personage of Death to narrate in the third-person, omniscient perspective. While one would assume that the use of Death as a narrator would cause the piece to be dark or judgmental of the actions of German citizens during WWII, it actually causes the tone of the book to be satirical as demonstrated by Death's interjections showing that he is compassionate, tenderly carrying the souls of the deceased; enjoys the \\"stupid gallantry\\" of humans; and, in a reversal of roles, he is \\"haunted by humans\\" (Zusak). Although this book is a satire about portrayals of war and the negative image of all German citizens during WWII, the mood of the book is very encompassing: depressing, heart-warming, dark, and even romantic.         The book tells the story of the \\"Book Thief,\\" a girl entering adolescence named Liesel Meminger. Leaving a life of Communism and their incapable mother, Liesel and her younger brother, Werner, leave for the fictitious city of Molching, Germany and a life with Hans and Rosa Hubermann, their foster parents. Werner dies on the way leaving Liesel with a sense of abandonment and her first book, The Grave Digger's Handbook. Liesel fills the void in her life with knowledge from her menagerie of books that she obtains as gifts or through theft. However, this is not the sole focus of the novel. This is also the story of a girl growing up in Hitler's Germany depicting people of all scopes of life, such as Rudy Steiner, her close friend and a great athlete; Max Vandenburg, a fugitive Jew; and Ilsa Herman, the wife of the mayor.         The book primarily explores two themes. First, Zusak uses this piece of literature to prove that not all Germans were Nazis. Obviously, this is true. Not everyone in this country is a Republican, just as not everyone was a Nazi, and different people took Nazism to different degrees. Second, the book talks about the power of words. As described throughout the book and in a section called The Word Shaker, words are powerful things capable of good and evil. Once again, I agree with Zusak. Words made what Hitler did possible, but they also give us strength and hope necessary for life.         Overall, the novel was an exceptional piece of literature. While the novel was a bit shallow in historical detail, only alluding to things like the Nuremberg Laws and major battles, the use of Death as a narrator was ingenious. Death was capable of humor, seriousness, and a Smorgasbord of other attitudes. Additionally, since the novel sought to explain a child's perspective of Nazi Germany, it was filled with vivid imagery capturing some beauty in almost everything. If I were Zusak, despite doing a great job already, I would have increased the amount of historical detail in the piece and limited the Death's foreshadowing throughout the novel so that the ending could have greater effect. Overall, it was an outstanding read.
1592402038|2.0|Not until page 33 of the 34-page introduction - which comprises approximately 1/6 of the book - does the author reveal that \\"this book doesn't instruct about punctuation.\\" Instead, it \\"gives [the reader] permission to love punctuation.\\"<br /><br />If you actually want to learn how to properly punctuate American English - or any English at all - then find a different book. If you like to ridicule people for not knowing how to punctuate then this is the book for you. This book reminds me of a bad slasher film. People often go see these films for no other reason than to feel superior to the doomed victims who run screaming into the night, yet stop and look behind them just long enough for their assailant to catch them. \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" allows its readers to feel superior by thinking, \\"I would never make a stupid mistake like that. My goodness, how ignorant the rest of the world is compared to me and my fellow punctuation sticklers.\\"
0596809158|5.0|I'm a long time Matlab user, but have been using R for a couple months now.  Still on the fence on their relative merits (they're different, let me say), but it's been interesting.  I had the help of friends, but this book got me going.  I bought probably 10 books, and this is far and away the best place to start.  Nice combination of keeping it simple and still giving you a sense of the logic of the software.  What it doesn't have is details about specific things (graphics, for example), but it gets you close enough that you can usually figure the rest out for yourself.  Great book, well written, good coverage of topics -- at least for my use (analysis of international macroeconomic data).
B0019NB9A2|5.0|There were a few classic sci fi movies from the 50's and this is by all considerations one of them. A masterful reworking of the Tempest, this movie broke new ground with cinematography and futurism, made even more amazing by a comparison with todays computer generated animation. On all levels this movie is a work of genius, from the set design (incorporating art from modernist masters), to the sweeping landscaping backgrounds (reminiscent of the artwork for contemporary sci fi novels), to the robotics (the famous Robbie the Robot), all of this accompanied by the brilliant score and music by Louis and Bebe Barron (and the eerie and soulful use of the theramin).    At its heart, a simple morality play, but with many layers of human aberrant psychological fears, greed and hubris, this is an event best viewed in widescreen Blu-Ray format. Yes, by comparison with Avatar and Start Wars, the movie wants for spectacular action, however, its naivete and earnestness has its own appeal. When this movie is viewed by a 21st century audience, there are levels of specific relevance with current fears of apocalypse and global doom, that are quite different to the fears of atomic oblivion faced by its 50's audience. This is its charm, as its general theme can be accessed and understood by a modern contemporary audience. From masterful acting by Leslie Neilsen acting as a romantic hero lead, and Anne Francis as the virginal innocent/provocateur whos innocence and humility finally sets the scene for the resolution of mans arrogance and conceit as portrayed by Walter Pidgeon, this is a ensemble cast.    The screenplay is tight and absent of glaring science errors (that usually damaged other sci fi movies, no flying vampire monsters, or rubber masks here), this is a movie that can be watched over and over without feeling foolish.    I would recommend this to any lover of the genre.
B0020MKTOS|2.0|I was not happy with this movie. The story was interesting. It might have been good but the language was so filthy and so pervasive that even some severe editing could not have saved it. The bad language seemed to me to be in virtually every scene and I believe that every character had a foul mouth. And there was a lot of violence. I would not recommend it and would not watch it again. My family member watched the whole movie, but I walked out because of the violence and offensive language. The reason I say that it was interesting is because my relatives verbally told me how the story developed after I walked out and also how it ended. The reason I bought it, was that my family member had borrowed it from a friend but lost the friend's DVD before it could be returned. I bought it as a replacement DVD so that it could be returned to the owner. Otherwise, I would never have spent money on this movie. On the other hand, I will say that the seller was fast and the cost was inexpensive. The DVD arrived quickly and was brand new in the shrink wrap as advertized.
055357342X|5.0|BAM! I mean just like that this thing comes at you.     I read Game of Thrones and considered it a masterpiece that transcended its' genre and provided a thrilling tale. I read the sequel A Clash of Kings and was honestly somewhat deflated on the series as a whole. I expected the second to be the epic war installment, and when that fizzled out (spectacular finale aside), I didn't know where the series was headed.    And that's where it gets you.    Because no, you don't know where this series is heading. More than any other installment, each characters chapters are more of an adventure unto themselves. Every character that gets a point of view has a significant story that all reach satisfying (if not happy) ending or well played cliff hangers.     Plus big thumbs up for George RR Martin completely transforming Danerys. I felt her story was horribly boring in the second book, and felt that he had run out of ideas for the character. But no, no my friends. She's back, and her tale may be the most interesting in the book. The title of this review comes from her arc and I dare not say anything else.     Of one Arya Stark however, there is much to say. Hands down she is now one of my favorite child characters ever, as she yet again steals the show. She starts of the book lost in the woods and never really escapes. Tragically wandering, her's is a tale of grief, hope, shock, action, and ultimately comes down to doing what you have to and letting it shape who you are. It's not exactly a triumphant story, but I dare you not to cheer at it's climax. There's a scene at a tavern at the end that will make your heart stop and your eyes widen when it begins. Then the ending satisfies something that could have been a dragged out Lost style, but is capitalized on and leaves you in awe and severe impatience.     Everyone else is fantastic, but I don't want to spoil too much. In fact the only character who doesn't have his best outing yet is Tyrion, and that's  because even he can't top himself. His story is still exceptional though.    There's one other thing you should know about this book. People die a lot. The series has never been shy about this, but it's done here to what some consider an excessive amount. Mostly concerning an event midway through. There is a lot death here, yes, but even the cruelest feel they were done with purpose. Same for the twists. Twists in this story come as unexpectedly developed turns, and not lame endings. They are shocking developments that drive the story and keep you constantly on your toes and reading. This is the series smoothest effort in terms of action and pace. It never slows down, it never gives up.    In fact as I sit here writing this, I must say this is even better than A Game of Thrones. It's more fantasy loaded, so if that bothers you significantly for some reason, then best stay back. Otherwise you're in for a story of immense proportions that tells of so many events, you might even shock yourself on a re-read of ones you forgot about.    Yup, best of the series.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I've read this 4 times since I discovered it on Kindle shortly after it was published. I cannot wait for the sequels. The author paints her world so well, you feel completely immersed in it. I sit on kindle for hours at a time reading this.
B000UZQI0Q|2.0|I am just fed up with the constant repetition of how allomancy works.  I have never been fond of an author rehashing the first book in the series once they hit their sequels, but I understand it needs to be done to an extent, but Sanderson overkills it.  I wasn't entirely fond of book one, but thought book two should pick up and it should be open highway from there, but instead I hit massive traffic with constant rehash, pining, whining, and no real substance to move this story along.  Then he *SPOILER* kills off the most interesting character in this story, Zane*END SPOILER*.  Thanks for eliminating one of the more interesting characters.  I know I'll finish off this series and I can only hope the next book is less explaining and actually has a story to it.  The powers in this book are not that complicated to understand. How many times did we need to hear how Breeze can soothe a crowd?  How many times do we need to hear Vin is learning to trust?  How many times do we need to get spoon fed Feruchemy? How Sazed stores his religion and powers in his metal every time we see him.  It's like announcing how everyone has to pee, poop, and breathe every time they do something. STORY PLEASE.  I ended up skimming through pages upon pages of boring explanation to try and weed out some semblance of a story and in the meantime where love of characters should develop, I ended up finding them annoying.  Two stars is the best I could give this book.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Look - I'm no Lady Gaga fanatic.  I have neither of her 2 earlier albums (or extensions), just a few CDs here and there.    However, this... this is an epic CD.    Channeling and sampling music from earlier artists- in short, borrowing from Hip Hop- adding empowerment, great *singing* ... this is a milestone in 21st century pop music.    Highlights:  - Hair: maybe it's because I have so little, but i love it!  - Americano:  excellent!  - Fashion of His Love: Channel Whitney Houston baby...  - You and I  - Marry the Night    Bring it On.    I am one of the converted.
B0045EJY90|4.0|I want to keep this short.  Some big pros and a few small cons.  Pros:  CD-quality sound from my iPod Touch 3rd Gen.  Remote control.  Nice quality internal parts (as far as I can tell), from the tray mechanism to the DAC to the headphone amp section.  Looks cool on my nightstand with some nice headphones nearby.  The USB jack on the front is such a cool feature.  I'm not interested in recording mp3s (which is also a cool feature); I just want to play CDs and Apple Lossless tracks through some good headphones while chillin on my bed every once in a while.  Cons:  When I contacted TEAC to ask about specs beyond what is published at their website or in the manual, they just referred me to the product description page at the website.  Also, I asked if the USB jack accesses the iPod's line out or the digital out, and they said, \\"Yes, it plays your iPod\\".  Either way, stuff sounds good with this setup.  This is not that big of a deal, but when I play CDs, I like to set the timer to count down the remaining time for each track(a habit I got from DJing); thus, I set the timer this way when I listen to CDs, but the unit does not save this setting.  Also, I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but when I change the unit's display to show the iPod's track/playlist/etc. info, I can only get it to play one track at a time.  Anyways, I like the sounds coming out of the CD-P650.  This CD player rocks!    edit:  I noticed that the iPod's \\"EQ\\" and \\"SoundCheck\\" options are still accessible, and they still impact the sound when hooked up to the USB jack of the CD-P650.  If this really a digital connection, shouldn't these be ineffective?  I mean, not just disabled, but completely unable to apply an audio algorithm to a digital signal?  If anyone has some input on this, feel free to add a comment to my review.
0553582038|2.0|I don't want to add to the hate of this book and the series as a whole has given me much enjoyment, so I'll keep this brief.What you really need to know is if you can skip this book.     The answer is...mostly. There are no doubt things that happen in its' half a story that are going to be significant later, but for now you'll struggle to care. It's not that the random and new characters aren't interesting or that their situations are boring, it just all seems so unnecessary. At times, it feels like reading a textbook when trying to get through these seemingly random side stories and their maddening details.  The endings to these chapters are good, but they're the only thing that are. It's like someone who blows all their time setting up a joke, and the punchline just doesn't hit the same.     Not that the regular characters fair much better. Here's a guick rundown. Cersei? Ungodly long for a character no one really liked before. Fail. Brienne? Almost no redeeming qualities and ends on a groan worthy cliffhanger. Fail. Samwell? Geesh, just wake me when we get there. Fail. Sisters Sansa and Arya? Better, but each only get a few chapters. Sansa grows a little, Arya grows a lot, but you'll ultimately want more. Finally there's Jaimie who gets the best arc. It's not near as good as previous ones, but is so fantastically solid it stands apart in this installment.     So it comes back to skipping. I stay stick to skim reading. You can read the notes of this one yeah, but there are still little things that are better experienced. Just bull through it even if your eyes wander a few paragraphs.     It's a Feast for Crows, but there is slim pickings here for us readers.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The show is great. Development of the characters over the seasons and the writing of the episodes keeps you captivated.
B003L77G6A|4.0|** WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS **<br /><br />Season 4 of 'The Big Bang Theory' had just one thing that separated it from every other show about a group of friends in their late 20's/early 30's: Sheldon Cooper.<br />When the show first began, it was about a stereotypical Midwestern blonde girl who moves to California to make it big, and she happens to move across the hall from two Caltech geniuses who severely lack the social skills of the average human being. At the beginning of the series, Leonard, Sheldon, Howard and Raj were absorbed by science. The humor was a product of their \\"experiments\\" and their inability to fit into the social environment. Here we are four seasons later, and that concept has become scarce as the story has progressed. Sheldon was the only facet of the show that gave it originality this season. I love the show, but it pains me to say that S4 of 'The Big Bang Theory' started to get away from what made it so great.<br /><br />It baffles me why the show would decide to introduce so many new cast members in such a short period of time. As a guy, when I first watched the show, I didn't take to the 4:1 guys to girls ratio. However, that's one of the things made it unique (see: Seinfeld). Penny was able to hold up a level of femininity that most actresses couldn't. She was the perfect solo female star. Not only does evening the gender ratio make this show like every other comedy on television, but it reduces Penny's role on the show. She didn't need a \\"posse.\\" The show spent much of Season 4 trying to balance seven main characters (eight once Priya became a regular) when the only ones who really are essential to its continued excellence are Sheldon and Penny.<br /><br />My synopsis of our \\"new\\" characters:<br />*I'm sorry to say this, but Amy Farrah Fowler is a mess of a character. First, she was introduced as the lady Sheldon, someone who only communicated with Dr. Cooper through webcam and text message and had no interest in developing any real social relationships. Then the show decides that Amy should try to befriend Penny and Bernadette and the three of them would become their own girl group. Since that time, Amy has become a complete one-eighty of her former self, awkward and clueless but trying desperately to fit into the social scene. And I hate to say it, but it's nowhere near as funny as it should be. The strangest thing is that her relationship with Sheldon is essentially very little more than circumstantial now. Sheldon constantly asks, \\"what happened to you?\\", and here I'm wondering the same exact thing.<br /><br />*Bernadette, I will admit I do like as a complimentary girl in the show. The only downfall with her is in dating Howard; I always liked the way Howard thought he was so much more suave and debonair with women than he actually was, and putting him in a relationship takes that element of his character away. Bernadette can stand on her own. She's a sweet, cute, sometimes airheaded but lovable character (and to be quite honest, I could listen to her voice all day). She didn't need to be one of the boys' love interests to find a role on the show. Either way, I think she'd work best in a recurring role, something akin to that of Leslie Winkle in the first couple seasons.<br /><br />*It's kind of a paradox that I liked the idea of Leonard dating Raj's sister, but I don't like Raj's sister. The idea was good because of the dynamic it created between Leonard and Raj, Raj and Priya, Penny and Priya, so on and so forth. The problem is I didn't find that her character brought much of anything to the show. The fact that she was attractive and that threatened Penny was a clever twist because it made Penny re-think her decision to end things with Leonard (and ultimately, we find out that it's a decision she regretted). So I thought the situation they created by having Leonard date Priya was good, but Priya just doesn't seem to fit on the show. Now from what we learned in the season finale, her role on theshow may be hanging in the balance. I'm not aching for her to leave the show, but I wouldn't miss her too much if she went that route.<br /><br />The show suffered a minor slump when Kaley Cuoco broke her leg and had to be absent for two full episodes. Those episodes perfectly showcased how vital the character of Penny is to the show's success. In \\"The Desperation Emanation\\" (ep. 4.05), Leonard is set up by Bernadette with a girl named Joy. Her character was not only unfunny, she was downright repulsive. In a season with peaks and valleys, it didn't get any lower than Joy.<br /><br />By no means am I saying this show has jumped the shark. It had many redeeming moments and a few classic episodes:<br /><br />*\\"The Robotic Manipulation\\" (ep. 4.01) so perfectly personifies Howard Wolowitz.<br />*\\"The Love Car Displacement\\" (ep. 4.13) was a great episode top to bottom. Including a guest appearance from former NBA player Rick Fox, it is the best the writers got out of their extended cast. There was great balance, funny storylines and laugh out loud moments.<br />*\\"The Justice League Recombination\\" (ep. 4.11) re-introduces us to Zack, a hilariously dumb ex-boyfriend of Penny's. The New Year's Eve costume contest is classic 'Big Bang.'<br />*\\"The Herb Garden Germination\\" (4.20) is the high school rumor mill, 'Big Bang' style. I loved it (and it's probably Amy's best episode).<br />*When the group starts hanging out at Raj's apartment, Sheldon decides he'd rather just replace them with new friends in \\"The Toast Derivation.\\" (ep. 4.17) Clever episode and very well executed.<br />*\\"The Zarnecki Incursion\\" (4.19) is a brilliant depiction of the gang looking to settle the score when Sheldon's World of Warcraft account gets hacked.<br />*\\"The Zazzy Substitution\\" (ep. 4.03) is the first time we see any sort of fallout from Sheldon's lack of social connection, and it results in a pretty hilarious new gig. I'm also a big fan of whenever Mrs. Cooper or Mrs. Hofstadter make an appearance.<br />*\\"The 21-Second Excitation\\" (ep. 4.08)  proves that any episode can be made epic with an appearance from Sheldon's nemesis, Will Wheaton. ^Side note: (This episode is also the perfect example of why I don't like Amy; the humor associated with her character for most of the season is perfectly on display in this episode)<br /><br />- Sheldon and Penny's back and forth at the Cheesecake Factory bar in \\"The Apology Insufficiency\\" (ep. 4.07) is incredible. It's astounding how funny those two actors can make simple conversation. Throughout the series, it's been most evident when they walk together up the three flights of stairs to their apartments.<br />- \\"Shelbot\\" was an inevitable story for a science fiction show to tell. \\"The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification\\" (ep. 4.02)<br />- Raj's infatuation with Bernadette throughout the season makes for some great love triangle moments.<br /><br />I didn't particularly love the season finale, but the way the stories all came together at the end was fantastic and should send the show into Season 5 with a head of steam. I loved the idea of having Penny get caught in a scandalous mistake. With Priya seemingly leaving the picture (at least for now), the possibilities are endless. Also worth asking: Will Howard be OK with Bernadette \\"wearing the pants\\" in the relationship, or will he finally pursue his PHD in Season 5? The questions are plentiful.<br /><br />It was an uneven season. It was a season that did a lot of things but didn't really go anywhere definitive with it. I thought the emphasis was too much on developing social relationships and not enough on the science of the show.<br />- If you asked me what Leonard did in Season 4 other than date Priya, off the top of my head I couldn't tell you.<br />- Penny spent the entire season in denial over the fact that she wanted Leonard back. As a result, other than a brief stint with Zack and her drunken night with Raj, Penny was involved with no one in S4. Rather, the writers decided to develop her \\"posse\\", a decision you already know I wasn't a big fan of.<br />- Once Howard started dating Bernadette again, Howard stories became \\"Howard and Bernadette\\" stories. I'm kind of torn on this, because I think Howard is a better character when he's single, but I do like Bernadette for him. Either way, the writers need to find a way to channel vintage Wolowitz again.<br />- Sheldon Cooper is the anit-Fonz, and I think when all is said and done, he'll go down as one of the better characters in television history. He is a comedy pioneer for nerds, and he is THE redeeming quality when anything isn't working. Jim Parsons is well deserving of the Emmy he won in Season 3, and once again he demonstrates why he was the perfect choice for Sheldon.<br /><br />A slight decline from its predecessors, but still as good a comedy as you'll find on television.<br /><br />Grade: B+ppearance from Sheldon's nemesis, Will Wheaton. ^Side note: (This episode is also the perfect example of why I don't like Amy; the humor associated with her character for most of the season is perfectly on display in this episode)    - Sheldon and Penny's back and forth at the Cheesecake Factory bar in \\"The Apology Insufficiency\\" (ep. 4.07) is incredible.

B004K4AUZW|4.0|I received Gaga's new album Saturday afternoon and played it all weekend. After hearing it a few times and not writing a review in the heat of the moment, I can say it is a great album; of course like any album there are throwaway songs and others that stand out. The point here is that I can recommend this album; especially if you purchase it for $0.99.    After reading so many negative reviews of customers I suspect did not purchase the album, I felt compelled to write my own review. Reviews are not written to attack a person's character, they are meant to help other customers when deciding to purchase something. A lot of the 1-star reviews are either about Amazon's servers crashing and not being able to provide the entire album, or simply people who absolutely despise Lady Gaga. If you hate an artist so much, why write about them on a personal level? Focus on the music.    Born This Way has been hyped for such a long time. The title track was a major hit, but of course, the comparisons with Madonna only got worse. Sadly, there is plenty of pop music that uses chord progression and beats. Listen to Strong Enough by Cher, it sounds like a total disco song rip-off, but it's Cher, why would anyone attack her? Anyways, the reality is that this album is not her deepest, that was The Fame Monster, at least for me. With BTW you get a mix of Euro pop, 80s stadium music, and dare I say, some metal influence.     I won't break it down track-by-track because my personal opinion on each track differs from everyone else. I will say that there are standout tracks such as: Marry the Night, Government Hooker, Americano, Scheibe, Bloody Mary, Heavy Metal Lover, Electric Chapel, (the beautiful) You & I, and finally The Edge of Glory. The three bonus tracks on the first disc serve as fillers to take a break from the sledgehammering electronic/metal/pop beats of the entire album. Surprisingly, the promo tracks and singles are actually not the best songs on the album, with the exception of The Edge of Glory and BTW--I give it the recognition it deserves because of its positive message.    Lyrically, this album borders absurdity, but this is Lady Gaga we're talking about! She has songs about social justice, gay marriage, Mary Magdalene, equality, fashion, and being strong for her fans. What we're forgetting is that she has never claimed to be anything other than a pop artist. Question: What other mainstream pop artist on the chart right now, writes their own music, sings live, and has songs that are not just about sex in the air, getting laid, or stuff like that? No one.     Shall we discuss Gaga's first three singles? BTW: gay anthem and an empowering song that uses the words, \\"gay, straight, or bi, lesbian, transgender\\". I'm surprised mainstream radio even played it. Secondly, Judas, religious overtones about holding on to the bad in your life when the reality is that you should leave those vices behind, in her case, the bad guy. Thirdly, The Edge of Glory, one of the best songs on the album. She said it was about her grandfather's death and being on the edge of glory/death/life. There's a saxophone solo--yes, in a mainstream pop song, and a very good one.     Let's rejoice and be glad that mainstream pop music can possibly change directions because of Lady Gaga's new album. I'm tired of hearing the same auto-tuned, factory churned BS that other pop artists are coming out with. I'll name names: Rihanna, Katy Perry, Kesha, and Britney Spears. Yes, Gaga's The Fame's first single was about having a good time and dancing, but she's matured, while these other artists are still stuck on things like S&M, drinking booze, and always being secondary to some guy--I'm talking to you Rihanna, Kesha, and Katy Perry. Luckily, we have women like Gaga, Pink, even Robyn (underrated gem) to save pop music from the industry.
B004GF244K|5.0|the portion of the concert with 'western music' is great...it is just like you are there.....the music was really great, I have already watched it 5 or 6 times. Glad I bought it. I had forgotten how great Goerge Harrisons music was. Seeing the likes of Jeff Lynne, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Paul, Ringo is a real treat.
0316044695|5.0|I have always had a vast amount of admiration and respect for all of our people serving our country in the Armed Forces of the United States. I have just finished reading \\"Lone Survivor. The Eye Witness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of Seal Team 10\\" by Seal Marcus Luttrell, with the help of Patrick Robinson. This book has put me in absolute awe of those brave people who volunteer to put themselves In Harms Way to protect the freedom and safety of all of us in the free world. The book takes you through the extremely rigorous demands faced throughout a SEALS career starting with the 2 week shake out session, then the several phases of BUD/S, including Hell Week, and the post BUD/S training in specific disciplines.  This entire process takes years and guarantees that those who successfully complete it are the toughest warriors in the world. The next phase of the book deals with Operation Redwing , and the strategic and moral dilemmas this 4 man seal team faced. The account of what happened is extremely horrendous and is written in a way that results in a great deal of controversy among those who have read it, as evidenced by the Blogs included with the Amazon review.   I read from 1-3 books per week and rank this as one of the best I have read.  It is non-fiction and demonstrates the dilemma these brave people often face in carrying out their (voluntary, and extremely dangerous) duty to keep all of us safe and free. I can tell you that these guy's are definitely not left wing liberals but are forced into very harrowing situations by the decisions they are often guided to make under our Rules Of Engagement. The book has 1,340 reviews on Amazon with 997 being 5* and 142 being 4*.  READ IT!

B000FBFN1U|3.0|I have never been more disappointed in the collapse of a promising series. What started in a tight, compelling novel has drawn out into a predictable, clichéd, rambling monstrosity. George R R Martin is certainly a master of prose and setting scenes. Further, he creates very intricate plots and has certainly put a nice spin on the Fantasy genre. But these wonderful aspects are undone by the lack of restraint- plot lines drag on interminably for thousands of pages- and a very formulaic writing style. By the second book, I had pretty much figured out his story telling, and by the third it had become too tedious.     Everyone told me that I needed to read these books because they \\"broke the fantasy mold\\". Perhaps. It is a dark, deeply cynical series that tries to be epic in scale and deep on political intrigue. However, breaking old mechanics and stereotypes really doesn't help much if you replace it with postmodern mechanics and stereotypes that were old 20 years ago.     Cliche #1: \\"Never Plan for the Future\\" - In those 80's cop films, it was a death sentence for a guy to talk about his plans for retirement (Mendozaaaaaa!). The same is true in Song of Ice and Fire. Throughout the series, when a character informs the reader (through dialog or thought) of how he plans to reach an objective, he will NOT reach that objective. His plans will be undone by treachery or the arrival of some army that hadn't been mentioned for a score of chapters. Likewise, when a character starts acting without telling the reader what he plans, or when he is certain that he is doomed, he and his objectives are safe. This happens with so few exceptions that it sucks all the tension out of the books.    Cliche #2:  \\"There are no good politicians\\" - Throughout this series, doing the right thing is rewarded with misery. People call this realism. Poppycock. I'm realist enough to know that sometimes good people fail, but also realist enough to know that people with a reputation for backstabbing will soon find themselves without friends. Yet in this series, the Starks have somehow maintained a great house controlling half of Westeros without being capable of the most base intrigue. How was this possible? In the first book, I was a bit shocked by Ned Starks naive antics, but in this book it became clear that the author believes no good deed should go unpunished. Not only is this unrealistic, but it also removes tension from the book. We know that each and every victory will be bittersweet. Further, bad people get away with no end of betrayal and deceit. But should a good person break a single vow, it will always come back to haunt them.     Cliche #3: \\"Forest Gump Syndrome\\" - Most of the characters are passive participants to this drama. Sansa is the worst, a pawn being shuffled from tower to tower to bedroom to altar to bedroom. On the one hand, she is a great window into what is happening, but at the cost of listening to her drivel on about how horrible her life is as she is passed from one womanizing sot to the next. If there ever comes a time when Sansa starts being an active participant, it will be completely unbelievable- she's gone 4000 pages without an ounce of character growth. But in this last book, even Arya, Tyrion and Cat spent 99% of the book just going with the flow. Arya treks back and forth across central Westeros, being the miserable captive of one strongman after another. What was once a fiercely independent (and intriguing) character is no more than a fly on the wall- getting nowhere. The biggest disappointment was Tyrion. In the last book, we got to ride with him as he actually played the game. Sometimes he was right, sometimes he made mistakes. But we had the sense he was a player. When he wakes from his injuries in this book, we watch chapter after chapter as his world slowly (ever...so...slowly) unravels.    Cliche #4: \\"The Super Genius\\" aka the \\"Oceans Eleven Syndrome\\": In this book above the previous two (where Tyrion was at least effective) we don't share the Point of View of anyone who is making stuff happen. Instead, we have these characters marched unwillingly from setting to setting like little marionettes, settling just long enough for one of the Active Players (Petyr, Tywin, etc) to explain their master plan. And wow are the Players making things happen. Grand conspiracies with intricate movements that require dozens or hundreds of participants, without anything leaking out. (Just one question: why did Petyr need Sansa to wear the amethysts when he could have given them to ANYONE?). I wouldn't be surprised to find that there is some big \\"Knights Templar\\" type organization behind all the scenes. It's the only cliche they haven't broached.     Cliche #5: \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\": Ah moral relativism. So this book we are introduced to the POV of Jamie Lannister. Martin focuses on giving a sympathetic reason for Jamie being a Kingslayer, while glossing over the other dastardly things he's done- you know, the tossing of kids out windows and ambushing Ned Stark in the streets and Incest and yada yada yada. The whole treatment of him seemed Martin's attempt to convince the reader that there are no \\"evil\\" people, just shades of grey. Sorry, Martin, the ship sailed. Jaimie is a child-killing, sister-loving, jerk. And while the Starks seem to be stuck in their \\"Too nice to be helpful\\" silliness, we are supposed to think that Jamie can change his ways? I almost get the feeling that Martin grew bored with the one dimensional goodie-two-shoe Starks and decided to start anew with the Lannisters.    These are the major cliches, but I could also bring up many smaller ones like the \\"Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya!\\" fight scene between the Prince of Dorne and the Mountain. Nevertheless, the 5 cliches above are important. Any one or even a couple of them would be tolerable. But when you add them all together, the reader is left with the impression that this is a great big repudiation of free will. Chapterafter chapter, page after page, we look through the eyes of people who are as ineffectual as a fly on the wall. But why then do we care about them? The answer is that we really don't. We want to care because we want them to be an active participant in an intriguing and epic story that is unfolding around them. In the first two books there was promise that these characters would actually start doing so- being players in the game. But after this book, I can't help but to predict that these bumps on the log will continue their lackadaisical walk through history until the very last minute- after 10s of thousands of pages- when they will do something completely out of character and participate in the story.

B0050VI5SI|5.0|Foster the People burst on to the alternative music scene when their first single, Pumped Up Kicks, began receiving heavy airplay in the latter months of 2010.  The band's eerie take on the distorted reality of a latchkey kid and his subsequent attempt to command attention by wielding a weapon and delivering the ominous warning, \\"better run, better run faster than my bullet,\\" piqued the interest of listeners and earned Foster the People instant notoriety.  Their EP album was simply a tease, and it left their newfound devotees clamouring for more.  The release of their first full length album, Torches, is the antidote to the feverish pleadings of their trip hop-craved following.<br /><br />The group's global sound alludes to something like a fusion of MGMT and Passion Pit's signature electronica stylings, with a hint of Two Door Cinema Club thrown in the mix.  The heavy hooks and infectious rhythms are practically begging to be absorbed with the car windows rolled down and the volume jacked up, whilst head bobbing and steering wheel tapping ensue.  A combination of reverb-heavy synths and sleek instrumentation, in addition to the laconic delivery of alluring, intentionally repetitive lyrics, create dance-worthy tracks that are both accessible and instantly endearing.<br /><br />Despite the fact that it is a debut album, Torches is certain to leave Foster the People deeply entrenched in the alternative landscape.  Not all of the songs contain the magical elements that garnered the attention of  \\"Pumped up Kicks,\\" but they do coalesce to form a uniquely satisfying auditory experience.  Furthermore, although there is a notable lack of diversity amongst tracks, they have established a formula that doesn't eagerly invite tampering.  This is certainly a group worth following, as their raw potential is largely uncharted in an industry that seems preoccupied with providing easily digestible, ubiquitous pop to the masses.
0307887960|4.0|First, the book.  The book is well written but a bit repetitive and a tad long winded.  I like the style, easy to read yet not being talked down to.  Sometimes I find it hard to find some specific information in this book using the index, but it's all there.     Next, the diet. The diet is working well.  After 7 days, 5 pounds.  I only spent two days on the attack phase since I only have 11 pounds to lose. Search for blogs on Dukan Diet for ideas on what to eat so you do not get bored.  Also take a look at the Amazon.co.uk website to read what British dieters have eaten and their great results.  Lots of good positive reviews there.  Husband started right onto the Protein and Veg stages (with no attack) and still lost just as much weight as I have.   The key is cutting out the carbs.     Some advice.   Ahead of time you will need some items.  You will need Plax (you get a lot of hard tartar fast with this diet, I think it is what you are NOT eating that contributes to this.  Plax mouthwash really does eliminate this if you use it before brushing.).   You may also need some fiber supplements.      You will also need snacks, have them ready: yogurt, sugar free jello, hard boiled eggs, lunch meat, and beef jerky.       You may feel incredibly weird and sluggish the first two days but it goes away.  I have more energy now than I did before.  I have eaten more vegetables in one week than I would normally in a month, so that's great.  I feel like my diet is more \\"whole foods\\" as it always should have been.   I actually looked around the grocery store for an hour looking for snacks that would work, and there sure weren't many that met the high protein/ low fat / low sugar rules.   I truly feel like I am always eating but the weight still comes off.    Good luck.  Give it a try if you need to try something different, you don't want to be hungry, and if the Lean Cuisine, Special K routine is wearing you down and leaving you hungry.    UPDATE after 1 MONTH:  I have lost the 11lbs I wanted to lose and I have been on this diet for 30 days.   I did add in some elements of the last phase (2 slices whole grain bread, and cheese, and berries) and continue to lose weight at about the same pace.   I did not go exactly \\"lean meat\\" for the last two weeks as I was getting a bit bored.  I chose low fat meats such as chicken sausages, etc but these were not fat free.   Also continued eating 1-2 fruit yogurts a day.   Once I read the \\"Atkins for Life\\" book I realized that, because I was not eating huge quantities of food, I could still add food in and lose weight, which was true.  This is the lowest weight I have been in 10 years so am thrilled with results.   I still credit the Dukan Diet with getting me started and making it easy to start.   Starting is the hardest part of this diet.     UPDATE after 6 weeks:   I am still losing weight, but not really trying.   Added in (slowly readjusting carbs to see what I can handle) a bowl of high fiber cereal each morning instead of the eggs and turkey bacon I was having.  Still losing weight.    Eating nuts, berries also.   I don't think you have to keep being as restrictive as Dukan suggests if you are on this long term.   I am 3 lbs below my goal weight and have not felt better in a long time.    Thanks Dr. Dukan for getting me started!
B0047O2HJC|5.0|To my ear this sounds great. Unlike the Beatles in Mono, which is often fascinating, due to the often dramatic differences in material between the mono and stereo mixes, Dylan in Mono isn't revelatory. You don't hear things you've never heard before. Nonetheless it sounds \\"correct.\\" As others have mentioned there's a punchiness to these recordings that was diffused in stereo - in some cases, particularly on the earliest records, this amounted to a substantial loss in power. This is also true of some of The Beatles albums, but, with an album like \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" there is a case to be made for the panoramic qualities of the stereo mix, even if it came about haphazardly, without the input of the Beatles themselves. I don't feel that way about \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" or \\"Highway 61,\\" both of which sound a little TOO thin and mercurial (so to speak) to my ear in stereo, even in their remastered editions. The mono puts the harmonica back in its rightful place in the mix and, more centrally, gives these albums a much more stable bottom register. The drums and the bass have much more authority here. I feel like I enjoy listening to these albums again...to say the least.    I'd also like to comment about the packaging. My box was also shipped in a stupid padded envelope. Thankfully nothing was harmed - but that thanks probably goes to the post office. The same day I received another package from amazon, this time nicely boxed with inflatable plastic to cushion the enclosed item -  a 15 dollar printer cartridge that came in its own box. Like I say, my item arrived in perfect shape, and I also didn't have the trouble that some here have reported with the bonus Brandeis disc. It was adhered with glue dots but CD and dots came off without leaving any residue. Still, I've got to ask - Why has Amazon singled the Dylan box out for such indifferent packaging?
B0015GDR44|5.0|I really thought I would have a difficult time getting into this.  The majority of all the episodes consist of just two people sitting in a room talking.  In fact, I almost turned this first episode off.  I am so glad I didn't.  After about 15 minutes I really got into it.  Its hard to sit and analyze why its so good.  The interactions are candid, fascinating, aggressive and confrontational.  Its like eavesdropping on a therapist with their most interesting patients.  The fact that this show has little action and is still so absorbing is a testament to how good the writing really is.  The therapist going to another therapist adds a whole new level of interest as he reveals what he really thinks about his patients as well as his own issues. The patient stories are told individually and have really interesting parallels.  I watched one episode and now I'm obsessed.  Five stars all the way. I definitely recommend it.
B002BFIN6K|1.0|The positive reviews here mainly rave about the recorded sound quality, but is that really what the focus should be on a CD that claims to \\"completely eliminate the technological limitations of the past by using computer software to capture Rachmaninoff's attacks, keyspeeds, pitches, durations, and interpretive nuances from a 78rpm record...\\"  I wrote an extensive review of this CD for the Association of Recorded Sound Collections Journal where I compared Rachmaninoff's original 78rpm records against the Zenph re-performances.  The Zenph performances did not hold up well to such scrutiny.  Here are a few quotes from that lengthy review.      \\"Where Zenph truly fails is in reproducing the artistry and musical effects found in Rachmaninoff's playing.  Simply put, Zenph often reproduces the notes but not the musical relationship between the notes.  Consider two slurred notes played in a particularly expressive manner by Rachmaninoff.  In Zenph the second note will be quieter but lack a poetic connection.\\"    \\"throughout Rachmaninoff's playing one hears beautifully balanced chords.  The top note might sing out more in one chord whereas an inner dissonance might be emphasized for a different color in another chord.  These are the sort of details missed by the Zenph technology.  Zenph's chords for the most part simply sound like ordinary chords - they lack the special touch, color, balance, and sound Rachmaninoff brings.\\"    \\"Zenph fails to recreate is the energetic, incisive quality found in many of the original 78s.  What happened to the light, springy character of the Mendelssohn Scherzo?  Why does the Bach Gigue sound so much more crisp and energetic on the original 78rpm?  Where's the electricity in the opening of Liebesfreud?\\"    \\"There are abrupt pedal clearings throughout the Zenph re-performance that destroy the mysterious mood found in Rachmaninoff's 78 [of the C-sharp minor Prelude].\\"    \\"The C sharp minor Prelude is by no means the poorest re-performance present on this CD.  The Prelude from the Bach Violin Partita in Rachmaninoff's arrangement for piano is considerably worse.\\"    \\"A crucial feature of Rachmaninoff's playing was his ability to create waves of sound.  In his recording of the Moment Musical in E-flat minor, the ascending and descending passages that begin at measure nine (0:09) have tremendous sweep.  When Zenph re-performs these measures that sweep is missing...\\"    \\"[In Liebesfreud, Rachmaninoff's] rapidity, clarity, and brilliance leave one in awe.  Zenph never matches Rachmaninoff's brilliance here, and the final descending double note passage (1:55) is a train wreck.\\"    \\"Zenph's claims that they recapture everything found in Rachmaninoff's performances and overcome the technological limitations of the past are both preposterous and misleading...\\"    \\"for anyone that takes Rachmaninoff's art seriously this CD is a travesty.\\"    For anyone interested, the full review can easily be found by searching google for Zenph Rachmaninoff Farhan Malik review.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I read this series before the books reached the NY Times bestsellers list. The main character is so unusual, she caught my attention right away. The plots are complex  and the characters well developed.<br /><br />My first read of the series was after surgery, while I was on painkillers. I've re-read them since, and I liked them even more. Larsson is no longer alive and the books were translated to English. Wonder if there are more works of his still be be translated? What a great storyteller!<br /><br />I would highly recommend the entire series.

B004VDSWQ6|5.0|Heaven & Hell Live at Radio City Music Hall is the definitive Heaven & Hell experience. The video quality is top-notch, the sound quality is incredible, and most importantly: we have an amazing setlist being performed by top-tier musicians at the top of their game.     I know what many of you are asking. \\"Is this much of an improvement over the DVD?\\" I can answer that with a very confident and resounding YES. I bought the DVD years ago after seeing them live at Metal Masters in 2008. The video quality is much better with no compression artifacts and very little color bleeding. Another problem that was noticeable to me on the DVD was really weird ghosting/motion blur of some kind. This is also gone in the Blu-ray release. Seeing this concert in high definition is a treat since you can catch so many small details, like scratches on Tony Iommi's guitar or the sequins on Dio's groovy shirts. Everything here looks fantastic.     The sound quality seems great to my ears. I don't have a speaker system to test out how crazy it can get, but it comes with HD audio, Dolby 5.1, and stereo. From what my TV speakers put out, everything sounds crisp and clear. The songs have varying mixes, such as Geezer Butler's bass lines dominating some tracks, while Tony Iommi's pounding riffs dominate others. I imagine that what we hear on this disc is what the band/sound engineers would want us to hear. It's perfect. See \\"Die Young\\" or \\"Falling Off the Edge of the World\\" for examples of the great mixing at work.    That brings us to the setlist, which is spectacular. You get material from the first three Sabbath Mk. II albums, Heaven & Hell, The Mob Rules, and Dehumanizer, along with some new tracks from the Dio Years compilation. This is a pretty long setlist and it doesn't disappoint. You get the expected hits like \\"Neon Nights\\" and \\"The Mob Rules\\" but for every one of those tracks you get a rarely played classic like \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\" or \\"Lonely is the Word.\\"     The band is intop form being filmed in the upward swing of their resurgence as gods of metal. Dio shows us that his voice, while sounding a bit aged, hasn't lost any of its power. Vinny Appice pounds the skins like he's going to be killed by a sniper if he doesn't hit them hard enough. He represents everything a professional drummer should be: a powerful, precise, timekeeper with a complete lack of vanity. His rhythm counterpart, Geezer Butler rocks the bass better than most whippersnappers half his age. He knows when to accentuate the riffs by following the guitar lines, and when to keep up the rhythm with his wild soloing. Tony Iommi, is of course, Tony Iommi. He plays heavy riffs of impending doom with ease. He has an amazing tone, and shreds with the very best of them without ever devolving into atonal noise.     If you love Black Sabbath, buy this. If you love Dio, buy this. If you love both, why are you even still reading? Click the button up there! If you don't have the DVD already, this is a no brainer. If you do, I still recommend this if you're on the fence. Give the DVD to your nephew or something! I think it's very much worth the improvement. You're getting an amazing concert with great video and sound. I cannot recommend this enough.

B003L77GGK|3.0|When I heard the news that creator Eric Kripke was stepping down and handing the reins over to Sera Gamble, I admit I was worried but I was willing to give the show a chance. After all, how bad could it be compared to S5?    Sadly, it was MUCH worse!    I have no idea what went on in the writers' room but I have a feeling that what was written on paper came off better than what was shown on screen. Not only that but this season had more new writers who clearly had never written for the show before.    The result was a combination of new characters and story lines that while interesting never seemed to go anywhere. Not only that but some of the actions of the characters just seemed blown way out of proportion for the sake of dramatic tension and not much else.    Not only that but one of the main characters undergoes such a drastic transformation in the finale that it just seems so OOC. I could understand this development better if it was done in a gradual manner that was built up all season but this didn't happen so the resulting actions just seem rather forced.    Now I know some fans of Supernatural will disagree with me but that's fine with me. I feel like I gave this show a chance to impress me more than once so I can't be too disappointed when it doesn't. It just means that's time for me to move on to something better.
1594481717|5.0|Dan Pink has influenced me through a series of books beginning with Free Agent Nation which helped me start one of my businesses, Listen to Life. This book introduced me to the Conceptual Age in which we find ourselves now, having transitioned from the Information Age. The story-driven nature of my new book: Work Positive in a Negative World is because of Pink's findings. I even encouraged my older daughter to major in Creative Writing due to Pink's discoveries.
0811874192|5.0|I bought this book for my mom who loves flowers, but can't always have them around because of allergies.  This book will make any gray day a little brighter.  These intricate designs are just beautiful.
B0007ODLCS|5.0|Some people are just meant to be songwriters. TVZ is one of those people. He knows how to put words to music or vice versa. Very talented and very good. Bob Dylan came to texas just to hear him play. Enough said! Amen!
0345529057|2.0|If getting paid by the word is the case, this author should now be able to retire comfortably. Regardless of some reviews, this is no Lord of the Rings!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I been using this app for a month so far, this is a well made, reliable app.  It has a widget that is identical to the standard clock.  I'm glad there is a option to have the alarm still beep if your phone volume is low or on silent.  This is much appreciated considering I keep my phone on silent often.
B0051QO4QY|4.0|When Born this Way (single) came out, I felt a bit disappointed. I was expecting a bit of darker more creative and poetic music from Lady Gaga. Yet, the song grew on me. Judas impressed me very much by its lyrics and similarity, in my point, to Bad Romance. The Edge of Glory, however, I found to be the song she should have released as the first single from the album. When I first listened to the whole album, I was a bit disappointed, as it is very 80s pop and anthems rather than what I expected, which was kind of a \\"Marylin Manson-ish\\" sound, kind of techno and very rock. I gave the album another chance at redemption, by forgetting all my preconcieved notions and just listening to the songs. Yes, a few songs I don't like much, such as Fashion of his Love, Bad Kids, Black Jesus, and Electric Chapel, which I find are too \\"bubble-gum-pop\\" lyrics for me.     Now that all the \\"negativity\\" is out, I will say that Bloody Mary and Americano are probably my absolute favorite songs on the album. Bloody Mary is very dark and edgy which I like and the lyrics are very creative. I love Americano for its artistic merit and its Spanish twists, as it reminds me of The Fame Monster's Alejandro. Another good song is Heavy Metal Lover.  In conclusion, I find that the album is not bad at all, but it isn't great. It'll probably grow on me later.
0767818040|2.0|A look at the DVD cover conveys a message to the red blooded male that when seeing this movie you will be seeing some skin. If that's all you're looking for then you'll give it a higher rating than I have. I found disappointment as the story had potential but hindered itself by taking avenues from reality to far fetched situations without needing to. There is some suspense, and enough skin to keep it away from the kids, but overall it missed it's potential.
B004NCLKJG|5.0|For me this is another dream Walkure along with 1940s Flagstad and company.  I thought I would never hear another recording with Vickers, Nilsson and Rysanek all together in one performance.  These singers made a career singing these roles far different from the one night stand performances we see today.  I could quibble about conducting style or sound balances but there's no point.  Just a note: I have never been a big fan of the Solti set anyway. Too much artificial sound for my taste....I'll take Furtwangler.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I heard the song \\"colder weather\\" on the radio and decided to purchase the CD.  The entire CD is full of great music and I haven't been able to get enough of it yet.  My friends and family listened to it and now they are hooked as well.
1933784032|5.0|Love the detailed images of these vintage and newer models - from the original saga to the new - this book is packed with details about model building for the movies. What look huge and heavy on screen is small and plastic and very breakable for real - traditional movies making magic at its best !
1567184855|5.0|I really enjoyed Journey of Souls for so many reasons. I don't usually read books on any type of past life regression as I feel it's not wise in most cases to give control of your subconscious and other levels of mind to someone else. But Michael Newton appears to be very evolved by how he handles his regression therapy and how well thought out and organized he is. Many people who meditate see the divine light of our creator and also have some similar experiences as written here of knowing or sensing our guardian angel and angelic teachers. Most do not question reincarnation either, so this would be a 5-star for those in the meditator catagory and also for any seeker. In a non direct way Newton's book expresses why we should never judge others and why we should always live our lives in awareness of the Golden Rule.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This is another great product of the talented Enya with the beautiful voice and lovely music. All songs were fresh and new, and as with all Enya songs, I find them to be so relaxing.  I highly recommend this cd to all Enya fans and for all who have never heard of Enya before!
B004SKJIEC|3.0|I buyed the Latest Japan not hybrid SHM SACD version (that is curiosly printed in just a single disc) and the sound is really better of any other previous releases in my opinion.  This AF gold double CD is good but the difference is not so impressive if we compare it with the standard latest Universal remaster. I think there is a problem in the master that the labels uses to prepare the new remastering, probably not the real original master. The only way to produce a great sound improvent is to work on the original multitrack master like EMI did for the Beatles catalogue reissue. It would be interesting discover the real origin of the master used by the AF engineer to produce this version of the Wonder's masterpiece.  Stevie Wonder's \\"Songs In The Key Of Life\\" is a seminar album and the new remasters are a good opportunity to rediscover the genius of this unique talent.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|1.  I just bought the BORN THIS WAY/GAGA digital album download from Amazon & had no problems whatsoever.  Surprisingly, it was quick & since Ive never bought an mp3 dig download from Amazon before, it was a lot easier then expected.<br /><br />2.  I did not buy the .99 digital album, but the $6.99 album to get the booklet & to thank Gaga/Record Industry for finally giving us a reasonably priced album.  Thanks to all, fans do appreciate it.  And Ill continue to buy from Amazon if they have reasonably priced dig downloads for full albums.<br /><br />3.  My review of the album:  As a long time fan of Lady Gaga, I have to say this is her weakest album yet.  All the songs are mediocre at best & nothing stands out as a favorite.  Also I couldnt help but notice all the songs (except 1) were written by others, NOT Gaga herself.  This, perhaps, is the problem.  Gaga needs to pen the songs herself to give us the personal edge weve come to expect from her.  Lyrically the songs are repetitive, generic & forgettable.  Musically, they seem to be pseudo-dance as the dance beats seem to be an after thought.  All in all, Im so very sad to say, this album is her worst yet.<br /><br />4.  Note to Gaga:  Stop all this performance art bs & get back to song writing.  Thats where your strengths are & thats why we love your music.
0240815807|5.0|I purchased this manual as the result of reading other reviews - and am pleased with the purchase.  It's a good 'mix' of professional opinion, concept descriptions sprinkled with specific comments on a number of available DAWs and their components.  There are adequate explanations for editing, filtering, and balancing - though I've not read it cover to cover.  Of the three audio mixing books I've purchased, though it's not as detailed technically as the others - I would buy it again for the perspectives.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Make no mistake despite it flaws five stars is no accident. This is one of Walt's greatest accomplishments in animation when disregarding his other endeavors in society. However the initial intention that this film was for seems to take a detour. This was supposed to be a way to commercially exploit Mickey propelling him to a level of success that Popeye was at. Though again it becomes built on so many artistic elements reminiscent of European Art and extra vignettes that were an expansion on The Sorcerer's Apprentice that it detours itself away from its original intention. These are exceptional pieces of work there really isn't any weak vignettes like Fantasia 2000 has. Color is always effectively used,the compositions are always in-synch and work well well with the changing mood. Scale and perspective are top notch and the characters are animated effortlessly. The vignettes are to short however to flesh out or develop many of the characters.    However also take into consideration that being in pantomime is a commercial risk people need memorable voices and lines to enjoy the characters and for them to be commercially successful. Fantasia features none of this. Again the reason why it is well known is due to the company overly promoting it over the years because Walt had always wanted this film to materialize into something. Ironically it was the 1969 release that made profit because stoner's were essentially tripping upon viewing the film. It did not earn its place in animation history as immediate as Snow White or other projects did. Again it gets away from its original focus of propelling Mickey to a level of success that Popeye was at than build's itself into an elaborate production. Totally in Disney's nature but was the genesis for Dumbo as an economically safe feature that gauranteed profit.
B000WM0P2E|1.0|This review is of the audio quality of the MP3 version (256Kbit/S) of the album.    The tracks on this album seem to have been encoded poorly.    There is distortion in the high frequencies, especially on cymbal, high-hat, and in the vocals.    Until the encoding issues are corrected, I would recommend the CD version   [[ASIN:B00029LNHS Elephunk]] which doesn't have any audio quality issues.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this bag to travel to Europe with (on a plane) and I couldn't be happier.  This bag is an exact replica of my friends Canon backpack, but less than half the cost.  It did have one minor issue though.  The tripod straps were never included in the package.  I called Amazon support and they gave me a partial refund for me to go out and get my own straps (they did offer to replace the bag though, I chose otherwise) and a lot better than having to ship back and forth between Amazon and I.      The bag definitely has enough space for me right now though.  I have a d90 with lens attached, plus 2 other lenses in the bag, along with my flash, flash accessories, etc.  The zippered parts can hold miscellaneous small things in it (caps, batteries, etc).  There is also a second zippered compartment between the main area and front pocket that can hold my 13\\" macbook in it, albeit a little tight, so I wouldn't expect anything larger than a 13\\" laptop to fit.    The ONLY thing I would want to see in this bag is a waterproof cover that slips out of it like some of the upper priced bags or have the bag made with waterproof materials.  The only part that is waterproof is the zippered compartments inside the main camera zippered part, which is a little weird imo.  With that in mind, that is why I gave the design layout a 4/5 rating.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|I was really hoping that I would like this movie but as most movies these days,it was a let down.For an action movie it was kinda boring.It was predicatable.The character background of these 2 guys were bad and I felt unncessary.Especially Denzel's story about his 2 daughters.Denzel looked bored with his character.The camera work was bad.Some parts were unrealistic and they copied the scene from Runaway Train when Chris Pine's character hurt his foot.If you want to see a good train movie,I suggest Runaway Train with Eric Roberts.At least that one will hold your attention.I would give this movie 2 1/2 stars but since I can't I'll round it off to 3 stars for the special effects.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|this is a great album on multiple levels, from the catchy hooks and dance-inspiring beats to the lyrics and overall theme of self-worth and self-acceptance. its hard to listen to her album without getting up and dancing around my office! i highly recommend it to anyone who likes pop music, techno, or 80's inspired tunes.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|A tale about never giving up and the relationships you make along the way.  Diane Lane gives a good performance. The Secretariat was a racing horse that won the coveted Triple Crown and was not matched for 25 years.  This is definitely a feel good story as the main character deals with financial troubles and has to go on faith.  DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; THEMES: B minus to B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B.  WHEN WATCHED: yesterday.
0671449028|5.0|This is a great book - I started reading it to my daughter when she was about 10 months old....I have read it every night since and she is now about to turn 4 years old. It is a lovely story with a great rythym and cute pictures. It is also the perfect length for a child (and parent) of this age. Not too long that it takes all night but not too short to where it feels like I am jipping her out of a story. I love it and highly recommend it.
B00005JOFQ|2.0|Anthor one of those highly overrated movies.There is not much to say that already hasn't been covered.Heath Ledger's mumblings are annyoing and the story was boring.There was no chemistry between these two.I didn't feel any love between them just 2 horny guys going at it.I didn't like the fact that Michelle Williams character stayed with Heath Ledger when it was obvious he was into men.She couldn't have a normal realationship with him.If this movie wasn't about 2 gay cowboys it would have never received so much hype.Just because it was something that has never been done before does not make it good!I wish people were more honest when it comes to this movie.I guess if people gave it negative reviews they would be afraid that more movies like this won't be made.There is a right way a nd a wrong way to do it,and this isn't the way.I will give one extra star for the scenery though.
B000GFLEBI|5.0|I like this movie, i can't see because o don't know about HD DVD LOL. But ii have in good conditions and good movie, i like too much when tooth are close to the journeyman.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was absorbing from the start, and I couldn't put it down.  The author did an amazing job of narrating from a child's point of view.  The main characters are dynamic and fascinating.  I loved the Alice and Wonderland comparisons throughout.  I avoided buying this book for awhile because I thought it would be so sad.  Even though it was, it also occupied my mind with philosophical ramblings on reality and was definitely worth the read.  I highly recommend this book.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|I was worried about this album after not being in love with the lead single. Fear not. BTW, the album, is filled with instant classics for the dance floor. I will never doubt this woman again. Terrific terrific album.     Also.....really love the remixes. Definitely worth buying the deluxe version to get them.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Yes, It's been a long time since the last great Stevie Nicks record Trouble In Shangri-La. And there was a lot of hype going around about \\"In Your Dreams\\",  so I was a little skeptical. But when I heard the results, this music far surpassed any of the hype and then some. The last time Stevie sounded this vital and passionate was during the early 80's. This album is an instant classic. In Your Dreams covers a lot of musical ground that Stevie inhabits effortlessly: rock, pop, folk and bluesy country all while sounding perfectly placed and solidly cohesive. \\"Soldiers Angel\\" may be the grittiest song Stevie has ever written & recorded solo or with FM, and with Lindsey's guitar and harmony it sounds like a hybrid of The Chain meets a Native American chant. Other highlights are the title track, the poignant \\"For What It's Worth\\" and the irresistible torchy & bluesy \\"You May Be The One\\". Stevie also covers some new territory on this record with the over the top grand romantic 60's inspired ballad \\"Italian Summer\\".  While \\"Moonlight\\" and the Poe adapted \\"Annabel Lee\\" are just classic Nicks at her bewitching best. This album has impressed me so much that I'm calling it the best new release so far of 2011, yes even better than Adele, who by comparison, is all but an ingenue. If you want to hear the real deal from someone who has lived the lyrics & music she embodies, buy \\"In Your Dreams\\" immediately. You will not be disappointed!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Season 3 of this series has long been viewed as the weakest, but looking back, it has some of the best episodes of the show's six-year run (so far). Fans may miss the intensity of the Yellowed Eyed Demon that taunted the Winchesters in Seasons 1 and 2, but the writers more than make up for it with new ideas, humor and reflections on the show's past. \\"Mystery Spot\\" and \\"A Very Supernatural Christmas\\" rank among the best things ever for Supernatural fans, so check this one out knowing that the writer's strike muted what may have been a great season.
B004SIP7US|5.0|It's a no brainer to deny that this is the most unique gangster film, or at least one of them! It is engrossing, beautifully created, and a fantastic epic at best. The story is set in Civil War-Era New York as the war begins to drag on and President Lincoln's popularity is heading to a downward spiral; mostly in part of the Conscription Act that is forcing thousands of poor Irish immigrants to join the Union Army and fight in a bloody stalemate against the Confederacy. Many of the American inhabitants among them being Daniel Day-Lewis's character feels that America is being invaded by the Irish immigrants, and brews up a strong hatred against any race that isn't American. And in the end the racial hatred and hatred against the Conscription Acts explodes into a bloody and fiery bloodbath, where many of the characters died.      Yes this is my favorite Martin Scorsese's film mostly because no one else has ever made a film this historically unique! The sets are among the best sets ever to be brought to the screen! It is meticulously well brought to life and really makes you feel your in Civil-War Era New York. The only complaint I have is the film in the middle does drag on, but it really pays off in the end. If you want to believe that Martin Scorsese is a living legend, start off by watching this film, or better watch Taxi Driver! Then watch Goodfellas (My favorite gangster film of all time)
B000KJU1MS|5.0|I think one of the reasons Gene and Paul put this out ( other than the $$$ ) is because they were taking a lot of flack about ALIVE 1 and 2 being doctored. Well kids, proof is in the pudding right here. Klassic KISS WERE TIGHT ! And ACE ! Watch the Winterland SF concert. ACE was better than Page and Clapton put together ! I have played guitar for 25 years so i can comment on this...ACE WAS GOD ! I and many others could play circles around ACE technically but rock is not about playing technical. Its about soul, phrasing, style and vibe. ACE had it...in SPADES ( no pun intended )Check out his vibrato he can do slow, moderate, or that high speed boingy vibrato only ACE can do...all with control. Check out the solo in got to choose.<br /><br />The whole band was very good musically and TIGHT ! KISS was the band that made every song a rocker. Not like Zepp or Hendrix where you got only a few rockers and then ballads and 10 minute jams. KISS made their albums full of Communication breakdowns, Whole lotta loves, Purple Hazes and War pigs. They refined hard rock.<br /><br />The only drawback to this DVD is that for the cobo hall performances they chose the first night. They kinda sucked on that one. The jam on \\" let me go rock and roll\\"  was a train wreck. I wish they would have chose the same night that they have released on other home videos. The one where they play strutter on KISS EXPOSED The band was tight ! Other than that this video is of KISS at there very best.<br /><br />This band was NOT just makeup and effects. They were a kick ass tight heavy rock band that took no prisoners. Also, Peter was a monster drummer. He hit that snare like he meant it yet he was a schooled jazz player ( he took lessons from Gene Krupa, look it up )...and you can hear it ! Total musical chemistry with this band ! LONG LIVE KLASSIC KISS !
1594202559|4.0|This book is a fascinating, detailed history of hedge funds. It uses stories of various funds to demonstrate how they operate and make money. The stories are fascinating and informative at the same time. You can learn an immense amount about how hedge funds work within the financial system and with the financial system by reading this book.    The book is very current (as of May 2011) mentioning even Raj Rajaratnam in an example of insider trading. Mr Rajartnam was just convicted in the past few days.    The last chapter (conclusion), however, falls off of the cliff entirely. It is completely out of line of the rest of the book, as he is making a case for some (but not much) regulation of hedge funds. Any intelligent reader of the previous 16 chapters would find this unnecessary. (That is why this gets a 4 star, really)
B00006LLNU|1.0|Reading good reviews of this band led me to seek out some of their music. I've concluded this is one of those bands who owe their success to the tragically hip music fan who gravitates towards artists whose music is so pretentious and unfathomable that most people reject it, hence, their popularity.  These are the people who think Pink Floyd sold out after Syd Barrett left. It reminds me of when I was forced to sit through a set of White Stripes at a festival show. Looking around at their supposed fans, most of what I saw was boredom. But I also got a sense that no one was willing to be the first to say \\"Jeez, these people really suck.\\" A modern version of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes.\\"  The only suggestion I would make to Sigur Ros is, when recording vocals, it would be better to place the microphone in the same room as the singer.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|To start it off, this album is simply amazing!     About 4 years ago I discovered a band called \\"Under the Influence of Giants\\" who is such a great band...I was sad to hear they made one great album and split up...Now to back to the present, I rectently discovered Awolnation through Amazon (like all of my music) and very quickly became attached to the album. I thought there was something very familiar about the sound of the vocals/sound...I looked it up, and sure enough Its Aaron Bruno from Under the Influence of Giants. I was very impressed when I found out its his solo project!     I cant stress enough how inspiring all of the tracks are on this album (besides track 2 which doesnt make any sense). Aaron Bruno is very talented! Such original sound, with upbeat sound and very broad vocals. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Under the Influence of Giants, or anyone who is looking to add another superb album to their collection.
B004NSULHM|2.0|let's see.  radiohead hires an intern to make sampled electronic music on a computer based on 3 melody loops.  thom adds vocals.  put out the album with a pretentious title & cover.  call it high art.  it sucks only cos the record buyer just doesn't get it.  trust me, it'll grow on u eventually!
0670022411|2.0|Being an avid reader, one of my favorite aspects of reading is the emotional journey that an author takes the reader on.  I also love when an author can paint such a vivid picture of, or create an emotional connection to the characters so that they take over your dreams because you \\"know\\" them and need to know what happens next to make sure they are safe.  This book, unfortunately, left me wanting nothing more than the week back that it took me to read it.    The plot was so predictable.  For example, every time there was a 2-page moment of love and happiness it would immediately be followed by terror and violence.  The plot just did not flow or build up to any amount of intrigue.    And I got a little tired of what I perceived as the author's condescending \\"I know so much about history and DNA, blah, blah, blah\\" throughout the entire book. We get it...you're a historian.    The characters were bland.  It was nearly impossible to like anyone other than Aunt Em.  (Wow...there's creativity for you.  Hey, Dorothy called and she wants her aunt back!) As a matter of fact, having just finished it, I just found out that this is the first book in a trilogy...and I have no desire to find out what happens next.  None!
B004GHNHVW|4.0|At first, I loved 1-2 songs that I've heard on Amazon's website.  I thought that Paul Simon can't make bad music.  I was considering to buy or not for 2-3 weeks but finely decided to buy.  When the disc came, I listened the whole disc and didn't amazed !  After hearing 4-5 times, now, I can't leave it .  I can't stop love the music   Well done Paul !
B003JTHXN6|5.0|Got the book at midnight and could not put it down. Easy read and easy style of writing (just took half a night about 3-4 hours)<br /><br />Compelling stories and life lessons.<br /><br />It starts off of his childhood days trying to start a mail order business. His pizza shop at harvard.  Then his selling of companies.<br /><br />I like how he valued experiences as well as making money.<br /><br />I like how he focused on trying to improve every way he can.<br /><br />I also liked how near the end of the book, he asks the reader to interact by asking what are your goals and why.  That made me think about my goals in life and what makes me happy.<br /><br />I'm not as courageous as him but he does inspire me to be so.<br /><br />He talks about his life lessons from playing poker, going to raves, first job right after college at oracle, his selling of his first company and his passion for the customer experience with zappos.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Yeah, I had to wait 24hrs for Amazon to work things out due to their complete lack of preparedness for the volume of purchases this deal created, but it was worth the wait.  Great tracks...if you like Gaga you'll enjoy the album.  If you don't like her, well why did you buy the album?  If you want to be convinced she's talented, you need to watch/listen to her perform live--this is where she stands apart from her contemporaries.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game. I am not a big time gamer but I love this one. It keeps me busy while waiting or while in traffic...I get bored easily and this game keeps my attention the WHOLE time I'm playing it.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I like a couple of songs but this album had wayyyy to much hype for what it ended up being... it was worth the 99 cents I paid for it though... just a little disappointed. I think she can do better.. shes extremely talented
0385341008|5.0|I loved this quirky witty book.  The characters were charming and beautifully drawn.  The author is a master story teller.  Too bad we won't be hearing from  her again.  I thought I would be annoyed by the style of telling a story in correspondence. but I was not.  It is a style that is particularly well suited to the telling of this tale.  The people of the island of Guernsey in the English channel were occupied by the Germans during WWII.  They used a book club and the love of literature as a means of tolerating the oppressive situation and the hardships that they endured.  Somehow hunger and food deprivation seemed less terrible when they were discussing literature.  This was not a club of longtime readers and intellectuals.  It included the farmers and manual laborers that made up the population of this mosty rural community.
B003SOMYNQ|4.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee, is a truly amazing book. Informative and descriptive,  Harper vividly makes the characters from Maycomb, Alabama, come alive. Scout, Jem, Atticus, and Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley are memorable. Harper's powerful and entertaining story of racism during the Great Depression has the right amount of suspense, drama, humor, and Southerness to it. At first I didn't understant the title, but now I understand why it is called \\"To Kill A Mockingbird.\\" Tom Robinson symbolizes the mockingbird and Bob Ewell is the racist who kills a man so pure, so innocent, that Jem weeps at the verdict. Bob Ewell and Mayella's false accusation of Tom Robinson results in a chain reaction ending with Tom Robinson's death.  But the jury is also responsible for his death.  \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" shows coming-of-age, innocence, and above all things love.
B004LFO0O2|5.0|Haters gonna hate. Rated 5 stars because so many people rated it 1 star and said the album was \\"ok\\". Jog off. If you don't like Machu Picchu or Under Cover of Darkness, you never liked The Strokes in the first place.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I have been a \\"Little Monster\\" before she even had any albums out, so naturally I support anything she does and I have tremendous amounts of respect for Mother Monster Gaga!<br />----<br />I am going to say that she is a good person at heart and down to earth and that is great because its rare for someone to be this popular and still be the same person before they hit fame! You can attack her as much as you want but it still does not change the fact that she has huge amounts of pure talent! She can sing live (which most mainstream artists can not do), play the piano well, write her own lyrics, design and think of concepts for fashion and the way she performs in general! This is extremely rare for mainstream artists. As you can tell I HATE mainstream BS, Gaga is the exception (although I loved her before she was mainstream).<br /><br />Lady gaga may not be 100% original but who is these days? It has all been done before. And to those who think she is copying Madonna I got something to say to that which is, she is inspired by her, along with many others such as David Bowie (how cool is that, remember the thunderbolt on her face in \\"just dance\\"...yeah)so what is wrong with having an inspiration? Also just a thought, Madonna was never 100% original either so stfu! Lady Gaga does it so much better anyways because she can actually sing unlike Madonna! /rant<br />----<br /><br />That said, of course Gaga has evolved! Do not expect her to be the same forever! With Born this way she has a better concept and over all theme for this album then \\"The Fame\\". I think this album as a whole is amazing because I can hear the fusion of Metal, Electro,80's and Pop which is very cool in my opinion! Electric Chapel is a perfect example!<br /><br />At first I hated the fact that I thought Lady Gaga was trying to push \\"Christianity\\" on the public (A Wiccan myself), but eventually I can to the realization that whats the big deal? It is her music and she writes about what makes her happy! And its not like she is saying \\"Believe in Jesus or else you are going to hell\\" type deal. I have warmed up to the concept.<br /><br />I guess its time to break it down by song.<br /><br />Marry The Night 4/5 : Very 80's meets Electro and of course the lyrics are great :D<br />Born This Way 4/5 : At first I did not care much for this song but I guess I warmed up to it and the message behind it<br />Government Hooker 5/5: One of my favs, very unique and DARK which I love! NIN meets Gaga<br />Judas 5/5 : LOVE IT! I especially love the part when she says \\"EW\\" and what comes after! Also the remixes are amazing!<br />Americano 3/5 : Maybe I will love it later, the concept is cool but I hate Mariachi music, sorry.<br />Hair 5/5 : I love the message behind this and I can relate to this a lot actually.<br />Scheisse 5/5 : I love German music especially German Industrial, and this reminds me of that but in a more Pop type music.<br />Bloody Mary 5/5 : The lyrics are amazing and it reminds me of Synth-Pop which I like.<br />Black Jesus + Amen Fashion 3/5 : Possibly the weakest song on the album<br />Bad Kids 3/5 : Tie with Black Jesus for weakest song, in my opinion.<br />Fashion of His Love 3/5 : The remix is much better! But still very 80's<br />Highway Unicorn 4/5 : Liking the name, its groovy (yes)<br />Heavy Metal Lover 5/5 : The beats are AMAZING! Along with the unique vocals, how could you dislike?<br />Electric Chapel 5/5: Reminds me of a metal band playing in a church while Gaga is singing her heart out! One of the best!<br />The Queen 5/5 : I guess this could be Edge of Glory 2.0<br />You and I 4/5 : This is so good but I had this song WAY before this album and I played it out to much. Also kinda Country EW!<br />The Edge of Glory : 5/5 At first is did HATE this song but now it is amazing! It has an 80's feel to it.<br /><br />All the remixes are amazing, but I can not stand Born this way (The Country Road Version), sorry I hate country and hopefully Gaga does not venture anymore in Country music! Country in itself is a mindless pathetic genre. Don't believe me? Walk down the isle's of any retail store in the Country section and you will see that every single album cover is the same.<br /><br />...........okay I am way off topic, anyways BUY this album, you will not be disappointed, even if you are not a fan of her music. Also if you are a fan of Electronic music you HAVE to check this out because the beats are amazing! And most of all have an OPEN MIND and enjoy little monsters!<br /><br />Paws Up!wn the isle's of any retail store in the Country section and you will see that every single album cover is the same.    ...........okay I am way off topic, anyways BUY this album, you will not be disappointed, even if you are not a fan of her music.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|Stevie Nicks is back with a vengeance. For me, this CD is one of her best, if not her absolute best. Her voice is strong and as haunting as ever. The song lyrics and the vibe of the album pulled me in from the first note and never let go. This is one of thoe CDs that will make me pay attention every time I play it - and I will play it often.
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|My review is not about the movie itself and exclusive Criterion only extras but about quality of new Criterion Blu-Rays packaging.  Unfortunately is not so good as it was in \\"oldie\\" DVD era. No cardboard slip covers with embossed letters (so you please don't trust user photos in discription), no bulky special amarays - just a plain standard plastic blue case. The only difference in design from other blu-rays - famous \\"C\\" trademark on the spin...
B004K4AUZW|5.0|So I have been spending a lot of time with this album over the past week. I checked out the tracks a weak early with the leak as well. I was initially a bit underwhelmed. I thought it was too straight forward, bland, and I didn't like that it's target audience seemed to be a younger crowd as opposed to the club scene and partying.     ...But after spending some time with it, this album really is making a greatly positive impression on me. I have high respects for GaGa really making this HER album as opposed to a bunch of producers writing her songs and telling her what to sing about. This woman is a real music artist whose work evolves, reflects, and is influenced by current culture and herself. You don't see that often in pop culture, ESPECIALLY with the super stars. Sometimes I forget that you need to just strap yourself in,  see where the artist takes you, and enjoy the journey. It's a huge departure from her current album, but how boring would it be if we stayed in the same place forever?     Anyways, songs like Americano, Heavy Metal Lover, and Fashion of his Love were initially turn offs for me, but I am finding myself falling in love with them and consistently humming the melodies around the house. She's exploring a lot of territory within many genres of music, and I feel she's doing it with incredible style and boldness.     With all that being said, I am very VERY happy with this album, regardless of the slightly sour beginning I had with it.     I really love it.
0316056863|5.0|I like Tina Fey. I was leery about reading a biography on someone who is still young and has a lot of career left, but she is funny, so I knew it was worth a try. With no time left to read this before it was due back to the library, I thought I would start it and see if it was worth finishing. It definitely was!<br />This book had me literally laughing out loud through most chapters. I flew through every page. There really wasn't a part of her life that I found boring, and her writing style made it even better. Plus, it was neat to hear how she made it and to hear about the inside life of SNL and 30 Rock. Sometimes I would try to picture Tina actually reading the book, and that made it even funnier. I am amazed at how talented of a writer Tina Fey is!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|If you thought you were gonna listen to a follow up to The Fame then just go away. This album is SO much better. It shows Gaga's true feelings and artistic views on the world and her little monster like me. :) She gets really deep and has catchy lines and this album really expresses who she is as a person. If your looking for some cheesy bubble gum pop record this is not for you. Its dark and fantastic just like gaga is. This album also takes you back to the 80's and is really amazing. If this album doesn't get 'album of the year' at the grammy's i would truly be disappointed. BUY THIS ALBUM
B000007VCM|4.0|This is one of their best albums. It has excellent songs like Love - Rain - She sells Sanctuary - and the other songs are very good. If you are new to The cult this is a good place to start with. Its very cool and rock.
B004CR5TD0|3.0|...dull in others.  What pulled me in were the songs with the electronics.  He's obviously a very talented singer, but songs where it's just his voice, or hardly any other instrumentation, are incredibly boring and uninteresting to me.  Really a 3.5 out of 5.
B0000085N4|4.0|This is their best album and an album that i recommend anyone who likes rock and hard rock to buy. Its cool easy - listening with the right balance between adrenaline and calm. Amazing songs vocals production - generally the rhythm the tempo and the atmosphere is fantastic.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Item was exactly as described and a at great price. Item was received very fast and was expertly packaged. Would love to do business again.
0312323867|5.0|If you read \\"Something Borrowed\\", I suggest you read \\"Something Blue\\". Must read this book in order to complete the story between Rachel, Dex, Darcy, and Ethan. It is definitely my favorite out of the two! I was a bit hesitant at first because Darcy's character wasn't my favorite type of person, so I honestly thought it was a waste of time to get to know this character. But actually, I relate a lot of Darcy in so many ways...don't judge a book by it's cover, especially this one! Trust me, you'll love it..plus it has a lot of surprises! Definitely heart-warming and real.
030745455X|4.0|I thought this was the best book of the series. I am not sure why it didn't have an ending where you didn't have to read the 3rd book in the series to know what happened.
0061989142|5.0|This book is great! It not only talks about must have clothing items, but how to mix them and use them to their full potential. I really enjoyed the sections on hair, makeup and accessories as well. As usual, Lauren is sharing all her best tips! I LOVE it!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful calendar app with tons of features. Extremely visual and very customizable. It's easy to use and integrates well with Android Agenda Widget.
B004G6009K|5.0|This movie reminds me of many of the old Disney \\"classics\\" that I grew up with. This is a classic fairy tale love story with many very well-developed characters both good and bad. Excellent 3-D DVD!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|First, I want to apologize for my one star review yesterday as I was so frustrated with the download, my first one ever.  Today it all worked perfectly.. so thank you Amazon for the great deal and thank you Lady Gaga.  Still getting to know her music, but I think I am slowly becoming a monster.  Gaga, you expose yourself in every way.
0061438294|3.0|The FBI must not want you to know much because this book didn't teach me much that I didn't already know naturally.
B004GTQ4DI|1.0|After seeing the original Cranford this series is a huge disappointment.  It has most of the same characters and backdrops but is so poorly written it was painful to watch. Gave up after only the first chapter.
B003INBOEM|5.0|If you even remotely like kung foo / bio pics then you NEED to see this movie. Donnie Yen was f*ing great as Ip Man and the story was fantastic. Watch it, love it, show it to all your friends. If there was a perfect movie in this genre I would say this is it for me.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|I've been riding the Gaga bandwagon since the Fame. Most artists put a LOT into their first release and then have \\"letdowns\\". Gaga's Monster was I thought, actually better then The Fame simply because she stretched a little....I love this CD for the same reason. Gaga is a very talented young lady. Her vocals for me WON me over the Music. I think she is Amazing and I do think she can \\"Rock Out\\".<br />I can't wait to hear the next release! My only concern is that she Peaks too soon, but from the sounds on this CD the girl has Great Possibilities. My Fave cut off this CD? Edge of Glory. The Judas tune is GOOD, a little weird and very Retro....Gaga is not \\"mindless\\" there is a purpose behind her music which I think makes her Special among today's artists....I got the Amazon, special, but I'll happily buy the special edition also just because I enjoy listening to this lady perform.....I do think she is Visual....a true performance artist, but there doesn't seem to be a limit to what she can do....I hope she never reaches it.<br /><br />BTW....I did buy the Special Edition....GREAT purchase! I think a GREAT aspect of Gaga is her VOICE....there are some so-so songs on the CD like Americano...but<br />she has such a FINE voice....it trancends the song itself.....Electric Chapel...<br />and Judas are GREAT tunes....To answer some later would be critics...YES....there is a lot of Electronic SOUNDS here....the Music SURROUNDS you. For me, Music is about Sounds....I like Everything...I LOVE this CD....Play it....replay it....let it Engulf you....Enjoy Gaga....there are a lot of wannabes....but the Lady is<br />AMAZING!<br /><br />Atreides
B004EBZX6W|5.0|when I first saw this app, I wondered when would I ever use this. ALL THE TIME. This a great app to have around when carrying around any wifi devices.  highly recommend!
B004UC1WN8|5.0|Great Album featuring massive amounts of excellent dance music including \\"Papi\\", \\"Villain\\", \\"Invading My Mind\\", and \\"Charge Me Up.\\" This was the best way for Jennifer Lopez to return back to the top with the International smash \\"On The Floor\\"!!
0061122416|5.0|I came to The Alchemist because someone I respect deeply spoke highly of it, and I was glad I did.  This would not be the usual sort of fare for me.  Fables probably aren't the usual sort of fare for anybody, of course, but I also mean this story's emphasis on self-realization, its message of \\"what would you do if you could not fail?\\" and \\"if you pursue your dream good things will come to you,\\" its moral that the answers to our questions lie within, and its overall flavor of new age spirituality are all outside of my usual comfort zone.  But I thought the book was fabulous and know I will reread it in the future.       I gather some have criticized The Alchemist as overly simple and lacking subtlety, but to me that is the essence of the fable and its style of storytelling, part of what made the book so charming and effective. And while the morals of the story, so to speak, are perhaps easily summarized, there is still---in my view---much to chew on that I will revisit.  The role of love in pursuit of happiness and fulfillment, the meaning of omens and understanding beyond oneself, the way of framing an individual's place in the world.  Maybe it is because it is outside my usual fare, but I found this \\"simple\\" tale deeply thought provoking.  Strongly recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love this book. i couldnt put it down its way better then twilight n those other books. i cant wait til the movie comes out
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book will make you laugh, cry and examine the meaning of your life. This is such a beautiful story, so very much more than a dog's telling of his life on earth. This is a must read, make you feel good, book.
B004Y8Y26C|5.0|Really rockin' soundtrack...bought it as soon as I got home from seeing it the first time.    The one thing that bugged me was that the tracks were out of order to  how they were in the movie.    The corrected track order would be:    3, 6, 15, 5, 16, 17, 2, 9, 4, 7, 8, 15, 10, 1, 18, 19, 13, 12, 14, 20, 11    Cheers
B003R0MEZ4|1.0|I have bought all the Criminal Minds sets up to the sixth season when they started getting rid of all the good people on the show. I refuse to watch the new episodes (or buy the box seasons) and the new people dont even come close to filling in the shoes. Criminal Minds WAS the s%^t but now it sucks. I highly do NOT recommend watching or buying past the 5th season. I know I am not the only one who feels this way. Do a search for: \\"Criminal Minds Fanatic Blog\\" [...]; everyone is ranting about these horrible changes.
B001LV2PA0|5.0|This movie is truly a great classic supernatural thriller-the beginning alone will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I love this CD.  Some songs are fun while others bear a message of acceptance - all are well written.  They are all carried high by Gaga's pure vocals and musicality.  Looking forward to Gaga's long and stellar career.
0385342047|2.0|Like many others I've read all the books in this series.  I started losing interest when 'Shopaholic And Sister' came out.  I thought maybe it was just because I disliked the character Jess.  Then I realized I was beginning to dislike all the characters in this book.  There is no depth in any of them and it seems as if all the books are following the same formula: 1. Becky goes shopping  2. Luke is obsessed with his company  3.Becky's mother over reacts  4. Becky lies  5. Luke's company is in trouble 5. Luke is never around 6. Becky somehow wiggles out of the consequences of her lies and saves Luke's company.  I didn't find anything charming about Minnie and in fact disliked this character a lot.  It's almost as if she is stuck in this book without much thought.  The antics of Becky Brandon are getting old and I no longer find her funny or charming.  I had the same problem with the Janet Evanovich books.  Same old story with a different nutty character inserted.  The saying, \\"Don't fix it if it isn't broken\\", really doesn't apply to writing.  If these books don't get any better I probably won't read them anymore.  Successful series are possible as shown by Sue Grafton and her Kinsey Malone character.  Each of her books are refreshing and funny.  Do yourself a favor, save money, and check this book out at the library.  I'm really disappointed in this series.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|Great soundtracks
B003VYAVGA|5.0|Absolutely brilliant. You can literally just push play and listen to the whole thing, which is hard to do with a lot of cd's these days.
B004K4AVAG|3.0|Born This Way was my first single from Mrs Gaga, and as a Farmville player, I was privy to hear the whole album on May 20.  The only songs that I really liked were \\"Marry The Night\\", \\"Electric Chapel\\", \\"Fashion of His Love\\" and \\"You And I\\".  The album version of the title track sounded like a remix and a poor one at that and so I prefer the single mix and also the Country Road Version to it.  \\"Government Hooker\\", \\"ScheiBe\\" are out un-listenable while the other songs just don't do anything for me.  While Gaga did not appeal to me with what I heard on the radio, I thought that she may be on to something when I heard the title track and then the first three songs I mentioned above via Farmville, unfortunately, with the exception of \\"You And I\\" and the title track, they would be the only songs I found appealing.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|I was really looking foward to a new album of Miss J.Hud, since her last album won her a grammy. She took her time and came out with an incredible record filled with love and life anthems to make us feel things can only get better if we want them to. Loved every single track of it.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I have to be honest..I am not a that big of a fan of lady gaga... But that being said.. I really like this album and how all her songs have a nice beat to them, I can dance to it, I can play this at a party or just jam to it in my car. the songs in this album are also different than her previous ones. it's a risk to do something different especially since her previous cd's were such major hits and were so abstract (which was the reason she was so popular in the first place), but I think it was a good different. She maintains her abstract self in this very catchy album
B004K4AUZW|1.0|save your money.  Worst album I have heard in a while, worse than B Spears.  People will say its good because Gaga is trendy, but its not.  Its really bad.  I want my $6.99 back
B0029LHX1W|5.0|An amazing tapestry of a murder mystery occurring in the later days of Stalin's Russia where paranoia and personal survival trumped all else. A suspenseful read.
B004LGPBZI|4.0|First things first, I am a life-long Oasis fan, going back to the early days (seeing them in concert in Indy in 1996 on the \\"Morning Glory\\" tour is still one of my most memorable concerts ever), but when Oasis finally called it a day in 2009, it was long overdue. The band had run out of musical ideas, period. I had no idea what would follow next, but when Liam annouced he was plowing on with ex-Oasis band members Gem Archer and Andy Bell (the 3 of them wrote all the songs on here), I was surprised but intruiged. Could they make great music without Noel? I bought this album the day it came out in March, but decided on purpose to wait a while to let it all sink in, as my initial reaction was \\"wow, this is incredibly good!\\". Fast forward almost 3 months, and here we are.<br /><br />\\"Different Gear, Still Speading\\" (13 tracks; 54 min.) starts off with arguably its weakest track, a rambling \\"Four Letter Word\\" but after that things pick up immediately, with a sweet \\"Millionaire\\" and then \\"The Roller\\" (1st UK single), which oozes Beatles all over. \\"Beatles and Stones\\" is one of the most tellingly-named tracks in a long time, showing where the band gets its inspiration. It is followed by \\"Wind Up Dream\\", with opening guitar riffs straight from the 70s Stones, just great. \\"For Anyone\\" is a fantastic, gentle strum-along track. It eventually leads to track 10, \\"Wigwam\\" a 7 min. epic song that is fabulous (call it Beady Eye's version of \\"Champaigne Supernova\\" and if that had been the last track of the album, it would've been just fine by me. But no, it is followed by a couple more songs, including the fantastic Beatles-esque \\"The Beat Goes On\\".<br /><br />In all, I can't emphasize enough how pleasantly surprised I am by this album. Yes, the album could've been even stronger by cutting one or two of the weaker tracks, but overall, this is an incredible strong album, and I say this having listened to this many times in the last 3 months. Sure to make my \\"best of 2011\\" list. Can't wait to see these guys live at some point. Meanwhile, your move, Noel Gallagher!se guys live at some point. Meanwhile, your move, Noel Gallagher!
B00003CXBK|4.0|We've all heard this story before.  As two sides are engaged in a fight to extermination, one individual from the winning side (us) travels to forbidden territory and experiences the lifestyles of the once-thought savage side (them), only to learn that it is, on the contrary, a lifestyle that must be preserved and worth fighting for, and henceforth decides to fight against the side of what he was once part.  Long story short: WE are the bad guys, not them; FEEL GUILTY!  Many films have done this including Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, the Last Samurai, and most recently, Avatar.    So what separates this film from the others?  It is the absence of the \\"black and white\\"/\\"us vs. them\\" mentality.  The other films completely sympathize with the losing side (usually the natives or nature), labeling them the good guys, and flat out label the other side as the villains (usually modern man or the white man).  This film tries not to do that.  The film clearly recognizes both the good and the bad on both sides.  What both sides fight for are BOTH selfish AND righteous at the same time.    On the human side, Lady Eboshi wants to protect her fellow humans, taking in lepers and the sick who would otherwise be killed in a world controlled by gods and demons.  Through her discovery of weaponized iron, she has found a way to fight back and rid the forest of the gods, giving her species a fighting chance.  On the side of nature, Princess Mononoke feels that the gods should remain in control of the world, in harmony, as it always has been.  Due to Lady Eboshi's actions, she is enraged and wants nothing more than to kill her.  She wants nothing more than the best for the plants and animals that have called the forest their home.  However, to do this nature must overcome its own hubris.    This is merely the tip of the iceberg.  Throughout the movie, both sides encounter more complex development, for example, Lady Eboshi's struggle with the war-bent samurai and Princess Mononoke's struggle with the other delusional, proud, and stubborn animal tribes.  This deepens both sides and makes both sides even grayer, completely removing the black and white morality.  In fact, the antagonist in the movie simply boils down to the anger and hate that dwells and grows on both sides like a curse.    So what are my gripes about this film?  Well, here are a couple.    The main character, Ashitaka, is so brave, so fearless, so pure, so valiant, so righteous, so... boring.  For a character that we follow through the entire movie, I feel he needed to have some more qualities that acted as flaws.  He does have his moments of anger when he loses control due to his curse, but these moments are rare.  Even so, he is easily able to overcome them.  By being such a near-perfect character, it was very difficult to relate to him.  A good main character is a flawed character that grows throughout the course of the movie, allowing the audience to grow alongside with him.    Another would be the length.  The movie is quite long.  It isn't a huge deal, but again, we follow Ashitaka throughout practically all of it.    Overall, this movie is great.  It's not perfect, but it's great.  It's not meant for kids, unlike other Ghibli films, but that doesn't hinder it whatsoever.  The soundtrack is superb, the animation is stellar and bright, and the plot is a great take on an old clichéd story.  The fact that it is \\"anime\\" is irrelevant; a good movie is a good movie.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Anyone that watched and enjoyed the Firefly series will Love this movie. I have watched this movie over and over and finally just purchased it. It was such a good epilogue movie to the series. I hope they make another but I don't hold my breath. I know you will like this movie very very much if you give it a viewing and you will probably purchase it also.
B004HAEGP4|4.0|This movie is one of those movies in the series that is obviously when the writers have dried up on new ideas for the series. Mila is still the awesome zombie killer but the movie kind of drags and gets very predictable. I'm glad I watched it, but I don't think I will add this one to my video library.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|Being a fan of her first two albums, I will admit, I expected more fun dancefloor anthems, and even a good ballad or two. My fave song of hers is \\"Monster\\", but with Born This Way, she kinda went Anthem Rock/Dance Pop... And I.dont hate it buut I dont like it. What I do like is:<br /><br />Marry The Night: A verry good track, dark but beautiful, good opener.<br />Born This Way: Of course an anthem for the Gay community, but also an anthem for originality, and it hits the nail on the head, solid!<br />Judas: Im sorry I guess it has a bad connnotation if ur uber religious but if u really listen, its about being with the guy you should love but still being in love with the man whos bad for you, that toxic man... Everyone has a toxic man. Thank u Gaga for this epic song.<br />Hair: Love it, its beautiful, I feel the same way with my hair :)<br />Scheisse: one of my new faves this song alone wardants another star.<br />Bloody Mary: OMG I love this track, its my favorite, I cant even describe it!<br />Electris Chapel: My second favorite I love the \\"dut du du dut dut du du\\" and \\"If u wanna steal my heart away, meet me meet me baby in a safe place\\" she really does have a way with words.<br />The Edge Of Glory: Epic! That is all.<br /><br />And the bad:<br /><br />Government Hooker: Seriously, this song is ridiculously stupid, I cannot stand it, hate hate hate!<br />Black Jesus + Amen Fashion: im dorry but why?! When she wrote this did she really think thats good? This is like the trashy low-class version of \\"Vogue\\"!<br />Highway Unicorn (Road to Love): She really boggles my mind.<br /><br />This is NOT the album of the decade like she claimed, its not even the album of the year, but its good, it has a few good songs, but the number ones shes used to are missing on this album. Other than BTW & Judas... I dont see anymore big hits. She got to confident.... Maybe next tine Gaga.
B004E547D8|5.0|Oh this was such a very good movie. I expected the movie to be ruined by the advertisements,(Hollywood usually shows all the best parts of the movie Spoiling the viewing).. But this was a very fast paced fun movie. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B003R4ZMK4|5.0|Seriously, one of the BEST SHOWS ON TV! By far the best show on ABC Family, pure and simple! I'm hooked! Can't wait for the new episodes! So addicting! Can't wait for summer!
B003M8NG94|5.0|Tim Burton's weirdness translates well in this alien invasion film with a great cast. Cheesy-fun 50's-60's meets now vibe. Looks GREAT in blu ray.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Every one of director Miyazaki Hayo's (Studio GHIBLI) films are amazing and worthy of more stars than the five that amazon allows. I believe that any fan of anime or manga will love this film. The art is stunning and the score is unbelievable! People who are fans of Dinsney animation or people who have never heard of anime or manga will most probably like this film, in my personal opinion.    Miyazaki Hayo's films have for a while now, I believe I've read, inspired Disney and Pixar animators.    One of my favorite special features on this DVD is the Nippon Television special on the making of spirited away - I watch it constantly.     This inspiring, Acadamy Award winning, film should - in my opinion - be on the shelf of any anime fan or Disney or Pixar fans shelf. It is Amazing!    An AMAZING film by an AMAZING studio and master director!!!
B000022TSY|4.0|The odyssey of two motorcycle hippies:  Billy (Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt aka Captain America (Peter Fonda) who score it big on a cocaine deal and go on a celebratory ride from L.A. to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  Their names were supposedly based on Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp of Wild West fame. Their adventures take them from farming families to hippie communes, from rural southern towns to their final destination:  Mardi Gras New Orleans. Watch for Jack Nicholson in one of his earliest and most unforgettable performances as George: the boozing, small-town lawyer.  The movie explores the drug counterculture and social intolerance of the late 1960's. The film editing is at times odd but other times, brilliant....which best describes co-writer/director Dennis Hopper's personality.    I saw this on the big screen when I was fourteen.  It marked the beginning of my love for motorcycles (and hippies). Wyatt (Fonda) rides on perhaps the most iconic motorcycle in history: The \\"Captain America\\" Chopper (a heavily customized Harley-Davidson). The movie has an excellent 60's music soundtrack played alongside beautiful Americana landscapes: it is a biker's dream trip. The pot smoking scenes are perhaps too frequent and sometimes ludicrous. There is also a strange but interesting \\"LSD\\" scene which attempts to show the psychotic side of a \\"trip\\".  Dennis Hopper went on to have a fairly successful film career and succumbed to cancer in 2010.  Peter Fonda (Jane's brother and Henry's son) is still working and gave an Oscar nominated performance in 1997's \\"Ulee's Gold\\".  Jack Nicholson, needless to say, went on to become a film legend.
B004XUD762|5.0|I recently received my bundle cd and shirt from the laterst release \\"The Song Remains Not The Same\\"  I downloaded it to my smartphone and listened to it on a 2 hour flight.  I found myself instantly in love with the acoustic reditions of my also beloved \\"Order of the Black\\" as well as a few surprises thrown in.  \\"Helpless\\" has been brought back to life in a whole new way.  I am only hoping he will throw a few out there for the upcomming US tour.

0670022411|4.0|Historian Diana Bishop comes from a long line of witches but she has no desire to pursue witchcraft. Instead, she focuses on her career as she does research on historical manuscripts about the move from alchemy and magic to science in Oxford. One day, Diana calls up a manuscript that is clearly magical and draws the attention of creatures everywhere. The world is full of much more than witches...there are also vampires and daemons living secretly among us.  It turns out that this manuscript has been lost and is a sort of \\"holy grail\\" for witches, vampires and daemons alike. Now, everyone wants to get their hands on it and Diana may be the key.  In her search for the truth about the manuscript and her attempts to escape from the other creatures, Diana makes an unlikely ally in vampire Matthew Clairmont. Could their relationship be more destiny than coincidence?<br /><br />I was skeptical about this book because I wasn't sure there was anything knew to say on the topic of witches and vampires.  I was disappointed that THE PHYSICK BOOK OF DELIVERANCE DANE didn't deliver on its promise and was worried that this would be more of the same.  Harkness cleverly introduces us to world where witches, vampires and daemons live among us.  They go about their lives in an uneasy truce with one another but they are all looking for the ancient manuscript that will provide the key to their origins or the chance to become supreme.  Diana is an interesting character in that she is a truly gifted witch who only wants to be \\"normal.\\"  She is complex and interesting and has a terrific backstory. All the characters in the book are interesting and the story moves at a very good pace. My one complaint would be the love story. Every time the love story came into the tale it slowed the whole narrative down. I felt the love story was silly, overwrought and kind of unnecessary. This is plenty going on without having this over-the-top love angle. Still, I found the book hard to put down. I was disappointed when it ended and I'm looking forward to the next book in this planned trilogy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Recommended.  Harkness could have toned down the love story a lot and the book would have been much better. Still, there is much to enjoy here. It's a very creative and fast-paced story and definitely leaves you wanting more. A great vacation read.inted when it ended and I'm looking forward to the next book in this planned trilogy.

B0047Y17P2|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Michael Connely's books(have read them all) and this one is no exception. Haller's personanlity is much calmer than Bosch's but they are a good counterpoint as half-brothers, so it's good to go back to Haller once in a while. The suspense was there and made the outcome interesting to the very last. I have no more comment other than what others that have liked this book have posted. I made this comment mainly to counteract all those who wrongly think that the price of a book is more important to a review than the content evaluation. I don't think that many of us care about others quirks regarding their financial plans.
0670022411|1.0|Having just read (and thoroughly enjoyed) the entire Harry Potter series, I was intrigued by a review of this book that said it was a Harry Potter for grown-ups. Wrong.     The book is terrible on so many levels: two dimensional characters, wildly predictable plot, and plodding, unoriginal writing. The protagonist, Diana Bishop, is supposed to be a strong, fiercely independent, intelligent woman who represses an innate talent for witchcraft. But then she spends the bulk of the book as a weak, pathetic whiner desperately needing to be saved by her obnoxiously patronizing vampire lover.    Worst of all? It's a TRILOGY! No one anywhere said I would have to trudge through three books of this tripe to get to the end of this story. And I won't, because I couldn't care less what happens to anyone in this book. Avoid it like the plague.

A song online accompanies the book or you can sing the refrain to your own \\"made-up\\" tune.  Several phrases are used over and over that a child will delight in repeating. Enjoy this with your favorite two, three or eight year old--fun for everyone!
B002ZG9968|3.0|I got a used movie from them, but it said the movie was in very good condition. When I opened the case there were scratch marks all over the front that were really deep. Although it did not affect the actual movie, it was very unappealing. I think it was really in good condition instead of very good. Besides that I'm very pleased. It arrived on time.

B004NO03E2|5.0|I'll keep this relatively short and sweet.  Just listen to what the other reviews are saying.  This album is even better than their first album \\"Burn\\".  So if you liked that one, you're gonna love this one.  Seriously.  The sound is tighter and heavier.  And the riffs are more technical to some extent.  If these new retro-thrash bands keep this up, thrash will be here to stay for quite some time.  With this release, I'm looking forward to the new HeXeN and like another reviewer said, the new EVILE as well.
B001CTDH76|5.0|My wife and I love this show, and the first season they ran it at 9-10PM. The last two seasons they have moved it to 10-11PM. I'm sorry, long days and I need to head to bed by 10! I could record it or use a DVR, but I don't. We missed watching the show and have since purchased Season One and Two. I absolutely love it, clever writing, Patrick Jane's lines are so amusing, especially the way he'll say things with a twinkle in his eye, and they have a well developed and enjoyable cast. The recording are done well, and there are a lot of episodes, Season One has 23 episodes and special features. We typically watch two or three a night, and have really enjoyed them. It is one of those DVD's that you'll watch, then pull out next year and be happy to watch again. Season Three, just ended last week and that DVD will be coming out in the next few months. I already have it on back-order. Great present for someone who loves the show, but is lazy like me and won't record it.

B0013D8LKO|5.0|I did not see Eyes Wide Shut when it came out, and remember it got very lukewarm reviews. But I gave it a look recently, expecting little.     I was not prepared for what I saw, which was nothing short of brilliant.     When my kids watched Animaniacs cartoons, all they saw was the slapstick and broad humor. But those cartoons contain a whole second layer of meaning aimed at adults. \\"Helloooo, nurse!\\" So it is with Eyes Wide Shut, which is not really about sex, except as a motive force which propels Dr. Bill Harford into realms he doesn't belong.     I'm amused by the many reviews which relegate the infamous orgy scene to some kind of fantasy or dream state. It isn't, not in the least. Kubrick is being completely literal there. With a magician's flip of the cape, he shows that our 'real world' is the fantasy, a lie we tell ourselves to avoid seeing the ruling elite who live above our laws and outside our view.     \\"But now we're awake,\\" says Alice, and tells her husband they should be grateful for having survived their brush with dangerous truths.     If you need to convince yourself it was all just a dream, go ahead. Just don't look up in the trees. There might be giant spiders up there.
B004XQO90E|2.0|I'll admit I went in to Source Code with zero expectations at all- it didn't look very appealing from the trailer. However, I'll admit I did like a few parts. There are a couple scenes of gorgeously shot, tear-jerkingly beautiful brilliance. That, and the cinematography is worth noting- It is very slick and tone-setting. But the way this movie plays out, it's almost like a parody of the intellectial science fiction thriller.<br /><br />The story has been done before- a computer program where you are allowed to enter someone's body. The Matrix did it, and to a lesser extent but not in the form of a computer program- Being John Malkovich, that movie where a portal was opened in an office building and you could enter John Malkovich's mind for a few minutes. Except here, the program is so that Jake Gyllenhaal can find the bomber of a train.<br /><br />The acting is unbelievably bad. I felt like I was watching a cheaply made TV movie. Gyllenhaal was acted off the screen by that ridiculous hairpiece of his. The plot is so deathly slow, dull, and takes nearly forever to get going, and one of the worst endings EVER absolutely ruins what could have been a good action thriller to begin with. Overall, avoid.<br /><br />OVERALL: 2/10<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Gorgeously shot<br />-Nice special effects<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Pretty much everything else<br />-One of the worst scripts of 2011, almost this year's \\"Salt\\"<br />-Boring buildup to a total non-conclusion<br />-Some of the worst acting this side of Community Theatre

You can also set for up to 3 equations to be solved before it disables if you are somewhat of a sound sleeper.  I NEVER pay for applications, but I will always be happy that I bought this.

140131046X|5.0|I lost my son 3 weeks prior to buying this book. I struggled with my lack of spiritualism and wanting to know my son was in a better place. While flying \\"home\\" after the funeral, etc. I stopped at several news stands in the airport looking for a book that might help me. I looked at several books but for some reason I kept coming back to this one.... I didn't buy it at the first airport... But that whole flight I could not get this book out of my mind... Finally, I decided during my next lay-over, I was going to the first shop I found and buying this book. I finished reading it today and I am so glad I bought it. There are so many stories and comments in this book that struck such an accord with me and my thoughts and how feel about my son and my spirituality... This book has truly made an impact on my life! Thank you, Mitch!

0307272702|5.0|An excellent job as usual. The author explains everything sastifactorily, but I feel a couple of loose ends remain.<br /><br />The historical Asian diet consisted mainly of rice yet they did not suffer from obesity. He offers that it was also lacking in sugar. This is true, but its elimination in modern Western diets is no cure, even among Asians. Perhaps early exposure to the fructose in sugar, even in the womb, makes one irreversibly sensitive to all carbohydrates later in life.<br /><br />There is also the question of overfeeding animals with non-carbohydrate calories. They don't get fat, so where do the calories go? He suggests it has the effect of making them more active, and turns people into marathoners. Seems counter to everyday experience.<br /><br />Third, why does gastric bypass result in weight loss if fat is driven solely by insulin?<br /><br />Someday these questions will be answered. Fortunately, for now, there is ample evidence the diet works.
B0038BBA4I|2.0|I bought this album on the strength of the Amazon reviews, and I have to say I'm disappointed and quite confused what all the buzz is about.  The songwriting is terrible, the lyrics are boring, and the band has on overall whiny, melodramatic sound that I find quite grating.

1593272774|5.0|My 9 year-old son is a Lego fanatic, and especially loves to build with Technic and Bionicle pieces. He's awfully timid about creating on his own, however, so I thought this book might help to provide the inspiration and confidence he sometimes lacks.     This beautiful book is absolutely filled with useful information. First, there are hundreds and hundreds of pictures showing different ways to combine gears and other common Technic pieces to translate power and motion in every direction. Then, the author moves on to show examples of what can be built with these basic machines... doors that slide open and shut, motorized cars, and even simple musical instruments! There are no building directions or parts lists, but we found that everything was photographed clearly enough to allow us to replicate, and that almost all of the pieces were already in our fairly extensive Lego collection.       The one huge detraction from this book, I felt, was the complete absence of descriptive labeling on the photographs within. The author does so deliberately for effect; in his own words, \\"This is an idea book; it's about imagination. Rather than tell you what to see or think when you look at each photograph, I encourage you to interpret each one in your own way.\\" I appreciate the sentiment, but I can't help feeling that the author has sacrificed usefulness in his pursuit of art. The well-organized table of contents contains very helpful titles and descriptions, after all... why not transfer these same few words to the corresponding pages to help identify the extremely beautiful, creative, and thought-provoking Lego constructs shown there at a glance? Thus, while I unhesitatingly recommend this book for Lego aficionados with the patience and knowledge it requires to really enjoy it, I do so with slight reservations for the lesser, more easily-frustrated mortals among us.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I would have given this 5 stars if the download was reliable. I tried to purchase this yesterday for 99 cents and thought I didn't get any songs since it said it failed. I find today that I have 11 songs but where are the last 3 including Electric Chapel. Maybe they should have thought it through before teasing everyone with this download and then failing to meet expectations.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Many people agree that Sabotage, Black Sabbath's sixth album, is the last 'classic' album out of their stunning, first six record run. Yet, there doesn't seem to be much of a consensus on where Sabotage ranks among that 'classic' six, and it is sometimes overshadowed by previous classics like Paranoid. I'd place Sabotage firmly near the top, and here's why:<br /><br />This album finds Sabbath in a similar mode as their previous release, the outstanding Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. On the heavier material, the band hits *hard*, yet several songs show a willingness to experiment and expand the boundaries of heavy metal, the rules for which Sabbath spent the 70s creating as they went along. The opening \\"Hole in the Sky\\" comes storming out of the gate, sounding every bit as massive and epic as its title suggests, courtesy of Toni Iommi's punishingly heavy wall of guitars and Ozzy's commanding wail. After the brief and bizarre acoustic guitar interlude \\"Don't Start (Too Late),\\" comes \\"Symptom of the Universe,\\" complete with slashing, menacing riffs and breakneck speed, and drums that sound like they're being absolutely pummeled to pieces by drummer Bill Ward. This song is notable for being faster and heavier than just about anything that came before it; it is both proto-hardcore and proto-speed metal, and clearly influenced everyone from Black Flag to Metallica. The epic, two-part \\"Megalomania\\" ends an already blistering side one with yet another slab of bleak, heaviness. The lumbering, crunching first section finds Sabbath at its darkest and most doom-laden, with sludgy minor key chords and Ozzy's melancholy wailing. After a while, the song shifts gears and centers around a more upbeat riff that is basically *the* riff on which Motley Crue based their entire career. This track goes on a bit too long, but it does end with some nice mellotron fleshing out the sound, and it caps off an unrelentingly heavy set of songs.<br /><br />Side two is more varied, starting with \\"Thrill of it All,\\" a stiff-backed rocker built around a slow-to-mid tempo and Zeppelin-esque chord progression. Things get really interesting on \\"Supertzar,\\" which pairs Iommi's dark guitar riffing with a medieval choir, the results of which sound like the perfect soundtrack to the Crusades. \\"Am I Going Insane\\" is frequently derided by fans for its poppy melodicism and synthesizer-based arrangement, but it's actually quite a good song. \\"The Writ\\" is another epic, in which Sabbath slams a steamroller of a riff through several changes, eventually leading to a passage marked by lush, melodic, arpeggiated acoustic guitars.<br /><br />What we have here is a very consistent album. Yes, there is a stubborn willingness to experiment, coupled with a penchant for some occasionally rather non-metal, \\"softer side of Sabbath\\" melodicism. But this is balanced by some of the band's hardest hitting songs, several of which provided a clear stylistic template that future metal bands would refer to with great frequency. Sadly, this would be the last truly great Ozzy-era album in Sabbath's discography, as drugs and personal problems would soon take their toll on their creativity (and eventually the group itself). Don't be put off by the silly album cover - this is Sabbath at the top of their game.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|...now i truly can't deny how great this album is. All tracks are killers and each track is lusciously multi layered in such fine arrangements. Gaga is a true music genius. Props to her for making pop music interesting again beyond my wildest imagination. Hard to ignore because it is THAT good!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Gaga is a great song writer. She sends a great message. Its simple... Accept everyone for who they are and let people live on their own as they want to... She wants everyone to accept themselves... This is a good album. The music is fresh. It motivates you and makes you want to move.
0345529057|5.0|Seriously? How does being unhappy with the price of the electronic version justify rating the works of this author 1 star? You want that to reflect on Martin's wonderful, epic story? You just don't care how that looks, because \\"you're gonna show Amazon, by golly!\\" Think about your actions before rating something. More than likely the ratings will not harm the sales, but unless you're rating the books low simply because you didn't care for them than 1 star ratings are insane. If the type's too small for you, hey - maybe it should dawn on you that a 1000 page standard paperback size is going to be a teensy bit small in font size. Get better glasses or go for the trade size.  What we have here is the single best fantasy series ever. I don't think I have ever devoured a set of books as quickly as I did ASOIAF. Its dense, complex story and characters are like nothing else out there - this isn't airy-fairy fantasy. It's raw and feels real, and you will be emotionally invested.  Buy the freakin' books and quit whining about the electronic cost.

After several frustrating tries, I finally give up.  That's when I noticed the freakin sticker on the front CD cover that says it's a protected CD.  So I look it up and basically it means I can't play it on my computer and I can't make it into mp3's and add to my zune.  I use my zune for everything, work, car, docking station at home.  I wish I would have known this CD was like that; I would have tried for the MP3 downloads instead of wasting my money on the actual CD.

B004BLDD9Y|5.0|Because a typical incandescent bulb uses about 95% of it's energy consumption as heat, and not light, these LED bulbs are great bargains, even at their current high cost. The light from this bulb is diffused and pleasant, and adequate for it's purpose in my home. It should last at least 10 years and use about 10% of the energy that a regular incandescent bulb uses.<br /><br />I'm planning to replace at least one incandescent bulb a month with an LED bulb for longetivity and energy savings. I hope I can do it. The CFLs are fine, but contain serious toxins and are not as energy efficient as these LED bulbs, so I'm not planning on using any more of them.<br /><br />I really hope the cost of the LED bulbs drops as production increases!

B004K4AVAG|4.0|I Just look for good music and I've liked stuff I've heard from Lady Gaga on the radio. I love the song \\"Born This Way\\" and other songs on this album. However when I hear this entire album all at one sitting I am disappointed by the similarity of the music on each track. I wish people would warn me when an artist doesn't really have a band behind her, but just a drum machine and electronic mimicry. Lady Gaga is a very talented singer and does wonderful things with her singing style on this album. I also love her lyrics. The repetitiveness of the music made me wish I just bought the single and left it at that. However there are several songs different enough to make this a good experience for me, but overall I don't think it's great. If she goes beyond this disco throb sound on the next album I will try my luck again and I have a feeling she will produce many masterpieces of varied music in the future.
B00009R86L|5.0|Tough to tell online, so I purchased 3 products:<br />The Domke, the Timbuk2 Griptex, and the Air Cell Lined strap.<br /><br />The Timbuk 2 was a huge disappointment.  The Griptex had no grip at all. Fail.<br />The Aircell is pretty good, and would be my second choice. It's comfortable and non-slip.<br /><br />But the Domke is great. It's thick and comfortable, and provides the non-slip padding I was looking for.<br />Recommended.<br /><br />(I'm using it on a Bag Of Holding from ThinkGeek, which I also love. It has a good thick strap and is well made overall.<br />Just surprised and disappointed that it did not come with any kind of shoulder cushion. This add-on completes the bag.)
B004K4AUZW|5.0|If you're expecting music like you got on The Fame, you will be surprised (but not disappointed!)  The songs flow so well together, have really danceable beats, and if you know the meanings of many of the songs, very powerful lyrics.  I find myself wanting to just listen to this album all day, and I feel like I like each song more and more the more I hear them.
B00402FGE4|4.0|I would like to start out by saying that I LOVE SGU, and am bitterly disappointed we won't see a third season. This show is definitely a whole different brand of Stargate. You don't have the light-hearted atmosphere of SG-1 or SGA, but it was done the right way. These characters are in a whole different situation, and they're trying to get home. They didn't volunteer for this, they're not qualified for this, and most of them have loved ones back on Earth that they'd rather be with, so they're certainly not enjoying the experience. It is, by necessity, both dark and more angsty than when they could come home and sleep in their own beds at night, and I appreciated that. If you had taken the light-hearted atmosphere and adventurous attitude that permeated the other two Stargates and brought it into this one, I'd have said you were full of it. And I'd have been right ;)     This show definitely goes places other Stargates have been hesitant to go. There is a fair amount of drama, including sex, suicide and drug abuse, as well as jealousy, physical violence, adultery, death and a disregard for human life from various characters at various times. There were moments where you're actually holding your breath, and while your key characters stick around the simple truth is not all of them make it back alive. That doesn't mean it's not without its humor and witty banter, however. There are some one-liners from this show that are absolute canon around our house these days.     That said, I will say it took the writers the better part of the season to find their groove. The early episodes are good, but seem to lack direction, although I found I appreciated them MUCH more the second time around, after I knew a lot of the backstory, because I could pick up on the subtle nuances that really didn't click with me the first time. The season really starts picking up speed about halfway through, however, and the last 5-6 episodes, and all of Season 2, were fantastic. So if you start watching this and really aren't clicking for the first half of the season, stick with it. It's so very, very worth your time. (If for no other reason than we see Jack, Daniel, Carter, Woolsey and McKay at various points along the way!)
B004NSULHM|5.0|I've heard people say that the King of Limbs offers nothing new from the band.  I disagree.  This album sounds nothing like anything they recorded.  Everyone in the band is in top form here. Props especially to the rhythm section.  I also hear a lot of complaints about Johnny's absence on the album.  To that all I can say is listen again.  His orchestration in Bloom and Codex is simply amazing, especially the middle section of the former.  But, you can also hear some great guitar playing from him and Ed in four of the eight songs. Lyrically, this is Thom's most thematically consistent album.   The King of limbs is simply haunting.  The Fab Five have done it again.
031603441X|2.0|I was hoping this book would be entertaining with true insights about the man, the group and the music. What you get is a rambling tall tale. First of all, Richards writes as he speaks. Much of the time this is gibberish or/ in a thick English accent. You can't understand a thing he is saying at times. Add this to the \\"tall tales\\" where Richards like to leave the impression that he is a \\"bad ass\\" and it is almost a comedy, (Imagine the little twit Richards pulling a knife on Billy Preston, or threatening Jerry Lee Lewis). If this little english gnome was only half as rough as he tries to imagine it would still be funny (he thinks he is Steve McQueen). Richards does a good job of relating how the Rolling Stones copied the best American rock and roll artists and literally \\"stole\\" the chops of the great Blues Masters. But Richards likes to create the myth that the Rolling Stones \\"saved\\" rock and roll by \\"re-discovering\\" the licks of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddily, Robert Johnson, Buddy Holly and others. This false idea has been promoted over the years by many of the British artists.  In reality the English groups didn't create or re-invent anything. In 1963 rock and roll was alive and well and Americans such as Roy Orbison, Elvis, The Beach Boys and others were doing just fine and creating new styles or licks without the help of the English groups. The \\"British Invasion\\" came about simply because it was a new trend and the Rolling Stones rode that trend to success. The Stones made many great records but they didn't do anything that the Everly Brothers hadn't already done. Richards seems to enjoy \\"picking\\" at Texas. Maybe it is because ZZ Top and other Texas groups copied exactly the same R&B styles the Stones used but can still play live at a honky tonk to this day. That bugs him? The Stones haven't been able to just \\"play\\" without an entourage of assistants and sound men, guitar techs and others since 1990.  Richards also lacks one item that makes a great musician. He has nosoul or heart. He freely admits he doesn't believe in Heaven or Hell and never did. The great blues stars he copied were great because they had \\"Soul\\" and were fighting the devil or satan, heavan and hell. Richards also is able to write off anyone he corrupted or used along the way. Brian Jones dies..so what. Richards got Papa John Phillips hooked on smack, so what? He is very self-focused and seems to want to put himself on a pedistal at every turn. A huge ego!! He puts down Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and almost everyone he stole from, because he CAN. Bill Wyman is hardly mentioned unless it is a put down. Richards seems to feel everytime he was busted it is \\"the evil law enforcement\\" officers trying to entrap him, even though he is guilty as hell. It is Richards against the establishment and the status quo. But by the end of the book he lives like a snob in Conn. and Mick Jagger is knighted. He and Jagger have become what they hated. It is sad the people he has used up, the way he raised his kids and the depraved life he has led. This book is fine if you are a huge Rolling Stone fan and want to believe the myths. Otherwise skip it. The only one who could really tell the story of the Stones is Charlie Watts. Yet I doubt he will ever talk.

0060763280|5.0|This book changed the way I think about money. I am no longer jealous of people with fancy cars. I no longer think money is the root of all evil. I am aware of all of my negative money beliefs and I am excited to change them. I listen to the audiobook at least once a week to remind me of the concepts and I have a very good feeling that this time next year, my financial life will be drastically different because of this book. I have already seen significant changes.<br /><br />I love this book! My favorite book on money.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|These films were made to be seen in HD, just one problem.  The extras are not in HD, wich is a little disappointing given that the difference in resolution is staggering.  Warners did the same thing to Blade Runner on Blu-ray.  These sets are perfect in terms of content, Warners should just be a little more consistent with the discs.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Yes I was one of the people that was able to download the entire digital album for .99 and yes, it only partially downloaded for me as well. In fact I only got 1 working song. That being said, instead of crying about it I contacted amazon (best customer service!) and less than 24 hours later all my songs had finished downloading to the Cloud Player. I will NOT be basing my reviews on the download process which clearly was going on here on release day.    Album-wise, it is not as good as The Fame(Monster) but it is still very good. There's good songs and blah songs. My favorite has to be Americano. It is fun, very upbeat and catchy. I also really like Judas, Electric Chapel, and Bloody Mary. The other songs are good, nothing very memorable. There are better songs than even her cover track of Born This Way, which, though catchy is not as impressive as some of the other songs on here.   I very much dislike Hair and You and I, which came off very country. I don't particularly care for that genre of music but other people may. Just stating my opinion. All in all, this album has a wide variety of sounds and Lady Gaga herself sounds wonderful.
1400032717|5.0|Talk about your unreliable narrators.  The author of \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\", Mark Haddon, repeatedly disclaims any expertise on autism or Asperger's Syndrome, so we can't draw any definite conclusions about the book's narrator, but he certainly isn't an ordinary child.  He curls up on the ground and screams when the world overwhelms him, he takes literally everything that people say, and he has a habit of hitting those who touch him, including policemen.  His name is Christopher John Francis Boone and he may not be autistic, but he isn't exactly un-autistic either, if you follow me.<br /><br />Whatever his diagnosis, he finds human beings far less congenial than animals, and so gets very upset when he finds the next-door neighbor's poodle stabbed through the body with a gardening fork (I mean more upset than you or I would be).  On the other hand, this incident gives him a wonderful opportunity to emulate one of his heroes, Sherlock Holmes.  As does Holmes, Christopher likes facts and logical progressions, so he sets off to find out who killed the dog.  He writes the story down, he tells us, at the suggestion of one of his teachers, and for obvious reasons decides to use an Arthur Conan Doyle style of detective fiction.<br /><br />He finds out who the killer is, all right, but that revelation comes about halfway through the novel.  Everyone knows that in a genuine murder mystery, the big reveal comes no earlier than the second-to-last chapter.  In other words, Christopher thinks he's writing a murder mystery about who killed the dog, but his book is nothing of the sort.  Considering his condition, it's not entirely surprising that he can't see the deeper emotional roots of his narrative, but you and I can.<br /><br />I can't get much deeper into the true nature of this story without giving the game away, but it has a lot to do with finding and recognizing the truth.  Much of what Christopher has been told in his life turns out to be a lie, including some of the things he has told himself.  Indeed, part of the novel's power comes from the fact that Christopher doesn't always recognize the truth, while at the same time remaining convinced that he knows the truth even better than the adults in his life.<br /><br />He's also among the most selfish fictional characters you're likely to run across.  Some fictional characters insist on their own way at all costs, fully aware that they are doing so.  Christopher insists on his own way at all costs without the slightest clue that others have their own needs.  Of course, this isn't a character flaw exactly - it's part of his maybe-autistic condition - but that doesn't help anyone else deal with him.  And this selfishness is annoying, but it's certainly better than those deadly uplifting books and TV shows where the mentally disadvantaged teach us all those valuable lessons about how everyone's just a human being at heart and lead us in a happy dance under the closing credits.  Christopher's not a saint, he's a teenager with a problem, which of course makes him a much more interesting protagonist.<br /><br />Even more remarkable is the skill with which Haddon makes Christopher's narration worth reading.  Christopher is by no means stupid, but he has a limited vocabulary and an even more limited sphere of interests, so he repeats himself a lot.  What's more, he is not all that concerned with those matters that you and I - the \\"normal\\" world - find interesting, such as people and what they do and how they relate and so on.  So it's a bit surprising to find yourself so engaged with Christopher's activities and how he describes them.  Haddon's smartest stroke, if you ask me, is to resist all temptation to interpret Christopher's world in any way.  Christopher, whatever we choose to call his condition, misses one thing that the rest of us do all the time - he does not consider what any event might mean.  He notes only the event itself and its logical fallout.  Forinstance, when he learns who killed the dog, he doesn't really tell us whether he's angry or upset or frightened.  He tells us what had not occurred to him before, that the killer might kill him, too.  It's a logical conclusion, but once you discover who the culprit is, you will immediately realize that Christopher is quite mistaken.  That's where the skill of the narrative strategy comes in.  Haddon remains totally within Christopher's point of view, no easy task with a character who thinks the way Christopher does, and lets us draw our own conclusions.  Now, that's interesting, in a way that it certainly would not be if Haddon dropped any hints at all about how we should react.<br /><br />You can easily see, with his selfishness, his single-minded disregard of everyone else's thoughts or feelings, and his inability to relate to even those closest to him, Christopher can be a serious pain in the neck.  Haddon gave himself a big challenge here; How is this character supposed to change?  The protagonist of any story undergoes a change; that's what makes him or her the protagonist.  Christopher can't very well become a normal adolescent, which would be unrealistic and foolish.  On the other hand, he has to change some kind of way - if he ends the book as much of a nuisance as he starts it, the story is a waste of time.  Well, without giving too much away, I think the conclusion of this novel is brilliant.  In it, Christopher remains who he was, and at the same time finds a new way to appreciate himself.  Whether you like Christopher or not, that ending can really inspire you.  If he can go through a challenge and come out with a good sense of self-worth, maybe you and I can too.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Everyone wants to be who they can be.dog, he doesn't really tell us whether he's angry or upset or frightened.

075640407X|4.0|Make no mistake - Patrick Rothfuss has a knack for the written word. The Name of the Wind is stuffed with engrossing passages, colorful imagery and original ideas, all of which kept me eagerly reading through the 720 or so pages of this trilogy opener. But there are a few snags which any prospective reader should be aware of. More below:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Original, logical ideas (particularly the magic) that keep action scenes grounded in some semblance of reality<br />-Rhythm of the writing keeps even mundane events from feeling too dry<br />-Interesting meta discussion regarding stories, what constitutes a story, power of stories/names (although I'm left wanting more!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Some ideas are repeated too often, making them feel like tropes even within this one work How often can Kvothe return to a state of poverty? It begins to lose its weight after awhile.<br />-Serendipity dangerously close to deus ex machina. Lots of chance meetings, fortuitous circumstances despite the narrator claiming that his story is not storybook-like.<br />-In need of an editor. Not quite as bad as the later Dark Tower books, but The Name of the Wind would've benefited from a 10-20% reduction (as in, tighter writing not simply another book in the series).<br />-Too many intrusions by the narrator. Hearing \\"this is not your storybook tale\\" gets old quickly and borders on being condescending. Fiction should make the reader forget they're reading a story, not remind them.

B00006F83Y|5.0|I can't add anything to what's already been said here, just wanted to vote for what I feel is the greatest rock album of all time. I can listen to it end to end over and over again! All the time!!!!

From club thumping dance tracks, to rock sessions, thbit is album has something for everyone.  If you are a little stuck in your music ways, it may take some time to enjoy these tracks, but trust me you'll be hooked I'm certain.

B0050G3NWG|3.0|This movie is entertaining as a biting, satiric take on William Randolph Hearst--though oddly enough, Joseph Cotton in the Orson Welles film, \\"F is for Fake\\", stated is was about Howard Hughes.  Hmmm?  A purposeful lie; or the truth.  Whatever the case may be, One or two showings; and I was finished with the film.  The greatest film of all time: No.  Interesting satire on a long forgotten power monger?--Yes.<br />But not the classic film of all time.  And I am an Orson Welles viewer; and this is not one of my favourite films that he made.  Now the Invasion from Mars radio stunt: A classic! to end all classic manipulations.  And a revealing insight into the minds of some Americans at the time.  Not funny, if you were one of the people who became injured in the panic.  Otherwise, a classic national prank that made the rest look like idiots.<br />The Ambersons was butchered, so we'll never know what that was meant to be; but it still gets 4 stars by all the critics.<br />Oddly, Citizen Cane was the breaking of Welles as a film maker. So hyped as time passed, he couldn't live up to the hype.  If the film was rationally viewed, he may have had less expected of him. The myth around this so-called masterpiece, made it much more difficult for him later on.  I'll take \\"Touch of Evil\\" over this film any day of the week.<br /><br />Wells
0312600844|4.0|Open this book to the inside of the back flap; observe the author's photograph; notice the near chiaroscuro forming around the outlines of Frazen's head.  Yes; that is a halo you are detecting, and Frazen is a member of the chosen.  Or so people say.    Frazen hit the literary world's jackpot with The Corrections, and not only did people laud that novel, but Oprah gave it a most profitable edge of controversy.  Yeah, I mean what better way to take a novel that probably was not going to have a huge audience and reach millions than to snub the talkshow queen, America's beloved?  So of course the next big novel from Frazen, Freedom, was met with excitement and expectation.    Now, before I jump into the review here, I just want to address one little thing.  The author has some fairly vocal females making some pretty strong accusations about him and what his presence has meant for women writers.  I am not going to go into that on too deep of a level because it is neither here nor there, for now anyway.  But I do want to say this: children, remember there is enough room in this sandbox for us all to play together.    Synopsis    \\"It was the season of migration, of flight and song and sex.  Down in the neotropics, where diversity was as great as anywhere on earth, a few hundred bird species grew restless and left behind the several thousand other species, many of them close taxonomic relatives, that were content to stay put and crowdedly coexist and reproduce at their tropical leisure.\\" (pg. 485)      I chose this quote because I found that it sheds a little light on the theme of the book, while also cleverly using birds to create an allegory for the characters of the novel.  I hesitated to use this quote, though, because it is also a little misleading.  The book is not nearly as dry as the quote.      Let me explain.  First: theme.  The artwork on the cover clearly takes a stand that this book has something to do with birds, or wilderness maybe.  If you look closely at it, you'll notice the reflection of the woods in the lake is pixelated, so then we must also consider the human thumbprint on ecology.  Are you with me so far?  An exciting new genre has been taking shape lately, and that is Ecoliterature.   Okay, perhaps \\"new\\" isn't the right word (a-hem, sorry Walden) but certainly the genre is burgeoning.    It takes the novel a good llloooonnnnnggggg while to reach the point where you read about any birds.  So for maybe half the novel you'll find yourself thinking that the cover is just pretty artwork or that they chose a bird because birds can fly and therefore often represent freedom (a concept much easier to spot in the novel's earlier chapters).  But if you keep going, at some point you will meet the Cerulean warbler, a bird!  Walter Berglund - the patriarch of the Berglund family (who taken together are all protagonists of this novel) will at some point advocate for the protection of these birds.  And folks, you might want to read this part when you are wide awake and not distracted because the birds, for Walter, are only ever a symbol, a tool to use to get at his real preoccupation: overpopulation.  So there you go, the cover's artwork and Ecoliterature.    Now remember how I said that the quote about these warblers is also an allegory for the Berglund family?  Well, let me unpack that a little.  On the surface, this novel is primarily about various members of the Berglund family in various stages of their lives: starting with young yuppie gentrification and ending in pseudo exile.  These people migrate, sing, fly.  And oh yes, they are restless, just like the quote says!  Each chapter will address a different Berglund, the mistakes he/she is busy making or repenting, and all the while we will march relentlessly forward in time as this novel spans decades.  By and large, the Berglunds are flawed; this works nicely because their flaws are what makes them real for readers.  And in some ways this book is meant as a warning, aforeshadowing of things to come and what has already begun, ecologically speaking.  So it helps us readers take the warning seriously if we can relate to the ugly zits popping up on the tender fresh Berglund skin.    Scoring  (Click here to understand my rating methodology)  Readability: I find Frazen's prose to be rock solid.  However that rock can sometimes be unyielding.  Don't get me wrong, this stuff is good - but I am not dying to read more.  And it doesn't help that he writes such long books because by the end any urge to move forward is simply an urge to be done.  Hey - I'm a slow reader!     1 out of 2 pts.      Freshness: Ahm not so much no.  Good book but I don't see that it really breaks with conventions in any significant way.  I suppose that some might be arguing that having the protagonist(s) be antihero(s) might be new, but it isn't.  I suppose some might be arguing that having the story told through multiple viewpoints is new, but it isn't.  It is called postmodernism people!  Maybe some think the \\"autobiography\\" section was fresh - I don't know, I'll admit it was creative but the idea doesn't seem significant enough to me to reverberate into an actual point on my scoring system.  And though the book is part of an emerging genre, I am just not satisfied with it enough to fulfill this particular criteria.  0 out of 2 pts.     Author-Exhibits-Writerly-Traits-Which-Impress-Me: Oh yes, I am stunned by the amount of planning that was put into this book.  And I found the hunt for the title and subsequent dizzying tally of all the different meanings/usages of the word to be too much for me to keep up with.  So much so that I thought a) this would be a good topic for an academic paper; then immediately thought b) thank god I don't have to do that work!  Also there was some very enlightening historical analysis happening in there that I was totally benighted to before the reading of this book.  3*** out of 2 pts.     Pathos: Yeah, there is some there; not aton, but some.  See here is my problem with the antiheroic protagonist: I am just never going to love him/her.  If they struggle to love themselves then as a reader I have to too.  I liked the characters the best at the outset, and with each turning of the page loved them less.  Sparks is heartless, what can I say? 1 out of 2 pts.     Je Ne Sais Quoi: There was something that felt good about this book.  A little bit of swagger from the author perhaps.  At any rate, I felt like I was in good hands.  It is always a plus when the novel you read you suspect might raise your IQ rather than lower it, even if only marginally.  2 out of 2 pts.     7 out of 10 points.  So you see I do not love this book nearly as much as many other reviewers do, but I still back it as time well spent!  Like that cover too!    If you liked this review, find more like it at:[...]    ***Yeah, I know.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Let me just start by saying that although I consider myself a little monster but had this album sucked I would have been the first to say. It's amazing! Definitely a lot of upbeat techno-ish beats on this album but I'm not complaining. If you listen to the WORDS you'll understand why I really do love this album. Did I mention it was only $.99...yea that doesn't hurt either. Gaga and Amazon definitely made a great choice & in my opinion are trendsetting for future artist.
B000002MTU|5.0|For my money, one of the great white blues albums, along with the Beano album, the early Butterfields and Winter's 'Progressive Blues Experiment'    Sizzling but disciplined guitar and vocal-wise, Clapton is at his best, giving it real fire a la Howling Wolf.    Mind you, when you've got Stainton and Keltner behind you, you ought to do good.    Fabulous.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|So chill, so good.<br /><br />The music is subtle and yet powerful at the same time.  Justin Vernon's vocals are just fantastic.<br /><br />Sounds great on vinyl, and comes with a full sheet of the lyrics, with a wintery background picture, it also came with a link to a free mp3 download of the album, which is a nice plus if you don't have it digitally already.<br /><br />Great album, and I am so looking forward to their album coming out next month!
B002ZG976U|4.0|I've been looking forward to this movie for ages. To me - a short, uncoordinated, curvy girl - being a dancer sounds brilliant. Unfortunately, rather than take dance classes when I was young, I preferred to watch cartoons. So there must a part of me that still dreams she could be a dancer, so I get by watching these movies. Give me Showgirls, Coyote Ugly (although technically singing but never mind), Save The Last Dance, and Make It Happen and I'm a happy girl.<br /><br />Despite this being delayed for a little while on DVD, I finally got a copy to watch and LOVED it immediately. The movie starts off with a very YOUNG looking Christina (playing Ali) stuck in a dead end job in Nowhere-ville, dreaming of being a singer and a dancer. She ups sticks to LA and walks into a slightly camp looking bar called Burlesque and comes face to face with her dreams. And Cher. Cher manages to steal every single scene with her remarkable body for a woman in her sixties and stunning powerhouse vocals, which Christina, once she gets going, really can match.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty standard - I could have written it my sleep. There's nothing shocking, just very safe in terms of the storyline and characters. You've got the pretty girl who wants to make it big, the owner who's got a Heart of Stone until the right person gets close, the bad girl who will have you shouting insults at the screen, the token gay men and the token hot guy who sheds his clothes and wears eyeliner. (And has a very memorable scene with a box of cookies and not much else. That scene could keep a girl warm on a lonely night!) Oh and the bad guy who can't act, trying to steal the good girl away from the hot guy.<br /><br />The soundrack was amazing, and I was actually dancing in my chair a few times, and of course it will be a necessity to buy the soundtrack and play it at full volume and pretend I'm Christina Aguilera in front of a crowd of adoring people. The only thing that is missing from the soundtrack is a duet. What were they thinking??? How could they not combine Cher and Christina's talents by having them duet? Shockingly remiss of them.<br /><br />The last movie I saw Stanley Tucci in was The Lovely Bones - and from that movie to this, he plays completely different characters, to the point where my Dad doubted it was the same guy. He doesn't have that major a role in this film, apart from the funny gay guy who makes a brilliant comedy double act with Cher. (Did I mention she's looking AMAZING for a woman of her tender years?!)<br /><br />The only quibbles I have about this movie is Alan Cumming and the running time. Alan Cumming seems just a random character, thrown into the mix for no other reason than to interact with Ali when she comes into the club, and do a saucy little dance routine between dancers. It was such a throw away scene, that seemed to have been maybe added in with Alan larking around between takes. And his one \\"singing\\" scene is stuck in the extras. The running time is close to two hours, but could have easily been shorter and still not lost any of the storyline. And the extras could have been a bit more meaty too. Cut dance routines and a blooper reel? Give me something more exciting please!<br /><br />This movie is never going to win any awards - it's a feel good, enjoyable film with plenty of eye candy for the gentlemen and the ladies to both enjoy. So drag your partner by the hand to see this and get practising your dance moves. Or get the DVD and clear some space in the living room and shake what your mama gave you!ey thinking???

B004KD5TQI|5.0|When I saw Sucker  Punch in the theaters I immediately fell in love with the music in this movie.  That night I actually got home and ordered the soundtrack and for the next month listened to it pretty much exclusively.  All the songs are amazing and the fact that many are sung my Emily Browning herself only add to this soundtracks mesmerizing nature.  Highly recommended for anyone who loved the movie and who loved the music from it.

B001QWBM62|1.0|I have a synth in a church... I get to create in off hours.  The idea was to create a piano track and sing along with a separate vocal track on the Hn4.. Then down load to my computer for mixing with other voices...  I thought it would be as simple as using a computer sequencer.  It was not....    challenge:    I needed to run a pair of headphones through the H4N and sing along with the other track... This was not very inspiring...       I could not keep the volume from the synth at respectable levels in the HN4... It always ran way to hot for practical use...      The effects I wanted did not seem to be available for all modes... especially the modes I needed...    This unit worked fine as a stand alone for recording a live situation with one track....   I needed a multitrack....     I never did get this right...   I never was able to get it to work in a way that was musical for the purpose of composing music with the idea of laying down more then one track... I have not used the Hn4 for awhile. I gave up on it.....    I may go back to the Hn4 online community and try again,  to see if I can remedy this... However, I think I will buy another computer and use that in its place...      Not happy about this.....     I checked at tweakheads to see what he wrote about the Hn4.   He loved it...  and their are many many positive reviews...        It could be a temperament thing for me... Im more of an artist then I am a tekkie....     I don't know....     I simply needed 2 tracks to work with..  I needed to be able to record vocals while a piano track was playing at the same time...    I needed to down load these to a computer..    not happy about any of this...  I feel like I waisted my money on advertisement... .
0393327655|5.0|It is ironic that Sam Harris begins his book with a description of a young man bombing a bus in the heart of a city.  Though published in 2004, the description appears to fit very well the recent London transit bombings.  And this is precisely why this book demands our attention in this time of growing radical, religious fundamentalism of whatever variety.<br /><br />Sam Harris presents as a quiet, thoughtful, reflective person in television interviews and public presentations.  His background is in philosophy and he is now completing his doctorate in neuro-science.  He presents his analysis of religion in a deliberate, careful, rational manner.  Yet the result is powerful.<br /><br />The book his two major themes.  The first part is comprised of a critique of the irrational basis of religious faith and the often terrible consequences of these beliefs.<br /><br />This is not a tentative or hesitating criticism.  At a time when the negative effects of religion and religious thinking are becoming increasingly visible, this book serves notice that making accommodations to religious thinking serves only to allow it to perpetuate its destructive influence.  A belief that killing innocent people is responding to the will of one's God is not an idea to be given credence.  And yet it flows directly from religious ideology and scripture.<br /><br />After surveying the current effects of religious beliefs, Harris then explores the nature of belief and how it relates to reason by providing an excellent review of the criteria and process of determining truth--or what in philosophy is called epistemology.<br /><br />Building on this analysis, he then reviews the effect of irrational belief in the history of Christianity with the Inquisition, the Cathar persecution, the witch hunts and finally the Holocaust.  His point is that the moderation and toleration that is generally accepted today is not a result of the religious belief itself, but the modulating influence of the Enlightenment and the political separation of church and state that followed.  This is followed by a detailed chapter analyzing the rise of radical and violent Islam.  But lest we think we are immune from the effect of religious fundamentalism, he points out its current effect over issues such as the Ten Commandments controversy, the role of \\"faith-based\\" legislative efforts, the attempt to legislate what had previously been areas of private freedom, the movement to control embryonic stem cell research,  and, of course, the abortion debate.<br /><br />Harris is particularly critical of what he calls the \\"myth of moderation\\" which flows from the postmodern viewpoint that all ideas are relative and none can be held truer or better than others.<br /><br />Moderates do not want to kill anyone in the name of God, but they want us to keep using the word \\"God\\" as though we know what we were talking about.  And they do not want anything too critical said about people who really believe in the God of their fathers, because tolerance, perhaps above all else, is sacred.  To speak plainly and truthfully about the state of the world--to say, for instance, that the Bible and Koran both contain mountains of life-destroying gibberish--is antithetical to tolerance as moderates currently conceive it.  But we can no longer afford the luxury of such political correctness.  We must finally recognize the price we are paying to maintain the iconography of our ignorance.<br /><br />The second part of the book is what makes it so significant  This is not just another attack on the irrationality of religious faith.  Harris acknowledges the legitimacy of the issues that religion attempts to address.<br /><br />What makes one person happier than another?  Why is love more conducive to happiness than hate?  Why do we generally prefer beauty to ugliness and order to chaos?  Why does it feel so good to smile and laugh, and why do these shared experiences generally bring people closer together?  Is the ego and illusion, and, if so, what implications does this have for human life?  Is there life after death?  These are ultimately questions for a mature science of the mind.  If we ever develop such a science, most of our religious  texts will be no more useful to mystics than they are now to astronomers.<br /><br />First he addresses ethics.  What kind of ethics is possible without a faith in a supernatural God?  One based in reason and that incorporates our growing knowledge of ourselves at the level of the brain.  Where currently there is little consensus on moral issues, a sustained inquiry will force the convergence  of various belief systems as it has done in other sciences.  Moral relativism will no  longer make sense (\\"we can't really judge the suicide bomber\\") because we will have developed verifiable criteria for moral and ethical behavior.  Harris explores a number of contemporary issues from this perspective including terrorism, torture and pacifism.  Furthermore, ethics is intimately connected with spirituality.<br /><br />In the next chapter he reframes the entire arena of spirituality from the religious to the scientific in the newly emerging field of consciousness studies.  He is hesitant to use the words spirituality or mysticism because \\"neither word captures the reasonableness and profundity of the possibility that we must now consider: that there is a form of well-being that supersedes all others, indeed, that transcends the vagaries of experience itself\\".  Specifically he refers to those traditions that identify spirituality with consciousness itself--with  the observer of content rather than the content itself, which frees us from the vicissitudes of experience.<br /><br />Our spiritual traditions suggest that we have considerable room here to change our relationship to the contents of consciousness, and thereby to transform our experience of the world.  Indeed, a vast literature on human spirituality attests to this.  It is also clear that nothing need be believed on insufficient evidence for us to look in this possibility with an open mind.<br /><br />It is tempting to quote whole sections of this final chapter in which Harris rescues spirituality from religion.  He explores the nature of consciousness and the various efforts within traditional religions to change the nature of consciousness through sustained introspection and the refinement of attention.  He applies this to an analysis of the nature of the self--how it arises, what sustains it and how it can be transcended.  He compares Eastern to Western philosophy and religion and questions why the Eastern analysis appears to be so much more sophisticated.  And finally he describes meditation as a form of introspection in a section which can serve as a primer to meditative practice.  All of this is done from an empirical perspective informed by modern studies of consciousness rather than from religious doctrine.<br /><br />The only lack in this book is the omission of the psychodynamic explanation for faith as originally proposed by Freud and more recently in the book The Psychological Roots of Religious Belief by M.D. Faber.  Harris takes a more cultural and societal  perspective.<br /><br />Few books describe more clearly the transition to a post-religious era and establish  so clearly why it is of such importance.<br /><br />The days of our religious identities are clearly numbered.  Whether the days of our civilization itself are numbered would seem to depend, rather too much, on how soon we realize this.
B000W1V5OC|4.0|Nightwish give us once more an example of their great talent either in composing or generally creating songs that can really touch someone's feelings and move his fantasy.  It is a DVD that a fan of NIGHTWISH must have in his library.  On the contrary someone can easily notice the poor quality of the image of the DVD. To make matters worse it cannot be produced by Windows Media Player or Vlc. Only produced by nero show time or a home DVD player.  The sound is at least very good indeed.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|All of the albums I've bought over the past few years have left me disappointed to varying degrees, so BORN THIS WAY had a lot to make up for. Plus my yard stick for judging this is The Fame Monster, so in all honesty I had been preparing myself for disappointment.<br /><br />Lets begin by talking vocals; who knew she had that kind of vocal ability? I've seen her live supporting The Pussycat Dolls [in my defence I did only go to see Lady GaGa] and in her Monster Ball tour and whilst I thought she had a good pair of lungs on her, I didn't think that there was anything special about her.<br /><br />But seriously, the change of musical styles has shown that whilst she can't reach the higher octaves like Mariah Carey or Christina Aguilera, but she has otherwise as powerful lungs as them. She can hold and/or draw out her notes just as ably as either of them.<br /><br />Several album tracks do have a strong religious overtone, but I don't find them remotely preachy or blasphemous. She's voicing her personal opinions and musings, how can her personal thoughts be so easily judged right or wrong? Sorry to stand on a soapbox, but it annoys me when a few people go all judge and jury on others - are they really so perfect themselves?<br /><br />A quick roundup; we've got a progression in both lyrics and vocals, plus she's wrote every song and co-produced everything. Can't argue with credentials like that, plus I love the heavy slightly retro synths and general rockier sound.<br />But whilst I am loving BORN THIS WAY and think that is far superior to The Fame, I'm also aware that [in my view] every single track on The Fame Monster was single worthy, something that this hasn't quite achieved. There's nothing here that I'd dub as a filler, but if I heard that one track [Marry The Night] was receiving a single release I'd be \\"meh\\".<br /><br />But when that's the only criticism available, I know that I'm onto a winner.<br /><br />Oh - just wanted to add that I'm not sure how much you'll enjoy BORN THIS WAY if you love The Fame [the original one disc version] as this album is so different in sound and message. Personally I thought The Fame was good, but not anything particularly special and aside from it's singles, I rarely listen to it anymore. BORN THIS WAY is not really made for the more casual fan. It's not like The Fame where you can just listen and bop along to catchy tunes, it's an album where you have to pay attention to the lyrics and the messages within them.e Fame [the original one disc version] as this album is so different in sound and message.

From song 1 to 17 it feels like as if youre on a journey dancing your way to the finish line the album's title brings each song to the surface making the album much more meaningful and fun this is one of her best and its only the beginning for GaGa it makes me more excited to see what she has in store for the future

I gave Stargate Universe a few minutes when it first came out on BROADCAST. I have the entire SG1 and Atlantis series, but SHAKY-CAMERA SUX! Whoever got the idea that filming like someone with a nervous condition is good cinematography should be flogged with a roll of film! Some critics of my review feel I shouldn't say anything at all, as I haven't bought the series. I disagree, as my opinion of the camerawork AS BROADCAST precluded me ever considering buying the series, as I did SG1 and Atlantis. IF I HAD BOUGHT IT WITHOUT EVER SEEING A REVIEW OF THE POOR SHAKY-CAMERA CINEMATOGRAPHY, AMAZON WOULD BE MAD AT ME FOR SENDING IT BACK!

He does this by examining the paths of the foods<br /><br />\\"Omnivore's Dilemma,\\" was published in 2006.  The author tries to inform about the \\"evils\\" of the American food industry that exploits the cycle of American foods.  I would give this book a 5 star because it helped me become more knowledgeable and conscious of the foods I eat.  It surprised me because of the dangers of eating foods from the agribusiness.<br /><br />In this book, Michael Pollan describes the tainted American food industry.  He explores how the American food is created starting from the seed, to the tables of American homes.  He especially emphasizes the use of corn in food processing and the problems it is creating for the farmers and the consumers.  He also describes the process that helped corn achieve its dominance in the food industry, from the use of nitrates, to governmental laws that make corn the most influential food in the American diet.  He also describes the dangers in the meat industry as well by watching the process of an industrially-raised cow develop into eatable food, such as steak.  It is very disturbing to see the process many animals go through in order to be slaughtered.<br /><br />This book is recommended for people who wish to know what they are eating, where it came from, and why it matters.  People should read this book in order to improve their diets and become more informed of how their food decisions impact the world.  He influences the readers by using statistics to change the viewpoints of the reader.  For example, the author states, \\"the FDA allows processors to use [TBHQ] sparingly in our food\\"(113).  This shows the dangers of the American fast food because a gram can cause nausea, vomiting, ringing in the  ears, delirium, a sense of suffocation, and collapse.<br />Reviews showed that many Americans were shocked at the foods they were eating and were compelled to change their eating habits by reading this book, and I agree.

B004K4AVAG|4.0|I too thought this cd would be a flop, something not worth buying and pretty much discography filler. Given the huge 0.99 cent release for the digital album, I was pleasantly surprised! Many songs contain the hearty, original sound of Gaga but it is simply evolved. I was worried after hearing the two primary singles -- Born this Way and Judas (Born this way is cute or whatever, but its definitely not a song you can listen to over and over again. Judas is the same way, but I found the chorus to be annoying. Thankfully, Judas has definitely grown on me since then.)    Hair, Americano, ScheiBe, Bloody Mary, Marry the Night, Edge of Glory, Bad Kids and Heavy Metal Lover are an ode to the old Gaga, and are lyrical gold. Marry the Night has a tasteful sound that exudes an 80s female power ballad, something akin to Houston's I wanna dance with somebody, but far more tasteful in a contemporary setting. My favorite songs off of this CD would definitely be Bloody Mary, ScheiBe and Heavy Metal Lover -- all exude old gaga, and are incredibly amazing. Bloody Mary especially, despite its religious undertones, has the sickest beat, includes some Gregorian Chant (chanting her name, Gaga) -- which is completely epic! Not to mention the extremely catchy chorus, and syllable schlepped at the end. I've found myself singing this song only after I had heard it twice. ScheiBe is amazing as well, and as a lover of foreign music, I've sang the german part over and over.     Definitely worth the 7 bucks; don't listen to the naysayers, as I was a naysayer before this CD came out -- and I've found too many things to like than to not like the whole CD at all. And I consider myself liberal when it comes to music, love all beats and flavors. A good beat accompanied by meaningful lyrics, executed beautifully in song is something that cannot be denied in retrospect to Gaga.     Besides, at least she didn't sing the same line over and over again like Who Runs the World!?!?! (Girls!!!) for the first2 1/2 minutes of a song.
0062060554|4.0|Few debut novels can  provide both good reading AND good writing.  Yet S.J. Watson accomplishes just that with his psychological thriller Before I Go To Sleep.  Although I can give it only 4 stars, I strongly recommend this book.<br /><br />GOOD READING:<br /><br />The main thrust was really intriguing for me and had me asking questions before I even read the first page.  How can Christine - a woman with severe memory damage (her amnesia recurs every morning when she wakes up) - stay safe in her world, let alone thrive and live anything akin to a normal life?  How does she address marriage, friendship, her home, even her own reflection in the mirror when she cannot recognize the husband she finds herself sleeping next to?  How can she gain enough traction each day to move forward with her life without being completely debilitated by her condition?<br /><br />Finally, how does an author add the element of mystery to such a scenario?  I found Watson's answers to all this to be very believable and keenly entertaining.<br /><br />GOOD WRITING:<br /><br />Watson's style is easy to read, straightforward, and his writing deftly overcomes three key challenges created by his potentially restrictive plot construction:<br /><br />1)  The repetition inherent in a tale of amnesia:  Watson manages to make each day seem different enough to keep the reader turning the pages.  He spares us having to endure too much rehashing of Christine's daily reawakening and re-remembering.  I was amazed at how much new information Watson was able to parse into each of Christine's days.<br /><br />2) The linearity of a diary approach:  Using flashbacks, new observations, and the occasional nuggets of curiously inconsistent details, Watson is able to give the story full depth and intrigue.  Instantly, I became captivated with each page and each day, as subtle changes cause Christine to doubt the trustworthiness of everyone around her.  In fact, there are points at which the reader is drawn into this web by questioning even Christine's own memories, motives, and integrity. Remarkably, Watson stays quite tightly to a sequential chronology.<br /><br />3) The singular nature of a purely first-person narrative:  Cleverly, Watson keeps us in Christine's head without allowing us to get bored.  We get a strong sense of the world around her, and what could have been a very narrow perspective is widened to engaging effect.<br /><br />MINOR DISAPPOINTMENTS:<br /><br />My own negatives with this book are few, but worth mentioning as they are the reasons I could not give  5 stars:<br /><br />1) The ultimate conceit of the novel will be easy to unveil by many readers who have seen enough movies.  To his credit, Watson manages to build sufficient dread to carry any correct-guessers through to the final pages.  (Even though I was pretty sure I knew what was happening, I was compelled to keep reading.)<br /><br />2) The ending to the ending is a bit hurried and lackluster.<br /><br />3) The F-bombs.  Although there are not a lot of them, I found them jarring, completely unnecessary, and artificially added as if for special effect.  I personally and generally do not mind such language, but in this case it pops up abruptly and pointlessly, and not at all in keeping with the characters.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This is a skillfully architected read and not as deeply convoluted as other memory genre works which come to my mind, such as the movies The Jacket, The Butterfly Effect, or (my favorite) Alejandro Amenabar's Open Your Eyes.  In fact, it struck me as a more harrowing psycho-dramatic version of the comedy 50 First Dates,  where Drew Barrymore's character has to watch a video tape every day to remind her about her current life.  But in the case of Before I Go To Sleep, that \\"video\\" is corruptible and might not exist for her own best interests.<br /><br />Watson is most definitely on my watch list.emories, motives, and integrity.

Well, we learn that she like to drink tea, she waits for her lover and she has no decent clothes. Oh yea, she is the most powerful witch of her generation, but she doesnt use her powers, or does she? She is so oblivious that it takes her forever to realize that she uses her powers daily. And this girl is supposed to be a tenured professor? She studies alchemy but she can't seem to learn any spells that her aunt tries to teach her, really? And the Hero, well, he may be handsome, but he's is not a very interesting or sympathetic vampire. I just found him anoying. This is supposed to be the first book of a trilogy, well I will not be finishing the series. I don't care what happens to these people. Don't waste your money, but if you are determined to read it, go to the library. That way you can read it and not waste your money like I did.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|This album is just SO good. Amazing. Worth the wait. Robin Pecknold and crew have created another fantastic listening experience with metaphorical lyrics, gorgeous harmonies, and beautiful instrumentation. But it's not simply business as usual, as some reviews seem to say. The album has a more mature sound, with new instruments and more experimental sections, like in The Shrine/An Argument. One song, The Cascades, doesn't have any words at all, but it doesn't need any. Montezuma, Bedouin Dress, Battery Kinzie, Lorelai, and Grown Ocean are some other songs worth mentioning. Really, they're all worth mentioning, and together, they make for one - dare I say it - EPIC record.

Wow what a great movie!  The start is grainy and a throw back to the the 70's with the lighting and music, slowly the movie comes into focus.  The movie plays with music in a very clever way love / sexual tension scenes always have the boom chika boom boom beats in the background.  There were so many famous actors in this move that I lost count I really anticpated this to be a B list but in reality it was clearly A+ casting with lots of big names.  The special effects were cheesy but really added to the movie.  This is the best done movie since Pulp Fiction and just as out of the box.<br /><br />I have not clapped at a movie on DVD in years but Machete got a standing ovation with my friends!

B004K4AUZW|3.0|Let me start by saying, that i fully intended this to be a negative review of this CD. But it turns out after finally getting the whole thing, I just cant call the Cd \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", or I can call it both at the same time. I love it or hate it depending on what part is playing. I believe the bad is due to Gaga just trying too hard. A lot of the songs are downgraded due to things put in that just did'nt need to be there. My 12th grade English teacher once told me \\"It's what you leave out of a story that makes is great\\". I think Gaga needs to apply that to her music this time around. The amazing thing about this CD is every single low rated song had the potential to be a an epic 5/5.    Marry the Night 2.5/5 Starts out good but then goes off in the wrong direction, like many of the songs on this CD.    Born This Way 5/5 Not sure how anybody dislikes this song about freedom and being yourself. Its not inherently a \\"Gay Anthem\\" and I'm not sure why people view it as such.    Government Hooker 5/5 Love it. Dirty. Raunchy. Just the way i like it. Cant wait to get the UNCENSORED VERSION.    Judas 5/5 Love it when she mixes religious symbolism in her songs. I know a lot of people don't, but I do. The bridge is awesome. Awesome music video.    Looks good so far. But here is where things take a turn for the worst, to make an understatement.    Americano: 1/5 I am going to pretend this song does not exist. Over the top is an understatement, Gaga trying to hard. The last 30 seconds is good though. Anything before that is horrible.    Hair 0/5 Corny lyrics. I am as free as my hair? I am my hair? Really gaga? Really? I understand the sentimental value this song has for Gaga but i found it uninspiring. Sorry.    Sheibfie 2/5 Starts out EPIC, and then the chorus comes to let you down. Yet another song with good parts and horrible parts. Better than Hair and Americano though. Remixes will be better than the album version. Basically.. what they take out.    Bloody Mary 5/5 Best songof the CD. Love the religious symbolism once again. Love the synthesized sound effects and the beat. Deep spiritual lyrics. Ironically, based on what I read, this song was a spur of the moment fluke.    Bad Kids: 2.5/5 The yelling at the beginning was unnecessary. Lyrics sound like it was written for a rebellious 12 year old. Musically it sounds ok.    Highway Unicorn: 2/5 Just plain bad. Song is a chaotic mess. Some of the mess does sound good though if you can bear getting through it.    Heavy Metal Lover: 4/5 A good upbeat yet mellow song. Good for cruising. Smooth structure and lyrics.    Electric Chapel: 3/5 At risk of repeating myself (again), Good and bad at the same time. Driving me insane at this point.    You and I: 5/5 I honestly did not think I would like this song but the direction taken was surprising. It is not her singing it on the piano which is what I expected. The song needed reinvented due to it being sang on tour for so long and it was successfully done.    Edge of Glory. 2/5 I would have liked it better with less singing and more techno sounds or being a pure techno song. How did we get from house music to a saxophone? Meh. The pure techno remixes are far superior. Overkill with the strings at the end.    Overall i think the CD is worth buying. But i certainly suggest sampling it before you hear it. Its most certainly different.  Reviews are going to be very polarizing even for Gaga fans like myself.
